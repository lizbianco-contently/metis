Dr. Ogilvie has been a wonderful \nfriend and counselor to me in the short time I have been here, and we \nare also very pleased to see he is doing well.\n  Dr. Elliott, the guest Chaplain today, is the minister of my home \nchurch, the church of which I am a member in Raleigh, NC. Edenton \nStreet United Methodist Church is a church of which we are very proud--\nabout 3,000 strong, I think, the last time I saw. He is here this \nmorning with his lovely wife Jackie. We are very proud to have both of \nthem with us.\n  The church itself, as I say, is a church of which we are extremely \nproud. It is a church that is involved in every aspect of ministering \nto the community in Raleigh and outside of Raleigh. Dr. Elliott has \nprovided extraordinary leadership for this church. He has been a \nwonderful friend and counselor to myself and my family.\n  Dr. Elliott, I believe, received his doctorate degree from Duke \nUniversity and did some postdoctoral study at Drew University. More \nimportant than that, though, is that he baptized both of my daughters, \nEmma Claire and Kate, of whom we are, of course, very proud. But most \nimportantly, Dr. Elliott is a true messenger for God. He speaks the \nword of God rightly, and he inspires all of us; when he preaches on \nSunday morning, we all come out knowing that God was present in our \nservice. That is the most important thing I can say about Dr. Elliott. \nThere is no finer Methodist anywhere, no finer minister anywhere, and I \nam very proud and honored to have him with us this morning to give the \nopening prayer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S563-6", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 1287 which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1287) to provide for the storage of spent \n     nuclear fuel pending completion of a nuclear waste \n     repository, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Lott (for Murkowski) amendment No. 2808, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 11 a.m. shall be controlled by \nthe Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, and the Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Bingaman, or their designees.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we are now in the final hour of \ndiscussion about this nuclear waste-related bill. I thought, since I do \nnot see Senator Murkowski, the chairman of our committee, I would go \nahead and make my statement indicating my position. I did speak \nyesterday on the Senate floor on this issue and laid out the reasons I \nwill be voting against S. 1287 this morning. I encourage my colleagues \nto join me in voting against the bill. I do so for the simple reason \nthat the bill as presently before us does not solve the problems of the \nnuclear waste program. In fact, it magnifies those problems.\n  Let me go through some of the specifics.\n  First, the bill does not reduce the liability that is borne by \ntaxpayers for the program's failure. Instead of reducing that \nliability, this bill would increase that liability. The part of the \nbill that purports to offer the Department of Energy authority to \nsettle lawsuits filed against it is arguably worse for the U.S. \ntaxpayer than is current law. Other parts of the bill set new and \narbitrary deadlines for the Department of Energy to ship nuclear waste \nto Nevada. We know today that the Department of Energy cannot meet \nthose deadlines, and a vote for this bill is a vote for a new wave of \nlitigation. We are already enmeshed in a great deal of litigation. A \nvote for this bill will bring us even more litigation.\n  Second, this bill does not speed up the decision of the Department of \nEnergy on whether Yucca Mountain is suitable for a repository. In fact, \nthe effect of the bill is to slow down that decision. By delaying the \nissuance of a radiation standard for Yucca Mountain by EPA, the bill \nwould delay the process of finalizing whether Yucca Mountain will be a \nrepository site.\n  The third point I want to make is that this bill does not make new \nfunds available to the nuclear waste program so we can do an effective \njob of investigating Yucca Mountain and building a repository. Instead \nof making those funds available, which we should be doing, to the \ncontrary, this bill caps the amount of funds the Department of Energy \ncan collect and shifts the burden of paying for nuclear waste disposal \nfrom the beneficiaries of that nuclear power--that is, the people who \nreceived electricity from it--to everyone else in the country.\n  The fourth point I want to make is that the bill does not facilitate \nthe movement of nuclear waste out of our individual States. In fact, \nthis bill, as I read it, would impede the transportation of waste out \nof those States. Even if we managed to build a repository, if you are \nfrom a State that has nuclear waste, the bill contains an impossible \nhurdle to moving that waste out of your State. Read page 17 of the \nbill. You will find that no shipments of nuclear waste can occur \nanywhere until the Secretary of Energy has determined that emergency \nresponders in every locality and every tribal entity along primary or \nalternative shipping routes for nuclear waste have met acceptable \nstandards of training.\n  Right in that single provision are the seeds of two huge lawsuits \nthat will keep nuclear waste in your State forever: A lawsuit over what \nconstitutes acceptable training and a lawsuit over the reasonableness \nof the required determination by the Secretary of Energy that every \nvolunteer fire or ambulance company in every locality that might see \nnuclear waste at some point is adequately trained.\n  Also, the requirements are vastly more restrictive on the Department \nof Energy than anything we have ever considered in the Waste Isolation \nPilot Plant case.\n  In my view, such a certification by a Cabinet officer is a practical \nimpossibility, not to mention an unprecedented intrusion by the Federal \nGovernment into local government responsibilities.\n  The fifth point is that this bill does not fix the problem of the one \nutility that is actually threatened by a shutdown of one of its plants \nbecause of the failings of the Department of Energy's nuclear waste \nprogram. I am speaking about the Northern States Power plant at Prairie \nIsland. Nothing in this bill forestalls the shutdown of that plant \nwhich is expected in January of 2007.\n  One of the most disappointing developments of the past few days has \nbeen the stripping from the bill of the major provision that did make \nthis bill worth passing, in my view, even though some of the flaws I \nhave described are still in the bill.\n  The provision that was stripped was a provision giving the Department \nof Energy new authority and capability to resolve lawsuits that have \nbeen filed against it. We have been told this is what a group of seven \nGovernors are insisting. They wanted us to drop this provision.\n  I studied a copy of their purported letter on this subject, and I \nfind it a very strange document. The copy I have been given is not \ndated, it carries no signatures, and it is not on any official \nletterhead. In fact, it carries a heading that suggests it is a draft \ndocument. The letter is not about this bill. It is about testimony \nSecretary of Energy Bill Richardson gave about a year ago.\n  Some of the reasons given in the draft letter for opposing take title \ndo not apply to this legislation. One argument in the letter complains \nthat nuclear waste might be stored on riverfronts or lakes or seashores \nwhere, of course, the reality is one finds nuclear waste stored today \nin powerplants.\n  Specifically, an alternative to take title recommended in the letter \nis not contained in the bill on which we are about to vote, so the \nclaim that by gutting this bill of its key provision --that is, its \ntake title provision--we have satisfied seven Governors is certainly \nnot supported by anything I have found in the document.\n  The other curious thing about what we have done to the bill during \nthe course of our deliberations this week when we removed this take \ntitle provision is that we have converted its statutory instructions to \nthe Department of Energy for settling industry lawsuits into something \nwe know the States themselves publicly oppose. Without take title, all \nthe Department of Energy can do is use money from the nuclear waste \nfund to give monetary and in-kind compensation to the utilities. That \nis what section 105 of the bill now authorizes.\n  Listen to what 51 State agencies from 35 different States told a \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals in January 1998 about \nthis concept. This is a quote from their pleadings in that case:\n\n       The Court should act decisively to bar DOE from using the \n     NWF [Nuclear Waste Fund] and ongoing fee payments to pay the \n     costs and damages resulting from its deliberate \n     noncompliance. Even the potential for DOE to consider such a \n     course should be immediately invalidated. . . .\n\n  That is what the States said in 1998, and in this legislation we \ninstruct the Secretary of Energy to do exactly what 35 States pleaded \nwith the court not to allow the Department of Energy to do.\n\n  The No. 1 remedy sought by the 35 States in this lawsuit, several \npages after this statement, was a court order forbidding the Department \nof Energy from doing what section 105 of this bill now tells the \nDepartment of Energy to do. I am not making this statement based on \nsome unsigned, undated document. We have a copy of the signed petition \nto the court here. I am glad to share that with any colleague who wants \nto review it between now and the time of our final vote.\n  On that document, many of us will see the signature of our Attorney \nGeneral, our respective attorneys general from the States, or our \nrepresentatives from the public utility commissions in our States.\n  The bottom line is this bill is not going to fix what is wrong with \nthe Department of Energy's nuclear waste\n\n[[Page S565]]\n\nprogram. On the contrary, it will move us further from a final solution \nwe need to achieve. We should not pass the legislation. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in voting against it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of our \ntime.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield 5 minutes from our time to the Senator from \nMaine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his \ngraciousness.\n  I rise in support of the provisions of the manager's amendment that \nstrikes the take title language from the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \namendments. I express my great appreciation to the committee chairman, \nSenator Murkowski, for his willingness to work with us to address the \nconcerns of a number of States, including my home State of Maine, about \nthe take title provisions.\n  Our States feared that the take title provisions would grant the \nDepartment of Energy a license to permanently store nuclear waste where \nit now sits--on the very vulnerable riverfronts, seashores, and lake \nborders of many States.\n  The take title provision was a fatal flaw in this otherwise necessary \nand sound legislation. This provision was based upon an ill-advised \neffort by the Department of Energy to shirk its responsibilities to \nstore nuclear waste.\n  The take title provision would have allowed the Department of Energy \nto take ownership of the nuclear waste at each individual nuclear plant \nacross the Nation. At first blush, that sounds very reasonable, but we \nhave to look at the record.\n  Given the Department of Energy's dismal record of missed deadlines \nand its utter failure to deal with the nuclear waste issue, new waste \nstorage facilities created under the take title provision would run the \nvery real risk of becoming de facto permanent waste sites.\n  Moreover, this administration has simply done a miserable job of \nallaying the fears of the Governor of my State and the people of many \nother States who all fear the take title provision is a ruse to create \npermanent repositories at each site.\n  Residents of my State of Maine have been paying into the nuclear \nwaste fund for years with assurances that the radioactive waste from \nthe State of Maine and from Maine Yankee, in particular, would be moved \nto a permanent repository, not left in Wiscasset, ME, where the plant \nonce operated. Since 1982, the ratepayers of Maine have paid nearly \n$150 million into the fund. Yet we have seen no progress, no results.\n  What to do with our Nation's nuclear waste is, indeed, a difficult \nquestion, but creating semipermanent storage at over 100 facilities \nacross the Nation is clearly not the answer.\n  Similarly, allowing the Department of Energy to continue to dodge its \nresponsibilities is not the answer. The answer is a safe, consolidated \nfacility. The answer is for the Department of Energy to fulfill its \nobligations. The answer is for the Department of Energy to take \npossession of the waste, not just in Maine but by physically removing \nit from these sites across our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the manager's amendment. I believe it \nwill solve the problems with the take title provision and thus improve \nthis important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank the Senator from Wyoming \nfor yielding.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will be brief.\n  I come to the floor for just a couple of moments to express my \nsincere regret that we have not been able to come together to resolve \nthe outstanding differences that are represented today in the debate \nand will be represented in the final outcome of the vote.\n  I give great credit to the distinguished ranking member of the \ncommittee, Senator Bingaman, and to our colleagues, both from Alaska \nand Nevada, for the effort that has been made to try to reach some \naccommodation.\n  Unfortunately, in part because of a lack of willingness on the part \nof some of our Republican colleagues to come to the middle, we have \nlost a golden opportunity to finally resolve this matter once and for \nall.\n  The administration has indicated it will veto this bill in its \ncurrent form. The EPA, the Secretary of Energy, and others, have \nexpressed vehement opposition. Environmental groups, both liberal and \nconservative, the energy utility companies, oftentimes in favor of this \nlegislation, in many cases today have come out in opposition to this \nbill, in part because of the failure to reach some compromise, and in \npart because this situation now makes their lives even more complicated \nand more difficult than it was before. Furthermore, there is deep \nconcern that this bill undermines EPA's ability to protect the American \npublic by delaying its authority to issue a radiation safety standard \nuntil 2001.\n  Instead of streamlining the process of moving nuclear waste to \nNevada, this bill has complicated it even more. And, it fails to \nrelieve American taxpayers of the extraordinary liability they face due \nto the failure to establish a long-term storage site. As a result, we \nhave no choice but to continue to oppose the legislation in its current \nform.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in opposition to this bill. Maybe \nin conference we can work it out. If we can, maybe we can come to the \nfloor at another date, with another opportunity to see if we cannot \nsuccessfully resolve these outstanding problems. But today that has not \nhappened.\n  Today, Senator Bingaman and others have expressed their regret and \ntheir opposition. We simply cannot allow a bad bill to pass and be \nsigned into law. This is the one opportunity we will have to do it \nright. We have to do it right before it is signed into law. The \nPresident has insisted on that. I think it is incumbent on us to insist \non that. I think the American people expect no less.\n  Mr. President, in just a short while we will have the opportunity to \nvote. It is my sincere hope that a large number of colleagues, on both \nsides of the aisle, will join us in saying: No. We have not done the \njob yet. Until we do it right, our vote will remain no.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield myself such time as I may utilize.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill. The time has come for \nthe Congress and the Federal Government to step up to do something. \nThis is not a new issue. It has been going on for a very long time. As \na matter of fact, the basic legislation--the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nof 1982--required the Federal Government to build a storage facility \nfor spent fuel, to accept nuclear waste by 1998, to develop a \ntransportation system, and that the cost would be paid for by the \nelectric utility customers. The Department of Energy has not done this. \nThe administration has not lived up to its part of it. They have been \nrequired to have a plan, but they have done very little.\n  The Federal Government has accepted the more than $16 billion \ncollected from utility customers to do this. It has not shown results. \nThe customers, of course, have been hit more than once in terms of \npaying the higher rates.\n  The time has sort of expired to continue to debate this issue, to \ncontinue to have opposition, which does not surprise me because there \nhas not been many positive options coming from the other side of the \naisle. All we have is resistance. All we have is: No, we are not going \nto do that.\n  This year I had the chance to go down to the nuclear storage site in \nNew Mexico. We have spent billions of dollars there. We have moved only \na very small amount into that storage spot. Idaho has not been able to \nuse that at all.\n  Currently over 40,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel is being \nstored at 74 sites in 36 States. An additional 35,000 metric tons from \nweapons production and naval facilities increases the number of sites.\n  I understand this legislation isn't what everybody would like to \nhave, but the fact is that we need to do something. Passing this bill \nwill start us moving in that direction. That is what we ought to do.\n  The legislation drops interim storage, requires the Congress to \napprove\n\n[[Page S566]]\n\nincreases in fees collected, sets a schedule for the development of a \nrepository, authorizes backup storage for any spent fuels, and allows \nEPA to set radiation standards after June 1, 2001. It does a number of \nthings on which we need to move further. It authorizes the settlement \nfor outstanding litigation and sets an acceptance schedule for spent \nfuel. I know it is a difficult issue.\n  I commend Chairman Murkowski and Senator Craig for all of their hard \nwork. The Energy Committee, which has approached this several times, \nhas done a number of things. Frankly, the time for delay is over.\n  We are experiencing some of the same kind of resistance to doing \nsomething now in the INEEL situation in Idaho where we are looking very \nhard at some alternative to incineration.\n  I have heard from the Vice President. He said he would look into it. \nI have heard from Mr. Frampton from the White House who said he would \nlook into it. I have heard from the Secretary of Energy who promised to \nlook into it, but nothing has happened.\n  There is a limit to the amount of time we can continue to stall in \nmaking some decisions with regard to this nuclear issue.\n\n  I urge support for this bill. I hope we can move forward with it \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wish the Chair a good morning.\n  I ask, how much time is remaining for the majority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 18\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. And for the minority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I note a Dear Colleague letter is \ncirculating this morning from one of our colleagues from Montana and \none of our colleagues from California. It concerns the critical \nenvironmental vote that will occur at 11 o'clock on the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act amendments.\n  It identifies that the protection of the health and safety of \nAmerican citizens should be our highest priority. I agree with that. It \nfurther states that in order to do this, all decisions must be made \nbased on science, not politics. It suggests this legislation does not \ndo that.\n  I implore my colleagues, what we are attempting to do is use the best \nscience available. That is why we brought the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission and the National Science Academy into the recommending \nprocess for EPA. But I point out for the benefit of anyone who still \nhas a doubt that the Environmental Protection Agency has the final \nauthority on determining the radiation standards. But the effort is to \nget the best science.\n  Let's be honest with one another. Every time this legislation comes \nup, it comes down to one thing: Nobody wants the waste.\n  I have said time and again, if you throw it up in the air, it has to \ncome down somewhere and that somewhere is Nevada. That decision was \nmade some time ago. We have expended $6 billion in the Yucca Mountain \neffort.\n  The criticism of this legislation to which this Dear Colleague letter \npoints is it doesn't address an alternative. It is innuendo to say the \nlegislation ``unnecessarily slows EPA's ability.'' It can't do anything \nuntil it is licensed. The ``legislation conveys undisclosed acreage of \nFederal land to Nye and Lincoln Counties in Nevada without providing \nany maps of the areas or conducting any hearings.'' That is simply not \ntrue.\n  We are trying to accommodate the two affected counties in Nevada by \ngiving them BLM-accessed land. What in the world is wrong with that? Is \nthat contrary to the public health and safety? To me it is good for the \npeople of Nevada. I am sure if you asked the two Senators from Nevada \nwhether their constituents should receive this land, they would have a \npretty positive opinion.\n  What we have here are more smokescreens. We have a statement by the \nminority ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks saying they have the sole discretion over nonmilitary \nenvironmental regulations and control of atomic energy. Well, as \nchairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we have the \nobligation to address the disposal of the nuclear waste. We have \nattempted to do that in a responsible manner.\n  Yes, this is politics. This is hard core politics. It is trying to \naccommodate my good friends from Nevada over their objection to put the \nwaste in their State. The Clinton administration, the administration of \nVice President Gore, simply doesn't want to address it on their watch. \nThat is all there is to it.\n  Each Member who votes against this legislation better be prepared to \ngo home and explain why they voted to keep the waste in their \nindividual State, when we had a chance to move it out to one central \nlocation at Yucca Mountain. There it is, 80 sites in 40 States. We have \na chance to move it to one location.\n  The Northeast corridor State Governors said: We don't trust the \nFederal Government; they didn't take the waste in 1998 when it was \ncontractually due; the ratepayers paid $15 billion; they broke the \nsanctity of a contractual relationship. What the Governors are saying \nis they don't want the waste stored in their State by the Federal \nGovernment taking title because they are convinced the Federal \nGovernment will leave it there. Well, they very well could be right.\n  As a consequence, we have this waste stored in these States on the \nway to the schoolgrounds, the playgrounds, the hospitals, homes. We \nhave it on the shores of the Great Lakes--Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, \nLake Erie, Lake Superior, Lake Ontario--the great rivers--the \nMississippi, the Colorado, the Columbia--the Nation's seashores. We \nmust resolve to put it at a permanent site. That is all there is to it.\n  We have a good bill. This is a responsible environmental vote. The \nenvironmental community has said, we are opposed to this legislation. \nWhat are they for? Are they for leaving the waste where it is? Well, \nthey wouldn't respond to that question.\n  Each Member of this body is elected to make a responsible decision \nand not be led by groups motivated by their own particular ideology. \nMake no mistake about it: A large segment of America's environmental \ncommunity wants to kill the nuclear power industry. They want to kill \nthe nuclear industry because they are opposed to it. But they don't \nlook at the contribution that industry makes to clean air, and they do \nnot address the responsibility of what the alternative is.\n\n  So a responsible environmental vote is to move this from these 40 \nStates and 80 sites to one central location that is designed for it. \nMake no mistake about it: These temporary locations are not designed \nfor it.\n  There is criticism that this is some kind of a full blown attack by \nthe nuclear power industry. What they are seeking is relief. They are \nseeking relief from the waste that has been generated over an extended \nperiod of time and the inability of the Federal Government to meet its \ncontractual commitments. That should make every Member of this body \nindignant. But that is what happened. Do you know who is taking it in \nthe shorts? The American taxpayer, because the claims against the \nFederal Government for not taking that waste under the contract are \nsomewhere between $40 and $80 billion. That is about $1,400 per family \nevery year in this country. Nobody seems to care about it. I care about \nit. I am sure you do, Mr. President.\n  We have a good bill. It uses the WIPP transportation model. It is \nsafe transport. The States decide the routes. Some of my colleagues are \nfearful it is going to be moved by rail. It is not going to be moved by \nrail. It is very doubtful. Rails don't go direct. A rail goes from one \nrailyard to the next railyard. Oftentimes those railyards are around \nareas of high concentration of population. That doesn't make sense. The \nGovernors are going to have control of where these routes are \ndetermined. They are going to be safe routes because we are going to \nhave professionals out there determining the safeguards, the drivers, \nand so forth. In fact, we submitted a letter yesterday from the \nnational Teamsters Union. They are concerned because they want trained \npeople. Their trained people will be involved.\n\n[[Page S567]]\n\n  Finally, EPA has the sole authority to set the radiation standard. \nDon't let anybody tell you differently. I love my friends from Nevada. \nI really do. I have a great deal of respect for them. I know where they \nare coming from. Do you know what they said in the hearing? They said, \nregardless of what the safeguards are, what assurances we have, we are \nnot going to support a bill that would put the waste in Nevada. I \nunderstand that. So it means it doesn't make any difference what we do, \nwhat the minority does, what the Senator from California and the \nSenator from Montana do. We will never be able to convince them. I \nunderstand that. So let's recognize that for what it is.\n  The Secretary may settle lawsuits and save the taxpayers this $80 \nbillion liability. This legislation allows early receipt of fuel, once \nconstruction is authorized, as early as 2006. The nuclear waste fee can \nonly be increased by Congress. It prevents unreasonable increases in \nthe fees. We provide benefits to counties most affected by repository \nland conveyance of the 76,000 acres to Nye and Lincoln Counties. This \nis the land that Nevada wanted. Well, I wonder how bad they want it \nnow.\n  We struggled with this problem for many years. The time is right. S. \n1287 is the solution. Utility consumers have paid over $15 billion into \nthat waste fund. We cannot jeopardize the health and safety of citizens \nacross the country by leaving that spent nuclear fuel in 80 sites in 40 \nStates. That is irresponsible. We should move it once and for all where \nit belongs: at a remote site on the desert.\n  I will show my colleagues that picture one more time, where we have \nhad 800 nuclear tests over a period of 50 years. That is the site. We \nrisk, if we can't get this legislation through, losing 20 percent of \nour clean generation. Where are we going to make it up? We can't \njeopardize our economic and environmental future by ignoring the \nnuclear waste management issues. That is what we are going to do if \nthis legislation is not supported. We risk losing 103 nuclear \npowerplants.\n  I urge Members to vote for S. 1287 and finally put this problem \nbehind us. And one more time, Mr. President--remember, each Member who \nvotes against this bill is going to be obliged to explain why they \nvoted to keep the waste in one of the 40 States that they come from \nwhen they had a chance to move it to one central location, Yucca \nMountain.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I will be very brief.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield 1 minute to my friend from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the changes made \nin the take title provisions. I have discussed it with my Governor, and \nnow I can say that we no longer have an objection to the bill. The \nGovernor hopes it passes with the changes that were made. So I wanted \nto let everybody know that I am in favor of the bill, and I appreciate \nthe changes that were made.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield 3 minutes to Senator Bryan, the Senator from \nNevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  I hardly know where to begin because so much misinformation has been \nuttered about this piece of legislation. This is clearly a legislative \nvessel that is flying under false colors. There is absolutely nothing \nin this bill that says, look, it is going to be Yucca Mountain as \nopposed to anything else. That decision, in terms of studying it, has \nalready been made. I regret that, but it doesn't alter the fact that \nonly Yucca Mountain is being considered and that process goes forward. \nThe bill has nothing to do with whether or not Yucca Mountain is going \nto be the site that is going to be considered and studied over the next \nfew years, absolutely nothing. So vote against this bill.\n  With respect to the compensation issue, we have agreed for more than \na decade, and this Senator has personally offered legislation to \ncompensate the utilities. That is not an issue. We agree. This bill \nwould pass by unanimous consent if that was the only provision that was \nin there. This Senator would be among the first to say that is fair.\n  What this is all about is trying to game the standards. That is what \nwe are talking about. By and large, in its original form, this bill \nstripped out EPA. Now, games are still being played. Somehow it is \nsuggested that EPA is being unreasonable. EPA has set a standard of 15 \nmillirems, the same one set at WIPP, the transuranic for nuclear waste. \nIn 1982, when the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was enacted, Congress \nthought EPA ought to be the one to make that determination. Now, is it \na fair, reasonable standard? Somehow this crazy myth has been spilled \nout all over the floor that this is an unreasonable standard. The \nNational Academy of Sciences--and this is not a Nevada-based group; the \n``N'' stands for National, not Nevada--has looked at the standards and \nsaid, look, the range should be between 2 and 20 millirems, and it is \n15.\n\n  Any Member of this Senate can defend a ``no'' vote on this \nlegislation on the basis that Yucca Mountain is going forward in the \nstudy process. Nothing changes that. All we are saying is, in the \ninterest of fairness, don't play politics with the standards. And that \nis what is occurring. All we are asking is that the health and safety \nof Nevada be accorded the same protection that the good citizens of New \nMexico and every other place in America enjoy. So by moving this into \nthe next year, they are trying to play politics. Do you know what. The \nvery perverse result of all of this is that it is going to result in a \nfurther delay, and that would be as a result of this legislation being \nenacted.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me respond to a few of the points \nmade in debate. The other Senator from Nevada also wishes to speak.\n  First, when my good friend from Wyoming made his comments, he made a \npoint that we hear a lot on the floor, which is that the people who are \nopposed to this bill have offered no alternatives. That is not true. I \nthink anyone who has followed the course of this legislation in \ncommittee knows that I offered an alternative in committee, which got a \nsignificant number of votes, which I believe would have been a \nsubstantial step forward. On each of the issues we are debating, I have \noffered alternative language. So, clearly, that is not the case.\n  Second, on the issue about the Department of Energy making no \nprogress with the Yucca Mountain project, I don't think that is an \naccurate or fair criticism at this point. Clearly, they have not done \nall we wish had been done, but it is also true that Congress, most \nyears, has not provided the funding requested for this project.\n  The Department of Energy is on target to characterize the Yucca \nMountain facility. Five miles of tunnel have been built in the last few \nyears. Numerous test facilities have been built. Progress is being made \nbut not adequate progress. I am sure they are unhappy with the pace of \nprogress. Of course, this legislation contains a delay in the EPA's \nability to issue their standards. The take title is perhaps the part \nthat is most confusing because there seems to be an underlying belief \non the part of some Senators who have spoken that if we provide this \ntake title authority so that the Department of Energy can go in and \ntake the title and settle these lawsuits that are pending, somehow or \nother that lessens the need for the Department of Energy to go ahead \nand move the waste to Yucca Mountain or to any other central facility. \nI don't see that myself. What Federal agency is going to want to \npermanently be the owner and caretaker of nuclear waste in 80 different \nlocations? Clearly, DOE would not want that result. They would like to \nresolve the pending lawsuits, take title to the property, move ahead as \nquickly as possible to get the site characterized, and if it meets the \nstandard, then go ahead with it. So I don't think this take title thing \nis what it is described to be.\n\n  On the land transfer issue, on which there has been some discussion, \nthere were no land transfers in the committee-reported bill. I think we \nneed to understand that. So there are no maps\n\n[[Page S568]]\n\nand there was no discussion about it in the committee because it wasn't \nbrought up there. Page 11 of the bill makes reference to ``maps dated \nFebruary 1, 2000, and on file with the Secretary of Energy.'' We can't \nfind any such maps. The Secretary of Energy can't find any such maps. \nWe don't know what they are talking about. There is real confusion \nabout the specifics of these land transfers.\n  The final point I will make on this--and I will defer to my \ncolleague, Senator Reid--is the chairman, understandably, in his \nconcluding remarks, said if you vote for this bill, we will put this \nproblem behind us. Mr. President, if that were true, I would be sorely \ntempted to vote for this bill. The truth is, we can vote for this bill, \npass this bill, and the President can sign this bill, but not only are \nthe problems not behind us, our problems would be compounded. \nTherefore, I will not be able to support the bill. I regret that we \nwill not pass something that does, in fact, put the problem behind us.\n  I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I said yesterday, when I practiced law, I \nrepresented car dealers, and there were times when they got cars in \ntheir inventory that simply were bad cars, lemons. There wasn't \nanything they could do to fix them. They would take them into the shop \ntwo, three, four times, and they turned out to be lemons. I represented \na car dealer who sold a car to someone and he said, ``They have a car \nout in front of my place painted yellow that looks like a float; it is \na lemon.'' He said, ``You have to settle this case.''\n  That is what we have. This legislation is a lemon. Whatever the \nesteemed chairman of the full committee tries to do, he can't make an \norange out of a lemon. This is bad legislation. The Senator from New \nMexico is known in the Senate as being a very thoughtful man. He has \ntried very hard to get a piece of legislation that improves the process \nfor Yucca Mountain. Now, this situation has been amply described by \nanybody who is willing to read this legislation as being a travesty. \nThis legislation doesn't help anything. It is opposed by the \nenvironmental community, the President of the United States, the \nDirector of the EPA, and the Department of Energy Secretary. This is \nbad legislation and it should be voted against.\n  Talking about the land in Nevada, nobody knows what that is. There \nare about 74 million acres in Nevada. They are talking about maps that \ndon't exist. What the chairman has tried to do in this legislation is \nsatisfy one group of people and, in the process, he eliminates others.\n  For the first time in the history of this legislation, the utilities \nare opposed to the States. The utilities wanted to get rid of this \nnuclear waste. Now they own it more than they ever owned it. They will \nbe stuck with it forever if this legislation passes.\n  I think this legislation should be taken back to the drawing board to \nsee if anything can be done to improve it. In the meantime, at Yucca \nMountain the characterization is still taking place. I think we should \nlet the 1987 act stand for what is going to take place at Yucca \nMountain--not some cockamamie piece of legislation that is trying to \ngive the nuclear industry a reward they don't deserve.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to share my views on the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Amendments Act of 2000 (S. 1287). Specifically, I want to \nexplain why I will continue to oppose this legislation in its current \nform.\n  Let me first express my grave concern about the process by which this \nlegislation has been developed over the last few days. My office \nreceived a new version of this legislation, which eventually was \nproposed as a substitute amendment, nearly every day last week. Closed \nnegotiations have continued even while the bill has been on the floor. \nFor those of us who have utilities in our states that are grappling \nwith nuclear waste storage questions, this made it nearly impossible to \nanalyze this bill on behalf of our constituents. The issues presented \nin this legislation are serious policy issues, and our constituents \ndeserve better information.\n  I am principally opposed to this bill because it does little to \naddress the nuclear waste storage question in my home state of \nWisconsin. Wisconsinites want nuclear waste removed from our state and \nstored in a permanent geologic repository out of state so that it has \nno chance of coming back to Wisconsin. I opposed nuclear waste \nlegislation in the last Congress which sought to build large scale \ninterim storage facilities before the permanent storage site is ready \nand would have jeopardized consideration of the permanent site. This \nyear's bill would have provided federal funds for on-site storage of \nnuclear waste until the permanent storage site at Yucca Mountain was \nready to take our waste.\n  The substitute amendment stripped out the on-site storage provisions. \nThis bill now does nothing to address the waste situation at the \nmajority of Wisconsin's nuclear plants. The bill, as amended by the \nsubstitute amendment, does contain a specific section which would \naddress the nuclear waste situation at the La Crosse Boiling Water \nReactor, which is owned by Dairyland Power and has been shut down for \nyears. The Dairyland language is something that I have supported and \nwill continue to support, but I had hoped this legislation would be \nable to extend similar relief to other Wisconsin utilities.\n  With the on-site storage provisions stripped out, the bill retains a \nloosely knit collection of provisions that seem unlikely to have a \nbeneficial impact on the country's nuclear waste program. The bill \nrequires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's and the National Academy \nof Sciences' concurrence in the radiation exposure standard that the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency is drafting--an entirely new \nprocedure. If those entities do not agree, the responsibility to set \nthe standard comes back to Congress. I am concerned that if those \nentities cannot agree it is likely that Congress can not do much better \nto resolve the issues.\n  One of my other concerns has always been the safety and security of \nshipping nuclear materials from their current locations to a permanent \ngeologic storage site outside of the state. Obviously, there is a risk \nthat, during the transportation, accidents may occur. Although the \nlegislation provides for emergency response training in the \njurisdictions through which nuclear material would be transported, I \nstill feel that these provisions need to be strengthened to ensure that \nstate and local governments have the financial and equipment resources \nthey need to respond to accidents.\n  In conclusion, I cannot support legislation which purports to fix the \ncountry's nuclear waste program and leaves Wisconsin so far behind. I \ncontinue to remain hopeful that legislation in this area can be crafted \nthat can win my support.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote for the most recent version of \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2000. It advances the \nprocess further, and it is essential that the promised and paid for \ndisposal of nuclear waste from Michigan proceed. There are a number of \nprovisions in this bill which are problematic and while I will vote to \nadvance this legislation, I will review the final product that comes \nbefore the Senate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for the last several days the Chairman of \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Murkowski, and the \nRanking Member, Senator Bingaman, have been working to come to an \nagreement on legislation to resolve how our nation will provide long-\nterm storage for deadly nuclear waste that is currently stockpiled near \nnuclear reactors around the country.\n  Despite many hours of hard work, an agreement was not reached. The \nlegislation before the Senate today will not ensure the safety of the \nAmerican public or deal with the critical issues of liability that \nfirst led us to consider this legislation.\n  I would like to take a few moments this morning to explain why I will \nbe opposing the substitute amendment to S. 1287, the Nuclear Waste \nAmendments Act of 2000.\n  As Senator Bingaman explained last night, this legislation was \nproposed because the federal government was unable to meet its \nobligation under the law to provide a long-term storage site for \nnuclear waste. In 1982, Congress directed the Department of Energy to \nbegin accepting waste at a long-term storage site by 1998. This \ndeadline has not been met, and as a result, the taxpayers are facing \nbillions of dollars in potential liability.\n\n[[Page S569]]\n\n  Originally, this bill would have allowed the Department to settle \nthese lawsuits by taking title to the waste in its current sites \npending completion of a long-term storage facility. This provision has \nnow been removed from the bill. As a result, this legislation does \nnothing to relieve the taxpayers of the enormous bill they may have to \nfoot.\n  I am also deeply concerned by steps taken in the bill to undermine \nthe authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to set radiation \nsafety standards. EPA has currently proposed tough but reasonable \nstandards to protect groundwater and those living in the area. These \nstandards are consistent with a report of the National Academy of \nSciences issued in 1995.\n  However, this legislation prevents EPA from issuing final standards \nuntil June 1, 2001. The clear expectation underlying this provision is \nthat a new president will be in office who will support weaker \nstandards than those currently proposed.\n  Mr. President, it is unacceptable to gamble with the health of \nAmericans who will be living near the long-term storage site. It is \nvery likely that waste will be stored at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. \nNearby, there is a dairy farm and fields of crops that use groundwater \nfor irrigation. If we do not support tough safety standards, there is a \nchance that radiation in the groundwater will end up in the water used \nin these farms and for drinking by those who live there, putting public \nhealth at risk.\n  Finally, I am concerned about an enormous potential write-off for \nnuclear utilities in this bill. Currently, utilities pay into a Nuclear \nWaste Fund to ensure that the Department of Energy has the resources it \nneeds to pay for long-term storage. This bill caps the amount that must \nbe paid by utilities, setting up the taxpayer to fund whatever costs \nremain.\n  We need to do a better job of protecting the safety of the American \npublic and the taxpayers from the bottomless liability that may result \nfrom this legislation. For these reasons, I will oppose this bill.\n  Finally, I want to thank Senator Bingaman for his hard work on this \nissue, and Senators Reid and Bryan. While this bill today is not yet \nsatisfactory, it is significantly better than those we have seen in the \npast. It is largely thanks to the efforts of these Senators that these \nchanges have been made.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1287, a bill to \nprovide for the storage of spent nuclear fuel, pending completion of \nthe permanent nuclear waste repository.\n  I also want to thank Senator Craig and Senator Murkowski for their \ntireless efforts to move forward on legislation to address the issue of \ndisposing of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste.\n  The federal government made a commitment to the nation's nuclear \nutilities that it would build a permanent repository to dispose of \ncommercial spent nuclear fuel. By law, the repository was supposed to \nbe ready to accept nuclear waste by 1998.\n  Six billion dollars later, the Department of Energy effort to build a \nrepository is years behind schedule and mired in political warfare.\n  As a result of these delays, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia ruled that the DOE had failed to meet its legal \nobligations and ordered the Department to pay contractual damages to \nthe nuclear utilities.\n  If the current situation is allowed to continue, the utilities will \nbe paying twice. They have already contributed to the nuclear waste \nfund to build the repository. Without this legislation, they will \ncontinue to pay for the repository and on site storage for waste the \nfederal government said it would take.\n  As a result of national defense and research activities, the federal \ngovernment itself has generated thousands of tons of spent nuclear fuel \nand high-level waste. This waste continues to be monitored and stored \nat federal sites across the country, including the Idaho National \nEngineering and Environmental Laboratory, at significant cost. This \nwaste is also waiting to be sent to a permanent repository.\n  The financial resources that are necessary to continuously store, \nmonitor, and maintain this fuel and waste are overwhelming and could be \nused for other constructive purposes by the government and utilities \ninstead of watching and waiting as has been the past practice.\n  This bill offers an option for relief to utilities where the \nDepartment of Energy could take title to the fuel and transport it to \nthe repository site. Different from past legislation, this bill \nidentifies that spent fuel storage at the repository site, in advance \nof fuel placement in a repository, cannot occur until construction of \nthe repository has been authorized.\n  This bill is particularly important to the State of Idaho because of \nthe 1995 Settlement Agreement. This agreement was entered into in \nFederal court. It was agreed to by the Departments of Energy and Navy \nand the State of Idaho. One of the requirements is to remove all spent \nfuel from Idaho by 2035. A repository or interim storage site is \nessential for the parties to comply with the agreement.\n  The logical location for the permanent repository is Yucca Mountain. \nIt has been designated by Congress as the only site for study. It is \nlocated on dry Federal desert land. It is adjacent to the Nation's \nnuclear testing site where hundreds of nuclear weapons have been \nexploded.\n  The bill establishes a schedule for decisions on the adequacy of \nYucca Mountain as a repository which will allow the parties to comply \nwith the Idaho Settlement Agreement. The bill also deletes the 70,000 \nmetric ton uranium cap which had been imposed on the repository. \nRemoval of this cap allows one geological repository to be capable of \nhandling the nation's inventory of spent fuel and high-level waste \ninstead of multiple repositories.\n  The bill allows the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and National \nAcademy of Sciences to give input on the scientific validity and \nprotection of the public health and safety provided by the proposed \nEnvironmental Protection Agency radiation standard. The Environmental \nProtection Agency maintains standard setting authority, cannot set a \nstandard until June 1, 2001, and is not bound to accept or even \nconsider the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or National Academy of \nSciences input. This compromise only delays the setting of a radiation \nstandard by the Environmental Protection Agency and delays the date by \nwhen the Secretary of Energy will have an established radiation \nstandard to work to. Although I dislike the compromise that was reached \nI understand that a compromise needed to be made to move this important \nlegislation forward.\n  Support of this bill is the right thing to do for the country.\n  Idaho is one of several states where defense and DOE spent nuclear \nfuel and high level waste are stored; other major states include \nWashington, South Carolina, and New York.\n  There are over 70 commercial nuclear utilities that are storing spent \nnuclear fuel because the federal government has not lived up to its \ncontract.\n  Storage facilities at these locations are filling up quickly, will \nnot last forever, and will be expensive to monitor and maintain.\n  The U.S. receives 20 percent of its electricity capacity from nuclear \npower. There are no other emission free alternative power generating \ntechnologies that could replace this capacity if opponents are \nsuccessful in shutting down nuclear power. Many of the issues \nassociated with spent nuclear fuel are political, not technical. \nNuclear fuel has been moved safely across this country and around the \nworld for nearly forty years. The ``mobile Chernobyl'' scare tactics \nare a myth.\n  Movement needs to continue on a permanent repository and relief needs \nto be provided for nuclear utilities. This bill provides forward \nmomentum and relief.\n  I would have preferred to see the bill go further by establishing an \ninterim storage facility at the Nevada Test Site and vesting standard \nsetting authority with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. \nUnfortunately, the Congress has been unable to enact this type of \nlegislation because of the threat of a presidential veto. While I would \nhave preferred to vote in support of a stronger bill, I understand why \nSenator Murkowski has made concessions to the other side to try to move \nthis legislation forward.\n  This is an important piece of legislation which will show the \nAmerican people that we can address the issue of nuclear waste in a way \nthat is technically and environmentally sound.\n\n[[Page S570]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to support enactment of this important \npiece of legislation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nbefore we vote to recognize a member of the Senate staff who has \ncontributed a lot to the nuclear waste debate over the years. That \nperson is Joe Barry, who has worked for Senator Bryan for many years, \nand who apparently has actually had other duties not related to nuclear \nwaste, as well. He is a tremendous professional who has helped keep the \ndebate in the Senate on this issue on a high level of technical \naccuracy. I understand that he will be leaving for a position in the \nprivate sector in Boston when we break for this recess. Senators don't \nalways agree with each other in debate. The search for relevant and \naccurate information and perspectives is essential to the legislative \nprocess, and is greatly helped when Members have highly competent \nprofessional staff like Joe. We will miss him in this chamber, and I \nwould like to extend my personal best wishes to him for great success \nin the future.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I regret that I cannot support S. 1287, \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2000.\n  I cannot support this bill because it fails to meet the safety \nconcerns of our local communities regarding the hazards of nuclear \nwaste. I cannot support this bill because it poses an unacceptable \ndanger to the lives and health of the thousands of Minnesotans and \nmillions of Americans who live near shipment routes.\n  By dramatically increasing the number of hazardous shipments through \nlocal communities, S. 1287 increases the risk of transportation \naccidents involving nuclear waste and could put public health and \nsafety in jeopardy. This legislation would mean an additional 800 \nshipments in the first two years, growing to about 1,800 shipments \nannually by the fifth year. These shipments would continue for at least \n25 years, traveling within half a mile of 50 million Americans.\n  Under this legislation, highly dangerous nuclear waste would be \nshipped through 40 or more states, including my own state of Minnesota, \nregardless of whether it is safe for our local communities, and without \ntheir input. Without reliable and efficient emergency response \nsafeguards for our local communities, S. 1287 fails to protect local \ncommunities from even a small accident during the shipment of nuclear \nwaste.\n  Recently, DOE projected that a nuclear waste transportation accident \nin a rural area with even a small release of radioactive material would \ncontaminate 42 square miles. DOE also estimated that it would take 460 \ndays to clean up such an accident, at a cost of $620 million. The \nsafety record of nuclear waste transportation should give us pause. \nBetween 1964 and 1997, the Department of Energy (DOE) made \napproximately 2,913 shipments of used nuclear fuel. During this time, \nthere were 47 safety incidents involving nuclear shipments, including 6 \naccidents.\n  Furthermore, S. 1287 undermines the Environmental Protection Agency's \n(EPA) standard-setting process. It would delay the EPA's existing \nstatutory authority to adopt health and safety standards to protect \nlocal communities from the release of radioactive materials. This delay \nstands in fundamental contradiction to the claimed urgency of this \nlegislation. It also highlights the misplaced priorities of S. 1287, \nwith an unacceptable emphasis on disposal at any cost, regardless of \nwhether the safety and health of local communities have been adequately \nprovided for.\n  It is especially regrettable that S. 1287 does not resolve our \ndilemma regarding the future of nuclear waste storage. Nobody, \nincluding me, wants this waste to stay onsite forever, but we need a \nsafe and responsible solution for disposal of the waste we have \ncreated. As we head into the 21st century, we urgently need to develop \na policy that protects the health and safety of local communities and \nall Americans. Unfortunately, this bill fails to meet that requirement. \nS. 1287 is a disappointing step in the wrong direction and a regression \nfrom past legislative efforts in this area. And for that reason I am \nvoting against it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I strongly oppose S. 1287 and the \nsubstitute amendment being offered. This is bad policy and should be \nrejected by the Senate.\n  Protecting the health and safety of American citizens should be our \nhighest priority in evaluating the disposal of our nuclear waste. In \norder to do this, all decisions must be made based on science, not \npolitics. This legislation does not do that. Under the cover of a \n``compromise'' bill, this legislation is the latest attempt to pre-empt \nscience and legislate the scientific suitability of Yucca Mountain, \nNevada, as a high-level nuclear waste dump.\n  Instead of finding a repository that meets our health and safety \nstandards established in law, this legislation attempts to weaken our \nhealth and safety standards to meet the repository. I cannot and will \nnot support such an action.\n  For many years we have debated the suitability of a high-level \nradioactive waste dump site at Yucca Mountain. And for years, I have \nbeen down on this Senate floor with my colleagues from Nevada fighting \nto protect the health and safety of the citizens of Nevada. But I know \nthat Yucca Mountain is not just a Nevada issue, it is a national \nissue--and more important to me, it seriously and directly affects my \nState of California.\n  Yucca Mountain is only 17 miles from the California border and the \nDeath Valley National Park. Development of this site has the potential \nto contaminate California's groundwater and poses unnecessary threats \nto the health and safety of Californians due to possible transportation \naccidents from shipping high-level nuclear waste through Inyo, San \nBernardino and neighboring California counties.\n  Since its inception as a National Monument in 1933, the federal \ngovernment has invested more than $600 million in the Death Valley \nNational Park. The Park receives over 1.4 million visitors every year. \nFurthermore, the communities surrounding the park are economically \ndependent on tourism. The income generated by the presence of the Park \nexceeds $125 million per year. The Park has been the most significant \nelement in the sustainable growth of the tourist industry in the Mojave \nDesert. The Park is committed to sustainable growth of jobs and \ninfrastructure in contrast to the traditional boom-and-dust desert \neconomy.\n  Scientific studies show that a significant part of the regional \ngroundwater aquifer surrounding Yucca Mountain discharges in Death \nValley because the valley is down-gradient of areas to the east. If the \ngroundwater at Death Valley is contaminated, that will be the demise of \nthe Park and the surrounding communities. The long-term viability of \nfish, wildlife and human populations in the area are largely dependent \non water from this aquifer. The vast majority of the Park's visitors \nrely on services and facilities at the park headquarters near Furnace \nCreek. These facilities are all dependent upon the groundwater aquifer \nthat flows under or near Yucca Mountain. And, unfortunately, there is \nno alternative water source that can support the visitor facilities and \nwildlife resources.\n  Water is life in the desert. Water quality must be preserved for the \nviability of Death Valley National Park and the dependent tourism \nindustry.\n  I hope my colleagues agree that we should not threaten these \nvisitors, this natural treasure, and our huge financial investment with \nincomplete science and unnecessary actions. The potential loss is just \ntoo great.\n  It has been extremely difficult to get the Energy Department to \naccept California's connection to the site. Although DOE now recognizes \nInyo County, California as an Affected Unit of Local Government under \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act, it did so reluctantly after a successful \nlawsuit by the county that resulted in DOE granting affected unit \nstatus in 1991. Inyo is the only county in California that is now \nlisted. Fortunately, in response to a letter that I sent to the Energy \nDepartment, a hearing will be schedule in San Bernardino County to \ndiscuss the potential threat of transportation routes through the \ncounty. But my State's concerns are not being fully addressed. I ask \nunanimous consent that my letter to Secretary Richardson and his \nresponse be included in the Record.\n  As an Affected Unit of Local Government, Inyo County receives Federal \nappropriations to monitor the Yucca\n\n[[Page S571]]\n\nMountain project. The primary thrust of Inyo County's monitoring \nprogram has been to demonstrate the hydrologic connection between the \naquifer underlying Yucca Mountain and the discharge points in Death \nValley National Park and surrounding communities.\n  In addition to the groundwater concerns, my State is extremely \nconcerned about the increased transportation of high level radioactive \nwaste that will be shipped through our State as a result of this bill. \nDespite my objections, the Department of Energy has already started to \nship low-level nuclear waste through Inyo County to the Nevada Test \nSite. Inyo and San Bernardino are especially concerned because of the \nlack of thorough studies on the transportation routes.\n  The State of California has also been very involved in this issue. \nThe California Energy Commission's comments on the Yucca Mountain \nProject Draft Environmental Impact Statement express the State's \nserious concerns over the possible groundwater contamination and the \nlack of adequate analysis of proper transportation routes. In fact, the \nWestern Governor's Association has repeatedly asked the Energy \nDepartment to complete a more detailed and thorough analysis of the \ntransportation routes to Yucca Mountain to no avail.\n  While the legislation that we are debating today is an improvement \nfrom bills introduced and debated in the past, it still must be \nstopped. This legislation would undermine the regulatory framework \nauthorized in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and implemented by \nthe EPA and DOE.\n  The EPA was directed by Congress to establish a radiation exposure \nstandard for Yucca Mountain. The EPA is in the process of completing \nthat requirement. The draft standards were issued last August and the \nEPA is currently considering all comments on the proposal. The draft \nstandard includes a separate--and much needed--groundwater standard for \nthe repository that must meet the requirements of the Safe Drinking \nWater Act.\n  The legislation we are discussing today prevents the Clinton \nAdministration from acting in a timely manner to protect public health. \nHowever, once this Administration leaves office, the EPA standards \ncould move forward. Where is the science in that?\n  This provision flies in the face of science and the fundamental \nprinciple of protecting public health and safety first and foremost.\n  I understand that a 1995 study by the Department of Energy showed \nthat the radiation at Yucca Mountain would be much higher than allowed \nunder current regulations. In fact, the DOE study finds that maximum \ndoses at the site would be 50 rem per year.\n  If, like me, you are not a scientist, let me put that number into \nperspective for you. That is like having approximately 5,000 chest x-\nrays annually. Furthermore, it is about 2000 times higher than what the \npublic is currently permitted to receive under an operating powerplant \nunder current EPA regulations. That dose is sufficient to produce \napproximately 100 percent probability of dying of cancer under NRC and \nDOE current risk estimates. Virtually everyone exposed to that dose \nwould die of cancer. So rather than go back and try to design a better \nrepository to meet the standards, we are on this floor to change the \nstandards to meet the repository.\n  Finally, the one provision in S. 1287 that most people could agree on \nwas stripped from this substitute amendment. That provision would have \nallowed the Energy Secretary to take title to the waste that is \ncurrently being stored on-site in order to resolve the liability issue.\n  The alleged reason for moving this legislation was to deal with the \nliability issue that was created by a successful lawsuit from the \nutilities against the Energy Department. The utilities claimed that the \nEnergy Department was not meeting its obligations under the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act to store this waste. And the utilities won. Senator \nMurkowski and Secretary Richardson seemed to agree that the best way to \nresolve this issue was to have the Energy Department take title to the \nwaste at the utilities. That was the reason for moving a bill. Now, \nthat provision is gone, and therefore the reason to move this bill is \ngone.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote no on this unnecessary \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that correspondence in regard to this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Hart Senate Office Building,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 12, 2000.\n     Hon. Bill Richardson,\n     Secretary of Energy, James Forrestal Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I am writing about the environmental \n     impact report being prepared for the proposed transfer of \n     radioactive material to Yucca Mountain near Las Vegas. More \n     specifically, I am writing about the concerns of the San \n     Bernardino Board of Supervisors that the County of San \n     Bernardino has received less than adequate information about \n     the process.\n       Though radioactive material being transported to Yucca \n     Mountain in Nevada will be transported within San Bernardino \n     County, there has been no hearing on the proposal within the \n     County. Further, San Bernardino County officials allege that \n     they have received no formal notice of hearings held outside \n     the county or other notices of the environmental process.\n       I understand that other hearings were recently added to the \n     Yucca Mountain review process. This is a request that you \n     schedule a further hearing within San Bernardino County. I am \n     certain that San Bernardino County officials will be happy to \n     help arrange such a hearing. Thank you for your attention to \n     this matter. Please respond to me through my San Bernardino \n     office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 2000.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: Thank you for your letter of January \n     12, 2000, regarding the environmental impact report being \n     prepared for the proposed transfer of radioactive material to \n     Yucca Mountain.\n       I am sensitive to your concerns and the concerns of your \n     constituents in San Bernardino County regarding their \n     involvement in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) \n     for a Geologic Repository for the Disposal of Spent Nuclear \n     Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste at Yucca Mountain, Nye \n     County, Nevada. I have added an additional public hearing in \n     the city of San Bernardino. The hearing will be held prior to \n     the end of the comment period for the Draft EIS, which has \n     been extended until February 28, 2000. A Federal Register \n     Notice announcing the date and location of this public \n     hearing is forthcoming.\n       The Department is making every effort to address the \n     public's interest in this document. This past December, three \n     additional hearings were scheduled to include locations in \n     the Midwest, including Lincoln, Nebraska; Cleveland, Ohio; \n     and Chicago, Illinois. With the inclusion of an additional \n     hearing in your State, the Department will have conducted a \n     total of 21 hearings, 11 throughout the country and 10 in the \n     State of Nevada. The Department is striving to ensure that \n     the public has ample opportunity to comment on the Draft EIS. \n     I hope the additional hearing in California addresses your \n     concerns and those of your constituents.\n       If you have any questions or additional concerns, please \n     call me or have a member of your staff contact John C. \n     Angell, Assistant Secretary for Congressional and \n     Intergovernmental Affairs, at 202-586-5450.\n           Yours sincerely,\n     Bill Richardson.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Board of Supervisors\n\n\n                                     County of San Bernardino,\n\n                             San Bernardino, CA, January 12, 2000.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: The Board of Supervisors unanimously \n     approved [a] resolution at our meeting yesterday. It \n     expresses our substantial concern over the lack of \n     notification from the Department of Energy with regard to \n     their plans to transport thousands of shipments of high-level \n     radioactive waste through the major cities of our County.\n       The only hearing held in this State took place in a remote \n     area hundreds of miles from our major population centers. In \n     addition we were not provided with any official notification \n     of the Issuance of the Environmental Impact Statement nor \n     were we provided a copy of same.\n       While we understand that transportation and storage/\n     disposal of this material is essential for operation of \n     various facilities, it is only appropriate that the \n     jurisdictions which will be recipient of the majority of \n     these shipments be given notice and response opportunities.\n       We ask for your strong support for our request to the \n     Department of Energy for full disclosure, additional time for \n     response and review, and for a public hearing to be held in \n     our area. The hearing should be held somewhere near the \n     population centers which will be subject to these shipments \n     and the potential dangers imposed thereby.\n       We appreciate your serious consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely.\n                                                      Jerry Eaves,\n                                       Supervisor, Fifth District.\n\n[[Page S572]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                County of Ventura,\n                                                 February 1, 2000.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I am writing to reiterate the Ventura \n     County Board of Supervisors' opposition to S. 1287, the \n     Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments of 1999, which, as currently \n     written, would allow spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste \n     to be transported through Ventura County.\n       The Board of Supervisors endorses the development of a \n     national policy for the transportation of spent nuclear fuel. \n     However, the Board opposes transporting these material \n     through Ventura County. County officials and residents are \n     concerned about the proximity of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear \n     Power Plant in San Luis Obispo County and the vulnerability \n     to potential disasters related to the transportation of \n     hazardous materials through the community, which poses \n     serious health and safety risks to County residents.\n       Please vote against S. 1287 unless it is amended to \n     prohibit the transportation of spent nuclear fuel and \n     radioactive waste through Ventura County and other heavily \n     populated areas.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Thomas P. Walters,\n     Washington Representative.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               County of Inyo,\n\n                               Independence, CA, February 1, 2000.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer, I am writing to express concern with S. \n     1287, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1999. S. \n     1287 proposes to abandon current specific DOE guidelines for \n     determining the suitability of Yucca Mountain, Nevada (for \n     siting of a nuclear waste repository) in lieu of less-\n     demanding, generalized criteria. S. 1287 also removes the \n     role of the Environmental Protection Agency from determining \n     the human health standard to which repository design and \n     operations should be held.\n       S. 1287, as it currently stands, would replace DOE's \n     current and specific site suitability criteria (10 CFR 960--\n     adopted in 1986 after considerable public input) with a \n     generalized ``total system performance assessment'' approach \n     (proposed in 10 CFR 963) which does not require the site to \n     meet specific criteria with regard to site geology and \n     hydrology or waste packet performance. Replacement of the \n     current site suitability criteria by 10 CFR 963 would reduce \n     the likelihood that the repository would be designed and \n     constructed using the best available technology. Individual \n     components of the repository system could be less than \n     optimal in design and performance if computer modeling of the \n     design showed it capable of meeting NRC's less-demanding \n     standard. Given the significant long-term risk that \n     development of the repository places on California \n     populations and resources, any compromises on repository \n     design, operations or materials cannot be tolerated.\n       S. 1287 allows the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to set a \n     standard for protection of the public from radiological \n     exposure associated with development of the repository. The \n     power to set a standard for the Yucca Mountain project \n     rightfully belongs with the EPA in its traditional role of \n     setting health standards for Federal projects. In our recent \n     response to EPA's proposed radiological health standard for \n     the repository, Inyo County stated its strong support for EPA \n     authority over the project and for use of a standard which \n     focuses on maintaining the safety of groundwater in the Yucca \n     Mountain-Amargosa Valley-Death Valley region.\n       Based on these considerations, S. 1287 will not provide \n     adequate protection for Inyo County resources or citizens. We \n     hope that the provisions in the bill for setting repository \n     standards and for changing the site suitability guidelines \n     will be deleted.\n       We appreciate your continued support of Inyo County's \n     efforts to safeguard the health and safety of its citizens.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael Dorame,\n       Supervisor, Fifth District, County of Inyo.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 California Energy Commission,\n\n                                 Sacramento, CA, February 7, 2000.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: We have reviewed S. 1287 (Nuclear Waste \n     Policy Amendments Act of 2000) (NWPA) and offer the following \n     comments.\n       The State of California, including thirteen California \n     agencies, has reviewed the Department of Energy's (DOE) Draft \n     Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the proposed Yucca \n     Mountain High-Level Nuclear Waste Repository. This review, \n     coordinated by the California Energy Commission, identified \n     major areas of deficiencies and scientific uncertainties in \n     the DEIS regarding potential transportation and groundwater \n     impacts in California from the repository. In light of these \n     deficiencies and uncertainties, there are serious questions \n     whether a decision should/can be made on the Yucca Mt. site's \n     suitability in time for shipments to begin in 2007, as \n     required by S. 1287.\n       These deficiencies and uncertainties include the need for \n     better data and more realistic models to evaluate groundwater \n     flow and potential radionuclide migration toward regional \n     groundwater supplies in eastern California. In addition, \n     there are major scientific uncertainties regarding key \n     variables affecting how well geologic and engineered barriers \n     at the repository can isolate the wastes from the \n     environment. For example, there is considerable uncertainty \n     regarding waste package corrosion rates, potential water \n     seepage through the walls of the repository, groundwater \n     levels and flow beneath the repository, and the potential \n     impact on California aquifers from the potential migration of \n     radionuclides from the repository. California is concerned \n     about these uncertainties and deficiencies in studies of the \n     Yucca Mt. project and the serious lack of progress in DOE's \n     developing transportation plans for shipments to the \n     repository.\n       Potential major impacts in California from the proposed \n     repository include: (1) transportation impacts, (2) potential \n     radionuclide contamination of groundwater in the Death Valley \n     region, and (3) impacts on wildlife, natural habitat and \n     public parks along shipment corridors and from groundwater \n     contamination. Transportation is the single area of the \n     proposed Yucca Mt. project that will affect the most people \n     across the United States, since the shipments will be \n     traveling cross-country on the nation's highways and \n     railways. California is a major generator of spent nuclear \n     fuel and currently stores this waste at four operating \n     commercial nuclear power reactors, three commercial reactors \n     being decommissioned, and at five research reactor locations \n     throughout the State. Under current plans, spent nuclear fuel \n     shipments from California reactors will begin the first year \n     of shipments to a repository or storage facility.\n       In addition to the spent fuel generated in California, a \n     major portion of the shipments from other states to the Yucca \n     Mountain site could be routed through California. This \n     concern was elevated recently when DOE decided, over the \n     objections of California and Inyo and San Bernardino \n     Counties, to reroute through southeastern California, along \n     California Route 127, thousands of low-level waste shipments \n     from eastern states to the Nevada Test Site, in order to \n     avoid nuclear waste shipments through Las Vegas and over \n     Hoover Dam. We objected to DOE's rerouting these shipments \n     over California Route 127 because this roadway was not \n     engineered for such large volumes of heavy truck traffic, \n     lacks timely emergency response capability, is heavily \n     traveled by tourists, and is subject to periodic flash \n     flooding. We are concerned that S. 1287, by requiring that \n     shipments minimize transport through heavily populated areas, \n     could force NWPA shipments onto roadways in California, such \n     as State Route 127, that are not suitable for such shipments.\n       The massive scale of these shipments to the repository or \n     interim storage site will be unprecedented. Nevada's \n     preliminary estimates of potential legal-weight truck \n     shipments to Yucca Mountain show that an estimated 74,000 \n     truck shipments, about three-fourths of the total, could \n     traverse southern California under DOE's ``mostly truck'' \n     scenario. Shipments could average five truck shipments daily \n     through California during the 39-year time period of waste \n     emplacement. Under a mixed truck and rail scenario, \n     California could receive an average of two truck shipments \n     per day and 4-5 rail shipments per week for 39 years. Under a \n     ``best case'' scenario that assumes the use of large rail \n     shipping containers, Nevada estimates there could be more \n     than 26,000 truck shipments and 9,800 shipments through \n     California to the repository.\n       We are concerned that S. 1287 would require that NWPA \n     shipments begin prematurely before the necessary studies \n     determining the site's suitability have been completed and \n     before the transportation impacts of this decision have been \n     fully evaluated. S. 1287 accelerates the schedule for the \n     repository by requiring shipments to begin at the earliest \n     practicable date and no later than January 31, 2007. In \n     contrast, DOE has been planning for shipments to begin in \n     2010, a date considered by many to be overly optimistic. \n     Shipping waste to a site before the necessary scientific \n     evaluations of the site have been completed and before route-\n     specific transportation impacts have been fully evaluated \n     could have costly results. The DOE nuclear weapons complex \n     has many examples of inappropriate sites where expediency has \n     created a legacy of very costly waste clean-up, e.g., \n     Hanford, Washington. The use of methods that were not fully \n     tested for the storage and disposal of nuclear wastes has \n     resulted in contaminants from these wastes leaking into the \n     environment. Transporting waste to a site, as mandated by S. \n     1287, before the appropriate analyses are completed could \n     create a ``de facto'' high-level waste repository in \n     perpetuity with unknown and potentially serious long-term \n     public and environmental consequences.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert A. Laurie,\n       Commissioner and State Liaison Officer to the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission.\n\n\n              why nuclear waste won't go to south carolina\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would like to inquire of the manager whether it is \npossible for any spent nuclear fuel to go to South Carolina under the \nprovisions of Section 102, ``Backup Storage Capacity'' of the manager's \nsubstitute amendment.\n\n[[Page S573]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Absolutely not. Spent nuclear fuel cannot go to South \nCarolina under the specific terms of the amendment's Backup Storage \nCapacity provisions, which states that the government shall: ``* * * \ntransport such spent fuel to, and store such spent fuel at, the \nrepository site. * * *'' That site is Yucca Mountain, Nevada.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the manager.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, what is the remaining time on this \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as this debate comes to an end, I think \nit appropriate to respond to my friend from New Mexico relative to what \nI understand he said--that he had not seen a real letter from the \nGovernors opposing taking title. I don't know whether the White House \nwill not make that available, but we have it here. I will be happy to \nshare it with him. I will put it in the Record because it shows all the \nsignatures of all the Governors:\n  The Honorable Howard Dean, Governor of Vermont; the Honorable Jeb \nBush, Governor of Florida; the Honorable Angus King, Jr., Governor of \nMaine; the Honorable John Kitzhaber, Governor of Oregon; the Honorable \nJeanne Shaheen, Governor of New Hampshire; the Honorable Jesse Ventura, \nGovernor of Minnesota; and the Honorable Tom Vilsack, Governor of Iowa.\n  There are more coming, I am told. I hope we can put that particular \ncriticism to rest.\n  This is not an imaginary letter. This a letter from the Governors \nobjecting, if you will, to the situation of leaving the waste in their \nStates for the specific reason that they don't trust the Federal \nGovernment. The reason they do not trust the Federal Government is the \nFederal Government has not performed on its contract after taking $15 \nbillion from the ratepayers to take the waste. They are fearful that \nthe waste will stay in their States under the control of the Federal \nGovernment. That is a legitimate concern.\n  Again, I refer to the chart of where that waste is. It is in those 40 \nStates. It is in 40 States, and each Member is going to have to respond \nas to why they voted to leave that waste in their State.\n  We have had questions brought up about the land in Nevada. It is kind \nof fuzzy because this is beneficial to Nevada. Now they are saying they \ndid not have any notice and they don't have the maps. The maps are in \nour office. We have them for the counties. I am sure the minority could \nget them. I am sure the two Senators from Nevada could get the maps of \ntheir own counties. We have them in our office, in fact, and I will try \nto get them in the Record so they can see them.\n  As far as the land transfer is concerned, it has always been in \nprevious bills. These are smokescreens. Our friends from Nevada are \ntrying to explain why this isn't a good deal. They wanted it. It is \nthere. Now they are saying: Well, just wait a minute; we don't have the \nfacts. We have them. They are there and available for anybody. The land \ntransfer is authorized in the previous bills. Let's not beat around the \nbush.\n  In the remaining time I have, I want to highlight what this bill \nreally accomplishes.\n  I think the minority ranking member would recognize that we have \ntried to work with him on his list of alternatives. We addressed his \nconcern on the interim storage. Our bill uses the WIPP transportation \nmodel. EPA has the sole authority to set the standard. We took out the \ninternational collaboration in transmutation which they wanted. We \ncouldn't take everything, but we certainly tried.\n  This is a valuable piece of legislation as it stands because we have \nin this substitute dropped the interim storage. Isn't this kind of \nironic? We dropped the interim storage. The administration was opposed \nto the interim storage in Nevada. The idea was that we could move this \nstuff out at a critical time and put it out there. They said: No, we \ncan't do that until Yucca is finalized--until it is finally licensed. \nBut now they are doing it twice. They are having it both ways. They are \nsaying we will just leave it in the State. Then it becomes interim in \nthe State. These Governors are smart enough to figure it out. I hope \nevery Member of this body is because it is a flimflam. That is just \nwhat it is.\n\n  The administration wants to have it both ways. They do not want \ninterim storage. They want the interim storage in the States. It drops \ninterim storage.\n  It requires Congress to approve any increase in fees to protect the \nconsumer. It sets schedules for development of a repository. It \nauthorizes backup storage at the repository for any spent fuel that the \nutilities can't store on site. It allows the EPA to set radiation \nstandards after June 1, 2001; prior to that consultation only with NAS \nand NRC, to ensure that any standard is the best science available.\n  What in the world is wrong with that?\n  It authorizes settlement agreements for outstanding litigation. It \nrequires an election to settle within 180 days as requested by the \nadministration. In other words, it brings them together.\n  Finally, it transfers 76,000 acres.\n  Let me conclude by saying that each Member is going to have to \nrespond as to why they left this waste in their State if they don't \nsupport this bill. I encourage my colleagues to recognize that it is \ntime to bring this matter to an end. Let's support the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, let me respond to the map issue. I think the Senator \nfrom Alaska characterized it as ``flimflam.'' That is what this \nlegislation is. As recently as yesterday, in requesting the maps, they \nhad none. The only thing they have is these notes right here. I ask \nunanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                 payments to local counties eliminated\n\n       Annual payments prior to first receipt of fuel: 2.5 \n     million/year $12.5.\n       Upon 1st fuel receipt: 5 million/one time 5.0.\n       Annual payments after 1st receipt until closure: $5 \n     million/year (2007-2042 125 million.)\n       Total--Over 140 million up to 2042 then 5 million/year \n     after that.\n\n\n                       land conveyances retained\n\n       Total of: 76,000 acres.\n       46,000 to Nye County.\n       30,000 to Lincoln County.\n       For a variety of uses: For example--\n       City of Caliente:\n       Municipal landfill (240 acres).\n       Community growth (2,640 acres).\n       Community recreation (800 acres).\n       Lincoln County\n       Community Growth:\n       Pioche--2,080 acres.\n       Panaca--2,240 acres.\n       Rachel--1,280 acres.\n       Alamo--1,920 acres.\n       These lands had been previously identified by BLM as \n     available for disposal.\n       Towns:\n       Beatty--3,400 acres.\n       Ione--1,280 acres.\n       Manhattan--750 acres.\n       Round Mountain/Smokey Valley--11,300 acres.\n       Tonopah--11,500 acres.\n       Total estimated 28,230 acres.\n       Towns:\n       Amargosa--2,700 acres.\n       Pahrump--14,750 acres.\n       Total estimated 17,450 acres.\n       BLM/Grand Total: 45,680 acres.\n       Western Members should be pleased about this kind of \n     transfer of public lands from federal ownership.\n       There are lots of benefits to doing these kinds of \n     transfers:\n       Long term financial benefits are:\n       Decrease federal mgmt costs;\n       Increase State & local benefits;\n       The land can now be used for income providing activities.\n       Such transfers help consolidate land ownership and that \n     leads to a more cost-effective and environmentally sound \n     ecosystem management.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, there are no maps.\n  That will give you some indication of what a shoddy, moving target \nthis has been as we have tried to debate and expand on it. It is simply \nindefensible public policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me take the remaining time to \ncommend our chairman, Senator Murkowski, for his heroic efforts in \ntrying\n\n[[Page S574]]\n\nto come up with legislation that would be constructive and deal with \nthis problem. This is not an easy issue to resolve. There are many \npoints of view.\n  First, the subject is complex. The history of the legislation is \ncertainly varied and difficult.\n  I certainly believe the chairman has worked in good faith to try to \ncome up with a solution. As I stated several times this morning, I do \nnot believe he has been successful in that regard.\n  I am not able to support the bill.\n  I think there is a lot of confusion that has surrounded our debate \nhere on the floor. As to the whole notion that the Governors are \nfearful that waste would wind up remaining in their States if they did \nnot drop this take title provision, I can say if they are worried that \nwaste will remain, they have good grounds to be worried because it is \ngoing to remain in their States. Under current law, and under this \nlegislation, if this legislation becomes law, the waste will remain in \ntheir States. The only question is, who is going to have ownership and \nresponsibility for that waste.\n  We had proposed that the Department of Energy be given ownership and \nresponsibility. We believe that would, if anything, desensitize the \nDepartment to move ahead more quickly on Yucca Mountain. I believe that \nis clearly the case.\n  The notion that anybody who opposes this bill is going to have to \nexplain why they want waste to remain in their States is not the issue \non which we are voting. Waste is going to remain in each of the States \nwhere it is now located unless and until we get the Yucca Mountain site \ncharacterized. I hope we do that quickly. I am doing all I can to \nsupport doing that quickly. I believe the waste should be moved to a \npermanent repository. I think that is clearly where we need to head. \nBut the notion that this problem is going to be somehow solved by \npassing this bill is just not supported by anything. There is no logic \nto that.\n  We can pass this bill. This bill can be signed by the President. You \ncan wind up 5 years from now trying to explain to people in your State \nwhy the waste is still sitting there because it is going to be there in \n5 years regardless.\n  I think people need to understand that there is much less here than \nmeets the eye. As far as this legislation is concerned, anyone who \nthinks this legislation is going to put any problem behind them is \ngoing to be sorely disappointed down the road. In fact, I think the \nproblems will be compounded if we enact this legislation and it were to \nbecome law.\n\n  I urge colleagues to oppose the bill and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Under the previous \norder, the hour of 11 a.m. having arrived, the substitute amendment, \nNo. 2808, is agreed to.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the bill, as amended, \npass? The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Prior to permanent closure of the geologic repository \n     in Yucca Mountain, Congress must determine whether the spent \n     fuel in the repository should be treated as waste subject to \n     permanent burial or should be\n\n[[Page S578]]\n\n     considered an energy resource that is needed to meet future \n     energy requirements.\n       (b) Future use of nuclear energy may require construction \n     of a second geologic repository unless Yucca Mountain can \n     safely accommodate additional spent fuel. Improved spent fuel \n     strategies may increase the capacity of Yucca Mountain.\n       (c) Prior to construction of any second permanent geologic \n     repository, the nation's current plans for permanent burial \n     of spent fuel should be re-evaluated.\n\n     SEC. 302. OFFICE OF SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is hereby established an Office \n     of Spent Nuclear Fuel Research within the Office of Nuclear \n     Energy Science and Technology of the Department of Energy. \n     The Office shall be headed by the Associate Director, who \n     shall be a member of the Senior Executive Service appointed \n     by the Director of the Office of Nuclear Energy Science and \n     Technology, and compensated at a rate determined by \n     applicable law.\n       (b) Associate Director.--The Associate Director of the \n     Office of Spent Nuclear Fuel Research shall be responsible \n     for carrying out an integrated research, development, and \n     demonstration program on technologies for treatment, \n     recycling, and disposal of high-level nuclear radioactive \n     waste and spent nuclear fuel, subject to the general \n     supervision of the Secretary. The Associate Director of the \n     Office shall report to the Director of the Office of Nuclear \n     Energy Science and Technology. The first such Associate \n     Director shall be appointed within 90 days of the enactment \n     of the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2000.\n       (c) Grant and Contract Authority.--In carrying out his \n     responsibilities under this section, the Secretary may make \n     grants, or enter into contracts, for the purposes of the \n     research projects and activities described in (d)(2).\n       (d) Duties.--(1) The Associate Director of the Office shall \n     involve national laboratories, universities, the commercial \n     nuclear industry, and other organizations to investigate \n     technologies for the treatment, recycling, and disposal of \n     spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.\n       (2) The Associate Director of the Office shall--\n       (A) develop a research plan to provide recommendations by \n     2015;\n       (B) identify promising technologies for the treatment, \n     recycling, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level \n     radioactive waste;\n       (C) conduct research and development activities for \n     promising technologies;\n       (D) ensure that all activities include as key objectives \n     minimization of proliferation concerns and risk to the health \n     of the general public or site workers, as well as development \n     of cost-effective technologies;\n       (E) require research on both reactor- and accelerator-based \n     transmutation systems;\n       (F) require research on advanced processing and \n     separations;\n       (G) ensure that research efforts with this Office are \n     coordinated with research on advanced fuel cycles and \n     reactors conducted within the Office of Nuclear Energy \n     Science and Technology.\n       (e) Report.--The Associate Director of the Office of Spent \n     Nuclear Fuel Research shall annually prepare and submit a \n     report to the Congress on the activities and expenditures of \n     the Office that discusses progress being made in achieving \n     the objectives of subsection (b).\n\n                  TITLE IV--GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS\n\n     SEC. 401. DECOMMISSIONING PILOT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The Secretary is authorized to \n     establish a Decommissioning Pilot Program to decommission and \n     decontaminate the sodium-cooled fast breeder experimental \n     test-site reactor located in northwest Arkansas.\n       (b) Funding.--No funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund may be \n     used for the Decommissioning Pilot Program.\n\n     SEC. 402. REPORTS.\n\n       (a) The Secretary is directed to report within 90 days from \n     enactment of this Act regarding all alternatives available to \n     Northern States Power Company and the Federal Government \n     which would allow Northern States Power Company to operate \n     the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant until the end of \n     the term of its current Nuclear Regulatory Commission \n     licenses, assuming existing State and Federal laws remain \n     unchanged.\n       (b) Within six months of enactment of this Act, the General \n     Accounting Office is directed to report back to the Senate \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the House \n     Committee on Commerce on the potential economic impacts to \n     Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and \n     Michigan ratepayers should the Prairie Island Nuclear \n     Generating Plant cease operations once it has met its State-\n     imposed storage limitation, including the costs of new \n     generation, decommissioning costs, and the costs of continued \n     operation of onsite storage of spent nuclear fuel storage.\n\n     SEC. 403. SEPARABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act, or the application of such \n     provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be \n     invalid, the remainder of this Act, or the application of \n     such provision to persons or circumstances other than those \n     as to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected \n     thereby.\n\n     SEC. 404. FAST FLUX TEST FACILITY.\n\n       Any spent nuclear fuel associated with the Fast Flux Test \n     Facility at the Hanford Reservation shall be transported and \n     stored at the repository site as soon as practicable after \n     the Commission has authorized the construction of the \n     repository.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I certainly want to accommodate the \nSenator from Massachusetts. I would like to take a moment to thank some \nof the people who have worked on this legislation.\n  I take this opportunity to, first of all, compliment the professional \nstaff who prepared a good deal of the material for the debate we just \nconcluded. Andrew Lundquist, who is pretty much the general on the \nEnergy Committee as the chief of staff of the Energy Committee, worked \nvery hard. He had a little difficulty because his wife had a baby in \nthe middle of the debate--a little girl, who joins three young \nbrothers. But I do thank Andrew.\n  Colleen Deegan, who is on my right, we would not have been able to \nget as far as we had without her. Other committee staff who helped or \nothers who did not create too many problems are Kelly Johnson, Kristin \nPhillips, Bryan Hannigan, David Dye, Betty Nevitt, Jim Beirne--who sat \nhere an extended period of time--and Bob Simon and Sam Fowler from the \nminority. The departed staff member who worked on this for about 5 \nyears is Karen Hunsicker, who worked on it until the end of last year.\n  While Senator Bingaman and I could not agree to resolve all the \nissues, I compliment him and his staff for working to try to reach an \naccord on the issue.\n  I think it is unfortunate we could not bring the administration \naboard in a responsible manner, either taking title or without taking \ntitle. It is clear this matter will not be resolved on the watch of the \nClinton administration. I suspect the Vice President's attitude on this \nshould be known by the public as the campaign progresses.\n  But nevertheless, I thank my two colleagues from Nevada for the \nmanner in which they nobly represented the interests of their State. \nThat is very important around here. As they know, Senator Stevens and I \nhave often tried to convince this body that those of us who are elected \nfrom an individual State really have the best interests of that State \nat heart. For the most part, the Members I think should be very \nsensitive of that fact. That was evidenced in the vote today.\n  I would like to make one assumption, that where we ended up is where \nwe ended up the last time on this. Although Senator McCain was not \nhere, we can assume he would have voted with us.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Kennedy was not here.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Of course, Senator Kennedy was not here.\n  While there were a few changes, we ended up just about where we were \nthe last time. As far as I am concerned, this matter has to rest with \nthe administration for a solution. The Senator from Alaska will not be \nbanging his head against the door to try to solve this Nation's nuclear \nwaste problem until we get from the administration a program that \nsuggests they are going to address the problem with a resolve.\n  Again, I thank all of those who were involved in the debate. I wish \nyou all a good day as we lament on the reality of this last vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I appreciate the recognition, but I do not \nwant to deprive the Senator from Nevada speaking if he wants a brief \nmoment to follow up.\n  How much time does the Senator wish?\n\n[[Page S579]]\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. If the good Senator would yield for a minute?\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to yield for 1 \nminute to the Senator and that then the floor would be returned to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I wish to respond to the gracious statement by the chairman of the \nEnergy Committee. Although we have had strong differences on this \nissue, the differences have been professional, not personal. He has \nbeen very professional in the way in which he has handled this matter. \nHe has extended us every courtesy. I appreciate that. I think his \nconduct and deportment reflect the highest traditions of the Senate. I \npublicly acknowledge that. Even though, in combat, we were forceful in \nour advocacy, as was he, this is something that is intensely personal \nto us. The Senator understands that. But I do thank him very much for \nhis graciousness and professionalism.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S579-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S579-S582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as we approach the budget debate this year, \nI think it is important for us to take a moment ahead of time to think \nabout the broad outline of what we spend money on and also what we do \nnot spend money on--how we allocate the priorities of this budget--\nbecause the budget is, after all, the most concrete, clearest \nexpression of the priorities and intentions of the Congress.\n  I would like to walk through that for a moment, if I can, and then \nmake a proposal to my colleagues, which I hope might, in the context of \nthis year's surplus and the choices we face, be attractive.\n  The reality is, of the $1.8 trillion we will spend this year, the \nlargest single expense, as we all know, goes to Social Security. The \nFederal Government is going to spend $400 billion or 22 percent of the \nFederal budget on monthly retirement and disability payments for about \n45 million Americans who are either senior citizens or disabled.\n  The second largest commitment will be made to Medicare, nearly $220 \nbillion or 12 percent of the Federal budget, ensuring that virtually \nevery individual over the age of 65 receives health insurance benefits \ncovering hospitalization, physician services, home health care, limited \nnursing home care, and laboratory tests, and providing health benefits \nto roughly 5 million disabled people.\n  In those two expenditures alone, we have spent a little over one-\nthird of our budget on Social Security and Medicare. Of the remaining \n$1.2 trillion of that budget, we will spend $115 billion or about 6.5 \npercent of the budget on Medicaid. Those are, obviously, the health \ncare benefits we provide to the least able to afford health insurance. \nIn addition, we will spend about $110 billion or a little over 6 \npercent of the budget on Federal, civilian, and military retirement and \ndisability benefits as well as veterans benefits.\n  When you throw in the other mandatory entitlement programs--such as \nfoster care, unemployment compensation, farm price supports, food \nstamps, and supplemental security income, which is, as everybody knows, \nan income safety net for the poorest people in America--we then reach \nover $1 trillion in Federal spending.\n  This year, of the $1.8 trillion Federal budget, over $1 trillion will \ngo towards the mandatory entitlement programs that, while vitally \nimportant, are on autopilot. We are not going to make individual \njudgments about them except to the degree we decide we need to shore up \nthe Medicare program or shore up the Social Security program. They are \nbasically on autopilot in terms of their existence. The consensus of \nthe Congress wants them; the country wants them. We support them. They \ndon't need to be renewed, and they don't need to be reauthorized. They \nobviously are not appropriated on an annual basis.\n  When we talk about the budget that we, as Members of Congress, are \ngoing to be dealing with in terms of discretionary spending, where we \nwill make long-term investments, where we have some flexibility, we are \ndealing with about $800 billion.\n  All of us understand what happens very quickly to that remaining \nportion of the budget, to those $800 billion. Two hundred twenty-four \nbillion or 12 percent of the Federal budget will go almost immediately \nto interest payments on the national debt. We are grateful that having \nreached the point of having a surplus, and with the President's \nproposal, we can see an end to the payments of interest on the national \ndebt by the year 2013. But for the moment, 12 percent of the Federal \nbudget this year is going to go to pay interest on the national debt. \nThose payments are not optional.\n  Putting that spending aside, we are now left with about one-third of \nthe overall Federal budget or $600 billion which we now can use to \ncover all other Government functions. But that disappears very quickly. \nTwo hundred eighty-three billion of that budget will be spent on \nnational defense this year, nearly 16 percent of the Federal budget. \nAnother 2.5 percent of the budget will be spent building highways, \nchanneling harbors, financing mass transit, all to a cost of about $45 \nbillion this year. Then you factor in housing assistance, nutrition \nprograms, at a cost of about $42 billion, that is another 12 plus \npercent of the budget. And less than 2 percent of all the budget will \ngo to health research, public health programs, searching for a cure to \ncancer, for HIV-AIDS, licensing new drugs for the marketplace, programs \nto attack teen smoking, services for the mentally ill.\n\n  One and a half percent of the budget will go to crime control, \nputting cops on the street, fighting drug trafficking, and barely 1 \npercent of the budget will go to foreign aid. Many Americans labor \nunder the perception that somehow foreign aid is this vast proportion \nof the Federal budget. In fact, foreign aid is a significantly less \npercentage and real expenditure than it was under Ronald Reagan. I \nthink we spent two or three times as much under Ronald Reagan in \nforeign affairs than we are spending today, which, I might add, is \nparticularly ironic when you measure the changes in the world and the \nneed for the United States to be more involved, not less involved, in a \nworld that is increasingly globalizing and where we are all feeling the \nimpact and forces of technology.\n  The point I make to my colleagues today: For what most people agree \nis the single most important investment we can make in America, there \nis precious little money remaining. How many of my colleagues in the \nlast years, recognizing the impact of the technology revolution, have \ncome to the floor emphasizing the importance of education in America? \nWe reap the benefits and the deficits of our attention to education in \na thousand different ways. When Senators come to the floor and talk \nabout the increasing problem of children having children, babies being \nborn out of wedlock, the number of kids in America who are at risk, we \nshould be directly examining how many of our schools stay open into the \nevening, how many of our schools have afterschool programs. How many of \nour schools don't even have an ability to be able to track children who \nare truant?\n  It used to be that in the United States of America there was an ethic \nthat when children were not showing up in school, the truant officer \nwent out and found the kids. We did something about it. Today, you can \nbe a kid in school and not show up and nobody even stops to wonder what \nhappened. In too many schools in America they may not even contact what \nis too often a single parent and find out whether that single parent \nmight have had time to be able to be aware that their kid might not be \nin school or what they might have time or ability to be able to do \nabout it.\n  I don't raise this issue of spending to try to disparage the other \nbudget priorities. I think they are all priorities. I vote for them. I \nsupport them. I think everybody in the Senate understands the \nimportance of all of the things I listed. We have built up a very real \nbipartisan consensus on the importance of most of these investments.\n\n[[Page S580]]\n\n  But why is it that in the year 2000, after years of talking about \neducation's importance and education reform, we are so absent a \nconsensus in this institution on the need to be investing in \ncommunities that have no tax base with which to improve the school \nsystem? Ninety percent of America's children go to school in public \nschools. We waste more time on the floor of the Senate debating some \nalternative to public schools, such as vouchers or charters, rather \nthan figuring out how we are going to fix the public school system and \ninvest in it properly so those 90 percent of our children have a place \nto grow up properly and share in the virtues of this new world that \nAmerica is increasingly witnessing and even playing a critical role in \ndeveloping.\n  Every one of us meets with the extraordinary creative energy of the \nnew technology community of this Nation. We have remarkable people \ndoing remarkable things. We have companies that have built up more \nwealth faster than at any time in the history of this Nation. But there \nis an enormous gap for those companies in their capacity to grow over \nthe coming years. Every chief executive of every technology company in \nour Nation will tell us again and again and again that their greatest \nrestraint on growth is the lack of an available skilled labor pool. \nThere are some 370,000 jobs going wanting today in the technology \nfield.\n  (Mr. ROBERTS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KERRY. We are going to debate in Congress whether we are going to \nexpand visas to bring immigrants from other countries to fill the jobs \na properly educated young American ought to be able to fill or would \nwant to fill if they had the opportunity to be able to do so. I think \nit is important to point out that out of a $1.8 trillion Federal \nbudget, we are spending a relatively tiny amount of money to empower \nlocal communities to improve student achievement, to support teacher \nand administrator training, to help finance and encourage State, \ndistrict, and school reforms, to recruit teachers, to fix failing \nschools, and to provide children the extra help they need to meet the \nchallenging academic standards that are needed to make it in today's \nworld.\n  Let me speak quickly to the teacher situation, Mr. President. For 3 \nyears now, some of us have been coming to the floor of the Senate to \nwarn our colleagues and America of our need to hire 2 million new \nteachers in the next 10 years. Why do we need to hire 2 million? \nBecause we lose 40 percent of the new teachers in the first 3 years; \nbecause the schools are in such disarray, they have burnout in a mere 3 \nyears, or they find the support systems are so inadequate they don't \nwant to continue to teach. But we are also losing them because we have \na whole generation of teachers reaching retirement age and we need to \nrenew the teaching profession.\n  Ask any kid in college today: Do you want to go teach? How many kids \nplan to go teach in today's world? I read in the newspapers yesterday \nthat the starting salary for an associate in a major law firm in Boston \nor New York is now equivalent to the salary of a Senator--about \n$140,000 a year. That is what you get the day you get out of law school \nand go to work for a large law firm.\n  If you want to, coming out of college today--and most kids need to \nbecause the average student gets out of college with about $50,000 to \n$100,000 worth of loans--they can look to go into some dot-com company \nwhere they can earn $60,000 or $70,000 within the first year or so of \nemployment. What does a teacher get--$21,000, $22,000 a year? And after \n15 years of teaching, when you have broken through and gotten your \nmaster's degree, you can get into the midthirties or high thirties. In \nsome school districts, you may break into the forties. You can wind up \nan entire career of teaching and be earning maybe somewhere in the low \nfifties, high fifties, and very few districts hit the sixties. How do \nyou attract anybody, under those circumstances, to do what we pretend \nis the most valued profession one can undertake--teaching.\n  So this year we are going to spend a grand total of slightly over $19 \nbillion for all elementary and secondary education initiatives--or just \nbarely over 1 percent of the $1.8 trillion Federal budget. When we hear \nour esteemed budget committee leaders talk about the great commitment \non the part of Congress or the Federal Government toward improving \neducation, I ask people to remember that what we are talking about is 1 \npercent of that Federal budget. We put so much more money into the back \nend of life in America, whether it is through Medicare or through \nSocial Security, or just dying in a hospital--I hate to say it, but, \ntragically, in the last 2 weeks of life in America. We spend so much \nmore at the back end of life than we invest when the brain is \ndeveloping and it is in the most important stage of life.\n  Not one scientist will fail to document that what a human being will \nbe--their capacity to think, their capacity to socialize, their \ncapacity to be able to learn and to be a full participant in society--\nis 95 percent determined in the first 3 years of life. And we invest a \nfraction of a percentage of our budget to guarantee that children are \nsafe and nurtured and, indeed, given the opportunities to have the \nmaximum amount of brain development and opportunity for safety in those \nstages.\n  Our young people pull in about a penny on every dollar in terms of \nthe investment priorities of the U.S. Congress. The National Center for \nEducational Statistics reports that the Federal Government provided 8.4 \npercent of total expenditures for elementary and secondary education \nfrom 1970 to 1971. It was 9.2 percent from 1980 to 1981. Yet last year \nwe provided only 6.1 percent. The school population goes up, the demand \ngoes up, but the commitment of the U.S. Congress, in total terms, goes \ndown.\n  Let me put this in a different perspective, if I may. Let me compare \nthe cost of investing in our children to the cost of some of our \nrecently enacted tax provisions. In 1997, the President proposed, and \nCongress agreed, to create a new capital gains exclusion on home sales. \nToday, a homeowner can exclude from tax up to $500,000 of the capital \ngain from the sale of a principal residence. Obviously, we all agree \nthat exempting the sale of a home from capital gains taxation is a good \nthing, and I am for that. Calculating the capital gain from the sale of \na home is perhaps one of the most complex tasks a typical taxpayer \nfaces because they have to keep detailed records of transactions on \nhome improvements, they have to draw distinctions between improvements \nthat add to the home's basis and repairs that don't. But what does it \nsay about our national priorities--that the cost of exempting up to \n$500,000 of gain on the sale of a home will cost the Federal Government \n$18.5 billion this year. We are going to give up $18.5 billion of our \nrevenue because we have decided it is important to reflect this \n``priority.'' That is almost exactly the amount of money we spend as a \nnation on all elementary and secondary education.\n\n  Mr. President, I think that is a disturbing budget reality, and it is \nan incontrovertible fact, which I believe requires us to try to \nreconcile with the current demands we face from millions of Americans, \nwhether they are parents, teachers, or business leaders, all of whom \nare asking us to help improve the schools of this Nation.\n  Now, I point this out because I believe now, when we enjoy the \ngreatest economic expansion in the history of our Nation, we have an \nopportunity to lay the foundation for a new era in America. It is an \nopportunity to fix our schools, to increase their accountability, to \nrecruit more and better teachers, and to reduce the average class size. \nI share with my Republican colleagues the desire to guarantee that we \nhave a new accountability in the school systems. I believe we can reach \na consensus and achieve that. But it must be done by some commitment of \nadditional resources in order to allow the reformers at the local level \nto empower their States and local school districts to be able to turn \ntheir schools around.\n  Under the CBO's most recent estimates, the on-budget surplus--that \nis, the non-Social Security surplus--will amount to somewhere between \n$800 billion and nearly $2 trillion. I believe their most conservative \nestimate is probably the better place for us to start. That \nconservative estimate assumes that spending will continue to\n\n[[Page S581]]\n\nincrease at the rate of inflation. It assumes the continuation of \nemergencies, such as droughts in the Midwest and hurricanes on the east \ncoast. It even assumes the continuation of unlikely events such as a \ndecennial census every year--when we all know that expense occurs only \nonce every 10 years.\n  I ask my colleagues to focus on the fact we are not talking about \njust Social Security now. We are assuming that the Social Security \nsurplus is locked up, as it ought to be and as we wanted it to be. But \nwe must decide to dedicate a portion of these surpluses towards the \nappropriate investment priorities of the Nation. Yes, that includes \nMedicare reform and putting it on solid footing. Yes, it includes a \nprescription drug benefit to help people pay the extraordinary costs of \nprescription drugs. We should dedicate a portion of that surplus \ntowards debt reduction so we can keep reducing interest rates, and \nreduce the future interest obligations and extend the virtuous cycle of \nfiscal discipline which is at the heart of our economic expansion. Yes, \nwe ought to pass some targeted tax cuts for middle-income families--\nsuch as the marriage penalty, estate tax relief, and an increase in the \nstandard deduction. We can do those things.\n  We can also reserve an appropriate amount of money for the education \nof our young people--to raise that education to the level of rhetoric, \nto the level of campaigning, and to the level of debate that has \nexisted in the Congress in the past years. I think the Congress has a \nunique opportunity this year to tell America that our young people at \nthose critical stages of development are worth more than one penny on \nthe dollar.\n  I intend to introduce a 21st century early learning and education \ntrust fund. This legislation would set aside 20 percent of the most \nconservative CBO estimate of the on-budget surplus over the next 10 \nyears only. I believe, with all of the debate on both sides of how to \nraise student achievement and reform public education, about the \ngrowing acknowledgment on both sides that reform costs money, that we \nshould at the very least take a step that locks up a portion of the \nbudget surplus and dedicate this money to early learning, and to \neducation as a whole, where the country gets the greatest return on \ninvestment. Almost every analysis suggests that for $1 put into \neducation at that stage, a minimum of $6 is returned to the Federal \ncoffers over the course of the next years in one way or another.\n  My proposal would set aside $2.2 billion this year, $30 billion over \n5 years, and nearly $170 billion over 10 years for education, for early \nlearning, for childhood interventions, which will make a difference in \nbuilding the fabric of families. That will help us break the cycle of \nchildren having children out of wedlock. That will help us solve the \nproblem of parents who do not have time to be parents and be with their \nchildren in those critical hours of the afternoon when most kids get \ninto trouble.\n  It will literally turn around the fabric building of our own Nation \nand ultimately provide us with an educated workforce that has the \nability to continue the extraordinary economic growth we experienced \nthese last years, as well as, I might add, empower us to be able to \nguarantee that a citizenry that grows up in a world of more information \nhas the skills and capacities to be able to manage that information \nand, indeed, contribute to the wise decisionmaking--the wise choosing \nof policies in a world that will become increasingly more virtual, more \ncapable of making faster decisions with more information being thrown \nat people and people trying to discern the truth for themselves. As \nThomas Jefferson and George Washington, the Founding Fathers of this \ncountry, understood, nothing is as important as that effort of \nguaranteeing that your citizenry is educated.\n  The funds that would be held by the education trust fund could be \nused--and only used--to finance legislation to approve the quality of \nearly learning through secondary education above the current inflation-\nadjusted baseline. Eligible uses include but would not be limited to \nprograms and reforms authorized under the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act and the Head Start Act. Trust fund expenditures would \nhave to traverse the normal budget process.\n\n  If Congress were unable to agree on how to use trust fund revenue or \nif Congress simply doesn't commit enough resources to trigger the use \nof the trust fund, the trust fund assets would be carried over to the \nnext year. The trust fund would work similar to the Social Security \ntrust fund. On paper, those assets would carry forward to the next \nfiscal year. In reality, unspent funds would be used to pay down the \npublic debt.\n  Trust fund revenue would not be available for anything other than \nthese education specifics. Appropriators could not tap those trust fund \nmoneys for sugar subsidies, for pet projects, or for other related \npurposes. Tax writers could not tap into trust fund money to pay for \nspecial interest tax breaks. But tax writers could use the trust fund \nmoney for education purposes ranging from school construction bonds to \nany other number of priorities on which the Congress could reach \nconsensus. In effect, the trust fund would create a budgetary firewall \nprotecting our national commitment to young people for early learning \nand education generally.\n  I have strong views about how some of that money might be best spent. \nBut that is a debate for a different day. The question before us, as we \nthink about the budget as a whole, particularly since it is the first \nbudget of the new millennium, is, What is our commitment as a nation to \neducation? Are we satisfied that one penny per dollar less than we used \nto commit under Ronald Reagan and less than we used to commit under \nRichard Nixon is currently being committed by the Federal Government \nfor the purpose of building the future fabric of this Nation? I don't \nthink I am alone in believing that surplus funds ought to be used to \nsome degree in some manner for these education expenses.\n  In the State of the Union Address, the President pledged to increase \nour commitment to the Nation's education system by using surplus funds. \nIn fact, his fiscal year 2001 budget requests an increase in \ndiscretionary spending for $5.7 billion for elementary and secondary \neducation. I wholeheartedly support that critical increase. But I know \nand you know, Mr. President, and all of us in this Congress know that \nif we put together the proper structure that requires accountability \nthat changes the relationships that currently exist in our public \neducation system, that embrace choice, competition, accountability; \nthat if we unleash the capacity of our school systems to be the best \nthey can be, whether it means adopting the best of a charter school, \nthe best of a parochial school, the best of a private school, the best \nof the best public schools, we have the ability in this Congress to \nfind a way to guarantee that local communities embrace real concepts of \nreform. But none of those concepts can be properly implemented without \nsome commitment of resources for communities that have no tax base and \nno ability to fund those systems through the property tax.\n  This is our mission, and $5 billion is not enough to fix our schools, \nor to guarantee a qualified teacher in every classroom, or to provide \nstudents with meaningful afterschool programs.\n\n  I am not suggesting a Federal mandate. I am not suggesting the long \narm of Washington reaching in and telling people how to do it. To the \ncontrary. I am suggesting that we leverage the capacity of local \ndistricts to make those choices for themselves. If we don't tell them \nhow to get there as true fiscal watchdogs looking over our taxpayers' \ndollars, we will look on the back end to see they did get where they \nsaid they were trying to go. If we in this body intend to make \neducation a top priority and work for serious reform, we have to \nguarantee children have access to those things that will contribute to \ntheir education's success.\n  I have never been able to reconcile in the Senate how it is that we \nare so ready to augment the expenses for the juvenile justice system, \nbuild new prisons and house people for the rest of their life for \n$35,000 to $75,000 a year, but we are unwilling to invest $35,000 a \nyear to keep them out of those prisons and to provide them with a set \nof other choices when it matters the most. That, it seems to me, is the \nobligation of this country. The American people want funding for \neducation increases. The American people in community\n\n[[Page S582]]\n\nafter community know they can't take any more on the property tax \nburden. Seniors who want to live out their years in the house they paid \nfor can't see the property tax go up. Young families with a fixed \nstream of income who bought into their first home can't see the \nproperty tax go up. However, we fund our education system as if we were \nstill the agrarian society which set up the entire structure for \nproperty tax in the first place.\n  Our obligation is to find a way to release the creative energies and \nlearning capacities of our Nation. If we were to find a bipartisan \nconsensus and reach across the aisle to end this wasted debate about \nsaving a few kids rather than saving all of the kids, it seems to me we \nwould have the ability in the Congress to achieve something that would \ntruly be a long and lasting legacy. It would be a great beginning for \nthis millennium.\n  Education is the No. 1 issue in America. It deserves more than a \npenny, a dollar. That, it seems to me, is the mission we should embark \non over the course of these next months.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before we do go to a vote on the motion, I \nwant to have a colloquy with the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma. \nThe vote then on the motion will occur immediately following this \ncolloquy, which should not take very long. Then the vote on the two \nnominees will not occur before 1:45 p.m. It may be later than that; I \nemphasize that.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma may want to talk for a while, and others \nmay want to comment on this. We want to accommodate, as we always do, \nSenators who wish to be heard on important nominations. I yield the \nfloor to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for yielding \nto me.\n  Last year, at the end of the session, I came to the floor and \ninformed the White House, as well as my colleagues, that of a list of \n13 proposed appointments, 8 were acceptable. I did this by checking \nwith my colleagues to find out who would be placing holds on which of \nthose 13 nominees. There were five that would have had holds on them.\n  I further stated that if anyone other than the eight were appointed, \nI would put a hold on all judicial nominations for the 2nd session of \nthe 106th Congress. This policy was the result of an exchange of \nletters with the administration last summer in which the White House \nagreed to provide a list of potential recess appointments prior to \nadjournment so that the Senate could act on these appointments and \navoid contentious action on recess appointments. The 8 to which I \nagreed were from a list of 13 that was provided by the White House, and \nI read those into the Record.\n  On December 9 the White House gave a recess appointment to Stuart \nWeisberg to the OSHA Review Commission, and on December 17 the White \nHouse gave a recess appointment to Sarah Fox to the National Labor \nRelations Board. They were not on the list of 13 that was received on \nNovember 18 and to which I referred on November 19. Based on these \nactions, I believe the White House violated their commitment by making \nthese recess appointments. Therefore, I said I would put a hold on \nevery judicial nomination this year. I believe this is the correct \nreaction to the action taken by the White House.\n\n[[Page S583]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. First of all, I appreciate sincerely the efforts of the \nSenator from Oklahoma to limit the recess appointment power of the \nExecutive. Over a period of years, Executives of both parties have \nprobably abused this authority. It is one that has been used by \nPresident Bush, President Reagan, as well as President Carter and \nPresident Clinton. I know in the past Senator Byrd, as a matter of \nfact, worked on this area of concern of the Senate and worked out an \nagreement, with the cooperation, as I recall, of Senator Dole and \nPresident Reagan, who was in the White House at that time.\n  Because of the Senator's concern and insistence about this matter, my \ncolleagues will recall that last year, once again, we went through a \nprocess that led to a similar agreement in writing between the Senate \nand this President about how these recess appointments would be \nhandled. It is important that we make every effort to live up to the \nletter of that agreement, as well as the spirit.\n  I emphasize that Senator Inhofe has already helped in bringing that \nabout. There is no doubt in my mind that his efforts and his comments \nlast year and this year had an impact on the number of recess \nappointments with which the administration did, in fact, go forward.\n  I know for sure--in fact, the President indicated as much to me--that \nthey had wanted to do more, but they showed restraint and they realized \nthat it could cause even more serious problems. So he has had an \nimpact, there is no question about that. It is very helpful.\n  Indeed, Senator Inhofe did inform me of his intentions last November \nbefore he made his speech on the floor--I remember, I walked over to \nthis area and talked with him. I admit, I was dealing with a lot of \ndifferent issues at the time and perhaps should have paid a little bit \nmore attention to exactly the exchange that was occurring and the lists \nthat were being discussed--after I had shared with him the list of \npossible recess appointees provided by the White House on November 19 \nin compliance with a similar Byrd-Reagan agreement. There is no \nquestion his memory of that discussion and his efforts did take place, \nand I appreciate that.\n\n  As majority leader, I must also say I worked with the White House to \nlimit their use of these recess appointments through these negotiations \nboth now and in the past. I am quick to say, on more than one occasion \nI thought they made a mistake and I told them so. I remember one \nambassadorial appointment in particular.\n  On many occasions, we have been able to resolve differences. With \nregard to the appointment of a person during the recess, sometimes \nthere were problems, but concerns were worked out after further \nconsideration. I do acknowledge that they have worked on a regular \nbasis with me as majority leader and with my staff when I have been \nabsent and in my own State or in other States.\n  I have great sympathy for the Senator's plan to object to these \njudicial nominations. I have said before, I am not one who gets all \nweepy-eyed about having more Federal judges of any kind anywhere. \nHowever, as majority leader, I must take some other factors into \naccount.\n  Using the Sarah Fox example, she had previously been confirmed to a \nposition on the NLRB by a vote of the full Senate. I believe she would \nhave been confirmed to a full term if her nomination were brought to \nthe floor of the Senate again. It probably would have eventually \nbecause, in this case, it is not a judicial nomination.\n  If the Chair will excuse me and my colleagues a moment of \npartisanship, I hope to have a Republican in the White House next year \nto succeed President Clinton. So, therefore, I hope this Republican \nwill be able to name a majority of the members of boards and \ncommissions as soon as possible. I did not want Sarah Fox serving a \nfull NLRB term, which would have extended until 2004. I thought a 1-\nyear appointment allowing, then, for her to be replaced by the next \nPresident--whichever party that President may be from--made some sense.\n\n  Maybe that contributed to a violation of the letter or the spirit of \nthe agreement, but it was after a lot of discussion with colleagues on \nour side of the aisle. I thought it made sense to go ahead and do that.\n  I am also concerned very much about the Senate getting into the \npossibility of filibustering judicial nominations. It is a bad \nprecedent. The Senate has generally not done that. Once again, I hope \nwe will be having nominations suggested by the Senator from Kansas next \nyear. I would be greatly concerned about the idea that a nomination \nwould be filibustered.\n  As a matter of fact, you may recall last year when the Democrats did \nfilibuster a nominee from Utah, I complained loudly that it was a \nmistake, should not be done. As you recall, the better part of judgment \nprevailed, and we backed away from that. We, in fact, confirmed that \nnominee. So that is another factor I have to inject.\n  I do not think we should or would be able to go all year without \nconfirming any nominees. Some of these nominees are good men and women. \nSome of them have already waited a long time. Some of them are \nsupported by Governors and Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and \nshould not be held.\n  In some of these States there truly is a need for more judges, as bad \nas that may sound to some of us. Florida is a State with a growing \ndocket of cases. Even hard-working Federal judges cannot cope with it.\n  So all of these are matters I have to consider as majority leader. It \nis one of those burdensome, delicate balances for which the majority \nleader has to assume the responsibility.\n  So based on that--my concern about how long these appointments would \nbe for; my feeling that, in fact, the White House did try to work with \nus; my feeling that we should not start filibustering these \nnominations--these and other concerns lead me to the conclusion that I \nwill honor a Senator's hold for a reasonable period of time and will \ncertainly honor a hold by the Senator from Oklahoma and will inform him \nwhen nominations will be brought to the floor so that he can take \nwhatever action he is compelled to take--and I will honor that also--\nbut, nevertheless, I think we should move forward and bring these \nnominees to a vote on the floor.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for yielding.\n  Mr. REID. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I do not believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader does have the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Chair.\n  I would be glad to yield. And then I will yield back to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma for his remarks.\n  Mr. REID. In addition to what has been said, I also think it is \nimportant to say that we have started this session off on a good note.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thanks to the efforts of the whip, we have made good \nprogress.\n  Mr. REID. We have gone through two very big, complicated pieces of \nlegislation: The bankruptcy bill, with over 300 amendments, and the \nnuclear waste bill, with the potential of well over 100 amendments. \nThose have gone through now.\n  I appreciate, commend, and applaud the leader for being a man of his \nword, as we knew he would be. I hope the Senator from Oklahoma, \nrecognizing how strongly he feels about the issue, would understand it \nis not only the State of Florida. In Nevada, we are four judges short. \nWe do not want the bandits to take over the town.\n\n  We appreciate very much the majority leader's efforts to move these \nfour. We hope the Senator from Oklahoma will understand the personal \nsituations in States such as Nevada, where we are desperate for new \njudges.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could comment briefly on that, I meant \nit sincerely when I said there has been good, hard work done on both \nsides of the aisle: Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch on the \nbankruptcy bill; Senator Murkowski, obviously, and others on the \nnuclear waste bill. But Senator Reid has done excellent work on his \nside of the aisle in helping us move this legislation through in a \npositive way.\n  The fact is, already this year we have passed bankruptcy reform; we \nhave passed a bill that would provide for a minimum wage increase and \ntax relief for small business men and women, and for a nuclear waste \nrepository. These\n\n[[Page S584]]\n\nare important issues. They are complicated and difficult to deal with \nsubstantively and politically. I think the Senate can feel good. I hope \nwe can continue to work our way through important issues and that we \nwill be able to do it as much as possible in a bipartisan way.\n  I yield further to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the majority leader.\n  I hate to interrupt this love-in, but I want an opportunity to \nexplain my actions. First of all, I want to say to the majority leader \nthat I appreciate his acknowledgement of the accuracy of what happened \non November 19. That is important to me. There have been some erroneous \nstatements made in various newspapers reflecting the existence of other \nlists, and all that.\n  The bottom line is this: We made a request, the list came forward, \nand 10 minutes before we adjourned on November 19 we read from the \nlist.\n  I believe there were strong reasons why the two particular nominees, \nWeisberg and Fox, would have been unacceptable. There are several \nSenators I have spoken with who would have found them unacceptable--\nfrankly, I am one of them--and who would have been placed holds on \nthose two individuals had they known that recess appointments were \nimminent. Some would have placed holds or at the very least insisted \nthat hearings be held to explore the important policy matters \nsurrounding these two appointments.\n  I think that is irrelevant. The fact is, the names were not on the \nNov. 19 list. If the names had been on that list, that would have been \ntotally different. Maybe some would have objected to them so they would \nnot have been brought forward. The point is, appointments were made, \nand they violated the statements and the intent of the letter that we \nreceived from the White House vowing to honor their commitment.\n  I say to the majority leader, it is my intention, if we go forward at \nsome point to vote on the two particular nominations to which you \nreferred, that I will want to be heard and go back and maybe talk a \nlittle bit about what happened to bring us to the point where we are \ntoday.\n  I add that the President is not keeping his commitments. I think when \nI read his letter there is no question in my mind. I made it abundantly \nclear on the floor what the consequences would be.\n  I say, also, that I am in a position, I say to the majority leader, \nthat while the President does not keep his commitments, I do keep my \ncommitments. My commitments are to do what I can to try to block \njudicial nominations.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. No, not now.\n  I just say this. In following through with my commitment to try to \nblock the confirmations, while it is not my intention--if the \nhandwriting is on the wall--to just arbitrarily lay down blanket \nfilibusters, I do intend to consult with my colleagues and reserve my \nrights under the rules to assess what actions, if any, can succeed in \nthis effort.\n  I want to make one other comment about this, too; that is, you hear a \nlot of yelling and screaming about: Oh, what are we going to do without \nthese appointments that we have to have? I remind you, back in 1993, at \nthe end of the Bush administration--he was ready to go out of office--\nthere were 109 vacancies in the Federal judiciary. In other words, the \nDemocratic controlled Congress failed to fill these vacancies.\n  Right now, there are 74 vacancies in the Federal judiciary. If you \ndetermine where we would be if normal history takes its course through \ndeaths or resignations, at the most there would be another 25 \nvacancies. That means, at the most, we would have about 100 vacancies \nat the end of President Clinton's term. Compare that to the 109 \nvacancies left after the Bush administration. I make that comment to \noffset the argument before it is made as to what type of judicial \ncrisis will come about if we ended up without judicial nominees being \nconfirmed.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  We have Senators who I believe are about to leave the Chamber. Are we \nready to put the question? And then we would go ahead with the debate \non the judges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nproceed to executive session to consider Executive Calendar No. 408, \nthe nomination of Thomas L. Ambro, of Delaware, to be United States \nCircuit Judge for the Third Circuit. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.

Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Georgia for a \ncouple of unanimous-consent requests.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. President, I ask consent at 2 p.m. today the Senate proceed to a \nvote on the confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 408. I further ask \nconsent that following that vote the Senate proceed to a vote on the \nconfirmation of Executive Calendar No. 410. I finally ask consent \nfollowing those votes the President immediately be notified of the \nSenate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to make a couple of \nstatements about the vote that just took place, the reason for it, the \nhistory behind it, where we are today, and where we are going from \nhere.\n  First of all, I suggest during the 5-day Memorial Day recess there \nwas a pending nominee on whom there had been several holds. It is my \nunderstanding the appropriate committee had not received the financial \ninformation on that individual and there were\n\n[[Page S585]]\n\nother problems that had been voiced that precipitated the holds. \nConsequently, during that 5-day Memorial Day recess, President Clinton \nwent ahead and granted him a recess appointment.\n  I think the majority leader was correct when he said there have been \nDemocrat Presidents as well as Republican Presidents who have made \nrecess appointments. Frankly, I do not think the Republicans should \nhave done it. I do not think the Democrats should have done it. If we \ngo back and read the Constitution on what recess appointments are all \nabout, we would see that back in the horse-and-buggy days when we would \nbe in session for just a few weeks every other year, and if there were \na death of a Secretary of State or something like that, it was \nnecessary to put ourselves in a position where the President would be \nable to fill that vacancy. That was the whole intent of recess \nappointments.\n  In 1985, President Reagan was making recess appointments because at \nthat time we had a conservative Republican President and we had a \nliberal Democrat-controlled Senate. Consequently, he wanted to get his \nconservatives passed, so he went ahead and made recess appointments. I \ndo not believe he should have made those appointments. I think that \ncontradicted the provisions in the Constitution. However, he did it \nanyway.\n  At that time, the minority leader, the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, did what was perfectly appropriate, and \nthat was to send a letter to the President to say: Before you violate \nthe constitutional prerogative of the Senate in its advise and consent \npower on any future recess appointments, I request a letter from you at \na time with sufficient notice before the recess goes into effect. I \nrequest that you notify the Senate of what recess appointments you are \nintending to make during that recess and why.\n  Sufficient notice was interpreted and vocalized several times by \nSenator Byrd to be adequate notice so we would know they were coming \nup, so we could go to Members and see if there were anyone who would \nwant to put a hold on a judicial or any kind of nominee during the \nrecess and have adequate time to act on it before recess. In the \nextreme case, I suppose we could have just gone into a pro forma \nsession and not gone into recess. Nevertheless, that is what he \nrequested from President Reagan. I might add, President Reagan did \nagree to that request. He sent a letter that was satisfactory to \nSenator Byrd, so that set the precedent.\n  Because of the recess appointments of this President, I merely did \nthe same thing Senator Byrd did back in 1985. I sent a letter, a \ncommunication to the White House, and I said: Because of your \nappointments, I am going to make the same request Senator Byrd made of \nPresident Reagan, with which President Reagan complied, and that is \nthat you notify us in advance of any appointments you plan to have. If \nnot, we will put holds on all appointments at that time--all \nnonmilitary nominees.\n  We did not get the letter for awhile. A few trial letters came over, \nbut they were not consistent with what President Reagan had agreed to. \nFinally, on June 15, 1999, President Clinton sent a letter that said:\n\n       I share your opinion that the understanding reached in 1985 \n     between President Reagan and Senator Byrd cited in your \n     letter remains a fair and constructive framework, which my \n     administration will follow.\n\n  He agreed to follow the same mandates President Reagan did. At that \ntime, I wrote a letter back praising the President for agreeing to \nabide by the same agreement as the Byrd-Reagan agreement. However, on \nNovember 10, as we approached our recess, I anticipated the President \nmight be tempted to make recess appointments that were not consistent \nwith that agreement. So I sent a letter to him that says:\n\n       If you do make recess appointments during the upcoming \n     recess which violate the spirit of our agreement--\n\n  Then I went into the details as to what the spirit was; there had to \nbe adequate notice on a list we could consider and pass around to our \ncolleagues--\n\n     then we will respond by placing holds on all judicial \n     nominees. The result would be a complete breakdown in \n     cooperation between our two branches of government on this \n     issue which could prevent the confirmation of any such \n     nominees next year. We do not want this to happen. We urge \n     you to cooperate in good faith with the Majority Leader \n     concerning all contemplated recess appointments.\n\n  That was signed by me and by 16 other Senators. Almost all, I \nbelieve--most of them, anyway--voted against the motion to proceed a \nfew minutes ago.\n  On November 17--I remember that well; it was my 65th birthday--I made \na speech on the floor, and in that speech, anticipating there could be \na misunderstanding of what our intent was, I said, on November 17, on \nthis floor, at this podium:\n\n       I want to make sure there is no misunderstanding and that \n     we don't go into a recess with the President not \n     understanding that we are very serious. . . . It is not just \n     me putting a hold on all judicial nominees for the remaining \n     year of his term, but 16 other Senators have agreed to do \n     that. . . . I want to make sure it is abundantly clear \n     without any doubt in anyone's mind in the White House--I will \n     refer back to this document I am talking about right now--\n     that in the event the President makes recess appointments, we \n     will put holds on all judicial nominations for the remainder \n     of his term. It is very fair for me to stand here and \n     eliminate any doubts in the President's mind of what we will \n     do.\n\n  That is exactly what we said on the floor, and I am going back now \nand reminding this body of that statement.\n  On November 19--that was the day we were going out of session on \nrecess, and it would be a lengthy recess going until January, the State \nof the Union time--the President notified the Senate of contemplated \nrecess appointments. This was in compliance with the intent of the \nletter.\n  I hasten to say here it is not quite in compliance because this is on \nthe day we are going into recess. But nonetheless, in the spirit of \ncooperation and fairness, we agreed to take this list and to read the \nlist and to go to our colleagues and see what names were on this list \nof 13 nominees whom he desired to appoint during the recess, and we \nfound there were 5 on the list who were unacceptable to some Members of \nthe Senate. So we sent back to him that communication, that there are 8 \nof them, and if there were any appointments other than these 8, that \nwould be in violation of the letter.\n  To reaffirm that, the majority leader was good enough to let me be \nthe last speaker on this floor, where I stood here 10 minutes before we \nwent into recess and I made a rather lengthy talk, of which I will just \nrepeat a little bit right now. I said:\n\n       If anyone other than these eight individuals is recess \n     appointed, we will put a hold on every single judicial \n     nominee of this President for the remainder of his term in \n     office. . . . I reemphasize, if there is some other \n     interpretation as to the meaning of the (Nov. 10) letter, it \n     does not make any difference, we are still going to put holds \n     on them. I want to make sure that there is a very clear \n     understanding: If these nominees come in, if he does violate \n     the intent (of the agreement) as we interpret it [by \n     appointing anyone other than these eight], then we will \n     have holds on [all judicial] nominees.\n\n  There was one individual about whom the majority leader came to me, \nright after that, after we went into recess. He said: You know, we made \na mistake, there was one other individual. Let's increase that to nine \npeople instead of eight.\n  I said: That's fine.\n  We sent a letter to the President dated November 23 that, in the \nspirit of cooperation, we are adding one name to the list:\n\n       I hope this makes our position clear. Any recess \n     appointments other than the nine listed above would \n     constitute a violation of the spirit of our agreement and \n     trigger multiple holds on all judicial nominees.\n\n  On December 7 we urged the White House not to violate the agreement. \nYet, we found that by December 17 the White House did, and President \nClinton did, in fact, violate the agreement directly and blatantly by \nappointing both Sarah Fox to the NLRB and Stuart Weisberg to the OSHA \nReview Commission.\n  It happens that both of these recess appointments that violated our \nagreement would have been objected to by a number of Senators, two of \nwhom are in this Chamber right now. However, that is not significant. \nThere are reasons we would have found that objectionable. But even if \nthey had been acceptable, it still violated the very specific agreement \nwe had.\n\n[[Page S586]]\n\n  On December 20, I stated:\n\n       I am announcing today that I will do exactly what I said I \n     would do if the President deliberately violated our \n     agreement.\n\n  And on January 25, 2000, I did just that. I placed a hold on all \njudicial nominees. On this Senate floor I said:\n\n       It was in anticipation of just such defiance--\n\n  I am talking about the President's defiance of the Senate's \nprerogative to advise and consent to nominees--\n\n       It was in anticipation of just such defiance that I and my \n     colleagues warned the President on at least five separate \n     occasions exactly what our response would be if he violated \n     this agreement. We would put a hold on all judicial nominees. \n     So today it will come as no surprise to the President that we \n     are putting a hold on all judicial nominees. We are simply \n     doing what we said we would do to uphold constitutional \n     respect for the Senate's proper role in the confirmation \n     process.\n\n  Today we have agreed--I did not agree, but we went ahead and agreed \nto bring up two nominees on which I did assert my prerogative and say \nwe are going to have rollcall votes on every nominee that does come up, \nand those rollcall votes are going to be taking place in about 15 \nminutes.\n  I say for those individuals who hysterically talked about the chaos \nthat would be created in the event we put holds on all nominees, and no \nnominees were, in fact, appointed by this President for the last year \nof his administration and confirmed by the Senate, if you go back and \nlook at what happened in January of 1993--that was the last month \nPresident Bush was in office--there were 109 vacancies in the \njudiciary. In other words, 109 vacancies that the then-Democrat-\ncontrolled Senate failed to act upon.\n  Today, there are 74 vacancies in the judiciary. In the event normal \nhistory takes its course and the normal number of either deaths or \nresignations take place, it will be not more than 25 more. In other \nwords, there will be approximately 100 vacancies at the end of \nPresident Clinton's term of office. That is still nine fewer than there \nwere at the end of President Bush's administration.\n  This is sad. We are in the process of giving up an opportunity, by \nvoting on some of these, for the first time in 7 years of this \nPresident's administration of holding him to his word. He has broken \nhis word over and over. He has told lies to the American people over \nand over, and to this body he has broken his commitment. What we are \ngiving up is our last and maybe only opportunity in 8 years to hold \nthis President to his commitment. What is going on today is very sad. I \ndeeply regret it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to commend the majority leader, \nSenator Lott, for proceeding today with votes for these two judicial \nnominees. We will continue to process the confirmations of nominees who \nare qualified to be Federal judges. In that respect, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee will hold its first nominations hearing of this \nsession on Tuesday, February 22, and I expect to see more judicial \nnominees moving through the process in the coming months. There is a \nperception held by some that the confirmation of judges stops in \nelection years. That perception is inaccurate, and I intend to move \nqualified nominees through the process during this session of Congress.\n  That said, in moving forward with the confirmations of judicial \nnominees, we must be mindful of problems we have with certain courts, \nparticularly the ninth circuit. In addition, the President must be \nmindful of the problems he creates when he nominates individuals who do \nnot have the support of their home-State Senators. In this regard, I \nmust say that it appears at times as if the President is seeking a \nconfrontation with the Senate on this issue, instead of working with \nthe Senate to see that his nominees are confirmed.\n  Last session, despite partisan rhetoric, the Judiciary Committee \nreported 42 judicial nominees, and the full Senate confirmed 34 of \nthese--a number comparable to the average of 39 confirmations for the \nfirst sessions of the past five Congresses, when vacancy rates were \ngenerally much higher. In total, the Senate has confirmed 338 of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees since he took office in 1993.\n  I am disturbed by some of the allegations that have been made that \nthe Senate's treatment of certain nominees differed based on their race \nor gender. Such allegations are entirely without merit. For \nnoncontroversial nominees who were confirmed in 1997 and 1998, there \nwas little, if any, difference between the timing of confirmation for \nminority nominees and non-minority nominees. Only when the President \nappoints a controversial female or minority nominee does a disparity \narise. Moreover, last session, over 50 percent of the nominees that the \nJudiciary Committee reported to the full Senate were women and \nminorities. Even the Democratic former chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Joe Biden, stated publicly that the process by which \nthe Committee, under my chairmanship, examines and approves judicial \nnominees ``has not a single thing to do with gender or race.''\n  The Senate has conducted the confirmations process in a fair and \nprincipled manner, and the process has worked well and, in my opinion, \nwill continue to work well. The Federal Judiciary is sufficiently \nstaffed to perform its function under article 3 of the Constitution. \nSenator Lott, and the Senate as a whole, are to be commended.\n  I want to make sure we make those points in the Record before we \nstart voting on these judicial nominees. When the Judiciary Committee \nreports a nominee to the floor, it does not even consider telling \nSenators what the nominee's race or ethnicity or anything else is. The \nnominee's race or ethnicity or gender is irrelevant as far as we are \nconcerned. We report judicial nominees because we believe them to be \nqualified. We report them because the President of the United States \nhas the constitutional right to nominate judges. The Senate has right \nto confirm or not confirm them.\n  I have to say, the big battles are behind the scenes where we \ndetermine, in consultation with the White House, whether or not people \nshould be nominated at all. That process is participated in by \nvirtually every Senator in this body, and certainly by the leaders of \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  I wish to set the record straight because I see continual \npoliticization of the judiciary by this administration whereby this \nadministration tries to make appointments that literally do not deserve \nto be made.\n  Naturally, having said all this, during a Presidential election year \nthe nomination process does slow down. It ultimately ends during that \nyear, and historically has done so whether there has been Republican or \nDemocrat control of the Senate, and whether there has been a Republican \nor Democrat in the White House.\n  Another point I believe must be emphasized: We in the Senate cannot \ntake action on nominees we do not have.\n  Yesterday, at a Democratic National Committee event in Texas, \nPresident Clinton took the Senate to task for not acting swiftly enough \non his judicial nominees. Given the fact that this is his last year in \noffice, and that he was speaking at a DNC event, President Clinton is \nbound to say anything.\n  The nominees we will confirm today will bring the total number of \nClinton judges confirmed by the Senate Republicans to 340. \nApproximately 40 percent of the total federal judiciary now are Clinton \njudges--judges confirmed by Republicans.\n  I note this: The President has made nominations for less then half of \nthe vacancies that currently exist. For all the bad-mouthing this \nadministration does from time to time regarding the confirmation of \njudges, it is important to note there are presently 79 vacancies, and \nto date we have received only 38 nominees--4 of which we received just \ntoday, so, in essence, just 34 nominees until today. There are 41 \nvacancies for which the President has not even made a nomination. That \nneeds to be said.\n  I want to work with the President. I want to treat him fairly. I \nthink we have been more than fair with him. I intend to be fair in the \nfuture as well,\n\n[[Page S587]]\n\nbut I would appreciate it if he would speak a little more fairly \nhimself.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, it is the Senate's responsibility to assure \nthat only our Nation's most exceptional legal minds dispense justice \nduring lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. This definition \nprecisely describes Delaware's Thomas Ambro, whom we have just \nconfirmed to serve as a Federal judge on the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  I have followed Tom's legal career from the time he served on my \nWashington staff while attending Georgetown University Law School. \nFollowing a clerkship with Delaware Supreme Court Justice Daniel \nHerrmann, Tom distinguished himself as a corporate law attorney with \nthe law firm of Richards, Layton and Finger in Wilmington, Delaware.\n  I have no doubt that Thomas Ambro's national reputation as a \ncorporate bankruptcy attorney will soon be supplanted by a reputation \nas one of our wisest Federal judges. Congratulations to Tom on this \nsignificant day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The question is, Will the \nSenate advise and consent to the nomination of Thomas L. Ambro, of \nDelaware, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, as I understand, under the previous order, \nthe distinguished Senator from Florida is to be recognized next. Seeing \nhim on the floor, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \ncontinue, without him losing his place in the order, for up to 4 \nminutes in reference to the judicial nominations we just confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we begin the 2d session of the 106th \nCongress, we should think about the challenge we face with respect to \nour constitutional responsibility to work with the President to provide \nthe many Federal judges who are desperately needed around the country.\n  Today I thank our Democratic leader, but I also particularly thank \nthe majority leader, both longtime friends. They moved forward Senate \nconsideration of two of the seven judicial nominations that were \nfavorably reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee last year.\n  I know that had the distinguished majority leader not taken the \nearlier parliamentary action he did today, this would not have \nhappened. I thank him for doing that.\n  I note the heavy vote on both these nominees. One had a vote of 96 \nvotes. The other had a vote of 95 votes. Perhaps more relevant, there \nwere only two votes against them. I would love to win elections by \nthose kinds of margins in my home State of Vermont.\n  The point is that these distinguished jurists have been held up for \nsome time. Yet when they finally come to a vote, we find an \noverwhelming majority of Republicans and Democrats are for them.\n  I hope that we might proceed to prompt action on the remaining five \njudicial nominations on the Senate calendar, as well. Having confirmed \nJudge Ambro and Judge Pisano, I wish we were proceeding, as well, on \nthe confirmations of Kermit Bye to the Eighth Circuit, Judge George \nDaniels to the District Court for the Southern District of New York, \nTim Dyk to the Federal Circuit, and Marsha Berzon and Judge Richard \nPaez to the Ninth Circuit.\n  I hope that the distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, and the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and I can find a \nway to consider each of the judicial nominations reported last year to \nthe Senate by the Judiciary Committee.\n\n[[Page S588]]\n\n  Last October, Senator Lott committed to working with us, and I \ncommend him for that. Also, in November, he announced he would press \nforward for votes on the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha \nBerzon to the Ninth Circuit by March 15. In that regard, not only do I \ncommend him for pushing forward, but I commend the distinguished \nSenators from California, Senators Feinstein and Boxer, for their \nsteadfast support of these nominees. They are now in line to receive \nSenate action. We should do the same with all the others.\n  Then there is the question of the 31 judicial nominations pending in \nthe Judiciary Committee. In fact, 29 not yet had hearings, although we \nnow have some planned.\n  I am challenging the Senate to regain the pace it met in 1998 when \nthe committee held 13 hearings and the Senate confirmed 65 judges. That \nwould still be one fewer than the number of judges confirmed by a \nDemocratic Senate majority in the last year of the Bush administration \nin 1992. In fact, in the last 2 years of the Bush administration, a \nDemocratic Senate majority with a Republican President confirmed 124 \njudges. We now have a Democratic President with a Republican-controlled \nSenate, and it would take 90 confirmations this year alone for the \nSenate to equal that total.\n  Let me show a chart. These are Presidential election years. This is \nwhat we have done on nominations: 64 in 1980; 44 in 1984; 1988, with a \nDemocratic-controlled Senate and a Republican-control Presidency, 42; \nin 1992, with the Democrats in control of the Senate and with a \nRepublican President, we confirmed 66 judges; but then 4 years later \nwith a Republican Senate and a Democratic President, it dropped to only \n17 judges without a single judge confirmed to the federal courts of \nappeals; and now we have confirmed 2 judges so far this year.\n  I hope we can do better. I hope we will say that 1996 was an anomaly \nand the Senate will very much take its duties seriously.\n  Let these judges have a vote. If Senators do not want them, vote \nagainst them. But as we have seen, oftentimes even when they are held \nup, if they can finally get a vote, they are overwhelmingly confirmed \nby the Senate.\n  Over the last 5 years, the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed the \nfollowing: 58 federal judges in the 1995 session; 17 in 1996; 36 in \n1997; 65 in 1998; and 34 in 1999. In one year, 1994, with a Democratic \nmajority in the Senate, we confirmed 101 judges. With commitment and \nhard work many things are achievable. I am not demanding that the \nSenate confirm 101 judges this year, as we did in 1994, or 90 or 80 or \neven 70. But I do challenge the Republican-controlled Senate to hold at \nleast 13 hearings and confirm at least 65 judges, as it did in 1998.\n  We failed to reach those goals last year when the Judiciary Committee \nheld barely half that number of hearings and confirmed barely half that \nnumber of judges. A confirmation total of 65 at the end of this year is \nachievable if we make the effort, exhibit the commitment and do the \nwork that is needed to be done. We cannot achieve this goal if we wait \nseveral more weeks before holding hearings or wait several weeks \nbetween hearings. To hold at least 13 hearings requires the Committee \nto begin holding hearings right away and to hold hearings at least \nevery other week for the entire session.\n  I am continuing to work with Chairman Hatch so that all of the \nnominees submitted to us get a fair hearing before the committee and a \nfair up-or-down vote before the Senate.\n  We begin this year with 79 judicial vacancies, more than existed when \nthe Republican majority took control of the Senate five years ago and \nover 50 percent more than when the Senate adjourned in 1998. Over the \nlast 5 years we have actually lost ground in our efforts to fill \nlongstanding judicial vacancies that are plaguing the Federal courts.\n  Moreover, the Republican Congress has refused to consider the \nauthorization of the additional judges needed by the federal judiciary \nto deal with their ever increasing workload. In 1984, and in 1990, \nCongress responded to requests by the Chief Justice and the Judiciary \nConference for needed judicial resources. Indeed, in 1990, a Democratic \nmajority in the Congress created scores of needed new judgeships during \na Republican administration.\n  Three years ago the Judicial Conference of the United States \nrequested that an additional 53 judgeships be authorized around the \ncountry. Last year the Judicial Conference renewed its request but \nincreased it to 72 judgeships needing to be authorized around the \ncountry. Instead, the only Federal judgeships created since 1990 were \nthe nine District Court judgeships authorized in the omnibus \nappropriations bill at the end of last year.\n  If Congress had timely considered and passed the Federal Judgeship \nAct of 1999, S. 1145, as it should have, the Federal judiciary would \nhave over 150 vacancies today. That is the more accurate measure of the \nneeds of the Federal judiciary that have been ignored by the Congress \nover the past several years and places the vacancy rate for the Federal \njudiciary at over 16 percent--151 out of 915. As it is, the vacancy \nrate is almost 10 percent--79 out of 852--and has remained too high \nthroughout the 5 years that the Republican majority has controlled the \nSenate.\n  Especially troubling is the vacancy rate on the courts of appeals, \nwhich continues at 15 percent--27 out of 179--without the creation of \nany of the additional judgeships that those courts need to handle their \nincreased workloads.\n  Most troubling is the circuit emergency that had to be declared four \nmonths ago by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit. I recall when the Second Circuit had such an emergency 2 years \nago. Along with the other Senators representing States from the \nCircuit, I worked hard to fill the five vacancies then plaguing my \ncircuit. The situation in the Fifth Circuit is not one that we should \ntolerate; it is a situation that I wished we had confronted by \nexpediting consideration of the nominations of Alston Johnson and \nEnrique Moreno last year. I hope that the Senate will consider both of \nthem promptly in the early part of this year.\n  I deeply regret that the Senate adjourned in November and left the \nFifth Circuit to deal with the crisis in the federal administration of \njustice in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi without the resources that \nit desperately needs. I look forward to our resolving this difficult \nsituation promptly this session. I will work with the majority leader \nand the Democratic leader to resolve that emergency at the earliest \npossible time.\n  With 27 vacancies on the Federal appellate courts across the country \nand 73 percent of the judicial emergency vacancies in the Federal \ncourts system in our appellate courts, our courts of appeals are being \ndenied the resources that they need, and their ability to administer \njustice for the American people is being hurt. There continue to be \nmultiple vacancies on the Ninth Circuit. Six vacancies out of 28 \nauthorized judgeships is too many; perpetuating five judicial emergency \nvacancies, as the Senate has in this one circuit, is irresponsible. We \nshould act on these nominations promptly and provide the Ninth Circuit \nwith the judicial resources it needs and to which it is entitled.\n  I am likewise concerned that the Third, Fourth and Sixth Circuits are \nsuffering from multiple vacancies.\n  I look forward to Senate action on the long-delayed nominations of \nJudge Richard Paez, Marsha Berzon and Tim Dyk. I continue to urge the \nSenate to meet our responsibilities to all nominees, including women \nand minorities, and look forward to prompt and favorable action on the \nnominations of Judge Julio Fuentes to the Third Circuit, Judge James \nWynn, Jr. to the Fourth Circuit, Enrique Moreno to the Fifth Circuit, \nand Kathleen McCree Lewis to the Sixth Circuit.\n  Working together the Senate can join with the President to confirm \nwell-qualified, diverse and fair-minded judges to fulfill the needs of \nthe Federal courts around the country. I urge all Senators to make the \nFederal administration of justice a top priority for the Senate this \nyear.\n  Mr. President, I see my distinguished friend from Florida on the \nfloor. I thank him for his courtesy. I commend the distinguished senior \nSenator from New Jersey for giving us such a fine nominee. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 6 minutes\n\n[[Page S589]]\n\nwithout the Senator from Florida losing any of his time. I thank him \nfor his willingness to allow this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this is a good day for New Jersey. I \nam so pleased the Senate has confirmed the appointment of an \noutstanding citizen of our State, Joel Pisano, for a seat on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for New Jersey. He is a competent, thorough, well-\nthought-of individual. I thank Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy for \ntheir help in moving Mr. Pisano's nomination through the Judiciary \nCommittee and their support of his nomination. I recommended him in \nJune of 1999. I am grateful to hear he was confirmed by a vote of 95 to \n2.\n\n  Joel Pisano has outstanding credentials. He is going to be an \nexcellent addition to our district court. The backlog of cases is very \nhigh. It takes a long time for people to bring their cases and have \nthem adjudged. Joel Pisano will be an excellent addition to our bench \nand help move that caseload fairly and rapidly.\n  He has served as a magistrate judge since 1991. He is already \nperforming many of the duties of a district court judge, including jury \nand nonjury trials. He has managed pretrial proceedings in about 600 \ncivil cases, so he is used to controlling the large caseload of a \nFederal court. He has also dealt with a wide variety of different \ncases--patent and trademark cases, environmental cleanup disputes, \nantitrust and securities litigation, employment discrimination cases, \nand civil RICO matters.\n  I did a lot of personal research, as I have on all of the \nrecommendations I have made to the Federal bench, and I was so pleased \nto hear of the unanimous approval of Mr. Pisano as a candidate for the \nFederal bench.\n  He has a reputation for competence, energy, and commitment that \nperfectly fits the profile of an excellent candidate to sit on the \nFederal district court bench.\n  He has consistently impressed everyone who appears before him and who \nworks with him in his capacity for fairness and his thorough \nunderstanding of the law.\n  I heard not one critical note from the people I spoke to--lawyers, \njudges, those who make up much of the legal community in the State of \nNew Jersey.\n  Prior to his appointment as a magistrate, Mr. Pisano was a partner in \na distinguished law firm. In the 13 years he spent representing \nclients, he developed an expertise in a wide variety of areas, in both \ncivil and criminal matters.\n  Mr. Pisano appeared in court almost every day and tried 150 cases to \nconclusion. He also managed the litigation section of his firm, which I \nthink was an early indication of the supervisory skills that have \nserved him so well as a magistrate.\n  Magistrate Pisano's depth of experience and organizational skills are \nexactly what we need at a time when staggering caseloads are making it \nmore and more difficult for our Federal judges to spend as much time \nwith each case as they would wish.\n  He will tackle his new responsibilities with energy to spare. I am \npleased the Senate confirmed him. I am honored that I brought him to \nthe attention of the Senate. I believe he will serve as one of our most \noutstanding judges in the district court.\n  Mr. President, I thank my friend from Florida and yield the floor.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate, by a 95-\n2 vote, has confirmed Joel Pisano as a district court judge for the \nDistrict of New Jersey.\n  Judge Pisano is an excellent choice to fill the district court seat \ncreated with the confirmation of Marion Trump Barry to the third \nCircuit Court of Appeals this past summer. He is extremely well-\nrespected in New Jersey for his commitment to public service, as well \nas for his depth and breadth of knowledge of the law.\n  A graduate of Lafayette College and later of Seton Hall University \nLaw School, Judge Pisano has had a varied and distinguished legal \ncareer. He served for 4 years as a public defender in New Jersey, \nbefore moving into private practice as a partner with a well-respected \nNew Jersey law firm for 14 years.\n  In 1991, Judge Pisano was appointed to be a U.S. Magistrate Judge in \nNewark, New Jersey. In that capacity, he ably presided over a number of \nhigh profile cases, including that of a former Mexican deputy attorney \ngeneral who was charged with laundering $9.9 million in drug payoffs.\n  In a 1995 survey of attorneys who practice in New Jersey before \nFederal judges, Judge Pisano was praised for his skills in managing \ncases and his efficiency in moving a calendar quickly. His ``street-\nwise'' nature and prior experience as a trial attorney were said to \nserve him well on the bench.\n  Judge Pisano's 8 years as a magistrate judge have prepared him for \nhis promotion to the district court. He has an understanding of, and \nthe training for, the responsibilities and challenges he will face as a \ndistrict court judge. I am confident that he will serve us all well in \nhis new role.\n  In conclusion, I just want to say how pleased I am that Joel Pisano \nhas been confirmed by the Senate as a district court judge for the \nDistrict of New Jersey. I am sure that he will be a superb addition to \nthe bench.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S589-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald).

Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly regarding the late \nFloyd Riddick.\n  Floyd Riddick was for several years the Parliamentarian of the \nSenate. Floyd Riddick was born in 1908 in Trotville, NC. That was the \nsame year in which the Model T Ford was made. The Model A Ford came \nalong in December of 1927, but the Model T Ford came on the market in \n1908.\n  Floyd Riddick was from that generation of Americans committed to \nduty, excellence, and hard work. His entire life reflected a love of \nduty, of excellence, and of hard work. Floyd Riddick attended Duke \nUniversity. He attained his master's degree at Vanderbilt, and then he \nreturned to Duke University to earn his Ph.D. in political science. \nWhile working on his doctoral dissertation, Floyd Riddick spent a year \nobserving the workings of the U.S. House of Representatives. And then, \nin 1941, he published an expanded version of that research as \ncongressional procedure.\n  For the benefit of the viewing public, I hold in my hand a copy of \nthe volume about which I have just spoken. The title is ``Riddick's \nSenate Procedure.'' This particular volume, which was printed by the \nU.S. Government Printing Office here in Washington in 1992, including \nthe appendix, contains 1,564 pages. Mr. President, I have read this \nbook on Riddick's Procedure through and through and through a number of \ntimes. It used to be that when I was the Democratic whip, and while I \nwas also Secretary of the Democratic Conference in the Senate, and \nduring the\n\n[[Page S590]]\n\ntime I was majority leader, minority leader, and majority leader again, \nI read this book once every year--the complete book. It is a very \nvaluable book. If one hopes to ever have a fairly good understanding of \nthe Senate rules and precedents, then he or she should read this book. \nThe Parliamentarians of the Senate are very familiar with it. They \nresort to it many times a day, and it is a sure and dependable \nguideline with respect to the rules and precedents in the Senate. Doc \nRiddick--we called him ``Doc''--published a book on congressional \nprocedure. This book is on Senate procedure.\n  He then came to Washington permanently as a statistical analyst and \nas an instructor of political science at American University. He was a \nPh.D. in political science. I never received my baccalaureate in \npolitical science until I was 76 years old. That was about 6 years ago. \nI received my baccalaureate in political science, but, of course, I \nknew a lot about political science long before I ever received that \ndegree. I am a graduate of the school of hard knocks, and I learned a \nlong time ago the lessons that are taught by service in this body and \nin the other body. This is my 48th year on Capitol Hill.\n  The late Richard Russell talked with me one day about the rules in \nthe Democratic Cloakroom, right in back of where I am now standing. He \nsaid: Robert, you need not only to know about the rules, you need also \nto understand the precedents of the Senate.\n  I said: Where can I learn about them?\n  He picked up this book, ``Riddick's Procedure,'' and he said: This is \nthe book where you can learn a lot about the precedents of the Senate.\n  Doc Riddick--as I say, because he had a Ph.D. in political science, \nDoc Riddick wrote the book. From 1943 to 1946, Dr. Riddick edited the \nLegislative Daily for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a post which led to \nhis being asked to set up a Daily Digest in the Congressional Record \nwhich would summarize congressional events and serve as a guide to the \ndaily Record.\n  Now, Doc Riddick wasn't the first man who ever thought of that. \nJulius Caesar developed what well might have been called the \nlegislative daily. He developed a process whereby the daily actions of \nthe Senate would be noted and would be distributed to the various parts \nof the Roman Empire, and nailed upon walls for all to see.\n  That was a kind of daily legislative digest. That came along quite a \ngood many years before Dr. Riddick's time. But he followed in the shoes \nof Julius Caesar in that regard in that he set up a Daily Digest in the \nCongressional Record. It is still to be found in the back of the \nCongressional Record. In the back of the Record there is a Daily \nDigest, and Senators can go to the Daily Digest and very quickly be \ninformed about the actions of the Senate and the House the day before, \nand what legislation was passed and how many rollcall votes there were. \nIt is a very valuable compendium of the actions of the Senate and the \nHouse on the day previous to the day on which the Congressional Record \nappears in our office.\n  From that position in 1951, Dr. Riddick joined the Office of \nParliamentarian as an assistant, succeeding to the position of Senate \nParliamentarian in 1964 where he served until 1974. After his \nretirement, Dr. Riddick continued to serve the Senate as \nParliamentarian Emeritus and as a consultant to the Senate Committee on \nRules and Administration. Do you know what his salary was? Zero. He \ndidn't charge anything for his services.\n  That was a deeply dedicated man who enjoyed giving of his knowledge \nand talents, his expertise, his experience to other Senators. I have \nbeen a member of that committee for a long time, so I am quite familiar \nwith Floyd Riddick and his work on the committee.\n  Most Senators now serving will be most familiar with the name of \nFloyd Riddick in connection with Riddick's Rules of Procedure. He also \nauthored a series of articles summarizing each congressional session \nwhich appeared in the American Political Science Review and the Western \nPolitical Quarterly, along with several other books on the \norganization, history, and procedures of the Congress.\n  I used to conduct a seminar on the legislative process at American \nUniversity during the summers. I didn't earn much money, but the money \nthat I earned I put into a fund for the college education of a Chinese \norphan. I would have Dr. Riddick over to speak during those days when I \nwas conducting the seminar. Dr. Riddick would come over and speak to \nthe class. It wasn't an easy class. It was a tough one. I gave between \n600 and 700 questions on the final exam, and I flunked three or four \nindividuals in the class who apparently thought it would be an easy \nthing to skip when they wanted to. But they didn't make the grade. I \nhad no hesitancy in flunking them. Dr. Riddick, though, was one of \nthose who spoke for me from time to time.\n  I also had Senator Sam Ervin over to speak to my class. I had the \nlate Speaker, Carl Albert, over to American University from time to \ntime to speak in this seminar. I asked some of the officers of the \nSenate to visit the class. So we offered those young people a real \ntreat in the legislative process.\n  The Random House College Dictionary gives us this definition of the \nword ``integrity'': ``Adherence to moral and ethical principles; \nsoundness of moral character; honesty.''\n  That word ``integrity'' is used repeatedly in the publication \nentitled ``Tributes to Dr. Floyd M. Riddick'' upon the occasion of his \nretirement and designation as parliamentarian emeritus, which was \nordered by the Senate to be printed on December 19, 1974. Senator after \nSenator, in speaking of the services of Floyd Riddick upon his \nretirement, used that word ``integrity.''\n\n  He was a Parliamentarian who would not be swayed by anybody in the \nSenate. He called the shots exactly as he saw them. He didn't lean \ntoward the Republicans; he didn't lean toward the Democrats. He called \nthe questions as he saw them, and based them on the Senate rules and \nupon the precedents. When we received advice from Dr. Riddick while he \nwas Parliamentarian, we knew that was the way it was. We knew he wasn't \nbending the rules to favor any of us or to favor either political \nparty.\n  So the word ``integrity'' was an extremely well-fitting word for \nFloyd Riddick.\n  There are some individuals who come up from their origins with a \ncloseness to earth and a nearness to growing things--growing things, \nthe lilac bush, the rosebush, the tomato plant, the ordinary weed, a \nblade of grass--these individuals have integrity. There is a sort of \nelemental trueness about them which even the foibles and the follies \nand the bright lights of Washington politics cannot shake from their \nbeing.\n  As Popeye says, ``I am what I am and that is all I am.'' And these \npeople are just what they are and that is all they are. That was Dr. \nRiddick. Even the foibles and follies of politics in Washington could \nnot shake his being.\n  So it is not surprising to learn that Floyd Riddick enjoyed being on \na farm. He used to give some of us here a few of his tomatoes. He grew \nthose large, beefsteak tomatoes, and he would bring them in from the \nfarm. He would give me some in the summer. And there were others who \nwere fortunate enough to be the recipients of Floyd Riddick's tomatoes. \nAnd later in life, Dr. Riddick routinely escaped to his farm in \nRappahannock County, VA, as if for renewal and refreshment.\n  Rappahannock County, VA--my distant forbear, whose name was William \nSale, came from England in 1657 and settled on the Rappahannock River \nin Virginia. He worked 7 years as an indentured servant to pay for his \ntrip across the Atlantic--7 years. Then he received 160 acres of land. \nSo it was in Rappahannock County that Dr. Riddick had a farm. He loved \nthat farm.\n  Emerson said, ``The true test of civilization is not in the census, \nnor the size of cities, nor the crops. No. But the kind of man the \ncountry turns out.''\n  This was the kind of man we could emulate. He was a noble soul, Floyd \nRiddick. He was the kind of man we could proudly call a friend or \nassociate.\n  Emerson also said: ``It is easy in the world to live after the \nworld's opinion.'' That is easy. ``It is easy in solitude to live after \nour own.'' That is easy. ``But the great man is he who, in the midst of \nthe crowd, keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.''\n  Floyd Riddick never seemed frazzled, never seemed exasperated by the \npressure cooker atmosphere that can and does develop here on the Senate \nfloor.\n\n[[Page S591]]\n\n Even though Dr. Riddick's tenure as Senate Parliamentarian coincided \nwith some of the most difficult and passionate issues ever encountered \nby the Senate, such as Vietnam and civil rights, he was ever the calm \nprofessional, always willing and ready to lift a hand, always desirous \nof helping especially the new Members who were sworn into this body, \nalways there, too, at the beck and call of the Members who had been \nhere a long time.\n  Such a common, friendly, warm, congenial, accommodating, decent \nindividual! Around him there seemed to be always an aura of peace and \ncontrol. He kept his mind on his responsibilities, and he never ever \nforgot that, as Parliamentarian--in effect, the silent referee of \nSenate debate and procedure--he had to maintain complete and total \nobjectivity. No partisanship--complete and total objectivity.\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle knew it. They knew when they went \nto him, they would get the straight answer and it would not be colored \nor tinctured by partisanship. Doc Riddick was in every sense of the \nword a scholar. He was quiet, soft spoken, unassuming, and absolutely \nrock solid. That was Floyd Riddick!\n  I leaned upon him heavily in my earlier years in the Senate. He was a \ndelight to work with, and I enjoyed his company. He was one of those \ncompletely dedicated selfless people who labored for the good of the \ninstitution. He loved the institution. He labored for the good of the \nSenate and for the good of his country.\n  Robert E. Lee said that the word ``duty'' was the sublimest word in \nthe English language. Dr. Riddick understood what that meant, and, to \nhim, duty was sublime. He was above politics, as I have repeatedly \nsaid, he was honorable, and he was entirely above reproach.\n  Floyd Riddick did not need praise, although he certainly deserved it. \nHe did not covet recognition, although the recognition of his scholarly \nexpertise was widespread. For him, the glory of the work, the glory of \nserving the Senate, the glory of serving Senators, and through Senators \nthe glory of serving the American people, was enough.\n  We will long remember Dr. Riddick, those of us who served with him. \nWhence cometh such another?\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nVirginia may proceed as in morning business for such time as I may \nrequire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S591-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S591-S594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE SITUATION IN BOSNIA AND KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to address my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle with regard to the deepening and very grave \nconcerns I have in my heart about the situation in both Bosnia and \nKosovo. I, as many colleagues, travel with some regularity to that \nregion of the world, the Balkans. Just 3 weeks ago, I completed my most \nrecent trip. I had the distinct privilege of being accompanied on that \ntrip by the Supreme Allied Commander of Europe, General Clark, \nCommander in Chief of NATO Forces, in my travels through Kosovo, and \nthen later the next day with his deputy, Admiral Abbott, as I went into \nBosnia.\n  I have been to this region many times, although I am not suggesting I \nam any more of an expert than my colleagues. I first went in 1990 with \nthen-leader Robert Dole. We went to Pristina, in Kosovo. I remember our \ndelegation of Senators queried Senator Dole: Why here? Bob Dole \ninstinctively knew that Kosovo could become a battleground. I remember \nStephen Ambrose, the historian, was alleged to have quoted Eisenhower \nwhen Eisenhower was asked, 10 years after D-day: General, tell us about \nthe next war. And Ike very wisely did not opine, except to say: That \nwar could come as a surprise and may well come from a direction that \nnone of us could anticipate.\n  In our visit to Kosovo, I and that tried and tested and courageous \nBob Dole, a soldier of World War II, were confronted with a totally \nunpredicted situation while in Pristina. Thousands and thousands of \npeople heard about Members of the U.S. Congress coming to this remote \nregion, and they converged on the hotel. There was panic in the streets \nand a great deal of disorder. People were being trampled in the crowds, \nand Senator Dole had to make a wise decision, and a quick one, that we \nhad to exit because we could be responsible for injuries to people, \npeople who wanted to come to see us, people who wanted to tell us about \nthe hardships that were then being inflicted by Milosevic. Indeed, we \nmade a hasty retreat.\n  But as we went back to our plane, we passed that historic piece of \nground, whose origin goes way back, in my recollection, to the 1300s, \nthat field of battle which actually the persons who preceded the \ngoverning structure today lost. They lost the war, yet they still \nconsider that hallowed ground. But I remember as we passed that \nbattlefield, Bob Dole said: Tragedy and fighting will visit this land \nsomeday.\n  And that it did. Our Nation's men and women of the Armed Forces, \nprimarily the Air Force, fought a courageous battle: 78 days of combat, \ntens of thousands of missions together with other nations--seven other \nnations were flying missions with our Air Force--and eventually the \nmajor nations of the world came to an understanding as to how that \nfighting should stop. It was causing tremendous damage, but there was \nno other recourse by which we could get the attention of Milosevic.\n  There are those who say today, in hindsight, perhaps we should not \nhave done this, perhaps we should not have blown up that bridge. When I \nvisited Pristina several weeks ago, someone said: We haven't got power \nbecause the power lines were blown out. It was a tough war, and our \nmilitary commanders made tough decisions; 19 nations got together to \nmake those decisions--a historic first combat by NATO. They made it \nwork. Now they have basically stopped any major fighting and we are \ndown to incidents --fortunately few incidents, but nevertheless \ndangerous ones.\n  When I looked into the faces of the young men and women of our Armed \nForces, and indeed other armed forces, and actually walked the streets \nwith a patrol, it was clear they were performing duties for which they \nwere never trained in their military careers. Historically, our troops \nhave not in any great measure performed the type of mission they are \ndoing in that region. But they are doing it and doing it very well. \nThey are accepting the risks of getting caught in the crossfire that \nstill erupts as a consequence of the cultural differences, the ethnic \nhatreds. Indeed, much of the fighting today in Kosovo is Albanian upon \nAlbanian. It is retribution against fellow Albanians because they at \none time or another did something to further the Serb interest.\n\n  Our troops are there. When you ask those in charge, whether it is the \nNATO commanders, the U.N. representative, the E.U. representative, or \nanyone else, no one can give you any time estimate within which our \nforces can be withdrawn. The infrastructure that was to move in behind \nin Kosovo, the commitments that were made by a number of nations to \nprovide police, to provide money to pay salaries for the judicial \nelement, to help rebuild the power lines--it is not flowing. It is \ncaught up in bureaucracies, international bureaucracies. It is all but \nstagnant--all but stagnant.\n  I met with the commander of all troops, a very competent professional \nGerman officer. I met Ambassador Kouchner, who has been designated to \npull together the various elements to make this work. We were in a room \nin the military headquarters. There was no running water. The water \npipes were shut off, partially due to freezing and partially due to \nlack of power. The light bulbs flickered. Ambassador Kouchner pointed \nout we do not have enough power to keep the homes warm. There was a \ncertain feeling we won the war but we could lose the peace, because the \nwar goes on amongst the bureaucracies, no matter what the good \nintentions may be to bring forth and reestablish in that war-torn \nregion of Serbia--Kosovo is a part of Serbia--the\n\n[[Page S592]]\n\ninfrastructure needed to bring back just a modicum of a normal life.\n  Foremost in my heart is my deep concern for the men and women of the \narmed services undertaking missions for which they were not trained. \nMissions which take them away not only from their families, but take \nthem away from other potential deployments of our U.S. military, a \nmilitary that is stretched far too thin already.\n  These men and women of our military need to have some definitization \nof how much longer we are going to keep significant numbers deployed to \nKosovo. That timing is directly tied to the ability and the willingness \nof other nations and organizations to come in and consolidate the \nmilitary gains, reestablish an infrastructure--be it judicial, be it \npolice, be it rebuilding, be it a form of government, be it elections--\nso that the troops can return--ours and others--to their assignments \nand their bases elsewhere.\n  A similar situation still exists in Bosnia after these many years. \nHowever, let me draw a distinction. After the fighting stopped in \nBosnia, the military decided they would locate the troops in heavily \nprotected compounds. They would go out on daily patrols to prevent the \neruption of further fighting. So far, that has worked.\n  Clearly, without any question, the military operations in Bosnia and \nKosovo are a great credit to the men and women who fought them, the men \nand women who planned them, and the men and women who are still there \ntoday. That job was done and done well.\n  In Kosovo, they decided not to concentrate the military, either the \nU.S. military, or the other militaries. Rather, they were dispersed in \nthe various regions. The U.S. region is the same as the one controlled \nby the British and the French. They dispersed them right out into the \nsmall communities so that men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces, four \nand five of them at a time, are living in some war-torn house or in a \nsmall churchyard where I saw them. Some are just guarding churches \nbecause of the incredible desire to destroy churches. That is a whole \nchapter of this tragedy which someone has to examine. The Albanian \nforces practically destroyed every church the Serbian people ever used.\n  Quite different is the military deployment in Kosovo from that in \nBosnia, but both have worked. Both were carefully planned, both have a \ncredible measure of success.\n  In Bosnia, the Dayton accords laid the blueprint. One can argue we \nshould have done this and we should have done that in Dayton. Yes, we \nknew it could have been better, but we had to get an agreement, and we \ngot the best we could at that time.\n  One of my concerns is we should go back--not reconvene everybody who \nwas at Dayton--but go back and examine what was right and what proved \nnot to be successful at Dayton and correct it.\n  The fighting has stopped, and the military provides a security \nblanket within which the various factions can begin to reestablish that \ncountry. Some progress is being made, but by any timetable, that \nprogress is way behind the expectations, given the fighting has been \nover for several years. It is way behind, again, because of the \ndifficulty of the bureaucracies working to bring in adequate police, \nand not just the police who perform duties on the streets, but in the \ncase of Bosnia, we need an international police force to investigate \nand fight the rampant crime.\n  Beneath the security blanket provided by the men and women of the \nArmed Forces, organized crime is rampant. It has been said the only \nthing really organized in Bosnia is organized crime. The various ethnic \nfactions get along very well in the criminal underworld. They have \ncharted their ground.\n  Yes, things are slowly improving in Bosnia but ever so slowly. There \nwe have independent entities. The U.N. has one area of responsibility, \nprimarily the police; the E.U. another area of responsibility; the OSCE \nresponsibility with regards to elections. However, they each report to \ndifferent capitals.\n\n  I had the Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations in my office \nyesterday. He is in charge of peacekeeping all over the world. He made \nclear how the four basic entities in charge of bringing about the \nrestoration of Bosnia all have different reporting channels. There is \nno central authority that works today for the greater betterment of \nthat region.\n  What has happened? You still cannot get a definitive date from \nanybody as to when the American troops and other troops can be \nwithdrawn.\n  I say it is time the Congress of the United States should step up. We \nare a coequal branch of our Government. This body has time and time \nbeen called upon to vote for funds, for resolutions, and other \nlegislative initiatives with regard to the Balkan situation. Now it is \ntime for us to take a look at the constant flow of the American \ntaxpayers' money and say: Is America going to keep its spigot flowing \nwhen, at the same time, other nations are not meeting their financial \ncommitments or obligations?\n  If I can digress for a moment, I have studied this situation, I have \ntalked with innumerable people, I have traveled to this region. The \nBalkan situation is the most difficult problem and a matrix of \ndiversified responsibility and commitment I have ever tried to get my \narms around. As soon as I feel I have one body of fact on which I can \nrely and reach a decision, another person will come along and say: No, \nit's different than that.\n  I have tried in this set of remarks to outline how I understand the \nsituation to be in Bosnia and Kosovo. But I rise today to say to the \nSenate that it is my intention, when the piece of legislation we \nanticipate will be coming through soon, the supplemental--the \nsupplemental has $2 billion--can I repeat that?--$2 billion associated \nwith our obligations, military and otherwise, in just Kosovo. I think \nit is time we stated our intention as the Congress of the United States \nto allow the first part of those funds to flow--I will refine the \nlanguage eventually--but to have a stopping point when we take a pause \nand we say to our President respectfully: Mr. President, no further \nfunds of the $2 billion will flow until you can come back and give us \nsome type of assurance, certification, or otherwise, that the other \nnations are living up to their commitments. That should get the \nattention of the other nations. I say most respectfully, that should \ngive our President some leverage to deal with these other nations.\n\n  I am not alone on this. I have talked to a number of colleagues. As I \nsay, my language is not refined at this point. I welcome suggestions. I \nwelcome those who can contribute facts where I may be in error with \nregard to some of the statements I make today. In good conscience, I \ntried to check out everything. But, as I say, getting your arms around \nthis problem is not easy. Getting the body of facts is difficult. \nIndeed, others have worked as hard as I have.\n  Collectively, let us bring together our judgments as to how best and \nby what mechanism we can assert our responsibility under the \nConstitution--as the coequal branch, as those who control the purse \nstrings of the U.S. Government--to string this purse of $2 billion such \nthat our President can expend what has to be expended in the next 90 \ndays, following adoption by the Congress, but that there comes a time \nwhen accountability steps in.\n  Our President has to explain to the Congress what he has done, what \nremains to be done, and hopefully some prospects of when these \nsituations in both Bosnia and Kosovo can be brought to a state of \naffairs where the infrastructure allows the significant withdrawal of \nour troops and, indeed, troops of other nations.\n  It may well be that the United States--we took a major role in the \nwar in Kosovo, a major role in the war in Bosnia--could turn over such \nbalance of troop responsibilities as may remain in, say, a year, 18 \nmonths, to the Europeans. They are quite anxious, under NATO, to \nestablish their own organization militarily to do certain things in the \nevent NATO, for one reason or another, decides not to do them. This \nmight be their first challenge.\n  I see on the floor the distinguished leader of our NATO group in the \nSenate, the Senator from Delaware. We just met with the British Foreign \nSecretary on this very question. This might be an opportunity to test \nthat new military structure. I have concerns about that and how it \nmight have long-term effects on the weakening of\n\n[[Page S593]]\n\nNATO, but for the moment I give those who propose it the benefit of the \ndoubt. It has not been completely refined yet, this concept, nor \nimplemented. So that is another question for another day.\n  The reason for my addressing the Senate today is my deep concern for \nthe welfare of the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United \nStates who are going through a winter far more severe than anything we \nhave experienced here, certainly in the area of the Nation's Capital. \nAnd every day they could be subject to someone looking down a gun \nbarrel, perhaps not firing in anger at them or the troops of other \nnations but firing in anger at someone else because of the persistent \nethnic hatred that remains.\n  I say most respectfully, we have a duty in this institution to assert \nourselves as to the timetable committed to by other nations with regard \nto their support in both Bosnia and Kosovo which, up to this point, has \nnot been met. We should do everything within our power, and working \nwith our President, to see that that is done.\n  Mr. President, simply put, the United Nations, the European Union, \nand the OSCE are not doing the job they committed to do--in a timely \nmanner--in Bosnia or Kosovo. The successful NATO-led military \noperations in Bosnia and Kosovo were undertaken--at personal risk to \nour troops, and those of other nations, and with billions of dollars in \ncost to the American taxpayer--with the express understanding here in \nAmerica that the UN and others would promptly move in behind and \nconsolidate the gains. Now, as a result of little consolidation, U.S. \ntroops--and troops from over 30 other nations--remain in Bosnia over \nfour years after the end of that war, and are facing indefinite \ndeployments to both Bosnia and Kosovo.\n  Personal bravery and international bonds of commitment won the wars \nin the Balkans; but, will the slow pace of follow-on actions result in \na loss of peace?\n  During a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on February 2, when \nNATO commander General Clark was the witness, I first signaled my \nintention to take legislative action, in connection with the upcoming \nKosovo Supplemental to be proposed by President Clinton, to revitalize \nthe near stagnant situations in both Bosnia and Kosovo. I addressed \nthis subject again this past Tuesday, during the Committee's annual \nhearing with the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs on the budget request.\n  I am considering a variety of options, including tying U.S. military \nfunding for these operations to demonstrable progress by the UN, the \nEU, and the OSCE in fulfilling their commitments to rebuild the civil \nsociety in Bosnia and Kosovo; or requiring the withdrawal of U.S. \ntroops by a time certain--perhaps in 18 months--and leaving the \nmilitary occupation in Bosnia and Kosovo to European leadership. In the \ncoming days, I intend to continue to consult with my colleagues in the \nSenate, and others in the Administration and outside of government, on \nthis initiative. From my initial discussion with my colleagues I have \nto say, support is growing for my concept.\n  Congress has a co-equal responsibility with the Administration, and \nwe now must exercise leadership, hopefully with concurrence by the \nAdministration. This situation just cannot continue. Other nations and \norganizations will have to follow through on their commitments, the \nparties in the region will have to start cooperating with international \nauthorities and taking on more responsibility for the fate of their \nregion and their people.\n  The U.S. military will not stay there forever. The United States has \nfar too many commitments around the world, our military is stretched \ntoo thin as it is; we cannot have a decades-long military deployment to \nthe Balkans.\n  We, together with other nations, went into Bosnia and Kosovo with the \nbest of intentions--to stop the slaughter of tens of thousands of \ninnocent people, to restore peace and stability to the region, and to \nhelp the people of the Balkans rebuild lives shattered by war and \nethnic cleansing. But what has the coalition achieved? Our military \nforces have done their job. We have stopped the fighting, but precious \nlittle other progress has taken place. As one official said to me in \nBosnia, ``We have stopped the fighting, but the war goes on.'' Four \nyears after the Dayton Accords ended the war in Bosnia, little progress \nhas been made in rebuilding that country. The economy is stagnant, \npolice forces are inadequate and ineffective even to deal with routine \ncriminal activity--much less the growing problems of organized crime, \nthe judicial system is far from ready, only crime and corruption are \ngrowing. In fact, I was told by a senior UN official in Bosnia that the \nonly truly organized, multi-ethnic institution in Bosnia is organized \ncrime. Regrettably, a similar situation is rapidly developing in \nKosovo.\n\n  At this point, I would like to mention a positive event that has \noccurred in the region, the recent elections in Croatia. However, at \nthis point, it remains to be seen if those elections will translate \ninto similar positive events in Bosnia and Kosovo.\n  Since the timing of the departure of U.S. and allied troops from both \nBosnia and Kosovo is directly linked to the progress--or lack of \nprogress--that the UN and others make in achieving their goals, I am \ngravely concerned with the current situation. Clearly, the military has \nfulfilled its mission--namely, to provide a secure situation in Bosnia \nand Kosovo. In sharp contrast, the UN, the EU, the OSCE and others are \nnot living up--in a timely manner--to the commitments they made to \nconsolidate the gains made by the military.\n  Even though I have had a long association with the situation in the \nBalkans--having traveled regularly to the region since first visiting \nKosovo in September 1990 with then-Senate Majority Leaders Bob Dole and \nothers, and being the first U.S. Senator to go to Sarajevo during the \nwar, in September 1992--I was, quite frankly, distressed by what I saw \nduring my last visit in January.\n  Let me be clear--our troops, along with the troops from over 30 other \nnations that have joined the NATO-led operations in Bosnia and Kosovo, \nperformed magnificently in their military missions. They are, today, \nconducting a wide variety of assignments, and doing an outstanding job. \nThe U.S. troops I met in Bosnia and Kosovo are among the finest I have \nencountered in my 30-plus years of public service in working with \nmilitary organizations throughout the world. They are well-trained, \nmotivated and enthusiastic about what they are doing to help the people \nof Bosnia and Kosovo. Simply put--they have achieved their mission. To \nthe extent possible, given the continued ethnic animosities, the \nmilitary has stopped the large-scale fighting and has created a safe \nand secure environment, from a military perspective, in both Bosnia and \nKosovo. However, unacceptable, dangerous levels of criminal activity \ncontinue, and put our troops at constant risk.\n  So, why are our troops still in Bosnia over four years after they \nwere first deployed? Why is there no end in sight in Kosovo? The reason \nis that the United Nations, the EU and other international \norganizations charged with the responsibility of rebuilding the \ncivilian structures in Bosnia and Kosovo are simply not doing their \njob. This situation has to change.\n  Yesterday, I had the opportunity to communicate this message directly \nto Bernard Miyet, the Under Secretary General for Peacekeeping \nOperations at the United Nations. We had a lengthy discussion regarding \nBosnia and Kosovo and I conveyed to him my extreme concern with the \nsituation there, in particular the slow pace with which the United \nNations, European Union and other international organizations are \nfulfilling their promised assistance to the region.\n  Foreign donors must deliver, immediately, on their promises of \ninternational police so that NATO soldiers can get out of the business \nof policing. Our troops are not trained to perform these tasks, and it \nshould not be part of their mission. The United States has made a major \ncontribution of 450 police for Kosovo and is about to increase its \ncommitment. Others, particularly the Europeans, have to do their share \nby providing the necessary police forces.\n\n  Secretary Cohen delivered that message to our European allies this \npast weekend, at the annual Wehrkunde Conference. According to \nSecretary Cohen,\n\n       To date there has been a clear failure by participating \n     nations to provide the UN with\n\n[[Page S594]]\n\n     sufficient numbers of police for public security duties in \n     Kosovo, with a significant disparity in the amount of support \n     provided by different Alliance members. Indeed, the number of \n     police deployed is roughly half of what was planned. As a \n     result, KFOR soldiers, who are trained to fight wars, are \n     working as policemen, a job for which they have not been \n     trained and should not be asked to perform indefinitely.\n\n  I agree.\n  We must be mindful of the fact that the United Nations and other \ninternational organizations can only succeed if the nations comprising \nthese organizations contribute the needed resources.\n  In Kosovo, the UN needs the money to do the job. Only a small portion \nof the money pledged at last November's donors conference for Kosovo's \nbudget has actually been delivered. This is the money that pays the \nsalaries for teachers, judges, and street sweepers--the people who make \nKosovo work and whose loyalty the United Nations Mission in Kosovo \n(UNMIK) needs if it is to succeed. The Europeans and others have to \ncarry their weight and deliver on their commitments.\n  I am particularly concerned with the performance thus far of the \nEuropean Union. The EU has taken on the primary responsibility for the \nreconstruction of Kosovo. This is a job to which the EU committed--in \nrecognition of the fact that the United States bore the lion's share of \nthe cost of the war. Unfortunately, it is not quite working out as \nplanned.\n  Last fall, the EU committed almost $500 million for reconstruction. \nRecently, the European Parliament reduced that commitment to less than \n$200 million, questioning Kosovo's ``absorption capacity.'' It now \nappears that there is a serious chance that even this reduced EU \ncommitment will not arrive in time to make a difference.\n  I would like to quote from the excellent statement made by the \nRanking Member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin, during \nlast week's Committee hearing with General Clark:\n\n       It is vitally important for the international community and \n     particularly the nations of Europe to provide the funding and \n     the civilian police that are so necessary if these missions \n     (in Bosnia and Kosovo) are to be successful . . . The \n     European Union can talk about a goal of greater Euoprean \n     military strength--a stronger European pillar within NATO. \n     But the first test is whether it will meet the \n     responsibilities they have already accepted of providing $36 \n     million and civilian police for Kosovo. On my scorecard, they \n     are flunking the test.\n\n  The distinguished Ranking Member and I agree.\n  And again, during last Tuesday's hearing, Senator Levin reiterated \nand strengthen his message from last week by saying, ``There is a \nrequirement (in Kosovo) for 6,000 civilian police, but less than 2,000 \nhave been provided. We have provided our share but others have failed, \nand that failure endangers our troops and the success of our mission. \nCivil implementation of the cease fire is in real jeopardy and will \nfail unless a sufficient number of international civil police are put \non the ground promptly by the Europeans. The European Union can talk \nall it wants to about its plans to provide a militarily strong European \npillar within NATO under the European Security and Defense Identity. \nBut that is just rhetoric. The reality is their failure to meet their \ncurrent commitments in Kosovo.''\n  Since NATO troops were first deployed to Bosnia in December of 1995, \nthe United States has spent almost $10 billion dollars to support our \nmilitary commitment of troops to that nation. We have spent an \nadditional $5 billion in Kosovo for the air campaign and the deployment \nof U.S. KFOR troops. The annual price-tag for these military \ncommitments is $1.5 billion for Bosnia and $2 billion projected for \nKosovo. This is an obligation for the American taxpayer.\n\n  In addition to these significant sums of money, I am concerned about \nthe safety and welfare of the men and women of our Armed Forces, and \nthe Armed Forces of the other nations, who every day patrol the towns \nand villages of Bosnia and Kosovo, subjecting themselves to substantial \npersonal risk while performing duties traditionally not performed by \nmilitary personnel.\n  As I said earlier, our troops have performed their mission--they have \ncreated a safe and secure environment, as I previously indicated. But \nthe UN and other elements of the international community have not \nfilled in behind our troops to perform their mission. The results is \nthat our troops are forced to fill the vacuum, preforming missions for \nwhich they were not trained--acting as mayors, policemen, arbiters of \ndisputes, large and small. I was told of U.S. troops who were guarding \ntwo old Serb women who did not want to leave their home, which happened \nto be in an Albanian village. I saw three U.S. soldiers guarding a Serb \nchurch in an Albanian section of Kosovo. We must ask ourselves, are \nthese jobs our troops should be performing today, tomorrow or for an \nindefinite period, as is now projected? These are commendable, \nhumanitarian objectives which should be assumed by entities other than \nthe Armed Forces.\n  In Kosovo--as is the case in Bosnia--there is a level of hatred--\npersonal, ethnic and religious--that is simply beyond our \ncomprehension. When I was in Kosovo in January, I was told that most of \nthe violence in Kosovo is now Albanian on Albanian violence. I find \nthis troubling. The United States and our NATO allies went into this \nregion for the purpose of stopping and reversing the ethnic cleansing \nof Albanians by Serbs. But what has been a consequence of our \ninvolvement? While hundreds of thousands of Albanians have returned to \ntheir homes, tens of thousands of Serbs have been driven from Kosovo--\nthe result of attacks by returning Albanians. Now that the Serb \npopulation of Kosovo--such as it is--has been isolated in small pockets \nof the province, we are seeing growing violence by Albanians against \nfellow Albanians, simply for their past or present association with \nSerbs. In the town of Vitina, I was shown a store, owned by an \nAlbanian, which had been bombed 2 days before our arrival. Why? The \nAlbanian shopkeeper had purchased property from a Serb--he was a \n``collaborator'' in the minds of hardline Albanians.\n  Is it realistic for us to think that these people can ever live \ntogether peacefully? Or are we wasting our time and money--and \nneedlessly risking the lives of our people--trying to achieve the goal \nof a multiethnic society for Bosnia and Kosovo?\n  I believe that we have reached that point in time when it is the \nresponsibility of the Congress to take action--to reexamine the goals, \ntheir achievability, and what appears to be our open-ended involvement \nin Bosnia and Kosovo for an undetermined period of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER: The Senator from Delaware.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Roth pertaining to the submission of S.

Mr. President, I rise to express my strong opposition to \nthe use of block grants in education spending.\n  First, education is clearly the No. 1 issue this body, our \nGovernment, and our country will face in the next decade. We have huge \neducational problems. We are now an ideas economy. Alan Greenspan put \nit best. He said: High value is no longer added by moving things but by \nthinking things, that it is an idea that produces value.\n  In that kind of time and place, what could be more important than \neducation? In an ideas economy, for America to have a mediocre \neducational system, which is what we have now, is a very real crisis. \nIf we continue to be rated 15th, 16th, 17th among the educational \nsystems of the OECD Western countries, the 22 countries in North \nAmerica, Asia, and Europe, we are not going to stay the greatest \ncountry in the world by the time 2025 or 2050 rolls around. \nFortunately, because of our democratic system and our free enterprise \nsystem, because of the great entrepreneurial nature of America, because \nwe accept ambitious and intelligent people from all over the world to \ncome here and grow and prosper, we have a little lead time but not \nmuch.\n  Our educational system is at a critical point. Over the next decade, \nfor instance, high school enrollment will increase by 11 percent. \nSchools will need\n\n[[Page S595]]\n\nto hire 2.2 million public schoolteachers. Over 50 percent of the \nteachers are over 50 years old. Every day more than 14 million children \nwill attend schools in need of extensive repair and replacement, and 12 \npercent of all newly hired teachers who enter the workforce will enter \nwithout any training at all. That will be even higher in math and \nscience, computer science, engineering, and languages, the kinds of \nthings for which we need people.\n\n  So with the crisis upon us, all of a sudden we have a new proposal: a \nblock grant. A block grant is exactly what we don't need to improve the \neducational system. A block grant is something that gives the school \ndistricts more money and doesn't direct them on how to spend it.\n  I find there is a contradiction among so many of my friends who are \nstrong advocates of block grants. They say the educational system is \npoor. I agree in many instances. They say we spend too much money and \nwaste too much money on education. Then they say: Give those same \nlocalities, without any direction, more money.\n  They can't have it both ways. Either the localities are doing a good \njob and need more money, which they are not professing because they \nreally don't think they need more money, or the localities are doing a \nbad job and to give them more money makes very little sense at all.\n  The notion that we should take Federal dollars, which have been used \nto raise academic standards, reduce class size, recruit new teachers, \nhold schools accountable, and send them in an unmarked paper bag to the \nGovernors breaks our commitment to help communities and parents across \nthe country. Block grants are a blank check from the Federal \nGovernment. They fundamentally make no sense. They are bad government \npolicy.\n  I am sure many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would \nagree with me that to separate the taxing authority and the spending \nauthority makes no sense. The spending authority for that spending, if \nthey don't have to raise the taxes, painful as that is, is not going to \nspend it as wisely as somebody who knows how important those dollars \nare.\n  Sometimes I think we would be a lot better off eliminating the block \ngrant program and giving the money back to the taxpayers rather than \nthe Federal Government taxing and then giving this blank check to the \nlocality and letting them spend it.\n  A block grant is poor government policy to begin with because it \nseparates the spending power from the taxing power. In education, it is \neven worse. We hear clamor in the land that the local school districts \nare not doing a good job. I have sympathy for those local school \ndistricts. First, they are so busy minute to minute and day to day \ntrying to run a school system. They are up to their necks. Second, \ntheir only spending power is from the property tax--justifiably the \nmost hated tax in America--so they can't raise new dollars.\n  I have sympathy for those local school districts, but we all agree \nthey are not doing as good a job as they might. The irony is that my \ncolleagues from the other side of the aisle would probably say it is \nnot more money. It is wasted money. Yet here we are, giving them more \nmoney.\n  In today's global ideas-based economy, we cannot afford to have an \natomized educational system. Instead, the trend must be for local, \nState, and Federal governments to work together with families and \ncommunities. What is very interesting about any public good is that \nthere is no capitalism. Good ideas don't spread on their own. If \nsomeone invented a new heart valve in San Diego, it would spread to \nBoston in an hour. Why? Someone would sell it. That is what America is \nall about. But when a new educational innovation develops in one school \ndistrict, it doesn't spread, frankly, because there is no capitalism.\n  The appropriate role of the Federal Government in education is to \nfind what works and, on a matching grant basis, say to the locality, \nthis is a program that works. We will pay half or three-quarters of the \ncost because we know you are strapped based on these high property \ntaxes. You pay some and use it. We are not requiring you to use it. I \ndon't like mandates. We are giving you the opportunity to use it \nbecause we have seen it works in some areas.\n  When I was working on the crime bill, this is what we did. We found \nthere were, again, programs that worked.\n  Community policing: Wichita, KS, had developed community policing and \ndone it well. But it hadn't spread to Topeka. So I put in a bill when I \nwas chairman of the Crime Subcommittee in the other body and I said \nlet's give the localities money to do community policing on a matching \ngrant basis. The President came in, and in his usual intelligent and \nastute way on these matters, said let's call it ``100,000 cops on the \nbeat.'' So we did and it has worked. It changed policing in America.\n\n  Without that program, we would not have had community policing. But \nthe Federal Government played the appropriate role--finding a good \nidea, giving money as an incentive to help spread the idea--not 100 \npercent; that is a bad idea, not even 90 percent. Then it is like a \nblock grant with no strings attached and money gets wasted. And then \nthey let it happen. It is not bureaucracy that is the problem in \nFederal aid to education, as some who support the block grant would \nsay. Only one-half of 1 percent of Federal aid to schools is spent on \nadministration. The States use an additional 4 percent. All the rest, \n95\\1/2\\ percent, goes to local school districts. It is not bureaucracy \nat all. In fact, the claims of those who spin stories of a grand \nFederal education bureaucracy ring hollow. In a letter written to the \nPresident by the House Committee on Education in the Workforce in 1997, \nthe committee majority listed 760 so-called educational programs. They \nsaid we have too many. Combine them.\n  Look at the programs they call ``educational'' programs: Boating \nsafety financial assistance, Air Force defense research sciences, \nbiological response to environmental health hazards, financial \nassistance for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n  Those are not educational programs. In truth, the Federal Government \nprovides, on average, only 7 percent of all K-through-12 educational \nfunding. It is the State and local communities that should and do \nmaintain control over educational priorities. But what Washington can \ndo is help communities meet certain reform priorities when their \nbudgets are stretched too thin. Again, if the system isn't working, why \ngive more money with no strings attached to the very localities that we \nthink can do better? Why not do it in a way that directs them? Sure, \nthe local school board wants free money. Fine. Let them raise taxes and \ndo it for themselves. Don't let us put more burden on the Federal \ntaxpayers to do it.\n  Proponents of the block grants argue strenuously that control should \nbe returned to the localities. But the irony here is the block grants \nwould not return power to the communities; rather, it shifts control of \nthe Federal funding away from parents and communities and gives it to \npoliticians--Governors and the State legislature. This is the \nantithesis of local control.\n  What I would like to do before I conclude is look at a couple of \nexamples of block grant proposals. The Straight A's Act gives the \nStates and the Governors the authority to combine into a block grant \nFederal funds from 10 educational programs. More than 80 percent of all \nFederal support to elementary and secondary education will be included \nin the block grant. This sounds to me like LEA. I remember Law \nEnforcement Assistance--a block grant to law enforcement. That is the \narea in which I have the most expertise. Do you know what they did when \nno strings were attached? One police department bought a tank; another \npolice department bought an airplane to take the police officers back \nand forth to Washington--I think it was a jet-- all with block grant \nmoney. If we do this Straight A's Program, we will be back on the floor \nof the Senate a year or two later pointing out horror stories of how \nthe taxpayers' money was wasted.\n\n  Under Straight A's, parents, teachers, principals, and school boards \nwould no longer have a say in how the Federal dollars are spent. \nSchools would no longer be accountable for results and national \npriorities, such as funding for the neediest students and better \nteachers. New school buildings could be put aside for more salaries for \nadministrators. If this program gets straight\n\n[[Page S596]]\n\nA's, I would like to see what the curve is in that classroom.\n  The Senate Health Committee intends to mark up a reauthorization of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act in the next few weeks. I am \nconcerned to learn that the bill currently includes a block grant for \nteacher quality and professional development, programs to reduce class \nsize and Goals 2000. Yes, we need qualified teachers and smaller \nclasses. They produce the best results for children. But with the \ncommittee bill, there is no guarantee that class size reduction or \nteacher development will be done well, or even done at all.\n  I ask my colleagues to look at the proposal that Senator Kennedy is \nputting together. His leadership on this issue has been extraordinary. \nHis proposal does not intend to dictate to localities what they must do \nor impose new mandates on localities. Rather, it says, here are our \nFederal priorities; do you want to be part of them? They include \nsmaller class size and new school construction. Fine. You are going to \nmatch our dollars. If you don't want to be part of them, keep doing the \nsame old thing, but not with Federal dollars, Federal taxpayer money, \nwhich gives you a free ride.\n  I hope my colleagues will look at Senator Kennedy's proposal and will \nexamine the folly of block grants. I look forward to the debate that \nmay come on education in the near future.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 \nminutes, and in the normal routine to return to Senator Murkowski from \nAlaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S596-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S596-S598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY AMENDMENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, yesterday, I commented on the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act amendments. I thought then, and I think today, there \nare a few remarks that I probably ought to make aside from \ncomplimenting the distinguished Senator for his untiring efforts to \naddress nuclear waste in a logical and sensible way.\n  Mr. President, I rise to compliment Senator Murkowski's leadership on \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act. I appreciate his efforts to \nenable progress on the nation's need for concrete action on spent \nnuclear fuel.\n  I find it amazing how fear of anything in this country with \n``nuclear'' in its title, like ``nuclear waste'', seems to paralyze our \nability to act decisively. Nuclear issues are immediately faced with \nimmense political challenges.\n  There are many great examples of how nuclear technologies impact our \ndaily lives. Yet few of our citizens know enough about the benefits \nwe've gained from harnessing the nucleus to support actions focused on \nreducing the remaining risks.\n  Just one example that should be better understood and appreciated \ninvolves our nuclear navy. Their experience has important lessons for \nbetter understanding of these technologies.\n  The Nautilus, our first nuclear powered submarine, was launched in \n1954. Since then, the Navy has launched over 200 nuclear powered ships, \nand about 85 are currently in operation. Recently, the Navy was \noperating slightly over 100 reactors, about the same number as those \noperating in civilian power stations across the country.\n  The Navy's safety record is exemplary. Our nuclear ships are welcomed \ninto over 150 ports in over 50 countries. A 1999 review of their safety \nrecord was conducted by the General Accounting Office. That report \nstated: ``No significant accident--one resulting in fuel degradation--\nhas ever occurred.'' For an Office like GAO, that identifies and \npublicizes problems with government programs, that's a pretty \nimpressive statement.\n  Our nuclear powered ships have traveled over 117 million miles \nwithout serious incidents. Further, the Navy has commissioned 33 new \nreactors in the 1990s, that puts them ahead of civilian power by a \nscore of 33 to zero. And Navy reactors have more than twice the \noperational hours of our civilian systems.\n  The nuclear navy story is a great American success story, one that is \ncompletely enabled by appropriate and careful use of nuclear power. \nIt's contributed to the freedoms we so cherish.\n  Nuclear energy is another great American success story. It now \nsupplies about 20 percent of our nation's electricity, it is not a \nsupply that we can afford to lose. It's done it without release of \ngreenhouse gases, with a superlative safety record over the last \ndecade. The efficiency of nuclear plants has risen consistently and \ntheir operating costs are among the lowest of all energy sources.\n  I've repeatedly emphasized that the United States must maintain \nnuclear energy as a viable option for future energy requirements. And \nwithout some near-term waste solution, like interim storage or an early \nreceipt facility, we are killing this option. We may be depriving \nfuture generations of a reliable power source that they may desperately \nneed.\n  There is no excuse for the years that the issue of nuclear waste has \nbeen with us. Near-term credible solutions are not technically \ndifficult. We absolutely must progress towards early receipt of spent \nfuel at a central location, at least faster than the 2010 estimates for \nopening Yucca Mountain that we now face or risk losing nuclear power in \nthis country.\n  Senator Murkowski's bill is a significant step toward breaking the \ndeadlock which countries to threaten the future of nuclear energy in \nthe U.S. I appreciate that he made some very tough decisions in \ncrafting this bill that blends ideas from many sources to seek \ncompromise in this difficult area.\n  One concession involves tying the issuance of a license for the \n``early receipt facility'' to construction authorization for the \npermanent repository. I'd much prefer that we simply moved ahead with \ninterim storage. An interim storage facility can proceed on its own \nmerits, quite independent of decisions surrounding a permanent \nrepository. Such an interim storage facility could be operational well \nbefore the ``early receipt facility'' authorized in this Act.\n  There are absolutely no technical issues associated with interim \nstorage in dry casks, other countries certainly use it. Nevertheless, \nin the interests of seeking a compromise on this issue, I will support \nthis Act's approach with the early receipt facility.\n  I appreciate that Senator Murkowski has included Title III in the new \nbill with my proposal to create a new DOE Office of Spent Nuclear Fuel \nResearch. This new Office would organize a research program to explore \nnew, improved national strategies for spent nuclear fuel.\n  Spent fuel has immense energy potential--that we are simply tossing \naway with our focus only on a permanent repository. We could be \nrecycling that spent fuel back into civilian fuel and extracting \nadditional energy. We could follow the examples of France, the U.K., \nand Japan in reprocessing the fuel to not only extract more energy, but \nalso to reduce the volume and toxicity of the final waste forms.\n  Now, I'm well aware that reprocessing is not viewed as economically \ndesirable now, because of today's very low uranium prices. Furthermore, \nit must only be done with careful attention to proliferation issues. \nBut I submit that the U.S. should be prepared for a future evaluation \nthat may determine that we are too hasty today to treat this spent fuel \nas waste, and that instead we should have been viewing it as an energy \nresource for future generations.\n  We do not have the knowledge today to make that decision. Title III \nestablishes a research program to evaluate options to provide real data \nfor such a future decision.\n  This research program would have other benefits. We may want to \nreduce the toxicity of materials in any repository to address public \nconcerns. Or we may find we need another repository in the future, and \nwant to incorporate advanced technologies into the final waste products \nat that time. We could, for example, decide that we want to maximize \nthe storage potential of a future repository, and that would require \nsome treatment of the spent fuel before final disposition.\n  Title III requires that a range of advanced approaches for spent fuel \nbe studied with the new Office of Spent Nuclear Fuel Research. As we do \nthis,\n\n[[Page S597]]\n\nI'll encourage the Department to seek international cooperation. I \nknow, based on personal contacts, that France, Russia, and Japan are \neager to join with us in an international study of spent fuel options.\n  Title III requires that we focus on research programs that minimize \nproliferation and health risks from the spent fuel. And it requires \nthat we study the economic implications of each technology.\n  With Title III, the United States will be prepared, some years in the \nfuture, to make the most intelligent decision regarding the future of \nnuclear energy as one of our major power sources. Maybe at that time, \nwe'll have other better energy alternatives and decide that we can move \naway from nuclear power. Or we may find that we need nuclear energy to \ncontinue and even expand its current contribution to our nation's power \ngrid. In any case, this research will provide the framework to guide \nCongress in these future decisions.\n  Mr. President, I want to specifically discuss one of the compromises \nthat Senator Murkowski has developed in his manager's amendment. In my \nview, his largest compromise involves the choice between the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to \nset the radiation-protection standards for Yucca Mountain and for the \n``early release facility.''\n  The NRC has the technical expertise to set these standards. \nFurthermore, the NRC is a non-political organization, in sharp contrast \nto the political nature of the EPA. We need unbiased technical \nknowledge in setting these standards, there should be no place for \npolitics at all. The EPA has proposed a draft standard already, that \nhas been widely criticized for its inconsistency and lack of scientific \nrigor--events that do not enhance their credibility for this role.\n  I appreciate, however, the care that Senator Murkowski has \ndemonstrated in providing the ultimate authority to the EPA. His new \nlanguage requires both the NRC and the National Academy of Sciences to \ncomment on the EPA's draft standard. And he provides a period of time, \nuntil mid-2001, for the EPA to assess concerns with their standard and \nissue a valid standard.\n  These additions have the effect of providing a strong role for both \nthe NRC and NAS to share their scientific knowledge with the EPA and \nhelp guide the EPA toward a credible standard.\n  The NRC should be complimented for their courageous stand against the \nEPA in this issue. Their issuance of a scientifically appropriate \nstandard stands in stark contrast to the first effort from the EPA. \nThanks to the actions of the NRC, the EPA can be guided toward \nreasonable standards.\n  Certainly, my preference is to have the NRC issue the final standard. \nBut I appreciate the effort that Senator Murkowski has expended in \nseeking compromise in this difficult area.\n  By following the procedures in the manager's amendment, we can allow \nthe EPA to set the final standard, guided by the inputs from the NRC \nand NAS. Thus, I will support the manager's amendment.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Murskowski for his superb \nleadership in preparing this new act. We need to pass this manager's \namendment with a veto-proof majority, to ensure that we finally attain \nsome movement in the nation's ability to deal with high level nuclear \nwaste.\n  We hear so much in the United States about how dangerous nuclear \npower is, how dangerous these fuel rods are that come out of the \nreactors, how dangerous nuclear reactors are, and I thought I might \nshare with whomever is interested a bit of information about how safe \nnuclear powerplants are.\n  In this country, when we talk about moving some of the nuclear waste \nfrom one State to another, people get up in arms and they want to march \ndown the streets because they are frightened to death that something is \ngoing to happen if this nuclear waste moves down the streets, the \nroads, the highways, or whatever. I thought I might share a series of \nfacts with you that might make you think a little bit.\n  First, the U.S. Navy launched the first nuclear-powered submarine in \n1954. We put a nuclear reactor in a submarine and we sent the submarine \nall over the oceans of the world, and nothing ever happened to anyone. \nSince then, the Navy has launched 200 nuclear-powered ships, and about \n85 are currently in operation. In other words, 85 of the U.S. Navy's \nbest and biggest warships are on the high seas with a nuclear reactor--\nin some cases two reactors--on board. Were something to happen, it \nwould permeate and go right through the water. But guess what. Nothing \nhas ever happened to anyone. Guess what else. Every major port in the \nworld accepts America's Navy ships with nuclear reactors on board \ngenerating power to run that ship. Nobody seeks to say: You better keep \nthese away from our port because there are a lot of other ships around \nhere.\n  Why is that, I wonder? Why are we on the floor of the Senate almost \nwhipped up to a lather of fear about moving high-level waste from some \nState in middle America to some State in western America and we have 85 \nnuclear-powered U.S. Navy ships, from battleships on down, moving \naround the high seas and docking at various ports everywhere? Nobody \nhas a sign up. Nobody is frightened. Nothing has ever happened. And \nguess what. Because it was too good to be true, somebody said to go out \nand find out something about them; they must be hurting people with all \nthese nuclear reactors.\n  So the GAO went out and did an extensive and exemplary study about \nwhat they had done and not done. Guess what they found. This is a 1999 \nreview. ``No significant accidents. One resulting in fuel degradation \nhas ever occurred.'' For an office such as the GAO that identifies \npublic problems with Government programs, that is a pretty impressive \nstatement.\n  Our nuclear-powered ships, I say to Senator Murkowski, have traveled \nover 117 million miles on the high seas of the world. Nobody has said \nwe don't want them on the high seas because they have a nuclear \npowerplant in them because they are safe as safe can be. Yet when it \ncomes to us here in America we wonder whether we can transport some \nnuclear waste 200 miles. If we aren't technically sound enough, if we \nare not smart enough, if we are not engineered and qualified to be able \nto move something such as this 200 or 300 miles when the Navy has been \nmoving reactors on the high seas 117 million miles--they have \ncommissioned 33 new reactors in the 1990s. Just think of that. That \nputs them ahead of the civilian power by a score of 33 to 0. Because we \nhave frightened ourselves to death, we will not even license a new \nnuclear powerplant in the United States.\n  We surely are proud as proud can be when we see a great big American \nbattleship or aircraft carrier floating on those high seas with all \nthose Navy guys on board. What do they have? Some of them have two \nnuclear powerplants in the hull loaded with the same kind of waste \nproduct about which we are so worried. The distinguished Senator from \nAlaska is saying: Why don't we just move that and put it in a place \nwhere it can be stored? No one else in the world who is involved in \nnuclear power has tied the future of nuclear power and nuclear use to \nthe ultimate disposition of the high-level waste residue in a permanent \nunderground facility from whence it can never be extracted and for \nwhich the technical requirements are so severe in terms of making sure \nit lasts for 100,000 years--or whatever the number is--that we are \nnever going to get it done. It is amazing. It is just amazing.\n  The country of France gets 87 percent of its electricity from nuclear \npower. They still do not have a plan to put the nuclear waste away \npermanently because they are not frightened about it. They trust their \nintelligent, enlightened leaders, who currently have it in gymnasiums \nabout the size of high schools. That is where it is stored. You can \nwalk on top of it where it is stored and nobody is worried about \nanything. Here we are debating whether we could have a temporary \nstorage facility--as the country that invented it, as the country that \nengineered it, as the country whose great nuclear physicists invented \nthe notion and came up with the idea of how to power-generate it, and \nwe sit, except for the U.S. Navy, letting the rest of the world just \npass us by.\n  The Senator from Alaska will never get the credit he deserves for \ntrying to get this little site, this temporary facility. He will never \nget the credit.\n\n[[Page S598]]\n\n People are thinking we are trying to pull something over on them; we \nmight be hurting people; we are just trying to get it out of one site \nand hide it someplace else.\n  There are 85 U.S. Navy ships, I remind everybody one more time, of \nall sizes, including battleships, aircraft carriers, and some with two \nnuclear powerplants on them. As we stand right here, they are floating \naround on the high seas where the water is all fissionable. If you are \nin this part of the Atlantic, the water will eventually end up over \nhere miles away, and nobody is lodging serious complaints. They may say \nwe don't want the U.S. Navy around for some other reason. And thank God \nwe have them. But they are in ports everywhere. They don't take the \nnuclear powerplant out before they come into a port. Right? They don't \nhave three kinds of motors around. They may have a couple of auxiliary \nmotors. But the nuclear powerplants are right there on board.\n\n  I thought I would just state that part of my statement which I put in \nthe Record yesterday because it is so obvious to me that we are being \nso foolish in tying the ultimate disposition of the high-level waste \ngenerated by 20 percent of our electrical powerplants, which are \nnuclear, to a policy that says unless and until we find a place to put \nthat underground at Yucca--wherever it is in Nevada--forever we will \nnot continue with nuclear power.\n  I believe it is so shortsighted and based on such an insignificant \nset of scientific facts that it is almost as if America just wouldn't \ndo something such as that. But we are doing it. There were letters \ncirculating yesterday that the proposal of the Senator from Alaska \nwould not be helpful; in fact, it would hurt people. I don't think I \nhave to repeat. I think I have made the case.\n  What would the world be doing if in fact nuclear reactors were that \nunsafe and U.S. Navy ships want to dock to let their Navy men go on \nshore for a while and then get on with something else? I do not believe \nthey would be saying: Have we found a place to put the nuclear waste \nthat is coming in on that new battleship that you are generating? Have \nyou found a place to put it away forever? I think they would say: Gee, \nthere is no risk at all involved. It is a pretty good venture. We are \nglad to have you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me thank my good friend from New \nMexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee. We had a chart that we \nused in the debate. That chart showed the 40 States that had the \naccumulated waste--80 sites in 40 States. I wish I would have added the \n85 nuclear ships that are traversing the ocean because the Senator from \nNew Mexico is quite correct. That is something we don't talk much \nabout. It works. The Navy, obviously, has the expertise that has been \ndeveloped over a long period of time. When those submarines or surface \nships are taken out of active duty, reactors are removed. That waste is \ntaken and stored at various areas in the country. Chicken Little was \nsuggested around here today; the world is coming down. It doesn't have \nto come down. It is the emotional arguments that prevail without any \nsound science.\n  I appreciate the input of my good friend and his commitment to the \nobligation that remains unresolved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S598-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S598-S599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEATING OIL PRICES\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to address very briefly a \ncouple of issues. One is the issue of the high cost of heating oil, \nparticularly in the Northeast corridor at this time. I know my \ncolleagues from the Northeast are looking for relief. Perhaps I could \nenlighten them to some extent on the reasons behind why prices are high \nand why stocks are low.\n  I think it is important to recognize a couple of basic facts that \nunderline the whole question; that is, understanding the crude oil and \nheating oil relationship.\n  There are some who suggest we have a shortage of crude. That is the \nreason we have higher prices for heating oil. Factually, however there \nis no refinery in this country that has been short of a supply of crude \noil during this crisis. The problem is the refineries have been cutting \na different mix of product. They cut heating oil. They cut gasoline. \nThey cut diesel fuel as well as other hydrocarbons. They have begun to \ncut other mixes instead of heating oil. So if they change the mix and \nreduce gasoline for heating oil, that could give some relief, but it \nmay ultimately result in a shortage of gasoline during peak usage in \nthe coming months.\n  The basic difficulty is coupled with the fact that the inventories \nwere low. That is perhaps the fault of the industry. But while the \ninventories were low, the crucial problem is the storage areas for \nthese stocks were reduced dramatically. What do I mean by that? I mean \nthe tanks around the metropolitan areas that are conventionally used to \nstore the heating oils, the gasolines, and so forth.\n\n  In the case of New York, petroleum bulk storage capacity has declined \n15 percent over the past 5 years. Why? According to testimony the other \nday from New York State officials on heating oils, this is a \nconsequence of tighter environmental controls that suggest these old \nstorage areas are inadequate or a danger to the environment. That may \nwell be the case. However, the reality is we reduced our storage and as \na consequence we don't have the inventory of heating oils that we would \nhave had if we had the storage available.\n  I am not suggesting that people from New York or anywhere else don't \nneed strong environmental regulations. They do. But we have to \nunderstand how we got into this predicament. That is the reason why the \ninventories are down.\n  Some say the answer is to open up SPR, a strategic petroleum reserve \nin Louisiana. We need to recognize we don't have a shortage of crude \noil at the refineries, and if we further understand that in SPR there \nis no heating oil--it is not refined oil, it is crude oil; therefore, \nby taking oil out of SPR and take it to the refinery, we will displace \nwhat the refinery is already refining to accommodate SPR. So we don't \nhave any net gain.\n  Most people cannot quite understand that. They think SPR is for \nheating oil that can be taken out of SPR and distributed, thereby \neasing the shortage. We cannot do that.\n  I understand the Secretary of Energy will make an announcement today \nor very shortly about the administration's efforts regarding high oil \nprices. Let's look at this because it is important. They will do \nsomething more for the Low-Income Housing Energy Assistance Program, \nwhich provides money for the low-income areas. That is commendable. \nHowever, that does not solve the underlying problem. They will \n``jawbone'' more with the OPEC countries to release more oil. They can \nrelease more oil, but will they reduce the price? That is crude oil \nthat had to be refined. They will encourage refiners to make more \nheating fuels--they might be able to persuade them to do that but it \nwill change the mix and might result in a gasoline shortage this \nsummer.\n  The interesting thing about the administration's response is, nowhere \nis there a commitment that we increase our domestic petroleum \nproduction to make us less dependent on OPEC pricing policies. That \nwould be contrary to the environmental community who objects to the \nproduction domestically of oil and gas. Let me go a step forward. The \nVice President said: If I'm elected I will cancel all the OCS leases, \noil and gas.\n  What does he propose we will do? We cannot address what we will do \nwith our nuclear waste. As far as I'm concerned the administration can \nchoke on that waste. That seems to be their only solution.\n  We have an administration that proposes more new taxes on our \ndomestic oil and gas industry. Think about that. We have a heating oil \ncrisis, we have high prices, there are barges in transit and ships \ncoming over from Europe with heating oil. That may help. We cannot move \nthe crude oil out of SPR fast enough. We cannot get it to refineries \nthat have any unused capacity. And we don't have adequate storage to \nstore the reserves.\n  If you want to debate that issue, as chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee I will try to work with Members. But let's \nbe realistic and try to understand what the problem is and not fool the \npublic.\n  If anyone saw the Coast Guard cutter grinding through the ice on the \nHudson\n\n[[Page S599]]\n\nRiver to try and clear the waterways for the heating supplies to be \ndelivered, they would have a better understanding and appreciation of \nsome of the real problems.\n  I want to work with my colleagues to try and address this but let's \nmake sure we understand the realities associated with that. I have a \nproblem with our continued dependence on jawboning the Middle East \ncountries. Our friend Saddam Hussein is now producing nearly 2 million \nbarrels a day. The consequences of that, in view of the fact we fought \na war not so long ago, suggests that our energy policies are \ninconsistent, to say the least.\n\n  We talked about the administration's ``cure'' to encourage more \nproduction. The President has proposed $50 million in new and expanded \nuser fees over 5 years on our domestic oil companies drilling in \noffshore waters. Is that going to continue to drive production in the \nUnited States? It will continue to drive it overseas and increase our \nreliance on imported oil from foreign shores--and we are 56 percent \ndependent now. The user fees are included in the administration's \nfiscal year 2001 budget. According to reports, the fees would raise $10 \nmillion in each of the next 5 years by increasing rental rates on oil \nleases, among other fees.\n  In addition, we understand the budget recommends reinstating the oil \nspill liability trust fund to add 5 cents a barrel excise on both \ndomestic and imported oil. This equals $350 million per year from all \nsources.\n  Once again, instead of encouraging our domestic oil industry, this \nadministration seeks to discourage it wherever possible. The result is \nthat we are 56 percent dependent on foreign oil; and the Mideast, where \nthat oil comes from, where there is a huge abundance of oil, is sitting \nback nodding their head and smiling as they continue to control the \ndiscipline within their cartel not to allow overproduction and a \ndecline in price.\n  The national energy security of this Nation is at risk as we become \nmore and more dependent on imported oil. We have tremendous domestic \nreserves in this country if we can only open them. My State of Alaska \nhas produced 20 percent of the crude oil produced in the United States \nfor the last 20 years. If allowed on land in Alaska to use the \ntechnology that we have, we can continue not only to produce 20 percent \nbut probably increase that to 30 percent or maybe 40 percent. The \nalternative is to increase our dependence on imported oil.\n  Senator Landrieu and I have a bill, Senate bill 25, that will try and \naddress a fair return to the coastal impact areas offshore and onshore \nrelative to a reasonable revenue stream that ought to come back to \nthese areas as a consequence of oil and gas development on the outer \ncontinental shelf. This is legislation that all coastal States would \nshare in, whether they have any oil and gas activities. This \nlegislation would benefit the environment but it would put control of \nhow that money is spent--not with a central Federal Government dictate, \nbut with the participation of the States and the local communities. \nThat is the way it has to be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S599-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S599-S600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DISTRIBUTING NEW MONEY FAIRLY\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as a former banker, I must draw \nattention to what I consider an extraordinary movement by this \nadministration, the Department of Treasury's decision to distribute the \nU.S. $1 coin to America's largest retailer, Wal-Mart, in Arkansas.\n  Isn't that extraordinary? The banks have always been the agency for \ndistributing new money and the agency for bringing in mutilated money. \nBut for the first time the Department of Treasury has gone to a \nretailer, Wal-Mart, headquartered in President Clinton's home State, I \nmight add, and I am told that as a promotion they have cut a deal with \nGeneral Mills, where there are a few of them in boxes of Cheerios.\n  The banks are the backbone of our financial system. I cannot \nunderstand the logic or the fairness where if you are a banking \ncustomer, and your customers want coins, you have to run down to Wal-\nMart. A private citizen who orders those new coins from the U.S. Mint I \nam told can expect a 6 to 8 week delivery time.\n  I would like to ask the following questions. Who made the decision to \ngive these companies, Wal-Mart particularly, the ability to distribute \ncoins before the banks? I would like to know the name of the person who \nmade that judgment; and what part of Arkansas he was from? Was it a \nprocedure similar to awarding Federal contracts used in choosing Wal-\nMart and General Mills? I have sent that letter to Lawrence Summers, \nand I hope we can get a response very soon.\n  I yield the floor and encourage everybody who has a box of Cheerios \nto be sure and shake it because there might be a new dollar in it. \nDon't go to your bank because they will not have it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter, and an article that appeared \nin the Wall Street Journal, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Lawrence Summers,\n     Secretary, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Summers: I am surprised and very concerned \n     about the method the Department of the Treasury has chosen to \n     distribute the U.S. Mint's new one dollar coin. America's \n     largest retailer, Wal-Mart, headquartered in President \n     Clinton's home state, has been given priority over our \n     nation's banks to distribute these coins. I find it hard to \n     believe that any federal agency would deliberately give such \n     a marketing advantage to a private retailer, let alone the \n     largest retailer in America. Select boxes of General Mills' \n     Cheerios contain the new dollar coins.\n       According to an article in today's Wall Street Journal, \n     banks, which are the backbone of our financial system do not \n     have this type of ready access to these new coins. Some \n     bankers were quoted as saying they are referring people who \n     want the new coins to Wal-Mart. Moreover, a private citizen \n     who orders these new coins from the U.S. Mint can expect a 6-\n     8 week delivery time.\n       I would like you to answer the following questions. Who \n     made the decision to give these companies the ability to \n     distribute the coins before banks? Was a procedure similar to \n     the awarding of federal contracts used in choosing Wal-Mart \n     and General Mills?\n       I look forward to your prompt response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Frank H. Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Bankers Assail Mint for Deal With Wal-Mart\n\n                           (By Julia Angwin)\n\n       Bank tellers at First State Bank in Middlebury, Ind., have \n     recently been going to unusual lengths to fill their coin \n     drawers. While on lunch break, they would sprint to the local \n     Wal-Mart store to buy the government's newly minted $1 coin.\n       ``We thought if we could get 50 or 100 coins, then maybe we \n     could give them to our customers,'' says Sara Baker, the bank \n     officer that organized the tellers.\n       When a bank goes to Wal-Mart to get its money, something \n     odd is going on. In this case, it's a new strategy the U.S. \n     Mint adopted when it issued the new golden-colored dollar, \n     featuring the image of Native American heroine Sacagawea, at \n     the end of January. Prompted by the flop of the Susan B. \n     Anthony coin 20 years ago, the Mint crafted an agreement with \n     Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, allowing it to \n     essentially have first dibs over most banks on the new coin.\n       The U.S. Mint says it shipped the coins to 3,000 Wal-Mart \n     and Sam's Club stores and the 12 regional Federal Reserve \n     Banks on the same day, Jan. 27. But it mailed the coins to \n     Wal-Mart, while it sent the coins to the Fed branches by \n     truck. Many community banks are reporting a five-week wait \n     for the coins that they have ordered from the Federal \n     Reserve.\n       The delay has caused a furor among some bankers, who are \n     embarrassed that they have to send coin-seeking customers to \n     Wal-Mart, and among some business owners, who complain they \n     can't get the coins from banks.\n       ``Wal-Mart doesn't need any more advantages over a little \n     business like mine,'' said Bill Taylor, owner of Boiling \n     Springs Hardware & Rental in South Carolina, who tried \n     unsuccessfully to get some dollar coins from his local banks.\n       * * * off an angry letter to the U.S. Mint on behalf of its \n     members, protesting the agreement with Wal-Mart and asking \n     the Mint to speed delivery to community banks of the golden \n     coins. Dubbed the Golden Dollar by the Mint, the new coin is \n     actually made of an alloy of manganese, brass and copper.\n       ``The U.S. Mint has done an end run around the whole \n     banking system,'' says Ann McKenna, vice president for \n     finance at Tioga State Bank in Spencer, N.Y. ``It's very \n     disappointing.''\n       In fact, the Mint planned the Wal-Mart agreement as a way \n     of encouraging U.S. banks to order the new golden dollar coin \n     in larger numbers than their orders for the Susan B. Anthony. \n     And it has worked. The demand for the new coin has reached \n     200 million in the first month. It took the Susan B. Anthony \n     four years to reach that level.\n\n[[Page S600]]\n\n       U.S. Mint Director Philip Diehl says he doesn't mind the \n     controversy as long as the coin is a success. ``I'd rather \n     have a noisy success than a quiet failure,'' he says.\n       Mr. Diehl says the U.S. Mint got a lukewarm response from \n     most banks when it first approached them about potential \n     demand for the coin last summer. In response, he says, the \n     Mint decided to talk to some retailers about putting the coin \n     into circulation. Only two retailers showed interest: Wal-\n     Mart Stores Inc., of Bentonville, Ark., and 7-Eleven Inc., of \n     Dallas. At the same time, the Mint also crafted an agreement \n     with General Mills Inc. to distribute the coin in selected \n     Cheerios boxes--11 million in all--beginning last month.\n       Because of the logistical difficulties of distributing \n     coins to its stores, 7-Eleven dropped out of the agreement, \n     says Dana Manley, marketing communications manager for the \n     convenience-store chain. However, Wal-Mart was willing to buy \n     100 million coins and promote them nationally in its stores.\n       Wal-Mart spokeswoman Laura Pope says the company was \n     excited to work with the Mint. ``Our goal is to offer \n     customers something unique that they can only find at Wal-\n     Mart and Sam's Club stores,'' she says. Wal-Mart promoted the \n     new coin in a mailing distributed to 90 million customers at \n     the end of January.\n       The Mint's Wal-Mart strategy seems to have worked, helped \n     by the coin's golden color, to make the new dollar more \n     popular than its Anthony predecessor. Most banks in search of \n     the coin have started referring their customers to Wal-Mart. \n     Even Ms. Baker eventually gave up on her quest to buy coins \n     from the local Wal-Mart for her bank branch.\n       After two days of buying a few coins at a time (each Wal-\n     Mart has its own policy of how many coins it will give out at \n     one time), her tellers rebelled. ``Some employees went out \n     and said, `I could only get three coins and I'm keeping \n     them,' '' she says. ``Frankly, now we're telling customers to \n     go to Wal-Mart.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S600-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CHANGING OUR TAX CODE\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we talk a lot here about tax cuts. We \ntalk about tax increases. But we do not often talk about changing our \nTax Code. The President's proposal makes 192 separate changes to the \nTax Code. The IRS book is about 5 pounds. The code itself is already \n3,400 pages of text. That is 1,600 pages longer than the King James \nversion of the Bible, and at least the Bible is large type, but you \nneed a magnifying glass to read the IRS code. There are more than 2000 \nseparate sections of the Code, tens of thousands of subsections, tens \nof thousands of pages of regulations and interpretive rulings. Now the \nPresident wants to add another 192 sections to the code which will \nsurely make up several hundred additional pages of mindless complexity.\n  As I indicated, the President is proposing more than $95 billion of \nnew taxes on a wide variety of industries. There are new taxes that are \nbeing proposed at a time when the Government is already taking in more \nthan it spends. I wonder if there is any end to Washington's appetite \nfor more money from the American people.\n  Regarding especially the President's proposal to impose $1 billion in \nnew taxes on our mining industry, I guess he is trying to drive it \noffshore. The President has submitted this proposal every year for at \nleast the past 4 years and I say this proposal is going to meet the \nsame fate it has met every time it has been sent to the hill. It will \nbe killed, and I can promise you that. I can assure you, the same \ntired, worn-out proposals to add $13 billion of new taxes to the \ninsurance industry will never again see the light of day. I notice \nthere are other proposals the President has proposed, but I am sure \nmost of my colleagues share my sentiment that we do not need to raise \ntaxes by $95 billion at this time, when most of what is contained in \nthe tax code should be summarily rejected.\n  I conclude by saying what we need is tax reform. As a consequence, \nthe President's proposal to add 192 separate sections to the Tax Code \nhardly is reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S600-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. Smith's \nviews on the federal election laws, as expressed in law review \narticles, interviews, op-eds, speeches over the past half decade are \ndisturbing, to say the least. He should not be on the regulatory body \ncharged with enforcing and interpreting those very laws.\n  Today I am placing a very public hold on this nomination. I will \nobject to its consideration on the floor and I ask all of my colleagues \nwho support campaign finance reform to oppose this nomination.\n  In a 1997 opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Smith wrote \nthe following:\n\n       When a law is in need of continual revision to close a \n     series of ever-changing ``loopholes,'' it is probably the \n     law, and not the people, that is in error. The most sensible \n     reform is a simple one: repeal of the Federal Election \n     Campaign Act.\n\n  That's right, the man who the President has just nominated to serve \non the Federal Election Commission believes the Federal campaign laws \nshould be repealed. Thomas Jefferson said we should have a revolution \nin this country every 20 years. He believed that laws should constantly \nbe revised and revisited to make sure they were responsive to the needs \nof society at any given time. Yet, Mr. Smith sees the need for loophole \nclosing in the federal election laws as evidence that the whole system \nshould be scrapped.\n  In a policy paper published by the Cato Institute, for whom Mr. Smith \nhas written extensively in recent years, he says the following:\n\n       FECA [the Federal Election Campaign Act] and its various \n     state counterparts are profoundly undemocratic and profoundly \n     at odds with the First Amendment.\n\n  I wonder how Mr. Smith will reconcile those views with his new \nposition as one of six individuals responsible for enforcing \nand implementing the statute and any future reforms that the Congress \nmight pass. He has shown such extreme disdain in his writings and \npublic statements for the very law he would be charged to enforce that \nI simply do not think he should be entrusted with this important \nresponsibility.\n\n  It is especially ironic and disheartening that this nomination has \nbeen made at a time when the prospects for reform and the legal \nlandscape for those reforms have never looked better. We are all aware \nthat certain Presidential candidates have highlighted campaign finance \nissues with great success. The public is more aware than ever of the \ncritical need for reform. Campaign finance reform is and will be a \nmajor issue in the 2000 Presidential race.\n  In addition, just a few weeks ago, the Supreme Court issued a ringing \nreaffirmation of the core holding of the Buckley decision that forms \nthe basis for the reform effort. The Court once again held that \nCongress has the constitutional power to limit contributions to \npolitical campaigns in order to protect the integrity of the political \nprocess from corruption or the appearance of corruption. In upholding \ncontribution limits imposed by the Missouri legislature, Justice Souter \nwrote for the Court:\n\n       [T]here is little reason to doubt that sometimes large \n     contributions will work actual corruption of our political \n     system, and no reason to question the existence of a \n     corresponding suspicion among voters.\n\n  In my view, the Supreme Court's ruling in the Shrink Missouri case \nremoves all doubt as to whether the Court would uphold the \nconstitutionality of a ban on soft money, which is the centerpiece of \nthe reform bill that has passed the House and is now awaiting Senate \naction. One hundred twenty-seven legal scholars have written to us that \na soft money ban is constitutional, and their analysis is strongly \nsupported by this very recent decision of the Supreme Court.\n  Mr. Smith has a wholly different view of the core holding of Buckley, \non which the arguments supporting the\n\n[[Page S601]]\n\nconstitutionality of banning soft money relies. He wrote the following \nin a 1997 law review article:\n\n       Whatever the particulars of reform proposals, it is \n     increasingly clear that reformers have overstated the \n     government interest in the anticorruption rationale. Money's \n     alleged corrupting influence are far from proven. . . . . \n     [T]hat portion of Buckley that relies on the anticorruption \n     rationale is itself the weakest portion of the Buckley \n     opinion--both in its doctrinal foundations and in its \n     empirical ramifications.\n\n  In another article, Mr. Smith writes: ``I do think that Buckley is \nprobably wrong in allowing contribution limits.''\n  Mr. Smith's view, as quoted by the Columbus Dispatch, is that \n``people should be allowed to spend whatever they want on politics.'' \nIn an interview on MSNBC, he said, ``I think we should deregulate and \njust let it go. That's how our politics was run for over 100 years.''\n  He is right about that. Mr. Smith would have us go back to the late \n19th century, before Theodore Roosevelt pushed through the 1907 Tillman \nAct, which prohibited corporate contributions to federal elections. Mr. \nSmith has expressed the view that a soft money ban would be \nunconstitutional. He wrote the following in a paper for the Notre Dame \nLaw School Journal of Legislation:\n\n       [R]egardless of what one thinks about soft money, or what \n     one thinks about the applicable Supreme Court precedents, a \n     blanket ban on soft money would be, under clear, well-\n     established First Amendment doctrine, constitutionally \n     infirm.\n\n  A majority of this Senate has voted repeatedly in favor of a soft \nmoney ban. I cannot imagine that that same majority will vote to \nconfirm a nominee who believes such a ban is unconstitutional. We need \nan FEC that will vote to enforce the law and to interpret it in a way \nthat is consistent with congressional intent. I simply have no \nconfidence--I do not know how I can get confidence--that Mr. Smith will \nbe able do that--how can he? It would be completely at odds with his \nown loudly professed principles.\n  This is not a matter of personality. I have never met Mr. Smith. I am \nsure he is a good person. I do not question his right to criticize the \nlaws from his outside perch as a law professor and commentator. But his \nviews on the very laws he will be called upon to enforce give rise to \ngrave doubt as to whether he can faithfully execute the duties of a \nCommissioner on the FEC. It is simply not possible for him to distance \nhimself from views he has repeatedly and stridently expressed now that \nhe is nominated. We would not accept such disclaimers from individuals \nnominated to head other agencies of Government.\n  The campaign finance laws are not undemocratic. They are not \nunconstitutional. They are essential to the functioning of our \ndemocratic process and to the faith of the people in their government. \nAs the Supreme Court said in the Shrink Missouri case:\n\n       Leave the perception of impropriety unanswered, and the \n     cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could \n     jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in \n     democratic governance. Democracy works only if the people \n     have faith in those who govern, and that faith is bound to be \n     shattered when high officials and their appointees engage in \n     activities which arouse suspicions of ``malfeasance and \n     corruption.''\n\n  In the wake of that clear declaration by the Court, how can Bradley \nSmith continue to rationalize the gutting of the Federal Election \nCampaign Act? And how can we allow him the chance to carry it out as a \nmember of the FEC?\n  We need FEC Commissioners who understand and accept the simple and \nbasic precepts about the influence of money on our political system \nthat the Court reemphasized in the Shrink Missouri case. We need FEC \nCommissioners who believe in the laws they are sworn to uphold. We do \nnot need FEC Commissioners who have an ideological agenda contrary to \nthe core rationale of the laws they must administer.\n  The public is entitled to FEC Commissioners who they can be confident \nwill not work to gut the efforts of Congress to provide fair and \ndemocratic rules to govern our political systems. I will oppose this \nnomination and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon).

Economic and Budget\n  Outlook.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Lyndon Johnson balanced the budget in \n1969. At that time, the national debt was $365 billion with an interest \ncost of only $16 billion. Now, under a new generation without the cost \nof a war, the debt has soared to $5.6 trillion with annual interest \ncosts of $365 billion. That is right. We spend $1 billion a day for \nnothing. It does not buy any defense, any education, any health care, \nor highways. Astoundingly, since President Johnson balanced the budget, \nwe have increased spending $349 billion for nothing.\n  Early each morning, the Federal Government goes down to the bank and \nborrows $1 billion and adds it to the national debt. We have not had a \nsurplus for 30 years. Senator Trent Lott, commenting on President \nClinton's State of the Union Address, said the talk cost $1 billion a \nminute. For an hour-and-a-half talk, that would be $90 billion a year. \nGovernor George W. Bush's tax cut costs $90 billion a year. Together, \nthat is $180 billion. Just think, we can pay for both the Democratic \nand Republican programs with the money we are spending on interest and \nstill have $185 billion to pay down the national debt. Instead, the \ndebt increases, interest costs increase, while all in town, all in the \nCongress, shout: Surplus, surplus, surplus.\n  Understand the game. Ever since President Johnson's balanced budget, \nthe Government has spent more each year than it has taken in--a \ndeficit. The average deficit for the past 30 years was $175 billion a \nyear. This is with both Democratic and Republican Presidents and \nDemocratic and Republican Congresses. Somebody wants to know why the \neconomy is good? If you infuse $175 billion a year for some 30 years \nand do not pay for it, it ought to be good.\n  The trick to calling a deficit a surplus is to have the Government \nborrow from itself. The Federal Government, like an insurance company, \nhas various funds held in reserve to pay benefits of the program--\nSocial Security, Medicare, military retirement, civilian retirement, \nunemployment compensation, highway funds, airport funds, railroad \nretirement funds.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a list \nof trust funds looted to balance this budget.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                            1998       1999       2000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSocial Security........................        730        855      1,009\nMedicare:\n    HI.................................        118        154        176\n    SMI................................         40         27         34\nMilitary Retirement....................        134        141        149\nCivilian Retirement....................        461        492        522\nUnemployment...........................         71         77         85\nHighway................................         18         28         31\nAirport................................          9         12         13\nRailroad Retirement....................         22         24         25\nOther..................................         53         59         62\n                                        --------------------------------\n      Total............................      1,656      1,869      2,106\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, these funds are held in trust for the \nspecific purpose for which the taxes are collected.\n  Under corporate law, it is a felony to pay off the company debt with \nthe pension fund. But in Washington we pay down the public debt with \ntrust funds, call it a surplus, and they give us the ``Good \nGovernment'' award.\n  To make it sound correct, we divide the debt in two: The public debt \nand the private debt. Of course, our Government is public, and the law \ntreats the debt as public without separation. The separation allows \nWashington politicians to say: We have paid down the public debt and \nhave a surplus. There is no mention, of course, that the Government \ndebt is increased by the same amount that the public debt is decreased. \nIt is like paying off your MasterCard with your Visa card and saying \nyou do not owe anything. Dr. Dan Crippen, the Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office, describes this as ``taking from one pocket \nand putting it in the other.''\n  For years we have been using the trust funds to report a unified \nbudget and a unified deficit. This has led people to believe the \nGovernment was reporting net figures. It sounded authentic. But as the \nunified deficit appeared less and less, the national debt continued to \nincrease. While the unified deficit in 1997 was $21.9 billion, the \nactual deficit was $187.8 billion. In 1998 the unified budget reported \na surplus of $70 billion, but actually there was a deficit of $109 \nbillion. In 1999 the ``unified surplus'' was $124 billion, but the \nactual deficit was $127.8 billion.\n  Now comes the Presidential campaign. Social Security is a hot topic. \nBoth parties are shouting: Save Social Security. Social Security \nlockbox. The economy is humming, booming. With high employment, the \nSocial Security revenues have increased. It appears that, separate from \nSocial Security, there will be enough trust fund money to compute a \nsurplus. We have reached the millennium--Utopia--enough money to report \na surplus without spending Social Security.\n  Washington jargon now changes. Instead of a ``unified budget,'' the \nGovernment now reports an ``on-budget'' and an ``off-budget.'' This is \nso we can all call it an on-budget surplus, meaning without Social \nSecurity. But to call it an on-budget surplus, the Government spends \n$96 billion from the other trust funds.\n  We ended last year with a deficit of $128 billion--not a surplus. The \nPresident's budget just submitted shows an actual deficit each year for \nthe next 5 years. Instead of paying down the debt, the President shows, \non page 420 of his budget, the debt increasing from the\n\n[[Page S603]]\n\nyear 2000 to the year 2013--$5.686 trillion to $6.815 trillion, an \nincrease of $1.129 trillion.\n  They are all talking about paying off the debt by 2013, and the \nactual document they submit shows the debt increasing each year, and \nover that period an increase of over $1 trillion.\n  Each year, Congress spends more than the President's budgets. There \nis no chance of a surplus with both sides proposing to reduce revenues \nwith a tax cut. But we have a sweetheart deal: The Republicans will \ncall a deficit a surplus, so they can buy the vote with tax cuts; the \nDemocrats will call the deficit a surplus, so they can buy the vote \nwith increased spending. The worst abuse of campaign finance is using \nthe Federal budget to buy votes.\n  Alan Greenspan could stop this. He could call a deficit a deficit. \nInstead, appearing before Congress in his confirmation hearing, \nGreenspan, talking of the Federal budget, stated: ``I would fear very \nmuch that these huge surpluses . . .'' and on and on. We are in real \ntrouble when Greenspan calls huge deficits ``huge surpluses.'' \nGreenspan thinks his sole role is to protect the financial markets. He \ndoes not want the U.S. Government coming into the market borrowing \nbillions to pay its deficit, crowding out private capital, and running \nup interest costs.\n  But Congress' job is to not only protect the financial markets but \nthe overall economy. Our job, as the board of directors for the Federal \nGovernment, is to make sure the Government pays its bills. In short, \nour responsibility is to eliminate waste.\n\n  The biggest waste of all is to continue to run up the debt with \ndevastating interest costs for nothing. In good times, the least we can \ndo is put this Government on a pay-as-you-go basis. Greenspan's limp \nadmonition to ``pay down the debt'' is just to cover his backside. He \nknows better. He should issue a clarion call to stop increasing the \ndebt. While he is raising interest rates to cool the economy, he should \ncategorically oppose tax cuts to stimulate it.\n  Our only hope is the free press. In the earliest days, Thomas \nJefferson observed, given a choice between a free government and a free \npress, he would choose the latter. Jefferson believed strongly that \nwith the press reporting the truth to the American people, the \nGovernment would stay free.\n  Our problem is that the press and media have joined the conspiracy to \ndefraud. They complain lamely that the Federal budget process is too \ncomplicated, so they report ``surplus.'' Complicated it is. But as to \nbeing a deficit or a surplus is clear cut; it is not complicated at \nall. All you need to do is go to the Department of the Treasury's \nreport on public debt. They report the growth in the national debt \nevery day, every minute, on the Internet at \n``www.publicdebt.treas.gov.''\n  In fact, there is a big illuminated billboard on Sixth Avenue in New \nYork that reports the increase in the debt by the minute. At present, \nit shows that we are increasing the debt every minute by $894,000. \nThink of that--$894,000 a minute. Of course, increase the debt, and \ninterest costs rise. Already, interest costs exceed the defense budget. \nInterest costs, like taxes, must be paid. Worse, while regular taxes \nsupport defense, and other programs, interest taxes support waste. \nRunning a deficit of over $100 billion today, any tax cut amounts to an \ninterest tax increase--an increase in waste.\n  If the American people realized what was going on, they would run us \nall out of town.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Chair and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes addressing a \nmatter that is very important to the people of my home State of Montana \nbut also to about 50 million other Americans. Universal access to \ntechnology and services all across our country is a very important \nprinciple in American history. From the Postal Service to electricity \nto phone service, we have all made sure, as a national policy, that all \nAmericans have access to the basic services they need.\n  Now we need to make sure all Americans also receive universal access \nto another major service; that is, TV service, weather reports, \nemergency broadcasts, local news. All Americans should be able to get \nlocal news on their television set, to get information about their \nlocal communities. That is not available today for about 50 million \nAmericans. In my State alone, 120,000 people, about 35 percent of the \nhomes in Montana, receive video programming via satellite because there \nis simply no way else to get it. That is the highest per capita rate in \nthe Nation.\n  We have more satellite dishes per capita than any other State in the \nNation. We jokingly call the satellite dish our new State flower. It \nused to be the bitterroot; now it is the satellite dish.\n  The problem is, we in Montana have to watch the news from New York \nCity or Denver or Seattle. We can't get local news from our local \nstations from our satellites. The technology isn't there. The satellite \ncompanies don't provide the service. Montana is not alone. In nine \nother States, at least 20 percent of the households depend on satellite \nbroadcasts for TV reception. They can't get it with an antenna. They \ncan't get it from cable. They have to get it off the satellite. And in \nplaces such as Montana, with mountains, buttes, ravines, and gullies, \nall the different geographic conditions that occur in our State, there \nare many people who live on the outskirts of major towns who can't get \nlocal television signals with antenna, no matter how hard they try. \nThey can't get any television. There are many communities and homes \nthat are much too remote to receive news or TV coverage by cable. They \nare just too remote.\n\n  Why is it so many people can't get TV coverage that is important for \nties to local communities? The major satellite companies have told us \nthat the free market simply doesn't pay. It doesn't pay for the \nsatellite companies to provide the signal to smaller communities. It \ndoes pay for the larger communities but not for the small. The \nsatellite companies have told us they can only afford to market in the \nhigh-density urban areas. I understand that. All companies want to make \nas much money as they can. That is the American way. That is wonderful. \nBut the difficulty is, as a consequence, there are many areas of our \ncountry that can't get TV coverage--that is, coverage at all--or cannot \nget local television, local news.\n  We can't rely solely on the profit motive. That drives America; it is \nwonderful. That is why American prosperity is doing so well and for so \nlong. But we also have to be sure that it is not the only condition \nbecause otherwise we would still be cooking supper by candlelight in \nrural America. We would have to go down to the local telegraph office \nto communicate with friends. That is because without rural electric \nservice or rural co-op service, that would be the case.\n  This map is very interesting, the one behind me to my immediate \nright. Under the most optimistic local-to-local plans--that is, where a \nsatellite signal is sent down to communities so the communities can, \nfrom their satellite, get local television--only about 67 out of a \ntotal of 210 TV markets in the United States will get access to local \nchannels via the satellite. The more realistic answer is probably about \n40 markets will be served by satellite; that is, either by DirecTV or \nEchostar. Millions of households will get it in communities such as New \nYork City and Los Angeles.\n  The red dots on the map are cities served, as of the end of last \nyear, by satellite; that is, local service, local TV coverage, local \nnews coverage served by satellite. As we can see, there are a lot of \nplaces in America without red dots. If you are in a city with a red \ndot, you can get local news by satellite. But if you live someplace \nelse and not one of these red dots occurs, then you cannot get local \nnews by\n\n[[Page S604]]\n\nsatellite. The orange-yellow dots are announced probable sites in the \nfuture. As I said, the most optimistic estimate is 67 markets served \nout of the 210; the most probable is about 40 markets served out of \n210.\n  Let me tell my colleagues where my State ranks in terms of the \nprobability of getting served with local coverage by satellite. I can \nassure you, we are not in the top 67. Our largest city in Montana is \nBillings. Billings ranks about 169 in the Nation out of 210. Butte, MT, \nis about 192. Glendive is up in the northeastern part of the market. \nThat TV market is number 210; that is, out of 210 TV markets in the \ncountry, we are 210. So we have a ways to go if we are going to get \nsatellite local news coverage.\n  This isn't a problem only in Montana. It is a problem in 16 States. \nSixteen States have no single city among the top 70 markets, not one. \nThey include half of the Nation's State capitals. A dozen cities with \nnearly 500,000 people each won't get service. From the Great Plains to \nAlaska and Maine to Mississippi, much of America is being left behind.\n\n  Why is this so important? Why is local-to-local broadcasting so \nimportant? Essentially because this is the heart of the community. One \nof the fibers that holds a community together is the ability to \ncommunicate within that community. The community is able to tune into a \nTV to hear about the local high school football team: how did they do? \nDid they win or lose? And local news, all the things that go on in a \nlocal community: what is happening in the neighborhood? Maybe there is \na sale going on at a local store. There is a TV advertisement. You know \nwhat is going on in the community. There is a charity fundraiser.\n  Then look at some of the more dramatic reasons for local news \naccessibility: winter storm warnings, hurricanes, school closures, \nemergencies of one kind or another, floods, tornadoes.\n  There are a lot of reasons why we in all our communities want to know \nwhat is happening locally. As I said at the outset, there are about 15 \nmillion Americans who are not able to tune into their local TV \nstations, and we should find some way to solve that.\n  Last month, I heard from a good, solid Montanan, Gary Ardesson of \nFrenchtown, MT, which is about 20 miles outside of Missoula. Gary can't \nget any local channels--none whatsoever--either by antenna, or by \ncable, or by satellite. He wants to pay for it, but it isn't available. \nHe just can't get it. So Gary asked why in the world should he be in \nthis situation. What would Gary do if he wanted to get the latest storm \nwarning? All he can do is stick his head out the window and put his \nfinger up in the wind to find out what the weather is going to be. \nThere is no other way except by radio.\n  He commented on the legislation we passed in the last session. He \nsaid: What is the point of legislation if they only implement it in the \nareas that can already receive local channels? That is what we did last \nsession, but we didn't provide full coverage.\n  This is a problem not only for viewers; it is a problem for local TV \nbroadcasters. Local broadcasters are vital to local economies. They \nprovide jobs and an avenue for local businesses to grow. How? Through \nadvertising. It is very important that we can keep our local \nbroadcasters thriving. I think there are four main issues we have to \naddress to solve this problem.\n  First, we have to assure that every household in America has access \nto their local television station. That is a given. Every household in \nAmerica must have access to their local television station.\n  This can be achieved, I submit, through a loan guarantee program that \nencourages investment in infrastructure, whether it be satellite, \ncable, or some other new emergency technology. Loan guarantees are \ngoing to be necessary for those less densely populated parts of our \ncountry that need assistance, such as REA, the rural electric co-ops of \nnot too many years ago, and such as telephone co-ops. It is a \nguaranteed service to all Americans.\n  Look at this chart. This shows where the Rural Utilities Service--the \norganization in the USDA that administers the utility service programs \nin our country, whether it be electric power, telecommunications, or \nwhatnot--currently provides service. All 50 States currently have \nservice under the Rural Utilities Service. The yellow dots are water \nand wastewater guarantee programs, loan guarantee programs. The other \nis electrical distribution. That is the red. The dark blue is \nelectrical generation and transmission. Look at the green; it is \ntelecommunications. That is what we are talking about--administering a \nloan guarantee telecommunications program. The Rural Utility Service \nisn't doing that. Those are the green dots. If you stand close, you can \nsee the green dots--mostly in the East, where you would expect, and \nalso you will find a few in other parts of the country. We have to make \nsure the program is properly administered, once we guarantee access. \nCertainly, the Rural Utility Service is currently providing service in \nall 50 States and are more than qualified to provide that service.\n  The RUS currently manages a $42 billion loan portfolio for rural \nAmerica--$42 billion--including investments in approximately 7,600 \nsmall community and rural water and wastewater systems, and about 1,500 \nelectric and telecommunications systems servicing about 84 percent of \nAmerica's counties. They have been very successful.\n  This map shows the vast area that is covered. RUS's success in \ndeveloping infrastructure in rural America has led to the infusion of \nprivate capital in rural infrastructure. For every $1 of capital that \nRUS provides to rural America, that leverages to $2 or $3 of outside \ninvestment. The Rural Utility Service is the logical team to make sure \nthis program is properly administered.\n  Perhaps the RUS could consult with other agencies--the National \nTelecommunications and Information Association, perhaps--and that makes \nsense. But I think the core of the administration should be in the RUS. \nSome colleagues have suggested maybe new legislation for a new \noversight board, a new bureaucracy, similar to what was provided for in \nthe Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Act of 1999.\n  I have some concerns about that. My real question is, how can an \nagency successfully administer the loans when the guarantee decision is \nmade independent of that agency? A critical step in implementing the \nloan is a clear understanding of the funded project. That is best \nachieved during the review of the applications, including the financial \nand technical feasibility analysis.\n  That brings the third issue. We must construct this program in a \nfiscally responsible manner, minimizing the cost and risk to the \ntaxpayer. I think this goal can be achieved by utilizing an existing \nagency--one with a good track record.\n  RUS has done a good job. In 50 years, RUS has experienced not one \nloan loss in its telecommunications program. That is, to me, a very \ngood record.\n\n  Finally, I think we need to make sure the guarantee program is \nutilized to provide local-to-local service to all of America. I have \nheard from colleagues that Congress should require some level of \nprivate capital investment in conjunction with the loan guarantee. Some \nhave even suggested that the loan guarantee should be perhaps as low as \n50 percent. That gives me some pause because I don't want to have \nsomething set up with too many hurdles and redtape, which has the \neffect of increasing interest rates necessarily and therefore \ndiminishing the likelihood that all of America will be served.\n  In summary, these are my four main criteria: One, every household \nmust be served; two, the program must be administered by an agency with \nthe necessary expertise, somebody with a track record that knows what \nis going on; three, the program must be cost effective and low risk to \ntaxpayers; four, the program should not be structured in a manner that \nis so cost prohibitive to the private sector that it sits on the shelf \nunused.\n  So I say, let's move ahead and let's also keep this nonpartisan. \nThere are some in the Senate who have suggested that maybe this issue \nis driven by partisan politics. Mr. President, I totally reject that \nnotion; indeed, I find it offensive.\n  This issue doesn't belong to one Senator or to one party. This issue \nbelongs to the American people--people who need service, people who are \ndemanding that we act to provide them with\n\n[[Page S605]]\n\ncomprehensive satellite coverage. That is all this is. I call on the \nSenate to do that. That is what the people want.\n  The loan guarantee program that I am talking about was regrettably \nstripped from the Satellite Home Viewer Act in the eleventh hour of the \nlast session. I say, let's put it back in in a nonpartisan way. I say \nthat because all Americans who do not get local service would be very \ngrateful. Let's do this not only for Gary Ardesson in Frenchtown, MT. \nLet's do it for all of the Americans in rural America who deserve the \nsame service that people in the big cities are getting.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, it was just last week that I came to the \nfloor of the Senate to share a legal brief outlining the weakness of \nthe Department of Justice's case against Microsoft. But I repeated at \nthat time a thought I have expressed several times on the floor of the \nSenate that perhaps the most long-lasting effect of this ill-begotten \nlawsuit would be on the U.S. international competitiveness and our \nplace in the world that is changing so rapidly due to the development \nof both software and hardware in the computer industry and in the \nrelated high-tech fields. Yesterday, the other shoe dropped. The \nEuropean Union announced an antitrust investigation against Microsoft, \nsomething, as I say, that I have been predicting for more than a year.\n  When the Department of Justice was asked about it, it said this \naction took them by surprise. I don't know why we should be surprised \nthat the European Union is very much interested in restricting access \nof U.S. goods and services in Europe, whether they are software, \nairplanes, bananas, or a wide range of other goods and services, or why \nthe Department of Justice should be surprised that the European Union \ninvestigates and reflects its own actions in a matter of this sort. In \nfact, the report of this lawsuit points out that it is easier to bring \nan antitrust case in Europe than it is in the United States.\n  We have simply opened up to European competitors the opportunity to \ncripple or destroy one of the most innovative and progressive of all \nU.S. corporations, one that bears a very significant share of the \ncredit for the magnificent performance of our economy and for the \nchanges in our lives.\n  Again, as is the case with the Microsoft action by the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, this European investigation seems to have been \nsparked by an American competitor, even more perhaps than the European \nauthorities themselves. But nothing but ill can come from \ninvestigations or actions of this sort.\n  This industry and our economy has grown because it is highly \ninnovative, highly competitive, and very rapidly changing. Neither our \nantitrust laws nor European antitrust laws fit that very well--the \nEuropeans probably less than our own, as they represent views in an \neconomy that has been for generations far more stagnant than our own.\n  In any event, Mr. President, I regret to have to bring this matter to \nyour attention and to the attention of my colleagues. But I have feared \nexactly this for more than a year. I fear that it will breed other \ncopycat actions in other parts of the world that would also like to \ngrab for free the innovations and progress that have meant so much to \nthe United States and that are so important in reducing what is now the \nlargest bilateral trade deficit in our history or in the world. This is \nbad news. But it is bad news that is brought upon us largely by the \nill-advised and ill-founded actions against Microsoft by our own U.S. \nDepartment of Justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S605-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S605-S606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EDUCATION IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I was sitting in the seat the Presiding \nOfficer is occupying about an hour ago when the junior Senator from New \nYork regaled the Senate with his views on education in the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act.\n  He did me a great honor to denounce my proposal, Straight A's, rather \nspecifically. But it did seem to me to be a strange and inverted world \nin which Straight A's, a proposal designed to empower education \nauthorities such as parents, teachers, and superintendents--the very \npeople who know our students by their first names--to say, somehow or \nanother, this was an attack on local authority but that the issuance of \nthousands of pages of regulations, on hundreds of different individual \ncategorical aid programs, at the Department of Education in Washington, \nDC, was somehow liberating.\n  The Senator from New York criticized our present education system as \na failure, a statement with which I do not agree. I believe there are \nmany improvements necessary, but my own experience, in literally dozens \nof schools over the last 2 or 3 years, has shown a tremendous \ndedication to better teaching methods, to the education of our \nchildren, to innovation, changes that I want to encourage.\n  In fact, if we look for something to criticize as a failure, we need \nlook no further than the present Federal education system itself. Title \nI has now been in effect for 35 years. The difference in achievement \nbetween the kids it is designed to help and the less underprivileged \nchildren is as great as it was when the program began. Yet what we have \nfrom the Senator from New York and the Senator from Massachusetts is to \nhave more of exactly what has failed and that perhaps what is really \nlacking is sufficient direction from Washington, DC.\n\n  I do not claim to be an expert on what is needed for a higher and \nbetter education in the city of New York or in any other New York \nschool district. However, I don't think the Senator from New York knows \nmore about what the schools in my State need--I won't even say that I \ndo--than the superintendents, principals, teachers, and parents of \nstudents in my own State.\n  What we seek--and this will be the great debate that will take place \nin this body in less than a month--will be: Do we trust the people who \nhave dedicated their lives and careers to educating our children, to \nmake the fundamental decisions about what they need in 17,000 school \ndistricts across the country and hundreds of thousands of individual \nschools or do we believe they need total supervision and control in \nWashington, DC, in the bureaucracy in the U.S. Department of Education?\n  We have increasingly followed that lateral line now for 35 years. It \nis a dead-end street. That is what has failed to work in connection \nwith our education system.\n  For the first time, with the minor exception of the Ed-Flex bill we \npassed last year, we seek to restore some of that authority to our \nlocal school districts, to our teachers, and to our parents. That is \nwhat Straight A's is all about.\n  I suppose I should be honored to have my own program attacked \nspecifically and by name because I think that means it is making very \nreal progress. I know it is at home, whenever I go to a school or to a \nschool administration building and discuss its ideas. Our teachers and \nour educators want more authority to make up their minds as to what \ntheir children need. Those needs are not the same in every school \ndistrict. Not every school district has as its highest priority more \nteachers. Not every school district has as its highest priority more \nbricks and mortar. Not every school district has as its highest \npriority teacher education. Not every school district has as its \nhighest priority more computers. But many school districts have any one \nof those as a highest priority, and many have some other. Each of them \nought to be permitted, each of them ought to be encouraged, to make \nthose decisions for the students.\n  A final point. The Senator from New York attacked this proposal as \nlacking accountability. We certainly have accountability now. The way \nour schools account for the spending of money under hundreds of present \nschool programs is by filling out forms and by\n\n[[Page S606]]\n\nbeing visited by auditors who make a precise determination as to \nwhether $10 for one purpose has been used for some other purpose or \nnot. It is a form of accountability that has required our school \ndistricts to spend more and more money on administrators and on filling \nout forms and less and less money on educating the students themselves.\n  We substitute for that one ultimate form of accountability, \naccountability measured by whether or not our students are doing \nbetter, by whether or not our kids are getting a better education. No \nState may gain the benefit from the provisions of Straight A's unless \nthat State agrees to a form of testing, of actual achievement of the \nstudents, and promising if it is given this flexibility, those student \nachievement standards will rise, scores will rise in the period under \nwhich they are working with Straight A's.\n  It is neither more complicated nor more simple than that. The goal of \neducating our children is to see to it that they are prepared for the \nworld in which they will live. We are now able more and more to measure \nhow those goals are met. Do our students read better? Do they write \nbetter? Do they compute better? The accountability in Straight A's is \nmeasured by those standards, not by how well their administrators and \nteachers fill out forms and not how well they come out in an after-the-\nfact audit.\n\n  I have every confidence that as a part of the very important debate \nover education and the renewal of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, we will debate Straight A's. I am convinced as this body \nfinishes its work it will be a part of the most constructive and most \nsuccessful renewal of our activity in the field of education that this \nCongress has accomplished in generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S606-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

HARPER, JR., CHANCERY CLERK OF SUNFLOWER COUNTY, \n                              MISSISSIPPI\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Jack E. Harper, \nJr., of Sunflower County, Mississippi. Mr. Harper recently retired as \nthe Chancery Clerk of Sunflower County after serving tirelessly in this \nposition for 44 years. This is an exemplary record of public service, \nand it is a privilege to honor this outstanding Mississippian for his \nunselfish dedication to Sunflower County government for so many years.\n  In addition to Mr. Harper's lengthy service as Chancery Clerk, I also \ncommend him for his involvement in numerous civic activities and for \nhis military service. Mr. Harper is a veteran of the United States \nMarines, having served 31 months in the Pacific Theater during World \nWar II. In 1951, while he was a member of the Mississippi National \nGuard, he was ordered to active military duty for 2 years and served 1 \nyear in Korea during 1951-1952. In conjunction with his military \nservice, Mr. Harper is a member and past Commander of the Indianola \nAmerican Legion and VFW posts. Additionally, Mr. Harper has been active \nin his community, as demonstrated by the fact that he served as \nPresident of the Indianola Lions Club and as the District Governor of \nthe Mississippi Lions.\n  Jack Harper has always shown a commitment to education. He earned \ndegrees from Indianola High School, Mississippi Delta Community \nCollege, and both Bachelor of Laws and Juris Doctor degrees from the \nUniversity of Mississippi School of Law, my alma mater. Additionally, \nhe has served as a member of the Board of Trustees of Mississippi Delta \nCommunity College since January, 1961, and has served as Board Chairman \nsince 1968. He is a past President of the Mississippi Junior College \nInter-Alumni Association, and he is a member of the State Association \nof Community and Junior College Trustees. He currently serves as the \nCo-Chairman of the Education Committee for the Indianola Chamber of \nCommerce.\n  Although Jack Harper is retiring from official public office, I know \nthat he will continue to serve his community and the State of \nMississippi in the same devoted manner that he has for his entire life. \nI am envious of the time that he will now have to spend with his \nfamily, particularly his grandchildren. Once again, I congratulate and \nthank Mr. Harper for his service to Sunflower County and Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S606-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GUN ENFORCEMENT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this week, President Clinton sent \nto Congress his budget proposal for the 2001 fiscal year.\n  Among his initiatives is a proposal to improve the enforcement of \nfederal firearm laws. Specifically, the President requests more than \n$280 million to provide law enforcement agencies with tools they need \nto reduce gun crime. The proposal includes funds to: improve the speed \nand accuracy of Brady background checks by upgrading State and local \ncriminal history records; hire 500 new Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \nFirearms (ATF) agents and inspectors; provide grants to hire 1,000 new \nfederal, state and local gun prosecutors; implement a comprehensive \ncrime gun tracing program; and support local anti-gun violence media \ncampaigns.\n  I believe this is an important initiative in the fight against gun \nviolence, and I applaud the President's commitment to this issue. I \nhope that during this Session, Congress will support full funding for \nthis aggressive gun enforcement initiative, and will act to close \nloopholes in our federal firearm laws that give young people and felons \neasy access to guns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S606-4", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S606-S608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am most pleased to join millions of \nAmericans in commemorating African-American History Month and \nparticularly this year's theme ``Heritage and Horizons: The African \nLegacy and the Challenges of the 21st Century.'' This theme as \nannounced by the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and \nHistory (ASALH) is most appropriate and timely as we enter a new \nmillennium and hopefully a new and even brighter era of African-\nAmerican progress.\n  Since 1926, Americans have observed a time during the month of \nFebruary to recognize the vast history and legacy that African-\nAmericans have contributed to the founding and building of this great \nnation. It was the vision of the noted author and scholar, Dr. Carter \nG. Woodson, that led to this celebration. As we review the last 100 \nyears, it is important to remember that there have been many challenges \nand changes in the 1900's for African-Americans.\n  During the early 1900's, discrimination against African-Americans was \nvery wide spread. By 1907, every Southern state required racial \nsegregation on trains and in churches, schools, hotels, restaurants, \ntheaters, and in other public places. New leaders for the African-\nAmerican race emerged such as W.E.B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington, \nwhose intellectual thoughts on the progress and direction of African-\nAmericans are still very much discussed in the community.\n  There was also the Northern migration of hundreds of thousands of \nSouthern African-Americans during World War I to seek jobs in defense \nplants and other factories. Many African-Americans served our country \nadmirably during this war and in World War II. Like World War I, this \nwar led to the expansion of defense-related industries and \nopportunities in the North for employment. During the 1940's, about a \nmillion Southern African-Americans moved North. Discrimination played a \nlarge role in the labor industry which led A. Philip Randolph of the \nBrotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters to threaten a march on Washington, \nD.C. President Roosevelt then issued an executive order forbidding \nracial discrimination in defense industries.\n  Following World War II, three major factors encouraged the beginning \nof a new movement for civil rights. First, many African-Americans \nserved with honor in the war, as they had in many of the wars since the \nAmerican Revolution. However, in this instance, African-American \nleaders pointed to the records of these veterans to show the\n\n[[Page S607]]\n\ninjustice of racial discrimination against patriots. Second, more and \nmore African-Americans in the North had made economic gains, increased \ntheir education, and registered to vote. Third, the NAACP had attracted \nmany new members and received increased financial support from blacks \nand whites. Additionally, a young group of energetic lawyers, including \nThurgood Marshall, of Baltimore, Maryland, used the legal system to \nbring about important changes in the lives of African-Americans, while \nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. appealed to the conscience of all Americans.\n\n  Congress had an important role in passing the Civil Rights Act of \n1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. I am pleased to note that \nClarence Mitchell Jr. of Maryland played a critical part in steering \nthis legislation through Congress. African-Americans also began to \nassume more influential roles in the national government, a development \nwhich has benefitted the entire Nation.\n  Gains in education for the African-American community have been \nsignificant. From 1970 to 1980, college enrollment among African-\nAmericans rose from about 600,000 to about 1.3 million. This gain \nresulted in part from affirmative action programs by predominantly \nwhite colleges and universities. By the early 1990's about 11 percent \nof all African-Americans 25 years of age or older had completed \ncollege. About two-thirds of that group had finished high school. There \nhave also been many more advances and accomplishments during that time, \nbut this is just a brief overview of what has been a tremendous and \nrich history and heritage for African-American people in our Nation for \nthe last 100 years.\n  As we look forward to a new century, we anticipate that African-\nAmericans will continue to prosper in American society and throughout \nthe world. Their success is our success. As we look towards the \nhorizon, we see record breaking events for African-Americans.\n  The unemployment rate for African-Americans has fallen from 14.2 \npercent in 1992 to 8.3 percent in 1999--the lowest annual level on \nrecord. The median household income of African-Americans is up 15.1 \npercent since 1993, from $22,034 in 1993 to $25,351 in 1998. The real \nwages of African-Americans have risen rapidly in the past two years, up \nabout 5.8 percent for African-American men and 6.2 percent for African-\nAmerican women since 1996.\n  The African-American poverty rate has dropped from 33.1 percent in \n1993 to 26.1 percent in 1998--the lowest level ever recorded and the \nlargest five-year drop in more than twenty-five years. Since 1993, the \nchild poverty rate among African-Americans has dropped from 46.1 \npercent to 36.7 percent in 1998--the biggest five-year drop on record. \nWhile the African-American child poverty rate is still too high, it is \nthe lowest level on record. As the African-American population \ncontinues to expand, we continue to strive to make laws that improve \nthe lives of all Americans so that many more record breaking \naccomplishments occur.\n  As we begin the first Census count of the 21st century, we are \nworking to ensure that Census 2000 is the most accurate census possible \nusing the best, most up-to-date methods to make sure every person is \ncounted. According to the Census Bureau, the 1990 Census missed 8.4 \nmillion people and double-counted 4.4 million others. Nationally, 4.4 \npercent of African-Americans were not counted in the 1990 census. While \nmissing or miscounting so many people is a problem, the fact that \ncertain groups--such as children, the poor, people of color, and city \ndwellers--were missed more often than others made the undercount even \nmore inaccurate. A fair and accurate Census is a fundamental part of a \nrepresentative democracy and is the basis for providing equality under \nthe law. Therefore, I encourage everyone to make sure your neighbor is \ncounted.\n\n  I would also like to observe that the State of Maryland is currently \nbenefitting from a continued growth in our African-American population. \nBetween 1990 and 1997, when the last set of complete figures were \navailable from the Census Bureau, the number of African-Americans \ncalling Maryland ``home'' grew to 1.4 million--an increase of 200,609 \npeople. This makes Maryland the state with the eighth largest African-\nAmerican population in the United States. Nearby Prince George's County \nwas second in the Nation in terms of growth during this seven-year \nperiod with 68,325 new African-American residents. I am confident that \nan accurate Census 2000 count will show increases in these figures \nacross the state.\n  I am also most gratified to note that finally, a memorial to honor \nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. has been approved and a site near the tidal \nbasin in Washington D.C. was chosen. The sacrifice that Dr. King made \nfor civil rights has touched every element of American society. I am \nparticularly pleased to be involved in this effort to mark the \ncontributions of this great leader. This memorial will join the \nmonuments to Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln in some of the most \nhallowed ground in our Nation.\n  Mr. President, as we look towards the future for African-Americans \nduring this new century, it is my hope that the King Memorial will \nserve both as a monument to past achievements and our heritage, and \nalso as an inspiration for our Nation to continue the struggle for an \nequality that includes all Americans.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring your attention to \nan issue of great concern to many people in my home state of Arkansas.\n  This week, I introduced a bill, S. 2041, to continue to promote the \nuse of best management practices in the forestry industry by relieving \nthis nation's private timberland owners of an impending unnecessary \nregulatory burden.\n  My bill would permanently prohibit the Environmental Protection \nAgency from requiring water pollution control permits under the \nNational Pollutant Discharge Elimination System for the forestry \nactivities of site preparation, reforestation, thinning, prescribed \nburning, pest and fire control, harvesting operations, surface \ndrainage, road construction and maintenance, and nursery operations.\n  Recently in El Dorado and Texarkana, Arkansas, literally thousands of \nprivate timberland owners came together to discuss and express their \nconcerns about this new extension of EPA regulations and to learn of \nthe potential impact they may have on their private property and \nprivate forests.\n  Simply put, my legislation will statutorily ensure that all forestry \nactivities will remain as non-point sources in the eyes of the EPA. \nUnder the Clean Water Act, the EPA has jurisdiction to protect the \nwater quality of the United States by regulating point sources of water \npollution.\n  Let me define what I mean when I speak of ``point'' and ``non-point'' \nsources of pollution. A point source of pollution is pollution from a \nsingle point such as an industrial plant's wastewater pipe or a \nwastewater drainage ditch. Non-point sources of pollution like rainfall \nrunoff from a field or a forest cannot be defined as a set point. What \nis important here is that Congress, upon passage of the Clean Water Act \nin 1972, very clearly did not give the EPA authority to regulate non-\npoint sources of pollution.\n  The EPA's proposed revisions to the Total Maximum Daily Load \nrequirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, \nissued in September of last year, seeks to change this authority. This \nproposed regulation would enhance clean water by extending the NPDES \npoint source TMDL water pollution rules to forestry activities. This \nwould be accomplished by reclassifying forestry non-point sources of \npollution as point sources of pollution.\n  The forestry activities included in my legislation have always been \nconsidered as non-point sources of water pollution and therefore not \nsubject to EPA regulations. The EPA's new regulation change would \nrequire point source water pollution permits for all of these \nactivities. In other words, these new regulations would require permits \non the very things we want to promote in forestry--responsible \nharvesting and thinning operations, best management practices, and \nreforestation.\n\n  I agree with the EPA's objective of cleaning up our nation's impaired \nrivers, lakes and streams, but firmly believe that its proposed \nrevisions are not the best solution to the problem of clean water. \nPlacing another unnecessary layer of regulation upon our nation's local \nforesters will only slow down the process of responsible forestry and \nthe implementation of forestry Best Management Practices.\n\n[[Page S608]]\n\n  In Arkansas, we have a very successful Best Management Practices \nprogram for all forestry activities. In fact, over 85% of Arkansas' \nprivate timberland owners voluntarily adhere to these Best Management \nPractices to reduce water pollution from all forestry activities.\n  Let me restate that over 85% of Arkansas' private timberland owners \nvoluntarily adhere to these Best Management Practices to reduce water \npollution from all forestry activities. This is a wonderful example of \nwhere everyone works together to take care of their own environment and \nhave been successful in their efforts!\n  The EPA's background for the new regulation states that these new \nrequirements of obtaining water permits for forestry activities would \ntake effect only if the state did not develop a satisfactory system of \nits own, or if a specific water body needed the regulation to remain \nclean. It also states that only 3 to 9 percent of all non-point source \npollution comes from forestry-related activities.\n  Mr. President, let's talk through each of these forestry-related \nactivities to find out just exactly what each includes as well as what \na good Best Management Practices program does to combat potential \npollution from each of these.\n  Site preparation. Generally, site preparation includes removing \nunwanted vegetation and other material when necessary and before any \nharvesting of timber can take place. Best Management Practices provide \nguidelines to minimize the use of equipment and disturbances near \nstreams or other bodies of water, keep equipment out of streamside \nmanagement zones, and minimize the movement and disturbance of soil.\n  Reforestation. Reforestation is simply the process of planting trees. \nReforestation is the single process that prevents any further erosion \nof exposed soil. I can't see why we would want to slow down the \nreforestation process by implementing a permitting process.\n  Prescribed burning. Prescribed burning is done almost exclusively to \nprevent potential forest fires. In many of our nation's old growth \nforests, prescribed burning has prevented what would have been certain \ndestruction of thousands of acres of beautiful forestland. We want to \nprevent forest fires for the loss of timber as well as for the \npotential loss of property and life. Best Management Practices provide \nguidelines for conducting prescribed burning operations and ensuring a \nminimal potential for erosion and forest fire.\n  Pest and fire control. If someone is trying to control a forest fire, \nwhy do we want to hinder their efforts? For the same reason, we don't \nwant our Nation's forests eaten up by bugs.\n\n  Harvesting operations including thinning and, when necessary, clear-\ncutting. This is the crux of the issue. Timber harvesting is the timber \nindustry. Following Best Management Practices ensures that during any \nharvesting operation, extreme care is taken to prevent unnecessary \nwater pollution. Best Management Practices encourage thinning of \nexisting forests as opposed to clear-cutting of our Nation's forests. \nThinning is going into a forest and removing only a small portion of \nthe timber.\n  Surface drainage. Surface drainage through a forest is a naturally \nslow. And, following Arkansas' Best Management Practices, a buffer of \ntrees must be left around all streams and rivers.\n  Road Maintenance and Construction. It is necessary to have forest \nroads to reach the available timber. Best Management Practices require \nthe minimization of stream crossings, designing the road to be no wider \nthan necessary, and building roads to minimize the adverse impacts of \nheavy rain.\n  Nursery Operations. To conduct any reforestation activities, you must \nhave seedlings to plant. Best Management Practices for nurseries \ninclude minimizing soil disturbance, runoff, and chemical application.\n  Mr. President, the voluntary use of these and many, many other Best \nManagement Practices in Arkansas have successfully reduced and \nprevented water pollution from all forestry activities. Our nation's \nprivate timberland owners should not be burdened with more unnecessary \nregulations when they are already voluntarily complying with Best \nManagement Practices to effectively reduce water pollution.\n  Reasonable minds should prevail and agree on a common sense solution \nto promoting Best Management Practices in the forestry industry without \nunnecessary regulation and allow states like Arkansas to continue \nvoluntarily implementing our successful best management practices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S608-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

We are on the \nbrink of marking the longest economic expansion in our Nation's \nhistory. More than 20 million new jobs have been created since Vice \nPresident Gore and I took office in January 1993. We now have the \nlowest unemployment rate in 30 years--even as core inflation has \nreached its lowest level since 1965.\n  This expansion has been both deep and broad, reaching Americans of \nall races, ethnicities, and income levels. African American \nunemployment and poverty are at their lowest levels on record. Hispanic \nunemployment is likewise the lowest on record, and poverty among \nHispanics is at its lowest level since 1979. A long-running trend of \nrising income inequality has been halted in the last 7 years. From 1993 \nto 1998, families at the bottom of the income distribution have enjoyed \nthe same strong income growth as workers at the top.\n  In 1999 we had the largest dollar surplus in the Federal budget on \nrecord and the largest in proportion to our economy since 1951. We are \non course to achieve more budget surpluses for many years to come. We \nhave used this unique opportunity to make the right choices for the \nfuture over the past 2 years, America has paid down $140 billion in \ndebt held by the public. With my plan to continue to pay down the debt, \nwe are now on track to eliminate the Nation's publicly held debt by \n2013. Our fiscal discipline has paid off in lower interest rates, \nhigher private investment, and stronger productivity growth.\n  These economic successes have not been achieved by accident. They \nrest on the three pillars of the economic\n\n[[Page S609]]\n\nstrategy that the Vice President and I laid out when we took office: \nfiscal discipline to help reduce interest rates and spur business \ninvestment; investing in education, health care, and science and \ntechnology to meet the challenges of the 21st century; and opening \nforeign markets so that American workers have a fair chance to compete \nabroad. As a result, the American economy is not only strong today; it \nis well positioned to continue to expand and to widen the circle of \nopportunity for more Americans.\n\n\n                 the administration's economic strategy\n\n  Our economic strategy was based on a commitment, first, to fiscal \ndiscipline. When the Vice President and I took office, the U.S. \nGovernment had a budget deficit of $290 billion. Today we have a \nsurplus of $124 billion. This fiscal discipline has helped us launch a \nvirtuous circle of strong investment, increasing productivity, low \ninflation, and low unemployment.\n\n  Second, we have remained true to our commitment to invest in our \npeople. Because success in the global economy depends more than ever on \nhighly skilled workers, we have taken concerned steps to make sure all \nAmericans have the education, skills, and opportunities they need to \nsucceed. That is why, even as we maintained fiscal responsibility, we \nexpanded our investments in education, technology, and training. We \nhave opened the doors of college to all Americans, with tax credits, \nmore affordable student loans, education IRAs, and the HOPE Scholarship \ntax credits. So that working families will have the means to support \nthemselves, we have increased the minimum wage, expanded the Earned \nIncome Tax Credit (EITC), provided access to health insurance for \npeople with disabilities, and invested in making health insurance \ncoverage available to millions of children.\n  Third, we have continued to pursue a policy of opening markets. We \nhave achieved historic trade pacts such as the North American Free \nTrade Agreement and the Uruguay Round agreements, which led to the \ncreation of the World Trade Organization. Negotiations in the wake of \nthe Uruguay Round have yielded market access commitments covering \ninformation technology, basic telecommunications, and financial \nservices. We have engaged in bilateral initiatives with Japan and in \nregional initiatives in Europe, Africa, Asia, the Western Hemisphere, \nand the Middle East. We have also actively protected our rights under \nexisting trade agreements through the World Trade Organization and \nhelped maintain the Internet as a tax-free zone.\n\n\n                  meeting the challenges of the future\n\n  Despite the economy's extraordinary performance, we must continue \nworking to meet the challenges of the future. Those challenges include \neducating our children, improving the health and well-being of all our \ncitizens, providing for our senior citizens, and extending the benefits \nof the economic expansion to all communities and all parts of this \nNation.\n  We must help our children prepare for life in a global, information-\ndriven economy. Success in this new environment requires that children \nhave a high-quality education. That means safe, modern schools. It \nmeans making sure our children have well-trained teachers who demand \nhigh standards. It means making sure all schools are equipped with the \nbest new technologies, so that children can harness the tools of the \n21st century.\n  First and foremost, our children cannot continue trying to learn in \nschools that are so old they are falling apart. One-third of all public \nschools need extensive repair or replacement. By 2003 we will need an \nadditional 2,400 schools nationwide to accommodate these rising \nenrollments. That is why, in my State of the Union address, I proposed \n$24.8 billion in tax credit bonds over 2 years to modernize up to 6,000 \nschools, and a $1.3 billion school emergency loan and grant proposal to \nhelp renovate schools in high-poverty, high-need school districts.\n\n  Second, if our children are to succeed in the new digital economy, \nthey must know how to use the tools of the 21st century. That is why \nthe Vice President and I have fought for initiatives like the E-rate, \nwhich is providing $2 billion a year to help schools afford to network \ntheir classrooms and connect to the Internet. The E-rate and our other \ninitiatives in education technology have gone a long way toward giving \nall children access to technology in their schools. But there is still \na great ``digital divide'' when children go home. Children from wealthy \nfamilies are far more likely to have access to a computer at home than \nchildren from poor or minority families. That is why, in my budget, I \npropose a new Digital Divide initiative that will expand support for \ncommunity technology centers in low-income communities; a pilot project \nto expand home access to computers and the Internet for low-income \nfamilies; and grants and loan guarantees to accelerate the deployment \nof high-speed networks in underserved rural and urban communities.\n  Third, we must continue to make college affordable and accessible for \nall Americans. I have proposed a college opportunity tax cut, which \nwould invest $30 billion over 10 years in helping millions of families \nwho now struggle to afford college for their children. When fully \nphased in, this initiative would give families the option to claim a \ntax deduction or a tax credit on up to $10,000 of tuition and fees for \nany postsecondary education in which their members enroll, whether \ncollege, graduate study, or training courses. I have proposed increases \nin Pell grants, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, and Work \nStudy. I have also proposed creating new College Completion Challenge \nGrants to encourage students to stay in college.\n  We have seen dramatic advances in health care over the course of the \n20th century, which have led to an increase in life expectancy of \nalmost 30 years. But much remains to be done to ensure that all have \nand maintain access to quality medical care. That is why my budget \nexpands health care coverage, calls for passing a strong and \nenforceable Patients' Bill of Rights, strengthens and modernizes \nMedicare, addresses long-term care, and continues to promote life-\nsaving research.\n  My budget invests over $110 billion over 10 years to improve the \naffordability, accessibility, and quality of health insurance. It will \nprovide a new, affordable health insurance option for uninsured parents \nas well as accelerate enrollment of uninsured children who are eligible \nfor Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. The \ninitiative will expand health insurance options for Americans facing \nunique barriers to coverage. For example, it will allow certain people \naged 55-65 to buy into Medicare, and it will give tax credits to \nworkers who cannot afford the full costs of COBRA coverage after \nleaving a job. Finally, my initiative will provide funds to strengthen \nthe public hospitals and clinics that provide health care directly to \nthe uninsured. If enacted, this would be the largest investment in \nhealth coverage since Medicare was created in 1965, and one of the most \nsignificant steps we can take to help working families.\n\n  As our Nation ages and we live longer, we face new challenges in \nMedicare and long-term care. Despite improvements in Medicare in the \npast 7 years, the program begins this century with the disadvantages of \ninsufficient funding, inadequate benefits, and outdated payment \nsystems. To strengthen and modernize the program, I have proposed a \ncomprehensive reform plan that would make Medicare more competitive and \nefficient and invest $400 billion over the next 10 years in extending \nsolvency through 2025 and adding a long-overdue, voluntary prescription \ndrug benefit.\n  The aging of America also underscores the need to build systems to \nprovide long-term care. More than 5 million Americans require long-term \ncare because of significant limitations due to illness or disability. \nAbout two-thirds of them are older Americans. That is why I have \nproposed a $27 billion investment over 10 years in long-term care. Its \ncenterpiece is a $3,000 tax credit to defray the cost of long-term \ncare. In addition, I propose to expand access to home-based care, to \nestablish new support networks for caregivers, and to promote quality \nprivate long-term care insurance by offering it to Federal employees at \ngroup rates.\n  We must continue to make this economic expansion reach out to every \ncorner of our country, leaving no town, city, or Native American \nreservation behind, That is why I am asking the Congress to authorize \ntwo additional\n\n[[Page S610]]\n\ncomponents of our New Markets agenda. The first is the New Markets \nVenture Capital Firms program, geared toward helping small and first-\ntime businesses. The second is America's Private Investment Companies, \nmodeled on the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, to help larger \nbusinesses expand or relocate to distressed inner-city and rural areas. \nOverall the New Markets initiative could spur $22 billion of new equity \ninvestment in our underserved communities.\n  I am also proposing a new initiative called First Accounts, to expand \naccess to financial services for low- and moderate-income Americans. We \nwill work with private financial institutions to encourage the creation \nof low-cost bank accounts for low-income families. We will help bring \nmore automated teller machines to safe places in low-income \ncommunities, such as the post office. And we will educate Americans \nabout managing household finances and building assets over time.\n  To further increase opportunities for working families, I am \nproposing another expansion of the EITC to provide tax relief for 6.4 \nmillion hard-pressed families--with additional benefits for families \nwith three or more children. We have seen the dramatic effects that our \n1993 expansion of the EITC had in reducing poverty and encouraging \nwork: 4.3 million people were directly lifted out of poverty by the \nEITC in 1998 alone. More single mothers are working than ever before, \nand the child poverty rate is at its lowest since 1980.\n\n  Our initiatives to open overseas markets will continue. We have \nsuccessfully concluded bilateral negotiations on China's accession to \nthe World Trade Organization and now seek congressional action to \nprovide China with permanent normal trade relations. The United States \nwill also work to give the least developed countries greater access to \nglobal markets. We will participate in the scheduled multilateral talks \nto liberalize trade in services and agriculture and will continue to \npress our trading partners to launch a new round of negotiations within \nthe World Trade Organization.\n  We have a historic opportunity to answer the challenges ahead: to \nincrease economic opportunity for all American families; to provide \nquality, affordable child care, health care, and long-term care; and to \ngive our children the best education in the world. Working together, we \ncan meet these great challenges and make this new millennium one of \never-increasing promise, hope, and opportunity for all Americans.\n                                                  William J.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relative to the \n     Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, the United States \n     strategic petroleum reserves and to negotiate with OPEC or \n     non-OPEC countries for additional oil reserves or supplies; \n     to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                           Senate Resolution\n\n       Whereas, Fuel, in particular diesel fuel, and home heating \n     oil prices have skyrocketed to record highs in the first \n     weeks of 2000, threatening this Commonwealth's citizens' \n     well-being and safety to crisis proportions; and\n       Whereas, Retail prices of home heating fuel and diesel fuel \n     in some areas of this Commonwealth have reached $2 per \n     gallon, and level rack prices of diesel fuel are 106% higher \n     than they were in the first week of February 1999; and\n       Whereas, The impact of escalating oil prices on an industry \n     that is operating on narrow profit margins is being \n     compounded by driver shortages and other increased costs; and\n       Whereas, These increases dramatically affect prices for \n     essential utility and municipal services, and increases in \n     transportation costs threaten jobs and could cause major \n     disruption of vital supplies and other goods and services; \n     and\n       Whereas, Home heating oil supplies are extremely tight, \n     particularly in the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, and \n     weather forecasts call for continued below-normal \n     temperatures; and\n       Whereas, Refineries in Pennsylvania and other states must \n     produce more home heating fuel, which may cause shortages of \n     other oil products such as gasoline, kerosene and undyed \n     diesel fuel, thereby driving up prices accordingly; and\n       Whereas, The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting \n     Countries (OPEC) has indicated its desire to extend existing \n     output cuts amounting to over 4 million barrels per day, \n     resulting in nearly triple prices in less than one year, \n     devastation to world economic growth and inflation; and\n       Whereas, According to the International Energy Agency, \n     global oil supplies could be as much as 3 million barrels per \n     day below demand in the first quarter of 2000, and as much as \n     1.5 million barrels per day below requirements in the second \n     quarter; and\n       Whereas, A mid-January snowstorm, which occurred in the \n     northeast region of the United States, triggered even faster \n     price increases in Pennsylvania, resulting in United States \n     light crude oil selling just 4 cents below the $30 per barrel \n     mark; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania urge the President of the United States and the \n     Secretary of Energy to take immediate action to release \n     emergency funding to the State for the Low Income Home Energy \n     Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and to release the United States \n     strategic petroleum reserves, negotiate release of additional \n     oil reserves from non-OPEC countries or negotiate with OPEC \n     on additional supplies; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the Secretary of Energy, the \n     presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S612-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. HATCH, from the Committee on the Judiciary, without \n     amendment and with a preamble:\n       S.

A bill to revise the boundaries of the Golden Gate National \nRecreation Area, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n  the golden gate national recreation area boundary adjustment act of \n                                  2000\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this \nlegislation to permit the National Park Service to expand the \nboundaries of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA) by \nacquiring critical natural landscapes and scenic vistas. This includes \nland in San Mateo County, as well as land in San Francisco and Marin \nCounty.\n  A key component of this legislation is that about half of the total \ncost of purchasing these lands will be donated by the local community. \nThis legislation specifically provides that all land transactions \ninvolve a willing seller and willing buyer.\n  In introducing this bill, I am joined by my esteemed colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Barbara Boxer. This bill also has the bipartisan \nsupport of the entire Bay Area Congressional Delegation including \noriginal co-sponsors in the House, Representatives Tom Lantos, Nancy \nPelosi, and Lynn Woolsey.\n  Furthermore, this bill also has the strong support of local \nenvironmental and advocacy and preservation groups, the Point Reyes \nNational Seashore Advisory Commission, and the National Park Service. I \nknow of no opposition to this bill.\n  The three Marin County properties lie in the Marin headlands. \nPreservation of these lands will protect habitat, ridge-top trails and \nscenic views of San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean.\n  The San Francisco land along the pacific coastline, the city of San \nFrancisco would like to donate to the federal government and has \nauthorized $100,000 for the restoration of this site.\n  The legislation also proposes to include land near Labos Creek, \nadjacent to the Presido-West Gate, which was damaged during a severe \nstorm in 1997. The American Land Conservancy intends to acquire this \nland and donate it to the National Park Service. Lobos Creek is the key \nsource of the Presidio's water supply and a unique ecological resource.\n  Together, these parcels offer beautiful vistas, sweeping coastal \nviews and spectacular headland scenery and the preservation of unique \nbayland ecosystems with added public access. Much of this land also \nprotects the\n\n[[Page S614]]\n\nhabitat of several species of rare or endangered plants and animals. \nSeveral of the vegetation communities is home to at least 18 endangered \nor threatened species including the winter-run chinook salmon, American \nperegrine falcon, the mission blue butterfly and the southwestern pond \nturtle.\n  I urge my colleagues to support passage of the Golden Gate National \nRecreation Area Boundary Adjustment Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2052. A bill to establish a demonstration project to authorize the \nintegration and coordination of Federal funding dedicated to community, \nbusiness, and the economic development of Native American communities; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n       indian tribal development consolidated funding act of 2000\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, though there are glimmers of hope in \nNative communities, most Native Americans remain racked by \nunemployment, mired in poverty, and rank at or near the bottom of \nnearly every social and economic indicator in the nation.\n  For years the Committee on Indian Affairs, which I chair, has made \nstrengthening Indian economies a top priority. Healthy tribal economies \nand lower unemployment rates are imperative if tribes are to achieve \nthe goals of self-sufficiency and true self-determination.\n  Although federal economic development assistance has been available \nfor years, poverty, ill health, and unemployment remain rampant.\n  One of the reasons for the lack of success despite spending billions \nof dollars, is the lack of a consistent or consolidated federal policy \nto target development resources. Indian business, economic and \ncommunity development programs span the entire federal government and \nfor any given project undertaken by a tribe, there may be 6 to 8 or \nmore agencies involved. This fragmentation and lack of coordination is \nnot producing the kind of progress Indian country so badly needs.\n  To begin to remedy this problem, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation that builds on the most successful federal Indian policy to \ndate: Indian self-determination.\n  The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, which was \nenacted in 1975, authorizes Indian tribes and tribal consortia to \n``step into the shoes'' of the federal government to administer \nprograms and services historically provided by the United States.\n  This Act has worked as it was intended and has resulted in improved \nefficiency of program delivery and service quality; better managed \ntribal institutions; stronger tribal economies; and a general shift \naway from federal control over Indian lives to more local, tribal \nauthority.\n  What began as a Demonstration Project in 1975 has blossomed as more \nand more tribal governments realize the benefits of self governance.\n  As of 1999, nearly 48% of all Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and 50% \nof all Indian Health Service (IHS) programs and services have been \nassumed by tribes under the Indian Self-Determination Act.\n  The legislation I introduce today will begin the second phase of the \nSelf-Determination experiment by assistant Indian tribes in their use \nand maximization of existing federal resources for purposes of economic \ndevelopment.\n  By authorizing tribes and tribal consortia to consolidate and target \nexisting federal funds for development purposes, this bill will promote \na more efficient use of federal resources. Perhaps more importantly, \nthe legislation will lay the foundation for a development strategy that \nlooks to employment creation, investment and improved standards of \nliving in Indian country as the real measure of a successful \ndevelopment policy.\n  One of the key goals of this bill is to eliminate inconsistencies and \nduplication in federal policies that continue to be a barrier to Indian \ndevelopment through the issuance of uniform regulations and policies \ngoverning the use of funds across federal agencies.\n  By authorizing federal-tribal arrangements to combine and coordinate \nfederal resources, this bill will make the best use of existing federal \nprograms to assist tribes in attracting private investment and capital \nonto Indian reservations.\n  Already in this session we have addressed other building blocks to \nIndian development such as financing housing construction and physical \ninfrastructure, the need for good governance practices at the federal \nand tribal levels, ensuring adequate capital for entrepreneurs, and \nencouraging private sector investment into Native communities.\n  I am hopeful that the legislation I introduce today will signal a new \nday for how the federal government assists Native communities in \ncreating jobs and building a better future for their members.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2052\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TITLE.\n\n       The Act may be cited as the ``Indian Tribal Development \n     Consolidated Funding Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A unique legal and political relationship exists \n     between the United States and Indian tribes that is reflected \n     in article I, clause 3 of the Constitution of the United \n     States, various treaties, Federal statutes, Supreme Court \n     decisions, executive agreements, and course of dealing.\n       (2) Despite the infusion of substantial Federal dollars \n     into Native American communities over several decades, the \n     majority of Native Americans remain mired in poverty, \n     unemployment, and despair.\n       (3) The efforts of the United States to foster community, \n     economic, and business development in Native American \n     communities have been hampered by fragmentation of authority, \n     responsibility and performance and by lack of timeliness and \n     coordination in resources and decision-making.\n       (4) The effectiveness of Federal and tribal efforts to \n     generate employment opportunities and bring value-added \n     activities and economic growth to Native American communities \n     depends on cooperative arrangements among the various Federal \n     agencies and Indian tribes.\n       (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) enable Indian tribes and tribal organizations to use \n     available Federal assistance more effectively and \n     efficiently;\n       (2) adapt and target such assistance more readily to \n     particular needs through wider use of projects that are \n     supported by more than 1 executive agency, assistance \n     program, or appropriation of the Federal Government;\n       (3) encourage Federal-tribal arrangements under which \n     Indian tribes and tribal organizations may more effectively \n     and efficiently combine Federal and tribal resources to \n     support economic development projects;\n       (4) promote the coordination of Native American economic \n     programs to maximize the benefits of these programs to \n     encourage a more consolidated, national policy for economic \n     development; and\n       (5) establish a demonstration project to aid Indian tribes \n     in obtaining Federal resources and in more efficiently \n     administering these resources for the furtherance of tribal \n     self-governance and self-determination.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nmarriage tax penalty relief for earned income credit; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n                      MARRIAGE TAX PENALTY RELIEF\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to reduce \nthe marriage penalty built into the Earned Income Tax Credit--the EITC. \nIt appears that Congress may well act to address the marriage penalty \nthis year. Eliminating the marriage penalty is a worthwhile goal. A \nmarriage license shouldn't come with a higher tax bill from Uncle Sam. \nAs we consider this issue, however, I want to make sure that low-income \ntaxpayers are not left out of the debate. In terms of dollars, the EITC \nmarriage penalty may be relatively small, but for workers trying to \nraise children on low wages it represents a significant loss of income, \nand it may well deter couples from marrying.\n  Though our nation's economy continues to thrive, many Americans still \nstruggle to make ends meet. Working families across the nation hover \nabove the poverty level, striving to stay off welfare and yearning to \nprovide a decent life for their children. We can and must do more to \nhelp these families. And we can do it through the tax code in a manner \nthat is proven and fair, using the earned income tax credit. The EITC \nis a refundable tax credit specifically targeted to help low-income \nworkers and their families. In my state of Vermont, with soaring \nhousing costs and spiking fuel costs, the EITC has proven effective in \nsupplementing the income of working families.\n  By some estimates, the EITC has moved more than two million children \nout of poverty. One recent report calls it the most effective safety \nnet program for children in working poor families. In 1999, the EITC \nprovided low-income working families with two children a subsidy of \nroughly 40 cents for every dollar of income. But after income reaches a \ncertain point, the EITC is gradually phased out.\n  Unfortunately, a marriage penalty is built into the EITC. This \nmarriage penalty exists because a married couple's combined earnings \nput them at a higher point in the EITC phase-out range than where one \nor both of them would have been if they had remained single. If, for \nexample, one minimum wage earner marries another minimum wage earner \nwith two children, the couple's EITC would be over $1,300 less than the \ncombined EITC they would have received if they hadn't gotten married. \nFor working families that subsist on the minimum wage, this is a \nsignificant loss--more than half of their combined wages for a month.\n  To reduce the EITC marriage penalty, the bill I'm introducing will \nextend the point at which the EITC begins to phase out. This is the \napproach I advocated, and which was subsequently adopted in last year's \ntax bill. It is also the approach adopted in the bill passed by the \nWays and Means Committee. The difference between my bill and these \nother bills is the amount by which the beginning point of the phase-out \nrange would be extended. The other bills proposed to extend it by \n$2,000. I propose to extend it by $3,500; this would provide \nsignificantly more marriage penalty relief. My back-of-the-envelope \ncalculations indicate that my bill would eliminate about half of the \nmarriage penalties built into the EITC.\n  I do not have a cost estimate for this bill. For the Ways and Means \nmarriage penalty bill, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that a \n$2,000 extension of the beginning point of the EITC phase-out would \ncost $11 billion over 10 years. This is a relatively small part of a \nbill whose overall 10-year cost is $182 billion.\n  Last year, the conferees on the tax bill initially chose not to \ninclude help for EITC taxpayers in the marriage penalty provisions. I \nthreatened to vote against the bill, probably depriving it of a \nmajority in the Senate. The conference was reopened, and relief of the \nEITC marriage penalty was included in the final bill. I think that \nshows how strongly I feel about this issue. I'm glad that the House has \nlooked out for low-income taxpayers in its marriage penalty bill. \nStill, I think we can do better.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 2055. A bill to establish the Katie Poirier Abduction Emergency \nFund, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                              KATIE'S LAW\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a piece of \nlegislation that I hope will be called Katie's Law. This past year, \ncolleagues, in Carlton County, we lost a young, beautiful woman who \nworked at a convenience store. She was abducted. Everybody in the \ncommunity helped the family. Tragically, later her body was recovered. \nA suspect has been arrested for her murder.\n  I have, along with Sheila, stayed in close touch with Katie's family. \nWe have talked quite often with her mother Pam, her dad Steve, and her \nbrother Patrick.\n  When I went to the service, I couldn't even stand it, just to see the \npain. This never should have happened.\n  I thought about what I could do as a Senator to make a difference. I, \ntherefore, started talking to a lot of our rural law enforcement \npeople. They told me that whatever we could do in Congress, the key \nwould be to enhance their ability to respond quickly and aggressively \nto such crimes, that that would make a difference.\n  So there are two pieces to this piece of legislation. I hope I will \nget tremendous bipartisan support.\n  The first is an abduction emergency fund called the Katie Poirier \nAbduction Emergency Fund. Basically, what I am saying, colleagues, is \nthat for rural law enforcement, especially in the critical first 72 \nhours, they should never have to worry about whether they will have the \nresources and what the cost will be. This will be an emergency fund \nthey can draw upon from the Attorney General, to State agencies, down \nto the local level. For our rural law enforcement community, this is \ncritically important.\n  Then the second piece is to provide local law enforcement officers \nwith resources to use the latest identification systems to solve and \nprevent crime. In our metropolitan areas we have the technology, but in \nour rural communities quite often our local law enforcement communities \ndo not have the capacity to link up with systems such as the FBI's very \nsophisticated fingerprint identification system. This can be the \ndifference between 2 hours and 2 months. There will be money that will \ngo to local law enforcement, rural law enforcement so they can be able \nto take advantage of this technology.\n  Altogether, with the abduction emergency fund, we are talking about \n$10 million over 3 years, for $30 million; and on the technology \nupgrade for rural law enforcement, we are talking about $20 million \nover 3 years, for $60 million--total cost for 3 years, $90 million.\n  This is incredibly important to rural America. It is an investment we \nshould make. While I know no piece of legislation can ever provide 100 \npercent safety for our children, I do know this piece of legislation \nwill make a difference for rural law enforcement and will provide some \nprotection for our children and will provide some protection for our \nrural citizens.\n  I have never been more determined to pass any piece of legislation \nthan this small step. It is something I think I should do as a Senator. \nI think as Senators talk to their rural communities from around the \ncountry, they will find this does meet a very critical need.\n\n[[Page S617]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 2056. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct to ensure an adequate level of commodity purchases under the school \nlunch program; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                  EMERGENCY COMMODITY DISTRIBUTION ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague Senator \nJohnson in introducing the Emergency Commodity Distribution Act of \n2000.\n  Children are our future. I strongly believe each child deserves at \nleast one warm, nutritious meal every day. I stand before you today \nwith a new bill that will restore $500 million to the School Lunch \nProgram. The positive impacts of this program are endless. Children \nshould not have to pay the price of not having enough money for food.\n  Originally enacted in 1946, the school lunch program set goals to \nimprove children's nutrition, increase low-income children's access to \nnutritious meals, and to help support the agricultural industry. A \nfamily of four has to have an income at or below 130 percent of the \nfederal poverty level to qualify for a free lunch. The income for these \nfamilies is tragically low. Congress has a role in providing these \nchildren with assistance their families cannot provide.\n  Last year, Congress enacted the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives \nImprovement Act. This legislation amended the School Lunch Act to \nrequire the United States Department of Agriculture to count the value \nof bonus commodities when it determines the total amount of commodity \nassistance provided to schools. This change will result in a $500 \nmillion budget cut for the school lunch program over a nine-year \nperiod.\n  In FY1998, the school lunch program comprised over 90 percent of \nschools, with some 90,000 schools enrolling 46.5 million children. \nChildren receiving free lunches averaged 13 million a day, and those \nreceiving reduced price lunches averaged 2.2 million a day. Each state \nand millions of children are affected. This program provides a basic \nrequirement of food for needy children.\n  No child should be without food. The Emergency Commodity Distribution \nAct of 2000 would ensure that schools receive the full value of \nentitlement commodity assistance, and allow the School Lunch Program to \ncontinue to meet its dual purpose of supporting American agriculture \nwhile providing nutritious food to schools across the country. I urge \nmembers to support this bill, support children, and support our future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 2057. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit \nthe use of electronic measurement units (EMUs); to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                   the motorists privacy act of 2000\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Motorists \nPrivacy Act of 2000. This legislation has become necessary because \ntechnological advancements threaten to allow government and private \nenterprise to develop a vast database of information about the comings \nand goings of ordinary Americans.\n  Recently, I learned of a device known as an electronic measurement \nunit (EMU). EMUs are placed on billboards along highways and at the \nentrances to stadiums and concert locations in Atlanta, Indianapolis, \nLos Angeles, Phoenix, Boston, and a variety of other cities throughout \nthe nation. These shoe-box size devices instantly determine what radio \nstation a car radio is tuned to by detecting electronic signals emitted \nfrom the oscillators in every car radio.\n  These devices are capable of measuring tens of thousands of radios in \npassing cars every day. And they provide nearly instantaneous \ninformation on the number of people listening to a radio station at any \ngiven time. This valuable data can then be sold to radio owners, who \ncan then adjust their advertising rates based on listenership.\n  Mr. President, there is nothing wrong with surveying radio usage so \nlong as a citizen voluntarily chooses to participate in such a survey. \nHowever, when private enterprise or the government begin to monitor \nradio or television usage, without the knowledge of the citizen, then a \nline is crossed that can only lead down the path to Big Brother. And as \nfar as this Senator is concerned, that is not going to happen so long \nas I am a Member of the Senate.\n  When a citizen is sitting inside of his or her car, there is a 100 \npercent expectation of privacy that what is said and listened to is \nprivate. Motorists, rightfully, should have no suspicion that they are \nbeing monitored by the government or by private enterprise. However, in \nthe case of EMUs, few motorists are aware that these devices even exist \nand in most cases, no attempt is made to inform motorists when they \nenter an area in which EMUs are utilized.\n  Mr. President, what right does a company or government have to snoop \non what people are listening to in their automobiles? It is not a very \ngreat leap to imagine a world where EMUs track not only what you listen \nto in the car, but combined with remote television cameras, track your \ndriving patterns. And surely, such devices could be installed in \nneighborhoods in order to monitor what families watch on television in \ntheir homes. Surely such invasions of privacy cannot be tolerated.\n  Therefore, I am today introducing the Motorists Privacy Act which \noutlaws the use of electronic measurement units to scan car radios. \nRegardless of whether or not these scans are anonymous, motorists \ndeserve the same expectation of privacy within their cars as does a \nhomeowner. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2057\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Motorists Privacy Act of \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON USE OF ELECTRONIC MEASUREMENT UNITS.\n\n       Part I of title III of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 338. PROHIBITION ON USE OF ELECTRONIC MEASUREMENT \n                   UNITS.\n\n       ``(a) Prohibition.--No person may install, post, operate, \n     or otherwise use an electronic measurement unit (EMU).\n       ``(b) Electronic Measurement Unit Defined.--In subsection \n     (a), the term `electronic measurement unit (EMU)' means a \n     device that determines the frequency of the radio broadcast \n     being received by a radio receiver located within a vehicle \n     passing through the operating range of the device.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Mack, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Durbin, \n        and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2058. A bill to extend filing deadlines for applications for \nadjustment of status of certain Cuban, Nicaraguan, and Haitian \nnationals; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\nlegislation to extend filing deadlines for applications for adjustment \n     of status of certain Cuban, Nicaraguan, and Haitian nationals\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor this afternoon \nto introduce legislation which has as its objective to assure a greater \nmeasure of fairness to a particularly vulnerable group of Central \nAmerican and Caribbean nationals who, in many cases, for many years \nhave resided in the United States.\n  I appreciate the support of my colleagues: Senators Mack, Kennedy, \nDurbin, and Feinstein, who join in this effort as cosponsors.\n  For some background: In 1997, and again in 1998, Congress passed \nlegislation to protect, first, a group of Central American and Cuban \nnationals and then a similar group of Haitian nationals who were \nrefugees and were threatened with deportation.\n  Action was needed in those 2 years because of passage of the 1996 \nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, which \nchanged immigration rules and did so, in many instances, retroactively. \nThe history of this group of people started during the Presidency of \nRonald Reagan. The United States offered protection and legal status to \nmany Central American nationals who were fighting for democracy in \ntheir home country or fleeing the war that had ensued. Similarly, \nduring the Presidency of George Bush, Haitian nationals were forced to \nflee after the overthrow of the elected President, Jean-Bertrand \nAristide, in\n\n[[Page S618]]\n\n1994. They were offered protection and legal status in the United \nStates.\n  In 1996, these Central American and Haitian nationals had been living \nin our country for years; in the cases of the Central Americans, often \nlonger than a decade. They established businesses. They formed and \nraised families. They bought homes. They strengthened the communities \nin which they lived. Then in 1996, with the passage of the Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, these Central \nAmerican and Haitian individuals and families were made retroactively \ndeportable. These deportations would have occurred years and years \nafter these nationals had established their lives in the United States.\n  Congress moved quickly to protect their legal status here by passing \nthe Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act in November \nof 1997, and then the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act in \nOctober of 1998. These two bills made certain sections of the 1996 \nimmigration law nonretroactive. We mandated in those two pieces of \nlegislation that to apply for relief from deportation under this \nmeasure, applications had to be made by a date certain: March 31, 2000.\n\n  The sad fact is, in 3 years after one of these pieces of legislation \nwas passed and more than 2 years after another, we are still waiting \nfor the final regulations to be issued for both of these pieces of \nlegislation. The final rules that would help families apply for relief \nhave not yet been issued. Interim regulations were issued for both \nbills in 1998 and 1999, but in neither case have the regulations become \nfinal. There is the very real possibility that the application \ndeadline, March 31, 2000, could come and go before the final \nregulations, which establish the rules and procedures by which \napplications will be submitted and evaluated, have even been issued.\n  Both for reasons of fairness and to promote good Government, we \nshould extend the application deadline for relief. Under this \nlegislation, the new deadline for relief will be 1 year after the date \nthe regulations become final.\n  I point out to my colleagues that this legislation will not cover any \nadditional individuals who will have the right to apply for the right \nto live in the United States. No additional persons will be granted \neligibility as a result of this legislation beyond those who were made \neligible in 1997 and again in 1998. What this legislation does is \ncreate a more realistic and fair deadline for individuals Congress has \nalready passed legislation to protect.\n  This action should be taken because it is fair. First, it is fair to \nthe immigrants. We shouldn't expect them to go through the arduous and \nvery costly application process without the certainty that the \nregulations which will govern their applications are final.\n  It is easy to put a human face on this issue. There are scores, \nhundreds, thousands of examples. Let me just cite one which was brought \nto my attention by a prominent immigration attorney in Florida. I will \ncall this young woman, in order to protect her privacy, Frances. She is \na real human being. Frances is 22 years old. Her parents fled Haiti in \nthe 1980s, when she was a child. Her family settled in Florida. She now \nhas three U.S. citizen brothers and sisters. Tragedy has struck her \nfamily on several occasions. Her father died when she was just 7 years \nold. Her mother died when she was still in her early teens. She \nfinished high school and is now raising her younger brothers and \nsisters while working. She is an orphan. She would be in the class of \npersons protected by the 1998 legislation. She is trying now to put \ntogether the documents necessary to apply to stay in the United States \nand not be separated from her U.S. citizen brothers and sisters, the \nonly family she has left.\n  The 1-year extension and the ability to apply for relief once \nregulations are final will make a huge difference in the life of this \nwoman, will make a huge difference in her ability to comply with \nprocedures which are probably the most significant in her life.\n  Today, I am introducing this in an effort to secure as rapid a \nresolution of these concerns as possible. I am not unmindful of the \nmagnitude of the task Congress has asked the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service to perform. I don't want to imply that the INS \nand other Federal agencies should rush through these technical pieces \nof legislation. However, in situations such as this, where a longer \ntime than expected was needed to develop the regulations, it is only \nfair to allow a longer time for those who are going to be affected by \nthe law.\n\n  I understand the INS has been very thorough and understanding. It has \nmet with individual groups on all sides of this issue. Many of them \nhave been my constituents in Florida. I commend the INS for its \nwillingness to hear all points of view and be thorough in their review \nbefore issuing final regulations. However, having said that, I believe \nnearly 3 years is a reasonable amount of time to have finalized these \nregulations.\n  The Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act took only \nnine pages of text in Public Law 105-100 when it was passed. Similarly, \nthe Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act took less than two pages \nto print in the Congressional Record. These were concise, targeted \npieces of legislation. They were not lengthy, complex overhauls of \nmajor components of the immigration law. It is plain unfair to give \nsomeone a deadline and charge them a substantial fee to file and then \nto be uncertain as to what the rules will be that will govern those \napplications. With this legislation, I seek the flexibility to allow \nmore time to apply for relief in a situation where more time than \nexpected was necessary by the agency, the INS, to issue the \nregulations.\n  I send to the desk a few of the letters I have received from \nindividuals and advocacy groups and religious leaders calling for this \ndeadline extension, and I ask unanimous consent that these letters from \nthe American Immigration Lawyers Association of South Florida, the \nHaitian American Foundation, the Haiti Advocacy Agency, all be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send the legislation to the desk, which \nhas been cosponsored by Senators Mack, Kennedy, Durbin, and Feinstein. \nI ask my colleagues for their understanding and their support for this \nlegislation--legislation that will ensure the most basic elements of \nfairness in our democratic system, which will allow people who have \nfled war and persecution to come to the freedom of the United States \nand to be treated fairly by our laws.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                                              American Immigration\n\n\n                                          Lawyers Association,\n\n                                        South Florida Chapter,\n\n                                                 January 24, 2000.\n     Senator Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Re: Letter of support for your effort to extend application \n         period for HRIFA & NACARA.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the South Florida Chapter \n     of the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) I \n     write this letter of support to encourage you in your effort \n     to introduce legislation to extend the application period for \n     HRIFA & NACARA beneficiaries.\n       My organization has long-supported both bills and is \n     appreciative of your great efforts in support of these \n     efforts. Please let us know if there is anything we can do to \n     help.\n       Thank you, Senator Graham.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Michael D.

Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Office Bldg.\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sir: Thank you for introducing legislation to extend \n     the filing period under which HRIFA and NACARA can be filed.\n       Haitians have had an extraordinarily short period of time \n     to apply--a mere nine months. Due to this narrow time period, \n     many eligible poor people have not been able to apply because \n     of the uncapped INS fee structure and the reluctance of the \n     few pro bono attorneys serving them to submit fee waiver \n     requests for fear that INS might deem the application \n     untimely. As you know, as of December 31, 1999 only 18,000 \n     individuals had applied (of 50,000 INS estimates are \n     eligible).\n       This low number of applicants is due to the high costs \n     involved. Most families must pay between $1,000 to $2,000 in \n     INS fees alone. Supplement fees--such as the requisite \n     medical exams--are additional financial burdens for \n     applicants.\n       Extension of the HRIFA and NACARA filing deadline is \n     essential if Congress hopes to help Haitian refugees. Some \n     30,000 Haitians in South Florida are expected to benefit from \n     such extension.\n\n[[Page S619]]\n\n       Your legislation is indispensable and crucial. I applaud \n     your leadership in introducing the legislation and thereby \n     serving as a champion to your constituents.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Leonie M.

Bob Graham,\n     524 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Re: Extension of HRIFA/NACARA Filing Deadlines.\n       Dear Senator Graham: We are greatly encouraged that you are \n     introducing legislation to extend the deadlines for \n     applications under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central \n     American Relief Act (NACARA) and the Haitian Refugee \n     Immigration Fairness Act (HRIFA).\n       As you know, more than 2 years has passed since the passage \n     of NACARA and more than one since the passage of HRIFA and \n     the INS has yet to issue final regulations implementing these \n     laws. The statutory deadline for applications under both \n     laws, April 1, 2000, is fast approaching.\n       Interim regulations contained unreasonably burdensome \n     documentary requirements, excessive fees and lack of \n     appropriate consideration for special groups such as \n     abandoned children and refugees who were compelled to use \n     false documents in order to flee. These and other \n     deficiencies have, to date, prevented all but a minority of \n     those eligible from filing applications.\n       Hundreds of comments were filed critiquing these and other \n     restrictions as inconsistent with the remedial intent of \n     Congress. We certainly hope that the INS will give full and \n     fair consideration to these comments and ameliorate the \n     shortcomings in the final version. Nevertheless, it is now \n     apparent that any such improvements will be largely, if not \n     completely, negated by the short time remaining before the \n     deadline.\n       Accordingly, it is fitting and proper to extend the \n     deadlines to one year following the promulgation of such \n     final regulations so that the intended beneficiaries of this \n     important legislation receive the full measure of justice \n     provided under law.\n       Thank you for your support and kind consideration of our \n     views.\n           Respectfully,\n         Merrill Smith, Director; And: Linda Wood Ballard; Maurice \n           Belanger, Senior Policy Associate; National Immigration \n           Forum; 220 I Street NE, Suite 220; Washington DC 20002; \n           Phillip J.

A bill to modify land conveyance authority relating to the \nformer Naval Training Center, Bainbridge, Cecil County, Maryland, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n            bainbridge naval training center land conveyance\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould alleviate the $500,000 cost associated with the transfer of the \nformer Bainbridge Naval Training Center in Cecil County, Maryland. It \nis my hope that this bill will help expedite the development of this \nproperty by the Bainbridge Development Corporation and the State of \nMaryland, and allow this site to realize its tremendous potential as \nsoon as possible. Moreover, the money that the BDC will save through \nthis waiver will be put towards salvaging several of the historic \nbuildings on the site, namely, the historic Tome School.\n  Next week, I will participate in the transfer ceremony for this base, \nwhich now represents 1200 acres of pristine and strategically located \nland. The transfer follows decades of negotiations and cleanup, and I, \nalong with the Navy, my constituents in Cecil County, and the other \nmembers of the Maryland State congressional delegation hope to see \ndevelopment of this site begin promptly.\n  In my view, the transfer of the Bainbridge site is a shining example \nof what can be accomplished through partnerships between Federal, \nState, and local governments. I introduce this bill to sustain our \nmomentum and move this property into productive use as expeditiously as \npossible. Mr. President, I have spoken with the appropriate Navy \nofficials regarding this matter and they have raised no concerns about \nthis waiver. Indeed, this is truly a non-controversial measure with a \nvery modest cost and I urge my colleagues to support its swift passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Baucus, and Mr. Helms):\n  S. 2060. A bill to authorize the President to award a gold medal on \nbehalf of the Congress to Charles M. Schulz in recognition of his \nlasting artistic contributions to the Nation and the world, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n   legislation to award charles schultz the congressional gold medal\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on January 3rd, 2000, Charles Schulz \npublished his last daily ``Peanuts'' comic strip ending a remarkable \nfifty year run. To commemorate Charles Schulz's extraordinary career, I \nurge my colleagues to join me in awarding him a Congressional Medal of \nHonor.\n  Charles Schulz's body of work in the ``Peanuts'' strip deserves \nrecognition as a national treasure. For half a century, his cartoon \nillustrations have inspired millions of Americans with its wry humor \nand endearing cast of characters. Who has not been touched by the \ntrials and tribulations of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy, and the \nrest of the ``Peanuts'' family?\n  At its peak, Peanuts appeared in close to 3,000 newspapers in 75 \ncountries and was published in over 20 different languages to more than \n355 million daily readers. Charles Schulz's television special, ``A \nCharlie Brown Christmas,'' has run for 34 consecutive years. In all, \nmore that 60 animated specials have been created based on ``Peanuts'' \ncharacters. Four feature films, 1,400 books, and a hit Broadway musical \nabout the ``Peanuts'' characters also have been produced.\n  Charles Schulz's achievements are all the more remarkable because, \nthroughout his career, he has worked without any artistic assistants, \nunlike most syndicated cartoonists. Schulz has painstakingly drawn \nevery line and frame in his comic strip for 50 years, an unparalleled \ncommitment to his art and profession.\n  In 1994, while speaking before the National Cartoonists Society, \nCharles Schulz said of his comic strip, ``There's still a market for \nthings that are clean and decent.'' Charles Schulz has given \ngenerations of children a cast of colorful characters to grow up with \nand to teach the small and large lessons of life.\n  Seventeen Americans from the arts and entertainment world have been \nawarded the Congressional Gold Medal for their achievements in the \nenrichment of American culture. I urge that Charles Schulz become the \neighteenth individual so honored. Please join me in recognizing the \nlifetime contributions of Charles Schulz by awarding him the \nCongressional Gold Medal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 2061. A bill to establish a crime prevention and computer \neducation initiative; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                           the kids 2000 act\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there has been incredible prosperity that \nthe vast majority of our country is benefiting from--and that \nprosperity was built on a combination of communication and computers. \nThis technology has opened a whole new world for America. This new \ntechnology has driven our economic growth. And, the future lies with \nthose who can master the tools of this new economic age.\n  It wasn't too long ago that it looked like our time in the sun was \nbehind us.\n\n[[Page S620]]\n\nBehind us was the idea of prosperity in our country. But times have \nchanged over the past few years. And we stand here today with the \nprospect of a new era of prosperity.\n  With flexible financial markets, a historic wave of entrepreneurial \nactivity, and the convergence of new technologies from the personal \ncomputer to the Internet, we are transforming ourselves into what is \nnow called the ``new economy.''\n  Look at the numbers: In recent years, Information Technology \nindustries contributed 35% to Gross Domestic Product growth. The \nInformation Technology sector is growing at twice the rate of the rest \nof the economy. And by 2006, more than half of the U.S. workforce will \nbe employed by industries that are either major producers, or intensive \nusers, of Information Technology.\n  A lot of what we do--manufacturing, shipping, marketing, are \nbasically the same old functions. But we do virtually all of them in \nnew and better ways thanks to the explosion of information technology. \nThis has increased our productivity in ways that the best economists \nstill don't completely understand.\n  But, there is one thing that we do understand: those who can master \ntechnology will be able to benefit from this great expansion--and that \nis why we are here today. So no one is left behind.\n  That is why today I am proud to be introducing legislation, aptly \ntitled Kids 2000, that will be one step in our mission to provide all \nchildren with access to technology.\n  It is my hope, that through a public/private partnership, led by \nmembers of Congress and Steve and Jean Case, state-of-the-art computer \ncenters will be placed in Boys & Girls Clubs nationwide. Located in \nlargely under-served communities, Club computer centers will reach \nprecisely the kids who need these resources the most. And none of these \nkids will be left behind.\n  One goal of Kids 2000 is to help close the digital divide by \nproviding kids with computers, internet access, and fully comprehensive \ntechnical training. As the wonders of computers become increasingly \nevident and celebrated, certain segments of society still lack access \nto these resources. Some segments are not participating in this \ntechnological revolution that is sweeping across our country.\n  And the disparities are alarming. Look at the figures: Of households \nmaking over $75,000, 80% own computers and 60% use the Internet. Yet, \nfor households making between $10,000-$15,000, only 16% own a computer \nand only 7% use the Internet.\n  And it's not just income levels. There are disparities amongst races, \neducation levels and geography. In addition, at all income levels, \nhouseholds with two parents are far more likely than one-parent \nhouseholds to own computers and have Internet access.\n  The digital divide is also significant because the new digital \neconomy can't run on computers alone. Businesses need workers with \ncomputer know-how and Internet literacy. Those who are not competent \nwith the tools of technology will be left behind. Some of them are our \nkids. They are our responsibility and we cannot let this happen.\n  And we know what happens to our kids when they are left behind. Their \nopportunities are vastly reduced, there is despair, and even criminal \nbehavior. But there is something that we can do. And we are here today \nto begin a significant effort to do just that--to close the digital \ndivide.\n  Addressing the problems associated with the digital divide is not all \nthis initiative seeks to do. Another goal is to reduce juvenile crime \nby providing kids with substantive after-school programs.\n  Everyone has heard me say this time and time again, but let me say \nthis one more time--prevention works.\n  While kids are learning in these computer centers, they will be off \nthe street and out of harm's way. They will be occupied with \nconstructive activities. School dropout rates will be reduced because \nkids will realize that they have great potential. Kids 2000 is the \nultimate after-school program.\n  That is precisely why I have asked the Boys and Girls Clubs to host \nmy computer initiative. For decades, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America \nhave provided young people all across the United States with the \nsupport and inspiration they need to make it in a world full of peer \npressure and crime.\n  Kids 2000 also makes sense economically. It is estimated that \nallowing a single youth to drop out of high school and enter a life of \ndrug abuse and crime costs society between $1.7 and $2.3 million. In \ncomparison, Kids 2000 will cost the government a mere $40 per child.\n  Because I believe that there is a role for the private sector, I have \nasked my good friends Jean and Steve Case and PowerUp to be an integral \npart of this initiative. That means computers, America On-Line \naccounts, educational curriculum, and fully comprehensive technical \ntraining in Boys and Girls Clubs nationwide.\n  And PowerUp is not alone. 3-Com has committed to donating $1 million \nin networking equipment, MCI Worldcom will be donating educational \nsoftware and training, American Airlines has agreed to donate free \nairline travel to train teachers, Ripple Effects Software will donate \neducational software, and Sabre Inc. will be donating computers.\n  I want to thank all the corporations that have stepped forward and I \nhope that there will be many more in the coming months. We can't do \nthis project without the private sector's help.\n  I want to say thanks to Steve and Jean Case who have been in the \nforefront of this issue since the beginning and who are participating \nin this initiative in a very significant way. You know we could not do \nthis without you and I appreciate your generosity and commitment to the \ncause.\n  This initiative has brought together so many integral sectors of \nsociety. Business, government, the non-profit world. Together, we can \nmake this program a success. Together we can make a difference in the \nlives of kids and provide our children with the tools they need to live \nand learn in a world that has become so dependent on technology.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2061\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Kids 2000 Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend chapter 4 of title 39, United States Code, \nto allow postal patrons to contribute to funding for organ and tissue \ndonation awareness through the voluntary purchase of certain specially \nissued United States postage stamps; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n       ORGAN AND TISSUE DONATION AWARENESS ``SEMI-POSTAL'' STAMP\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today with my \nfriend and colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, to introduce \nlegislation that would authorize the issuance of the organ and tissue \ndonation awareness ``semi-postal'' stamp. With 67,000 people on the \norgan donation waiting list, we have no time to lose in educating the \npublic about the importance of life-giving organ and tissue donations.\n  In August 1998, as a result of strong public and congressional \ninterest, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 32-cent organ and tissue \ndonation commemorative stamp. But, just five months later, the postal \nrate increased to 33-cents. To use the stamp, that meant purchasers \nwould have to buy an additional one-cent stamp to make up the postage \ndifference. Yet, despite this hassle, more than 47 million of the 50 \nmillion stamps originally printed have been purchased, demonstrating \nthe strong demand for an organ and tissue donation awareness postage \nstamp.\n  Since the U.S. Postal Service does not re-issue commemorative stamps, \nwe are seeking authorization for a ``semi-postal'' stamp. This stamp \nwould sell for up to 25 percent above the value of a first-class stamp, \nregardless of the price of the first-class stamp, itself. The surplus \nrevenues would be directed to programs that increase organ and tissue \ndonation awareness. The decision to donate an organ or tissue is a \nlife-saving one. However, it is frequently one that family members and \nloved ones fail to communicate to one another. Every effort we make to \nremind people that this is a decision that should be communicated \nbefore a tragedy strikes is an effort toward saving lives. Whether it \nis an organ and tissue donation postage stamp or a box that drivers can \nmark as they renew their drivers' licenses, they are steps that raise \nawareness of the importance of communicating to family and friends the \ndecision to become an organ or tissue donor.\n  I would like to thank my colleague, Senator Durbin, for joining me in \nintroducing this legislation, and Senators Abraham, Baucus, Cleland, \nDodd, and Levin for their co-sponsorship. I have appreciated their \nsupport for this bill and for their tremendous work on behalf of organ \nand tissue donation awareness. I would also like to thank a number of \norgan and tissue donation groups who support this legislation--the \nMinority Organ Tissue Transplant Education Program (MOTTEP); the \nNational Kidney Foundation (NKF); the United Network for Organ Sharing \n(UNOS); Transplant Recipients International Organization, Inc. (TRIO); \nthe Coalition on Donation; Hadassah; the Eye Bank Association of \nAmerica; the American Society of Transplantation; the American Society \nof Transplant Surgeons; LifeBanc; and the Association of Organ \nProcurement Organizations.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important \nlegislation. Time is of the essence. The waiting list for organs \nincludes 67,000 people, with a new name added to that list every 16 \nminutes. Moreover, ten to twelve people die every day waiting for an \norgan to become available. There is simply no time to lose. Every \neffort we make to increase, and in this case help generate, funds for \norgan and tissue donation awareness will help to save someone's life.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2062\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I introduce two bills that \nare very important crime fighting measures. My legislation will help \nprovide law enforcement with additional assistance in locating missing \npeople. One bill, the ``Abducted Young Adults Act,'' will give the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children the legal authority \nto assist law enforcement officers in locating abducted young adults \naged 18 through 21. The second bill, ``Kristen's Law,'' authorizes the \nAttorney General to provide grants to public agencies and nonprofit \nprivate organizations that help find missing adults.\n\n  Mr. President, let me tell you a story about a girl from my State of \nNorth Carolina. Her name is Kristen Modafferi. Kristen was a bright, \nhard-working student at North Carolina State University. After \nfinishing up her freshman year of college, she traveled to San \nFrancisco to spend the summer taking a photography class at Berkeley. \nOnce Kristen arrived in San Francisco, she started her class and got a \ncouple of jobs to help pay for her expenses. She was settling in and \nmaking friends.\n  On Monday, June 23, 1997, Kristen left work to visit a local beach. \nShe has not been seen since. Kristen was three weeks over the age of 18 \nwhen she disappeared.\n  Law enforcement devoted a great deal of time to finding Kristen and \nshould be commended for their efforts. Despite a number of leads, \nKristen has never been found.\n  For 15 years, since the creation of the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children, our Nation has recognized the vulnerability of \nyoung children to abductions and exploitation. We have provided the \nfunding and support vital to ensuring rapid and multi jurisdictional \nresponses to these cases. But in Kristen's case we could not--and all \nbecause she was 3 weeks past her 18th birthday. The charter for the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children only allows the \nCenter to help law enforcement search for missing children aged 0 to \n18.\n  When a person involuntarily disappears, time is of the essence. \nSearch efforts must begin quickly, and they must reach across \njurisdictions. Abducted youngsters are often taken across state lines. \nIn order to effectively coordinate a search, the groups conducting the \nsearch must have an easy way to share information with each other, no \nmatter how far away from one another they may be. The greater the \nnumber of agencies helping in the search, the more likely it is that \nthe person will be found. But there is no central, federally-\nestablished organization that exists to aid law enforcement in their \nefforts to locate missing 18-21 year-olds. Unfortunately, Kristen's \ntragic story illustrates the need for such an organization. And what \nbetter way to fill this need than to build upon a reputable, federally-\npartnered organization--the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren--that already exists to search for missing individuals under \n18?\n  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children serves as the \nnational clearinghouse for information on missing children and the \nprevention of child victimization. The Center works in partnership with \nthe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention at the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, and its mission is codified in federal law.\n  Because the Center was established for the purpose of assisting with \ncases that involve missing children under the age of 18, the Center \ndoes not typically assist with cases involving involuntarily missing \ncollege students and other people who happen to be 18 through 21 years \nold. The sad fact is that had Kristen been just a few weeks younger \nwhen she disappeared, the Center would have immediately mobilized to \nstart a search.\n  One of the measures I introduce today, The Abducted Young Adults Act, \nwould expand the Center's charter to allow it to use its expertise and \nresources to help find involuntarily missing young adults in the 18 \nthrough 21 year-old age group.\n  Mr. President, some people might inquire why I chose to limit \nexpansion of the Center's mission by only covering individuals under \nage 22. For example, my bill would not affect the Center's ability to \nhelp police search for Kristen's sister Allison and other individuals \nwho are 22 and over. The second bill I am introducing today, Kristen's \nAct, will help fill this gap. I will discuss that bill in a moment. \nHowever, the reason for my decision to limit the expansion of the \nCenter's mission is twofold.\n  First, although a person is considered a legal adult when they attain \nthe age of 18, I think most people would agree that college-aged kids \nare just that--kids. Members of this age group are particularly \nvulnerable to criminals and are frequently victims of crime. They are \naway from home for the first time in their lives, in an unfamiliar \narea, without the presence of their parents. I believe that most people \nwould agree that this age group needs special protection.\n  Statistics demonstrate the need to address the issue of missing young \nadults and to find a way to provide some additional resources for this \ngroup. In fact, according to data from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nSheriff's office in my state of North Carolina, in 1999, they received \nreports of 132 missing persons aged 18-21. That's the number for just \none city, in just one state in the country. If we were to amass similar \nstatistics for every jurisdiction across the country, I believe we \nwould be astounded at the high rate of disappearances for this age \ngroup. For example, in February, 1999, the FBI reported 1,896 new cases \nof missing 18 through 21-year-olds--1,896 new cases in just one month. \nThis is a frighteningly large number. And I believe that the Abducted \nYoung Adults Act is a necessary protective measure. It will provide \nsome comfort to the millions of parents who send their children to\n\n[[Page S623]]\n\ncollege every year and worry about their safety: If anything does \nhappen, a national effort will be mobilized to help.\n\n  The second reason that the legislation would apply to a limited age \ngroup is that I believe the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren should stay focused on its central mission--to help search for \nmissing children.\n  Since its founding, the Center has helped recover nearly 48,000 \nchildren. Imagine the benefit to families and law enforcement if the \nCenter were to help search for abducted young adults. Surely the number \nof active missing young adult cases would decline if the Center helped \nwith the search efforts. I believe my legislation is a logical \nextension of the Center's current mission.\n  My bill would authorize appropriations of $2.5 million per year \nthrough 2003 so that the Center does not have to divert any of the \nfunding it needs to effectively search for children. I have worked \nclosely with the Center's staff to ensure that my bill will enhance not \nharm the Center's current mission. As a result, the Abducted Young \nAdults Act is fully supported by the Center.\n  The Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) also strongly supports my \nlegislation. Gilbert Gallegos, National President of the FOP, is a \nmember of the Board of Directors for the Center. As he so aptly states \nin his letter of support for the bill, ``Just because you turn eighteen \nis no guarantee that you will not be the victim of a crime.''\n  Mr. President, I believe that it is important to mention that it is \ntrue that some individuals aged 18 through 21 may disappear because \nthey want to. Some of these individuals may live in abusive households. \nOthers may want to start a new life. And because they are considered \nlegal adults, they have the choice to remain missing. In these cases, \nit may not make sense for law enforcement, the Center, or anyone else \nto launch a search.\n  My legislation ensures that the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children will use its public resources to search for only \nthose missing young adults aged 18-21 that law enforcement has first \ndetermined to be missing involuntarily.\n  Specifically, my bill says that in order for an individual to be \ndefined as an involuntarily missing young adult, the following criteria \nmust be met: (1) their whereabouts must be unknown to their parent or \nguardian; (2) law enforcement must have entered a missing persons \nreport on the individual into the National Crime Information Center; \nand (3) there must be a reasonable indication or suspicion that the \nindividual has been abducted or is missing under circumstances \nsuggesting foul play or a threat to life; or (4) the individual is \nknown to be suicidal or has a severe medical condition that poses a \nthreat to his or her life.\n  I believe that the Abducted Young Adults Act is a common-sense way to \nhelp prevent further incidences like the one involving Kristen \nModafferi. For every child the Center assists in locating, there are a \nhandful of individuals that it cannot help find. If my bill enables the \nCenter to help find just one more missing youngster, then I believe the \nbill will have succeeded in its goal.\n  I am pleased that the Abducted Young Adults Act is co-sponsored by \nSenator Biden. Senator Biden was instrumental to the establishment of \nthe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and I thank him \nfor his leadership and support.\n  Mr. President, the Abducted Young Adults Act is only one part of the \nsolution. The other part of the solution is to provide the \norganizations that are devoted to searching for missing adults with the \nresources they need to be more effective in their efforts to search for \nall adults, regardless of age.\n  That is why I am also introducing Kristen's Law, named after Kristen \nModafferi. This bill has been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Representative Sue Myrick, and I thank her for her \ninvolvement in this issue.\n  As I mentioned, Kristen's Law would allow the Attorney General to \nmake grants to public agencies or nonprofit private organizations to \nassist law enforcement and families in locating missing adults. Grants \ncould also be used by these agencies and organizations for a number of \nother reasons. For example, funds could be used to maintain a national, \ninterconnected database for the purpose of tracking missing adults who \nare determined by law enforcement to be endangered due to age, \ndiminished mental capacity, or the circumstances of disappearance. And \nthe grants could be used to help establish a national clearinghouse for \nmissing adults and to assist with victim advocacy related to missing \nadults.\n  Generally, the greater the number of people conducting a search, the \ngreater the chance is of locating missing individuals. The combination \nof the Abducted Young Adults Act and Kristen's Law sends a message to \nfamilies that they deserve all of the help necessary to locate \nendangered and involuntarily missing loved ones. Together, these bills \nwill help ensure that all endangered and involuntarily missing adults--\nregardless of age--will receive not only the benefit of search efforts \nby law enforcement, but also by experienced, specialized organizations.\n  I request that the text of the two bills be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                S. 2064\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nUnited States savings bond income from gross income if used to pay \nlong-term care expenses; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 Tax-Exemption Savings Bond Legislation\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, to support Americans faced with \nlong-term care needs I am proposing a savings bond tax credit. Many \npeople are struggling to pay for the assistive care needs associated \nwith conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. An \nestimated 5.8 million Americans aged 65 or older need long-term care. \nNursing home care is only one component of long-term care services that \nincludes assisted living, adult day and home care. Medicare and health \ninsurance do not cover long-term care. In 1995, federal and state \nspending for nursing home care was approximately $34 billion and an \nadditional $21 billion was used for home care. It is projected that \nhalf of all women and a third of men in this country who are now age 65 \nare likely to spend some time in their later years in a nursing home at \na cost from $40,000 to $90,000 per person. About 40% of all nursing \nhome expenses are paid for out-of-pocket by patients and/or family \nmembers. Liquidating family assets is often the only way for many to \nfund the high costs for care. These staggering statistics and the pleas \nfor help from Americans in such situations reinforce the critical need \nfor long-term care assistance.\n  To qualify for this proposed tax credit, the person receiving care \nmust have at least two limitations in activities of daily living or a \ncomparable cognitive impairment. Activities of daily living, like \neating, bathing, and toileting, are basic care needs that must be met. \nFamilies that claim parents or parents-in law as dependents on their \ntax returns can qualify for this tax credit if\n\n[[Page S625]]\n\nsavings bonds are used to pay for long-term care services. ``Sandwich \ngeneration'' families paying for both college education for their \nchildren and long-term care services for their parents can use this tax \ncredit for either program or a combined credit up to the maximum.\n  Mr. President, I ask that this proposed measure to provide long-term \ncare cost relief be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 2066\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide education and training for the information \nage; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n               america's math and science excellence act\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce America's Math and \nScience Excellence Act that will keep the United States on the cutting \nedge of the Information Technology (IT) revolution. If we are to \nprepare our children to meet the demands of our future workforce, we \nmust dedicate ourselves to strengthening math and science literacy. \nAmerica's Math and Science Excellence Act would authorize funding for \nmath and science education and training through a series of grants \nawarded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institute \nof Standards and Technology. This bill would create a long-term \nstrategy to ensure that the IT industry is employing American students \nwho are prepared to enter the workforce with sufficient math and \nscience skills necessary to compete both domestically and \ninternationally.\n  The Third International Math and Science Study, the most \ncomprehensive and rigorous comparison of quantitative skills across \nnations, reveals that the longer our students stay in the elementary \nand public school system, the worse they perform on standardized tests. \nTheir average tests scores continue to drop from the fourth to the \ntwelfth grade. The rapidly changing technology revolution demands \nskills and proficiency in mathematics, science, and technology. IT, \nperhaps the fastest growing sector of our economy, relies on more than \nbasic high school literacy in mathematics and science.\n  This bipartisan legislation targets three specific goals: \nestablishing teacher training and development outreach, providing \ninternship opportunities for students in secondary and higher \neducation, and assisting graduate math, science, and engineering \nstudents. America's Math and Science Excellence Act gives priority to \napplicants who obtain private sector or state matching funds. We must \nencourage private industry to not only get involved in the education of \nthe future workforce, but also to help direct and guide it.\n  According to a study by the CEO Forum on Education and Technology, \nour schools spend an average of $88 per student on computers and only \n$6 on teacher training. And while the nation's 87,000 schools have \napproximately six million computers and about 80 percent of the schools \nhave Internet access, the report stated that few teachers are ready to \nuse the technology in their lessons. This is a national tragedy. During \nthe past ten years, we have seen a transformation in classrooms \nthroughout the country. Computers have replaced blackboards and \nstudents now depend on the Internet for basic knowledge. Yet teachers \nare not equipped to incorporate technological tools into their \ncurricula.\n  The ``IT Teacher Training Grants'' created by this legislation \nsupport professional advancement in the related fields of IT for \nteachers who instruct elementary, secondary, or charter school \nstudents. These grants may be used for teacher salaries, fees for \nattending special conferences, workshops, or training sessions. They \nmay also be used for the development of a compensation system that \nrewards excellence in math and science related areas. In administering \nthese grants, the National Science Foundation shall give priority \nconsideration to schools that score in the 25th percentile or below for \nacademic performance according to their respective state standards, and \nprograms that provide matching funds from the private sector.\n\n  The ``Twenty-First Century Workforce Internship Grants'' will consist \nof awards to students in secondary schools, as well as students from \ninstitutions of higher learning to explore internships in IT. The goal \nof this program is to transition students' math and science skills into \nthe new digital workforce. By providing them with opportunities to \nexplore the private sector, these grants will enable the next \ngeneration of labor to experience the IT professional domain, while \nmaintaining their knowledge and proficiency in basic math, science, and \nengineering skills.\n  The national demand for computer scientists, computer engineers, and \nsystems analysts by 2006 is projected to be more than double our \ncurrent capacity. In addition, the supply of new graduates qualified \nfor these positions is expected to fall significantly short of the \nnumber needed. This deficiency of qualified workers in the United \nStates\n\n[[Page S626]]\n\nis due in part to a lack of students pursuing advanced degrees in \nmathematics, science, and engineering technology. The number of degrees \nin technical science and engineering fields awarded by American \ninstitutions of higher learning has declined dramatically since 1990. \nForeign national students in the United States were awarded 47 percent \nof Doctorate degrees in engineering, 38 percent of Master's degrees, \nand 46 percent of Doctorate degrees in computer science in 1996. The \n``IT State Scholarship Program,'' established in this legislation, \ntargets individual states to provide them with supplementary \nscholarships for students who want to pursue graduate and doctoral \ndegrees in math, science, engineering, or related fields. Two-thirds of \nthese funds shall be awarded to students from low-income families. \nFurthermore, the director of the National Science Foundation shall \naward these grants to states who provide at least one half of the cost \nof grant.\n  Finally, this act will reauthorize the National Institutes of \nStandards and Technology (NIST) to develop a Twenty-First Century \nTeacher Enhancement Program. This initiative was originally written \ninto statute as part of the ``Technology Administration Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 1999.'' However, we have yet to see the \nimplementation of this program. So I will again request through \nlegislation that NIST establish summer program to provide professional \ndevelopment for elementary and secondary math and science teachers. I \ncontinue to believe that offering teachers opportunities to participate \nin ``hands-on'' experiences at NIST laboratories would be invaluable to \ntheir understanding of math and science. Not only would this program \ndevelop and improve their teaching strategies and self-confidence in \ninstructing math and science, but it would also demonstrate their \nimpact on commerce.\n  We cannot continue to marvel at our robust economy without also \nlooking toward the next century and developing a plan to sustain it. \nThe reality is simple: we must prepare our students to enter the \nworkforce and to prosper in the new digital economy. It is not enough \nto put computers in every classroom if our nation's teachers cannot \nimplement them effectively into their daily lesson plans. Educating our \nchildren and the teachers who instruct them is essential to our \neconomic future.\n  Mr. President, I strongly believe that each of the programs within \nAmerica's Math and Science Excellence Act will encourage state and \nlocal educators, as well as private industry, to engage themselves in \nthe fight to increase basic math and science literacy. These grants \ntarget specific long-term deficiencies in the IT workforce shortage and \nwill help create innovative solutions to our current national dilemma. \nI encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this critical piece \nof legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG:\n  S. 2068. A bill to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission \nfrom establishing rules authorizing the operation of new, low power FM \nradio stations; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n            the radio broadcasting presentation act of 2000\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Radio \nBroadcasting Preservation Act of 2000. On January 20, 2000, the FCC \napproved a new non-commercial low-power FM (LPFM) radio service. In \norder for LPFM stations to fit in the FM band, the FCC will have to \nsignificantly weaken the existing interference protections it developed \nand has subscribed to for decades. The public commentary and technical \nanalysis shows that LPFM will cause interference with current FM \nstations, and thus result in a loss of service to listeners. It is \nimperative that the integrity of the spectrum is protected and that all \nindividuals have access to local news, weather and emergency \ninformation free from interference. Both public and commercial radio \nstations are opposed to the FCC's proposal in its current form.\n\n  These new FCC rules are inconsistent with sound spectrum management. \nI believe that this issue requires further study, as well as \nCongressional hearings, to fully examine the impact that LPFM would \nhave on existing FM radio service. Therefore, I am introducing the \nRadio Broadcasting Preservation Act. This legislation would repeal any \nprescribed rules authorizing LPFM and revoke LPFM licenses that may be \nissued prior to the date of enactment of this bill.\n  While the desire to provide a forum for community groups to have a \ngreater voice is laudable, a multitude of alternatives already exist. \nCurrently, groups may obtain commercial or noncommercial radio \nlicenses, use public access cable, publish newsletters, and utilize \nInternet web sites and e-mail. It is important that our efforts to \ncreate more opportunities for those who support LPFM do not lead to the \ndenial of access for others who depend on FM radio for safety, news, \nand entertainment. For instance, inexpensive and older radios, \nparticularly vulnerable to interference and most commonly used by low-\nincome and elderly listeners, will sustain the greatest negative impact \ncaused by LPFM.\n  Furthermore, it is not clear whether the relaxation of first, second, \nor third adjacent channel protection standards will have an adverse \neffect on the transition to digital radio. Unlike television \nbroadcasters, who are being given additional free spectrum to broadcast \nin digital format, radio broadcasters must use the current spectrum \nallocations to transmit both digital and analog signals, making \nadjacent channel safeguards all the more important. At a minimum, \nadding a large number of LPFMs to the already congested FM band will \nmake the transition to digital radio increasingly difficult and \nproblematic.\n  Finally, the new low-power proposal makes formerly unlicensed, pirate \nradio operators eligible for LPFM licenses. This ruling re-enforces \ntheir unlawful behavior and encourages future illegal activity by \nopening the door to new unauthorized broadcasters. The introduction of \nthousands of LPFM stations not only rewards illegal activity, but is \ncertain to undermine the integrity of the radio spectrum, interfering \nwith current FM service and penalizing the listening public. The radio \nprogramming supplied to listeners by existing radio stations provides \ncrucial news, weather, and emergency information, as well as cultural \nentertainment, which must be preserved.\n  I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. The bill \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 2068\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Radio Broadcasting \n     Preservation Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION.\n\n       (a) Rules Prohibited.--Notwithstanding section 303 of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 303), the Federal \n     Communications Commission shall not prescribe rules \n     authorizing the operation of new, low power FM radio \n     stations, or establishing a low power radio service, as \n     proposed in MM Docket No. 99-25.\n       (b) Termination of Previously Prescribed Rules.--Any rules \n     prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission before \n     the date of the enactment of this Act that would be in \n     violation of the prohibition in subsection (a) if prescribed \n     after such date shall cease to be effective on such date. Any \n     low power radio licenses issued pursuant to such rules before \n     such date shall be void.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 2070. A bill to improve safety standards for child restraints in \nmotor vehicles; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                 THE CHILD PASSENGER SAFETY ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation \nthat will help us fight one of the leading killers of America's \nchildren--the automobile collision. Car crashes account for 1 of every \n3 deaths among children.\n  In the United States we lose an average of 7 of our children every \nday to car collisions. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway \nSafety, crash injuries are the leading cause of death for the 5 to 12 \nyear old age group. Regrettably, up to half of the deaths involve \nchildren who already are buckled up or restrained in car seats and \nbooster seats.\n  That is why I am introducing legislation to substantially improve the \nchild safety seats that we buy to protect our children. My bill, ``The \nChild Passenger\n\n[[Page S627]]\n\nSafety Act of 2000,'' would direct the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration to improve the safety features of car seats, to upgrade \nthe way we test and certify car seats, to consider adopting measures to \nbetter protect older children, and to give parents the information they \nneed to shop for, and install, safe car seats for their children.\n  Over the years, NHTSA has implemented many measures to improve child \npassenger safety. I applaud, in particular, the NHTSA Administrator's \nrecent efforts to implement a new tether requirement for child seat \nmakers and automobile manufacturers.\n  But we cannot allow these past successes to obscure a fundamental \nfact: too many of our children are killed or injured in car crashes \nevery day. We should not wait to begin upgrading the safety of child \ncar seats and booster seats.\n  The first thing this bill seeks to do is to improve the testing of \ncar seats and booster seats. It calls for the government to consider \nusing more dummies that simulate children of many different ages in \nthese tests. A six-month old has a very different build than an \neighteen-month-old, and an eighteen-month-old is very different from a \nsix-year old. In Europe, they use as many as six different child \ndummies in testing their car seats and booster seats, ranging in age \nfrom newborn to ten years. In this country, we do not crash test child \nsafety seats with dummies that represent a premature infant, an \neighteen-month-old or a ten-year-old.\n  Currently, we test car seats on a sled. My bill directs NHTSA to put \ncar seats in some of the actual cars that already are being tested \nunder an existing program. Under this program, called the ``New Car \nAssessment Program,'' the government buys 40 or so vehicles and crash \ntests them to see how each would perform in a collision in the real \nworld. Why, Mr. President, could we not put at least one car seat or \nbooster seat in each of these cars? Doing it would help us better \nunderstand how these safety seats perform in the real world.\n  In addition, my bill calls for the government to study ways to update \nthe seat bench that is used in tests of child safety seats to better \nreflect the design of modern vehicles. The seat bench from a 1975 Chevy \nImpala with lap belts is what we now use to test car seats.\n  I am also asking the government to focus attention on how car seats \nand booster seats perform in rollover, rear-impact, and side-impact \ncrashes, as they do in Europe. These types of crashes are not as common \nas frontal collisions, but they result in a number of injuries and \ndeaths. Finally, my proposal calls upon NHTSA to increase the funds \nthey spend on testing car seats each year to at least $750,000, from \nthe current $500,000.\n  Second, we must deal with the problem of head injuries in side-impact \ncrashes and rollovers. Children's heads and necks are even more \nvulnerable than those of adults, because children's heads are larger in \nproportion to the rest of their bodies. In Europe, car seats have side \nimpact padding to better protect children's heads in these types of \ncrashes. My bill would require car seat manufacturers in the U.S. to \nprovide the same type of protection.\n  Third, we must focus more attention on an issue that auto safety \nadvocates have dubbed ``the forgotten child'' problem. The ``forgotten \nchildren'' (ages 8-12) have outgrown their car seats but do not fit \nproperly in adult seat belts. In crashes, they are at greater risk than \nother passengers. My bill calls for NHTSA to close this child safety \nseat gap, but it leaves it up to NHTSA to decide when and how to do \nthat. The agency could, for example, encourage the states to pass more \nlaws requiring the use of booster seats for older children. They could \ndo it by mounting a public information campaign about the importance of \nbooster seats. Or they could amend our safety standards for seat belts.\n  Fourth and finally, we must get more information to parents about the \nsafety of various car seats on the market today, as well, Mr. \nPresident, as on the correct means of installing car seats. My bill \ndirects NHTSA to institute a new crash test results information system \nthat will help equip parents with the safety information and knowledge \nthey need to make rational choices when they are buying and installing \ncar seats for their children. My bill also requires that the warning \nlabels on child seats be straightforward and written in plain English.\n  Next week is National Child Passenger Safety Week. What better time \nthan now to make these efforts to protect our children? I urge my \ncolleagues to support this vitally important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2070\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to benefit electricity consumers by promoting the \nreliability\n\n[[Page S628]]\n\nof the bulk-power system; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                     electric reliability 2000 act\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I introduce the Electric \nReliability 2000 Act, a measure that deals with the somewhat mysterious \nworld of the bulk electricity system. Although most Americans are not \nexperts on the intricacies of interstate electric transmission grids, \nthey need to have confidence that the system will work and their lights \nand heat will be there when they need them.\n  This nation's interstate electric transmission system is an extremely \ncomplex network that connects with Canada and Mexico. It has developed \nover decades with various voluntary agreements that allow areas to work \ntogether depending on changing power needs that vary from day to day \nand hour to hour and sometimes minute to minute. These voluntary \nagreements were developed after a disastrous event in 1965 led to a \nblackout in New York City and throughout other parts of the Northeast.\n  Yet a fundamental change has made this voluntary system unworkable \nfor the future. With the expansion of competition in the wholesale \nelectricity market--starting with the 1992 Energy Policy Act--the \nsystem of buying and selling wholesale power is now many times more \ncomplex than it was just a decade ago. With a stronger economy, \nelectricity usage has increased while thousands of new electricity \nmarketers and buyers have created new stresses on the system.\n  These stresses to the system have affected many parts of the country. \nIn August 1996, a sagging power line in Oregon made contact with a \ntree, and combined with other factors led to a power outage that \naffected over 7 million consumers along the West Coast. Other outages \nhave occurred in different parts of the country since that time.\n  To address this situation, more than a year ago a group of \nelectricity industry officials began meeting to develop legislative \nlanguage needed in this new era in electricity. They developed \nprovisions that have been included as a small part of several bills, \nincluding the larger restructuring bills developed in the House and by \nthe Clinton administration.\n  Events in recent months have lent urgency to this issue. I believe it \nis time to separate the issue of electricity reliability from the \nlarger issue of restructuring. Our continued economic growth is fueled \nby electricity, and we need to assure the public that the power will be \nthere for their homes and their jobs when they count on it.\n  The stresses in the system continue to mount. In the summer of 1999, \nAmericans experienced a wide-range of severe electricity outages. The \nDepartment of Energy created a team of experts to investigate these \noutages, and it submitted its report last month. I quote from the \nreport's summary:\n\n       In anticipation of competitive markets, some utilities have \n     adopted a strategy of cost cutting that involves reduced \n     spending on reliability. In addition, responsibility for \n     reliability management has been disaggregated to multiple \n     institutions, with utilities, independent system operators, \n     independent power producers, customers, and markets all \n     playing a role. The overall effect has been that the \n     infrastructure for reliability assurance has been \n     considerably eroded.\n\n  The report continues:\n\n       Moreover, historical levels of electric reliability may not \n     be adequate for the future. The quality of electric power and \n     the assurance that it will always be available are \n     increasingly important in a society that is ever more \n     dependent on electricity.\n\n  The report includes several findings that suggest a range of policy \nquestions that need to be addressed in order to assure the reliability \nof the Nation's bulk power system.\n  The bill I introduce today includes what has been termed the \n``consensus language'' that was developed over the past year by these \nexperts who work on the reliability side of the electricity industry. \nThis bill is not the complete solution to the reliability issue for \nthis industry. It is a good starting point. It creates a process to \ndevelop enforceable rules for the bulk-power system, while giving \nvarious regions the ability to tailor these rules in ways that make \nsense for their individual systems and their specific geography.\n  In addition to setting up rules and a referee to enforce these rules, \n``reliability'' also involves many other facets of the electricity \nindustry that are not addressed in this bill: full and open access to \ntransmission systems, effective conservation programs that can help \nreduce peak system demands, the ability to site electricity generation \nplants closer to the loads they serve, promoting small-scale \ndistributed generation, such as fuel-cells, throughout the grid, and \nmany other wide-ranging actions. Until we can gain a greater consensus \nof the need to address these issues, this bill provides the opportunity \nto begin these discussions.\n  Despite being described as a consensus bill, there may need to be \nchanges to this legislative language so that it is effective. For \nexample, there are ongoing discussions about the appropriate role for \nState regulators as their responsibilities relate to the interstate \ntransmission system. Therefore I respectfully request Chairman \nMurkowski to conduct hearings on this serious issue of the reliability \nof the bulk power system and also to hold hearings on this bill as the \nstarting point for solving this problem.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 2071\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of Energy to report to \nCongress on the readiness of the heating oil and propane industries; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                     the home heating readiness act\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President today I am introducing the Home Heating \nReadiness Act, which I offer with Senators Lautenberg, Lieberman, and \nJeffords. The goal of this legislation is to prevent sharp and \nsustained increases in the price of home heating fuel, like the kind of \nprice spike we are experiencing right now in Massachusetts and other \nnortheastern states.\n  Mr. President, at the end of December, the price of a gallon of home \nheating oil in Massachusetts average $1.78 across the state, and in \nsome local areas consumers are complaining of prices as high as $2.00 \nper gallon. Only several weeks ago, when the weather was warmer, the \nprice was far lower, about $.98, but as soon as the weather turned \ncold--as soon as families needed more oil to heat their homes--the \nprice spiked. I want to be clear, on average, it appears that this \nwinter will be warmer than most. Our problem is not the weather alone, \nsomething else in the supply chain of heating oil has failed. The Home \nHeating Readiness Act is an effort to learn, before it's too late, the \nsteps we can take to correct deficiencies and prevent price spikes.\n  Already the Energy Information Administration examines the price of \nheating fuel each fall in a report called the Winter Fuels Outlook, and \nthe Administration has done, overall, an excellent job of examining \nsupply, demand and potential weather scenarios and estimating the price \nof heating oil and propane. This legislation would ask the \nAdministration to go farther and examine the functional capability of \nthe industries, to search out potential problems and help us prevent or \nmitigate them. It asks EIA to examine the global and regional crude oil \nand refined product supplies; the adequacy and utilization of refinery \ncapability; the adequacy, utilization, and distribution of regional \nrefined product storage capacity; weather conditions; refined product \ntransportation system; market inefficiencies; and any other factor \naffecting the functional capability of the industry to provide \naffordable home heating oil and propane. In addition to identifying \nproblems, EIA will make recommendations on how those problems can be \ncorrected, and how price spikes can be avoided or at least mitigated.\n  Mr. President, with this legislation we are asking the EIA to do more \nand we should appropriate more funding to get the job done. For now, \nthis legislation does not authorize a specific amount. It is my hope \nthat the Clinton administration will work with us to determine an \nappropriate authorization level that we can add into this bill at an \nappropriate time. To help alleviate our current fuel crises the Clinton \nadministration has released roughly $175 million to help low income \nfamilies. I want to applaud that decision--those resources are urgently \nneeded. However, I want to also point out that if we prevent these \nprice spikes with better evaluation of the industry, we may have to \nspend less of those emergency funds in future winters. Finally, I want \nto work with Energy and Natural Resources Committee to get its input on \nhow this proposal can be improved to meet our goals.\n  The old adage that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure \ncertainly holds true in this case, and I hope that we act to create the \nHome Heating Readiness Report.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2072\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Home Heating Readiness \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in the United States, more than 10,000,000 households \n     burn heating oil and more than 5,000,000 burn propane to \n     generate space heat;\n       (2) sharp and sustained increases in the price of heating \n     oil and propane disproportionately harm poor and elderly \n     people with low and fixed incomes, who may be forced to \n     choose between heat and food, medicine, and other basic \n     necessities;\n       (3) sharp and sustained increases in the price of heating \n     oil and propane can negatively affect the national economy \n     and regional economies, and such increases have occurred in \n     the winters of 1983-84, 1988-89, 1996-97, and 1999-2000;\n       (4) sharp and sustained increases in the price of heating \n     oil and propane can be caused by--\n       (A) deficiencies in global or regional crude oil or refined \n     product supplies;\n       (B) inadequacy or underutilization of refinery capacity;\n       (C) inadequacy, underutilization, or disadvantageous \n     distribution of regional refined product storage capacity;\n       (D) adverse weather conditions;\n       (E) impediments to efficient and timely transportation of \n     refined product;\n       (F) market inefficiencies; and\n       (G) other factors affecting the functional capability of \n     the energy industry;\n       (5) the Energy Information Administration is charged with \n     analyzing the United States energy industry and markets and \n     providing projections on the retail price of energy products, \n     including heating oil and propane;\n       (6) future sharp and sustained increases in the national \n     and regional price of heating oil and propane can be avoided \n     or at least mitigated if--\n       (A) the Energy Information Administration identifies \n     potential failures in the functional capability of the energy \n     industry to provide affordable heating oil and propane to \n     consumers in all regions of the United States; and\n       (B) those potential failures are remedied; and\n       (7) avoiding sharp and sustained increases in the national \n     and regional price of heating oil and propane can reduce \n     Federal, State, and local expenditures to assist low-income\n\n[[Page S633]]\n\n     and other households in need of financial assistance when \n     prices increase.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about an extremely \nserious problem plaguing the citizens of my state of Connecticut and \nthose throughout the Northeast--the skyrocketing cost of home heating \noil and the fear of higher gas prices that will follow.\n  This complaint may sound familiar to some of my colleagues, \nparticularly those similarly-situated in cold-weather states. Senator \nDodd and I and several others have repeatedly voiced concerns about the \nvolatility of the heating oil-gasoline marketplace over the last \nseveral years, about the sudden swings in prices we have experienced as \na result of that volatility, and the threat it poses to the livelihood \nof our constituents and the stability of our regional economy. The \nsituation now, though, is more dire than anything we have seen in \nrecent years. While I do not want to be an alarmist, I think it is \ncritical for my colleagues to understand the severity of the squeeze \nmany families and businesses are feeling and the potential for economic \nhavoc.\n  We are bordering on a real crisis. The average price of a gallon of \nheating oil in the Northeast has jumped more than 100 percent since \nmid-January. Many families are really struggling to pay their bills and \nkeep their families warm. Dealers and distributors are reporting \nsignificant shortages throughout the region, which promises to send \nprices spiraling even higher in the near term. And if this vicious \ncycle of high demand and low supply continues to turn, and if the \nweather stays the way it has, many households may literally be left out \nin the cold, and their well-being put at risk.\n  It is not just consumers, though, who are being hit hard by this \nprice spike. It is also hurting a number of small businesses that are \nnot prepared to absorb this kind of sudden surge in costs. It sure is \nhurting many small companies in the heating oil industry, the \nindependent distributors and retailers, who form the backbone of this \nmarket. I have already heard of one oil dealer in Connecticut who owns \na family business and who needed to take out a second mortgage on his \nhome to make it through this hardship. It may not be long before others \njoin him. There is also the very real risk of some small dealers being \nforced out of business.\n  As a result of all this, a conspicuous current of fear and \nuncertainty is rippling throughout the Northeast. People are anxious \nfor some answers just as they are desperate for some relief. Like many \nof my colleagues, my offices have been inundated with calls from around \nthe state from outraged homeowners demanding to know why their heating \nbills are going through the roof and what we are doing to bring them \ndown.\n  We know that supplies are low and demand is high, and that is the \nbasic source of the problem. But it goes much deeper than that. The \ndecision made by OPEC to limit the production and supply of crude oil \non the international market has been a major factor. Our domestic \nsupply has shrunk considerably. Another factor has been the \ntemperature; the cold weather and strong winds have not only kept \ndemand high, they have frozen rivers and made it difficult at times for \noil barges to dock and unload their product. And some questions have to \nbe raised about the choices made by the major oil companies, while the \nsupply of crude oil may have been sufficient to meet demand, the \nrefiners may have made matters worse by focusing on turning out more \ngasoline than heating oil in anticipation of a warmer winter. These \nquestions deserve more attention, and I intend to press for more \ninformation about how these decisions are being made about utilization \nof capacity, which are critical to determining oil supplies and by \nextension oil prices.\n\n  But the complexity of this problem does not mean we are powerless to \nhelp. Along with Senator Dodd and the rest of our state delegation, we \nhave been doing all we can to provide some immediate relief from these \nspiraling prices and troubling shortages. One of our principal concerns \nis for the low-income families who are being asked to choose between \nputting food on the table and heating their homes. The price spike is \nhitting these families the hardest, and we are doing our best to help \nthem make it through. A bipartisan coalition sent a letter to the \nPresident two weeks ago urging him to quickly release emergency funds \nfrom the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which is a critical \nfirst line of defense for our neighbors who are least able to cope with \nsudden price surges. The President thankfully responded by releasing \n$45 million for the disadvantaged families of New England, including \n$3.1 million for those in Connecticut. This was a significant gesture, \nbut there are many families who won't benefit from it. That is why just \ntwo days ago our coalition sent the President another letter requesting \nthat an additional $200 million in LIHEAP funding be released \nimmediately. I hope the President again hears our concerns and heeds \nour call.\n  I am also concerned about the independent oil suppliers in the \nNortheast. Most home heating oil distributors are small businesses with \nfew employees; these businesses are not always in the position to \nweather severe price fluctuations or shortages as we are seeing now. \nPart of the problem is that small oil dealers often must pay the high \nprice of crude oil from large wholesalers before they are able to \ncollect on oil sales to residential homes. This leaves them with few \nreserves to make due. To help relieve the burden on these businesses, I \nhave asked the Small Business Administration to make available a \npackage of short turnaround loans and technical assistance. The SBA has \nbeen highly sensitive to this problem, and they are moving quickly to \nspread the word around the region about these options.\n\n[[Page S634]]\n\n  Along with several of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I \nhave supported and continue to support a drawdown of the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve as a way to quickly boost stocks in the Northeast and \nthereby quickly reduce prices. Senator Dodd and I and several of our \ncolleagues from neighboring states have lobbied hard for the \nAdministration to take that step. We have cosponsored legislation that \nexplicitly authorizes the Secretary of Energy to tap the SPR in these \ncircumstances. We wrote the President two weeks ago urging him to \napprove a drawdown as soon as possible. And shortly thereafter we met \nwith Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to plead this case directly. The \nSecretary unfortunately has been reluctant to pursue this option, but \nwe have not given up hope of changing his mind, and will continue to \npush our argument.\n  While we believe the SPR drawdown is critical to getting us through \nthis short-term emergency, it is not a long-term solution. It will not \nand cannot defuse the volatility of the heating oil marketplace. But \nthere are a number of steps we can take to prevent these disruptive \nprice spikes from cycling in and out. First, it is important that we \nconvince leaders of the oil-producing nations that colluding to hold \ndown supply is not in their long-term interest. As we have seen, prices \nof oil have indeed gone up, but there is growing resentment of the \npolicies of OPEC as our citizens feel a strengthening pinch. It is \nimportant that these countries understand that if they continue with \nthis strategy, they may jeopardize good relations with the United \nStates. Secretary Richardson will soon be meeting with OPEC's leaders, \nand we are pressing him to forcefully communicate this message to our \nallies and trading partners.\n\n  Second, we should take a hard look at the use of interruptible gas \ncontracts by natural gas suppliers and the evidence that these \ncontracts may be exacerbating the volatility of the heating oil market. \nThese ``interruptible\" contracts can be obtained at a discount rate in \nexchange for giving the contractor the ability to suspend service when \ngas supply is low or demand is high. When these contracts are \ninterrupted, many customers typically turn to heating oil as their \npreferred alternative, creating a sudden, secondary demand jolt to the \noil market. I have heard from a number of leaders in the heating oil \nindustry who fear that this is exactly what is happening now. We need \nto better understand the level of additional heating oil demand caused \nby these types of contracts and be able to anticipate demand \nfluctuations as accurately as possible so that we may avoid future \nsituations where demand exceeds supply. For that reason, I recently \nasked Secretary Richardson to investigate the extent and impact of \ninterruptible contracts, and to report back to us on his findings to \ndetermine what if anything we should do about this practice.\n  Our current situation points to the fundamental problem that we are \nfar too dependent upon foreign oil for our energy needs. We need to \nemploy long-term strategies to decrease our reliance upon foreign \nnations and bolster our own energy capacity. Many of us have \ncosponsored legislation in the past to increase research and \ndevelopment funding for renewable energy sources. We need to invest \ntime, money, and an increased level of effort in the development of \nenergy efficient power sources such as wind, solar, and natural gas. I \nwill continue to work toward this goal and I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to do so as well.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I rise to speak about a very serious \nproblem plaguing the citizens of Connecticut and the Northeast; that \nis, the skyrocketing cost of home heating oil and the fear of higher \ngas prices that will come with the warmer weather. There is a very \ncomplicated situation as to why it exists.\n  It begins with the decision by the OPEC cartel to reduce the supply \nof oil. It goes to the decision of some oil companies not to refine \nadequate supplies of home heating oil. Whatever the complexity, it does \nnot mean that we are powerless to help.\n  Senator Dodd and I, and the rest of our delegation, on earlier \noccasions, with colleagues from throughout the Northeast from both \nparties, have appealed to the President to release Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program funding. He did that--$45 million worth.\n  We have another request in now for an additional $200 million. It is \nthat bad in our State.\n  The real answer to this is to open up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nand effect the laws of supply and demand, 560 million barrels of oil \nthat we, the taxpayers, U.S. Government own. This is the time to use \nit.\n  Up until now, Secretary Richardson and the administration have \nrefused to do so. I appeal to them today on behalf of the people of \nConnecticut who are suffering under the shock of doubling and in some \ncases tripling of what they pay for home heating oil. Please open up \nthe reserve. There is now a new idea of swaps, not selling the oil but \nallowing the oil companies to take it out of reserve, bring it into the \nmarket, increase supply, lower price, and then put oil back into the \nreserve, even a higher amount.\n  The short of it is, we are in crisis in the Northeast. It is a crisis \nthat, if it is not stopped and is allowed to go on, with higher \ngasoline prices that will affect the rest of the country in spring \ntime, it will begin to create the kind of inflation that will cut the \neconomic growth we have enjoyed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url":

Con. Res. 81\n\n       Whereas Rabiya Kadeer, a prominent ethnic Uighur from the \n     Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) of the People's \n     Republic of China, her secretary, and her son were arrested \n     on August 11, 1999, in the city of Urumqi;\n       Whereas Rabiya Kadeer's arrest occurred outside the Yindu \n     Hotel in Urumqi as she was attempting to meet a group of \n     congressional staff staying at the Yindu Hotel as part an \n     official visit to China organized under the auspices of the \n     Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Program of the \n     United States Information Agency;\n       Whereas Rabiya Kadeer's husband Sidik Rouzi, who has lived \n     in the United States since 1996 and works for Radio Free \n     Asia, has been critical of the policies of the People's \n     Republic of China toward Uighurs in Xinjiang;\n       Whereas according to an Amnesty International press release \n     of August 16, 1999, ``It appears as though the accusations \n     against Kadeer and her son Ablikim Abdyirim may relate to her \n     attempts to meet a visiting delegation from the United States \n     [Congress] and her communications with her husband Sidik \n     Rouzi, . . .'';\n       Whereas reports indicate that Ablikim Abdyirim was sent to \n     a labor camp on November 26 for 2 years without trial for \n     ``supporting Uighur separatism,'' and Rabiya Kadeer's \n     secretary was recently sentenced to 3 years in a labor camp;\n       Whereas Rabiya Kadeer has 5 children, 3 sisters, and a \n     brother living in the United States, in addition to her \n     husband, and Kadeer has expressed a desire to move to the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China stripped Rabiya \n     Kadeer of her passport long before her arrest;\n       Whereas reports indicate that Kadeer's health may be at \n     risk and that she may be sentenced to 10 or more years in \n     prison;\n       Whereas repeated requests to the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China by Members of Congress and congressional \n     staff for an explanation of the nature of the charges against \n     Rabiya Kadeer, her secretary, and her son, for an update on \n     the state of Kadeer's health, and for details of any legal \n     proceedings against those arrested, have gone unanswered \n     since August 1999;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China signed the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on \n     October 5, 1998;\n       Whereas that Covenant requires signatory countries to \n     guarantee their citizens the right to legal recourse when \n     their rights have been violated, the right to liberty and \n     freedom of movement, the right to presumption of innocence \n     until guilt is proven, the right to appeal a conviction, \n     freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, freedom of \n     opinion and expression, and freedom of assembly and \n     association;\n       Whereas that Covenant forbids torture, inhuman or degrading \n     treatment, and arbitrary arrest and detention;\n       Whereas the first Optional Protocol to the International \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights enables the Human \n     Rights Committee, set up under that Covenant, to receive and \n     consider communications from individuals claiming to be \n     victims of violations of any of the rights set forth in the \n     Covenant; and\n       Whereas in signing that Covenant on behalf of the People's \n     Republic of China, Ambassador Qin Huasun, Permanent \n     Representative of the People's Republic of China to the \n     United Nations, said the following: ``To realize human rights \n     is the aspiration of all humanity. It is also a goal that the \n     Chinese Government has long been striving for. We believe \n     that the universality of human rights should be respected . . \n     . As a member state of the United Nations, China has always \n     actively participated in the activities of the organization \n     in the field of human rights. It attaches importance to its \n     cooperation with agencies concerned in the U.N. system . . \n     .'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress calls on the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China--\n       (1) immediately to release Rabiya Kadeer, her secretary, \n     and her son; and\n       (2) to permit Kadeer, her secretary, and her son to move to \n     the United States, if they so desire.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenators Murray, Bingaman, Edwards, Crapo, Dodd, Thomas, and Feinstein \nto submit a concurrent resolution stating the sense of Congress that \nChina immediately release Rabiya Kadeer, her secretary and her son. On \nAugust 11, 1999 Ms. Kadeer was arrested on her way to a meeting with a \ngroup of Congressional staff visiting China under the auspices of a \nU.S. Information Agency program. Later, two of the sons and her \nsecretary were detained as well.\n  One son has since been sentenced to 2 years at hard labor and her \nsecretary, 3 years. And we have received credible reports that in the \naftermath of the\n\n[[Page S637]]\n\nChinese New Year's celebrations, she herself faces imminent trial and \nsentencing.\n  The crimes she is accused of committing remain unclear, despite \nletters from a number of us on Capitol Hill, and despite a series of \nrequests to Chinese officials stretching back to August. Our attempts \nat quiet diplomacy, perhaps unsurprisingly, have failed. And so, with \nher trial and sentencing about to take place, it is vital that we try a \ndifferent tack. That is why I am offering this resolution.\n  Ms. Kadeer is a prominent member of an ethnic minority group in China \ncalled Uighurs. These people are Turkic-speaking Moslems, and they form \nthe largest ethnic group in China's northwestern-most province.\n  A few years back, Ms. Kadeer was lauded by the PRC for her promotion \nof business enterprises among women and for contributing to the \neconomic and social development of her province. To honor her efforts, \nshe was named by authorities to the China People's Political \nConsultative Congress and as a delegate to the United Nations World \nConference on Women held in Beijing.\n  But Ms. Kadeer began to fall out of favor with officials in Beijing \nafter her husband emigrated to the United States in 1997 and became a \ncommentator for Voice of America. Soon thereafter, her passport was \nseized and the assets of an organization she founded to improve \nopportunities for Moslem businesswomen were frozen. Then, in 1998, Ms. \nKadeer lost her position in the Consultative Congress.\n  Perhaps that is why five of Ms. Kadeer's children, three sisters and \na brother are now living in the United States, in addition to her \nhusband. And perhaps that is why Ms. Kadeer has expressed a desire to \nmove to the United States herself.\n  That desire, for the moment, has been quashed. Last summer, as she \nwas on her way to the hotel where the Congressional staff delegation \nwas waiting to meet her, Kadeer was arrested. The arrest is troubling \nenough, but the fact that it took place as she was attempting to have a \nsimple conversation with staffers who work for the United States \nCongress, I believe, requires that we take a firm stand.\n  Let's not forget that the PRC signed the International Covenant on \nCivil and Political Rights in 1998. Among other things, that Covenant \nrequires signatories to guarantee their citizens the right to liberty \nand freedom of movement; the right to presumption of innocence until \nguilt is proven; freedom of thought, conscience, and religion; freedom \nof opinion and expression; and freedom of assembly and association. It \nalso forbids torture, inhumane or degrading treatment, and arbitrary \narrest and detention.\n  In signing that Covenant on behalf of the PRC, China's Permanent \nRepresentative to the United Nations said, and I quote, ``To realize \nhuman rights is the aspiration of all humanity. It is also a goal that \nthe Chinese Government has long been striving for. We believe that the \nuniversality of human rights should be respected * * *.''\n  Well, I don't think China has respected the human rights of Rabiya \nKadeer, her son or her secretary. That's why this resolution calls on \nChina to release them and give them the chance to move to the United \nStates, if they wish. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis resolution and move for its earliest possible passage as Ms. \nKadeer's fate will soon be determined by a country that offers her \nlittle or no chance of a fair trial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S637-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 256--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF FEBRUARY 14-18, 2000, AS \n               ``NATIONAL HEART FAILURE AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \nBayh, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Biden, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. L.

Res. 257\n\n       Whereas the 1977 Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality \n     and Operation of the Panama Canal provides that Panama and \n     the United States have the joint responsibility to ensure \n     that the Panama Canal will remain open and secure, and \n     provides that each signatory, in accordance with its \n     constitutional processes, shall defend the Canal against any \n     threat to its neutrality and shall have the right to act \n     against threats against the peaceful transit of vessels \n     through the Canal;\n       Whereas the United States Armed Forces have depended upon \n     the Panama Canal for rapid transit in times of global \n     conflict, including during World War II, the Korean War, the \n     Vietnam War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Persian Gulf \n     War;\n       Whereas the common interests of Panama and the United \n     States have produced close relations between the two nations \n     and a shared interest in protecting the Canal and its \n     operations;\n       Whereas the passage of Panama Law Number 5 and the port \n     facilities lease agreements have created concern about the \n     future security of the Canal and its continued unfettered \n     operations;\n       Whereas Panama does not have an army, navy, or air force, \n     and the national police capabilities are inadequate to defend \n     the Canal against terrorism from internal or external \n     sources;\n       Whereas occupation, damage, or destruction of this crucial \n     naval choke point would be catastrophic to the United States, \n     its allies, and the world;\n       Whereas the Canal has influenced world trade patterns, \n     spurred growth in developed countries, and has been a primary \n     impetus for economic expansion in developing countries;\n       Whereas the Panama Canal remains a vital economic and \n     strategic asset to the United States, its allies, and the \n     world; and\n       Whereas 53 percent of Canal traffic originates or ends at \n     United States port facilities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) any attack on or against the Panama Canal by any \n     country will be considered an act of war against the United \n     States;\n       (2) the President should, prior to June 1, 2001, negotiate \n     security arrangements with\n\n[[Page S638]]\n\n     the Government of Panama that will protect the Canal and \n     ensure that the Canal remains open, secure, and neutral, \n     consistent with the Panama Canal Treaty, the Treaty \n     Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the \n     Panama Canal, and the resolutions of ratification thereto; \n     and\n       (3) the President should consult with the leadership of \n     both Houses of Congress and with the chairmen and ranking \n     members of the appropriate congressional committees regarding \n     the implementation of this resolution.\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I rise to propose a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Congress regarding the responsibility of \nthe United States in guaranteeing the security and passage of vessels \nthrough the Panama Canal.\n  The Panama Canal Treaty and the Treaty concerning the Permanent \nNeutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal were a battle fought and \nlost before my time in the Congress of the United States. However, we \nstill have an obligation to the world, our allies, and the people of \nthe United States to ensure that the Panama Canal will remain open, \nsecure, and neutral in providing safe passage to vessels of all \nnations.\n  These treaties with Panama gave the United States the option of \ncontinuing our presence in Panama beyond 2000. This option must be \nexercised! The United States needs to retain a presence in Panama to \nensure a measure of power projection capability in an area of vital \nnational interest to our economy, our freedoms, and our way of life.\n  Mr. President, this extension of our presence in Panama is also \nconsistent with the intent of Congress. The 1979 Panama Canal Act, \nwhich incorporated the treaty into United States law, included a sense \nof the Congress resolution that the ``best interests of the United \nStates require that the President enter into negotiations with the \nRepublic of Panama for the purpose of arranging for the stationing of \nUnited States military forces after the termination of the Panama Canal \nTreaty of 1977.''\n  Panama agreed to these terms in 1979. Since this time, both sides \nhave been working on an agreement to define our future presence, but \nprogress on this effort stalled in early 1998.\n  The current administration's policy in the region is a legacy of \nmissed opportunities, including their failure to negotiate a continued \nUnited States presence in Panama. There exists a dire need for a \nstabilizing presence which the United States has brought to the region \nsince World War II. Although the traditional threat of a foreign naval \nattack on the Canal has virtually disappeared, the United States still \nneeds to be able to project military power in the region. The \nunprecedented upsurge in political instability and state-sponsored \nterrorism that the United States now faces makes it necessary to \nprovide rapid troop and logistical transit through the Canal. The need \nto conduct surveillance or to pursue actual and potential adversaries \nalso requires immediate access to the Canal. Such possibilities make it \nessential that the United States retain a measure of conventional \nmilitary presence in the region.\n  There are many other reasons for the United States to retain a \npresence in Panama: First, the United States conducts a number of \nhumanitarian and civil-military programs throughout the region. These \nmissions have been greatly benefitted in the past with lower \ntransportation costs and greater efficiency afforded by centralized \nlogistics within the region. Second, as we all know, Panama is located \nin the center of a major drug transit corridor. Anti-drug operations \nwill continue to be a critical feature of United States policy in the \nregion. Third, with the issue of military readiness, the Jungle \nOperations Training Center at Fort Sherman provided unequaled \nfacilities for training in low-intensity warfare. Former Assistant \nSecretary of Defense Frederick C. Smith stated that this and other \nsites ``will be difficult to replicate elsewhere.''

Res. 258\n\n       Whereas today's youth are vital to the preservation of our \n     country and will be the future bearers of the bright torch of \n     democracy;\n       Whereas youth need a safe haven from various negative \n     influences such as child abuse, substance abuse and crime, \n     and they need to have resources readily available to assist \n     them when faced with circumstances that compromise their \n     safety;\n       Whereas the United States needs increased numbers of \n     community volunteers acting as positive influences on the \n     Nation's youth;\n       Whereas the Safe Place program is committed to protecting \n     our Nation's most valuable asset, our youth, by offering \n     short term ``safe places'' at neighborhood locations where \n     trained volunteers are available to counsel and advise youth \n     seeking assistance and guidance;\n       Whereas Safe Place combines the efforts of the private \n     sector and non-profit organizations uniting to reach youth in \n     the early stages of crisis;\n       Whereas Safe Place provides a direct means to assist \n     programs in meeting performance standards relative to \n     outreach/community relations, as set forth in the Federal \n     Runaway and Homeless Youth Act guidelines;\n       Whereas the Safe Place placard displayed at businesses \n     within communities stands as a beacon of safety and refuge to \n     at-risk youth;\n       Whereas over 300 communities in 33 states and more than \n     6,800 business locations have established Safe Place \n     programs;\n       Whereas over 35,000 young people have gone to Safe Place \n     locations to get help when faced with crisis situations;\n       Whereas through the efforts of Safe Place coordinators \n     across the country each year more than one-half million \n     students learn that Safe Place is a resource if abusive or \n     neglectful situations exist;\n       Whereas increased awareness of the program's existence will \n     encourage communities to establish Safe Places for the \n     Nation's youth throughout the country: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) proclaims the week of March 12 through March 18, 2000 \n     as ``National Safe Place Week'' and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States and interested \n     groups to promote awareness of and volunteer involvement in \n     the Safe Place programs, and to observe the week with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to invite my colleagues to \njoin me in sponsoring a resolution designating the week beginning March \n12, 2000 as ``National Safe Place Week.'' This resolution supports the \nsuccessful Project Safe Place program and encourages its growth. This \nresolution promotes a program that improves the quality of life for \nyoung people across the nation without depleting social service funds \nor instituting new government programs whose success is unsure. Project \nSafe Place makes use of programs already in place, seeks to bring \nfamilies together by helping them resolve their conflicts. and does not \nreach into the taxpayer's pocket.\n  The National Network for Youth estimates that more than two million \nyoung people run away from home each year. Increasing numbers of teens \nand even children are also being turned away from their homes by \ndisinterested or frustrated parents. On the street, these youth are \nlikely to resort to using drugs, prostitution and other criminal \nbehavior or survive. They are more vulnerable to physical or sexual \nviolence, and they are more likely to commit suicide. Without help, \ntheir future is bleak and frightening.\n  Project Safe Place is designated to assist young people and families \nwho face difficult situations. The problems vary from one individual to \nthe other. Some young people ask Safe Place for assistance because they \nfrequently find themselves in hour-long screaming matches with their \nparents. Others go because they are beaten and mentally\n\n[[Page S639]]\n\nabused at home. Sometimes they have a parent who is addicted to drugs \nor alcohol. All the young people who find Safe Places have in common an \noverwhelming need to improve their home life.\n  The program works by creating a network of businesses and public \nlocations that display the bright yellow, diamond-shaped Safe Place \nlogo in their windows or on other highly visible places on the front of \ntheir buildings. Businesses and locations such as convenience stores, \nfire stations, libraries, and fast food restaurants are effective Safe \nPlaces because they are found throughout the community and they tend to \nbe easily accessible. Also, young people are more likely to ask for \nhelp in familiar, non-threatening places. In most cases, it is easier \nfor a young person to find a convenience store and walk into it than it \nis for him or her to track down a social services agency, travel to it \nand then brave the intimidation of walking through its doors.\n  The employees at Safe Places are trained to act as a link to help. At \nthe Safe Place they make sure youth who ask for help are taken into the \nback of the store or restaurant, away from people who may know them and \nquestion them later. The employee immediately notifies a shelter. The \nshelter sends a volunteer counselor to talk to the youth, offer advice \nand evaluate the problem. The volunteer, who is the same gender as the \nyoung person, will transport the youth to the shelter if more \ncounseling is necessary or if the young person would like a safe place \nto stay. If the youth decides to stay at the shelter, parents will be \nnotified that the young person is all right.\n  Project Safe Place is a national program that operates locally. It is \na unique collaborative effort between youth service agencies, a network \nof volunteers and local businesses to make help available to youth \nquickly and in their own neighborhood. Safe Place aims to return young \npeople to a healthy emotional environment. That could mean seeing that \nthe family receives counseling or that could mean finding a place \noutside the house for the youth to live.\n  In addition to enhancing outreach programs to area youth, the \ndistinct Safe Place signs increase awareness of the plight of troubled \nyouths. They remind adults of problems in the community and often \ninspire people to volunteer. They demonstrate to businesses that the \nprivate sector can play a positive role and usually lead to more Safe \nPlace sites.\n  Since its beginning in Louisville, Kentucky in 1983, acknowledgment \nof Project Safe Place has been crucial to letting young people know \nthat the service is available to them and inspiring others to create \nmore Safe Places. In March 1998, many Senators helped pass Senate \nResolution 96, making the third week to March 1998 ``National Safe \nPlace Week.'' Since then, sites grew from 6,000 to 8,000. Today, more \nthan 30,000 young people and their families have been helped. Even if \nyour state is not one of the 34 that has at least one Safe Place, the \nprogram has probably still affected your state. It is likely that a \nrunaway from your state has been returned to his or her family through \nthis program. Counseling initiated by the program may have involved a \nparent who lives in your state.\n  My goal is to have at least one Safe Place in every state by the end \nof the decade. I urge all my colleagues to champion this plan and to \nbegin by cosponsoring this resolution making the second week of March \n``National Safe Place Week.'' The designation of time is a crucial step \nin promoting awareness of this effective program. Your support will \nhelp continue the valuable partnership between government and the \nprivate sector as we move toward a society with happier and safe young \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S639-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to rise \ntoday to join with nearly 1 million Lithuanian-Americans in \ncommemorating the 81st anniversary of an independent Lithuania. On \nFebruary 16, it is customary for those of Lithuanian heritage, and \ntheir friends and supporters to celebrate the proclamation of a \nprogressive and independent Republic of Lithuania, which was \nreestablished after more than seven centuries of struggle. Lithuania's \ndemocratic hopes were realized once before this century, yet freedom \nwas abruptly revoked in 1940, after 22 years of democratic governance. \nWhile February 16th reminds us of Lithuania's long and difficult \nperiod, it also affords us the opportunity to commend the determination \nand courage of the citizens of Lithuania and other Baltic nations. \nTheir strong commitment to democratic values serves as an incentive for \nus all to rededicate ourselves to the principles for which this \nimportant day stands, liberty and freedom.\n  The history of this nation has been marked by constant struggle \nagainst aggressors. Through countless invasions, Lithuanian defenders \nhave stood resolutely against their foes and have demonstrated their \ncommitment to independence. After well over a century of domination, \nthe people of Lithuania proclaimed their independence and reestablished \ntheir sovereignty as a nation on February 16, 1918. For more than two \ndecades, this young nation prospered economically and lived at peace \nwith its neighbors. The events of World War II brought this period to \nan end when, in 1940, Lithuania was occupied by Soviet Armed forces. \nOur thoughts must turn to those Lithuanians who suffered under the \nbrutality of the Nazi and Soviet occupations. Many risked and lost \ntheir lives for the rights and freedoms that Lithuanians today are \nprivileged to enjoy. Their steadfast determination and courage \neventually prevailed, providing hope for all peoples who dreamt someday \nof being free.\n  In 1990, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lithuania \nrejoined the international community of democratic nations and embraced \npolitical and economic reforms. Lithuania experienced a peaceful \ntransfer of civilian rule, despite a difficult period of transition, \nand has committed to pursuing economic reforms which offer the \npossibility of greater prosperity, a bright future and sustainable \ngrowth for years to come. To this end, Lithuania has chosen to engage \nwith its neighbors and other democracies by joining The Baltic Economic \nCooperation Agreement and the Council of Europe and through their \ndesire to join the European Union.\n  The Lithuanian people have drawn their strength from a sense of \nnationhood. This has been most evident here in the United States, where \nwe have witnessed the dedication of Lithuanian Americans to the freedom \nof their native land. Their perseverance has encouraged many of us to \nstand in this body over the last several decades and proclaim our \nsupport for a Lithuanian republic.\n  We in Maryland, and our Nation, are particularly fortunate to have \nsuch an active Lithuanian-American community. Longstanding traditions \nof self-help, volunteerism and the dedication to democratic ideals that \nhave prevailed in the community have truly enriched the history of our \ncountry. In areas ranging from business, to academia, to the arts, \nLithuanian-Americans consistently make significant contributions across \nthe Nation.\n  Every year Lithuanians gather in their capital, Vilnius, to \ncommemorate this anniversary. I am proud that we in the United States \nhave continued to stand with them on this occasion, both in years when \nthere was much to celebrate and in years when there were only dreams of \na better future. I am confident that we will continue to celebrate this \nanniversary in the future with the same optimism that we do this \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S640-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S640-S641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ACKNOWLEDGING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE 150TH FIGHTER WING\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President I rise today to salute the 150th \nSecurity Forces Squadron and the 150th Civil Engineering Squadron of \nthe New Mexico Air National Guard.\n  Federally recognized on July 7, 1947 as the 188th Fighter Bomber \nSquadron, the ``Tacos'' have contributed significantly to U.S. military \noperations in Korea, Vietnam, Bosnia, Iraq, and are scheduled to deploy \nto Turkey next January as part of Operation Northern Watch. During \ntheir 52-year history, the Tacos were the first Air National Guard unit \nto be converted to the F-100 aircraft in 1958 and the A-7D aircraft in \n1973. Since 1970, when the 150th Fighter Wing evolved into a joint \nsupport force, the Tacos have been utilized by every branch of our \nArmed Forces except for the Coast Guard.\n  The Tacos are characteristic of the many exceptional units that \ncomprise our Nation's Reserve and National Guard, and I have no doubt \nthat they will continue to ensure the success of our military missions \nboth domestically and abroad. I would ask that my colleagues join me in \nthanking them for their dedicated service.\n  I recently received a letter from General A.C. Zinni, the U.S. Marine \nCorps Commander in Chief commending the Tacos for their distinguished \nservice and the substantial role they played in the success of \nOperation Southern Watch. I ask that General A.C. Zinni's letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                             U.S. Central Command,\n\n\n                             Office of the Commander in Chief,\n\n                     MacDill Air Force Base, FL, January 20, 2000.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: I would like to take this \n     opportunity to highlight the deployment this past year by \n     members of the 150th Security Forces Squadron and the 150th \n     Civil Engineering Squadron, New Mexico Air National Guard, to \n     the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. These units \n     are but two of many outstanding Reserve\n\n[[Page S641]]\n\n     and National Guard units to deploy to Central Command's area \n     of responsibility and contribute to the success of Operation \n     SOUTHERN WATCH.\n       The capability and enthusiasm demonstrated by the members \n     of the 150th Security Forces Squadron and the 150th Civil \n     Engineering Squadron reflected great credit on themselves and \n     the professionalism of Reserve and National Guard units \n     throughout the nation. The participation of units like these \n     significantly contributes to our overall effort in support of \n     Operation SOUTHERN WATCH and allows the services to ensure a \n     more responsible and efficient utilization of the total \n     force.\n       Please convey my sincere appreciation and thanks to the \n     airmen of these great organizations and their employers for \n     their outstanding support and patriotism to the nation in \n     this vital part of the world.\n           Respectfully,\n     A. C. Zinni,\n       General, U.S. Marine Corps, Commander in Chief.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S641-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO DR.

With joy and pride we dedicate this \n     towering monument to the lasting spirit it represents--to \n     bring shalom's gift to the world through the non-violent \n     means of hope, healing and harmony. On the threshold of a new \n     decade, century and millennium, it is an essential guiding \n     beacon of light and enlightenment, soothing pain and \n     discovering promise.\n       Standing on the giant shoulders of our martyr for peace, we \n     gratefully acknowledge the Biblical fountain of living truth \n     spoken by Israel's prophets that nourished, sustained and \n     inspired the prophetic conscience of Dr. King, a Nobel Prize \n     laureate, teaching that human dignity is one and indivisible. \n     No one is to pass by this sacred site untouched by it, for it \n     is symbol of our collective mandate to transform the world--\n     transcending limitations and breaking barriers that still \n     divide us, keeping all children of Moses' God of Freedom from \n     rightfully fulfilling their potential to be a blessing.\n       We are deeply moved by the extensive labor of love and \n     faith finally giving birth to this grand accomplishment, now \n     and forever gracing our beloved City of Norfolk and the \n     Hampton Roads community. May the entire nation hearken anew \n     to the compelling message of the Book of Deuteronomy, \n     ``Tzedek tzedek tirdof lemann tichye'' (Justice, justice \n     shall you pursue that you may live).\n       Dr. King, we pledge to you and one another to continue your \n     most noble historical mission, rising to meet your high \n     stature. We can do no less. We shall never give up marching \n     to the Promised Land you so abundantly and sacrificially \n     dreamed of, leaving behind slavery in all its manifestations. \n     Together we shall yet overcome, O God Almighty, we shall yet \n     overcome.

Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks \nconcerning National Potato Lovers Month.\n  It is whispered that February is the month for lovers. Well, Idahoans \nknow that better than most Americans. You see, February is National \nPotato Lovers Month. That means that the ``eyes'' of the nation are \nupon the great state of Idaho.\n  Our spuds come in all shapes, sizes, and varieties, but they all have \nhomegrown a-peel: Hot taters, big taters, little taters--even tater \ntots. Spuds all over the state of Idaho chip-in to put our best side up \nduring National Potato Lovers Month.\n  Potatoes are truly an ``all-American'' food. In fact, instead of \napple pie, it would be more accurate to say something is as \n``American'' as the potato. Potatoes were first pulled from the ground \nin the New World, whereas apple pie originated in Europe. As early as \n200 B.C., Inca Indians used potatoes to prevent indigestion and \nrheumatism, and used their growing cycles to measure time. During the \n19th century, the American food was planted in Ireland, where its \npopularity surged. In fact, the Irish soon learned they couldn't live \nwithout potatoes. When Irish potato crops failed for three years, eight \nmillion people died.\n  Later in the 19th century, Irish immigrants popularized potatoes in \nAmerica. They eventually discovered the promised land for potatoes--\nIdaho. Our state has the cool and moist climate that grows perfect \nspuds.\n  The only hiccup in America's steady consumption of potatoes came in \nthe 1950's. First, instant convenience foods hit the market, and then a \nfad diet mistakenly identified potatoes as fattening. But when the \ntuber's true traits were told, potatoes joined the ranks of other \nprocessed foods.\n  Spuds have a long and cultivated history that includes the political \nstage. Politics and the potato met long ago, when Thomas Jefferson \nserved spuds at White House dinners to special guests. And politics and \nthe potato met again when Dan Quayle accidentally gave the country--and \nhimself--a spelling lesson, making Dan Quayle a true ``hot potato.''\n  The potato continues its appetizing presence in the political arena. \nWe here in the Senate might disagree, but we usually stop short of \ncalling each other half-baked. And, because we know there is more than \none way to skin a potato, we generally manage to unearth solutions.\n  To celebrate National Potato Lovers Month, I'll be sending each of my \ncolleagues a sampling of the world's best spuds--Idaho \npotatoes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S641-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S641-S642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXTRAORDINARY FAMILY OF VERMONTERS\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there was an article in one of our \nVermont papers in the last few days about an extraordinary family of \nVermonters. Marcelle and I have known Dick and Linda Butsch for many, \nmany years and we have been especially pleased to watch their five \nchildren as they have grown. We have also watched Jen and Chris, and \nthe triplets, Sarah, Patrick, and Gillian.\n  Sarah, Patrick, and Gillian were recently profiled because of their \nhockey activities. I will, at the end of my comments submit to the \nCongressional Record the entire story.\n  Dick and Linda are the best of Vermonters. Not only have they given a \ngreat deal of themselves to the community and to their families, but I \nhave always remembered with fondness the many kindnesses they showed to \nmy mother and father, while they were alive.\n  We are a small State, but it is people like the Butschs that make us \na great State, and I congratulate all of them and continue to look with \nadmiration as their children grow and develop.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the article entitled ``Family Values'' by \nMike Donoghue be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, Feb. 4, 2000]\n\n                             Family Values\n\n\n  hockey has been a constant for the butsch clan, including triplets \n                       sarah, patrick and gillian\n\n                           (By Mike Donoghue)\n\n       In Central Vermont hockey, it's not unusual to see the name \n     Butsch for scoring a goal.\n       From time to time you might have read a scoring summary \n     indicating ``Butsch goal with Butsch assist.''\n       On a few rare occasions it might have said, ``Butsch goal \n     with Butsch and Butsch assists.''\n       For years the Butsch family has been synonymous with \n     Central Vermont hockey, especially at U-32 High School in \n     East Montpelier. Now the family is getting more and more \n     attention in all four corners of the state--for both boys and \n     girls teams--and even spreading into colleges in the \n     Northeast.\n       The latest bunch of Butsch stars are triplets--Sarah, \n     Patrick and Gillian--the children of Dr. David ``Dick'' and \n     Linda Butsch. The three were born almost as fast as a wing \n     taking three slap shots.\n       ``They came less then a minute apart,'' said Linda Butsch \n     with a laugh as she recalled the birthday in late February \n     1984.\n       The triplets have followed each other to the ice rink \n     almost as fast as their births. They were skating by 4 and \n     playing hockey by 6. They worked their way up through Mites, \n     Squirts, Pee-wee, and Bantams.\n       They also are following in the ice skates of two older \n     siblings, Chris, a sophomore at Skidmore, where he is \n     president of the college's club hockey team; and Jen, a \n     freshman for the Providence College women's hockey team.\n\n[[Page S642]]\n\n       All five made their way through the Central Vermont Skating \n     Association before joining the U-32 varsity.\n       ``They play hockey for all the right reasons,'' said Bill \n     Driscoll, head of the North American Hockey Academy in Stowe.\n       ``They show up. They love every minute of every game and \n     practice. They have a super attitude.''\n\n\n                           playing their game\n\n       Sarah and Patrick are stars with the U-32 boys hockey team, \n     while Gillian, the youngest of the triplets, is the top \n     scorer on the newly formed U-32 girls varsity hockey team.\n       Patrick led U-32 in scoring last year as a freshman with 24 \n     goals and has tallied 23 this year.\n       Patrick admits that he winces a little when his sister, \n     Sarah, who plays the wing, has to take a cheap shot from one \n     of the boys on the opposing team. Otherwise, she holds her \n     own.\n       ``If it's a clean check, I know she can take it,'' said \n     Patrick, who hopes to play hockey in college.\n       Patrick and Sarah normally play on different lines, but \n     from time to time they are on the ice together.\n       ``We don't play together that often. We've played more \n     together in the past,'' Sarah said,\n       Patrick looks forward to those moments when he is skating \n     alongside Sarah.\n       ``It's fun when you are out there and know exactly where \n     she is going to be,'' he said.\n       When U-32 voters approved funds for a girls varsity team \n     this winter, Sarah had the chance to switch from the boys \n     varsity. She declined. If she does switch, she will be locked \n     into that decision.\n       ``I wanted to stay with the boys just because of the level \n     of play. I thought it would be more advantageous,'' said \n     Sarah, who would like to play college hockey like her older \n     sister.\n       Her coach, Jim Segar, agreed.\n       ``It would hurt Sarah to go play with the girls because of \n     her abilities,'' Segar said.\n       Her sister, Gillian Butsch, played in the CVSA's Bantam \n     Division through last year, but jumped at the chance to be a \n     member of the original girls varsity team.\n       ``All the players and all the parents were in favor of a \n     girls team so they could be equal with the boys,'' Sarah \n     said.\n       Sarah, who is the leading scorer on the girls team, said \n     the varsity team has improved substantially since the start \n     of the season.\n       In order to better compete with the boys, Sarah works out \n     with weights in some of her free time.\n       Segar and U-32 girls coach Mike Reardon said the Butsch \n     children have been supportive of each other.\n       Reardon said when no scorekeeper was available for a recent \n     girls varsity game, Patrick jumped in to run the scoreboard.\n       ``Not everybody would do that,'' said Reardon.\n       Hockey isn't the only passion they share. The three \n     sophomores also like to play soccer in the fall and lacrosse \n     in the spring. They also have been known to pick up a tennis \n     racket.\n\n\n                            the biggest fans\n\n       Dick and Linda Butsch have not only supported their \n     children in their hockey exploits, but also in their day-to-\n     day lives.\n       ``The parents are really great people,'' Reardon said. \n     ``They have instilled a lot of social values in their kids. \n     They also have provided them with their same humility and \n     sense of humor.''\n       Driscoll also has followed their careers.\n       ``With five children, you would have thought their parents \n     would have burned out on hockey by now. But they are at every \n     game,'' he said.\n       Butsch's career included a stint on the junior varsity team \n     at Princeton. ``It was all downhill after that,'' he said \n     with a laugh.\n       Others would dispute that, including Segar and Reardon.\n       Butsch has been active with the new hockey rink in \n     Montpelier, the Central Vermont Civic Center, and helped \n     raise the $1.8 million for its construction, Segar said.\n       ``Dick Butsch is making hockey happen in Central Vermont. \n     Not only for U-32 and Montpelier, but the Harwood Association \n     and others.'' He said even Spaulding High has used the \n     Montpelier center when unable to use its home ice because of \n     the farm show.\n       Butsch is trying to raise anothers $100,000 to put the \n     final touches on the civic center, which opened in December \n     1998.\n       Butsch, a surgeon, has been known to show up in his \n     hospital scrubs at civic center board meetings, Segar said.\n       Reardon said this winter he had a severe gash to his hand \n     and Gillian pulled out a medical supply kit to help stop the \n     bleeding and urged him to go see her father for stitches.\n       Reardon said a few days later, when it can time to removing \n     the stitches, Butsch accommodated the coach at the rink by \n     taking them out.\n       Linda Butsch admitted she is a limited skater. Her husband \n     said she had a short hockey career.\n       ``We got her to play goalie once. She never came back,'' he \n     said.\n\n\n                             the first wave\n\n       The Butsch triplets aren't the only family members making a \n     name for themselves in the world of hockey.\n       Jen Butsch, a freshman on the Providence College woman's \n     hockey team, had two goals and one assist last weekend, \n     including the game-winning score against Cornell on Saturday.\n       Earlier this season, she had a game-winning goal with four \n     seconds remaining in overtime at St. Cloud. The Friars (15-5-\n     3 overall, 9-4-3 in ECAC play) are ranked eighth in the \n     nation. Butsch has nine goals and seven assists, putting her \n     third in points for Providence, which is undefeated in 13 of \n     its last 14 games.\n       ``She is quite a role model for her sisters,'' U-32 boys \n     varsity coach Jim Segar said.\n       Chris Butsch is a sophomore at Skidmore, where he is \n     president of the first-year club hockey team. He was a \n     Division III all-state center at U-32, where he was the \n     leading scorer and two-year captain. He keeps busy trying to \n     line up games for the team and checking the Internet to see \n     how his sister Jen is stacking up. When he gets home he tries \n     to suit up for an occasional game with a local team, the \n     Bolduc Crushers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S642-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNITION OF THE HARRIMAN ARTS PROGRAM OF WILLIAM JEWELL COLLEGE\n\n Mr. BOND.

Dr. Harriman has also presented other artists such as Isaac \nStern, Itzhak Perlman and Yo-Yo Ma.\n  The Fine Arts program at William Jewell Incorporates an Education \nSeries that offers free masters classes, workshops and discussions \nallowing Jewell students and community members to view artists in a \nless formal setting. Furthermore, the program was named in Peterson's \nSmart Parents Guide to College as an example of how small colleges can \nbecome centers of culture for an entire region.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Harriman has been a tremendous asset to William \nJewell College and, indeed, the entire Kansas City area. I ask that my \ncolleagues join me in congratulating him on this most distinguished \nhonor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S642-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S642-S643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO LESTER S. JAYSON\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndedicated public servant and friend of the Congress for many years, \nLester S. Jayson, former director of the Congressional Research \nService, who died on December 30, 1999, in Orlando, Florida.\n  Mr. Jayson joined the staff of what was then the Legislative \nReference Service in October 1960 as Senior Specialist in American \nPublic Law and Chief of the American Law Division. He was promoted to \nDeputy Director of the Service in May 1962, and served as Director from \nFebruary 1966 through September 1975.\n  Mr. Jayson was influential in helping to develop the modern \nCongressional Research Service during his tenure as director of CRS \nbetween 1971 and 1975, the years in which the Service began \nimplementation of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970. This Act \nchanged the name of the Service and fundamentally enhanced its role by \nemphasizing the provision of policy analysis in all services to Members \nand committees of the Congress. The staff of the Service more than \ndoubled during this time, and Mr. Jayson helped guide CRS to fulfill \nits congressional mandate and continue the tradition of responding to \ncongressional requests for comprehensive and reliable information, \nresearch, and analysis to the Congress at all stages of the legislative \nprocess.\n  A graduate of New York City College in 1936 and Harvard Law School in \n1939, Mr. Jayson was admitted to the bar of the State of New York and \npracticed law in New York City until 1942, when he was appointed \nSpecial Assistant to the U.S. Attorney General to handle trial and \nappellate proceedings in civil cases in the New York field office of \nthe Department of Justice. In 1950, he joined the Appellate Section of \nthe Civil Division of the Justice Department, and in 1957, he became \nAssistant Chief of the Torts Section, Civil Division, and then was \npromoted to Chief of that division. Mr. Jayson was also a member of the \nbar of the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Court of Claims, the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and various other \nFederal courts. He served as Chairman\n\n[[Page S643]]\n\nand Vice Chairman of the Federal Tort Claims Committee of the Federal \nBar Association.\n  His 1,200-page book, Federal Tort Claims: Administrative and Judicial \nRemedies, was considered by many to be the preeminent volume on federal \ntort law. He wrote the volume as an extracurricular activity in 1964 \nand continued to update it regularly until several years ago.\n  On behalf of the Members of Congress who knew and worked with Mr. \nJayson, I would like to thank his family for sharing him with us during \nthe years he served the Congress and hope they are comforted by his \nlegacy. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Evelyn, his \ndaughters Jill and Diane, and his four grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S643-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO JIM FLANAGAN ON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today in \nrecognition of a gentleman who is known to many of us here in the \nSenate and in the House of Representatives, Mr. Jim Flanagan, who is \nnow retiring after more than 35 years of representing electric utility \ninterests here in Washington.\n  A graduate of St. Michael's College in Vermont, and an Army veteran \nwho served as a guided missile instructor, Jim Flanagan worked for many \nyears as the Washington Representative of New England Electric System, \nand later for Yankee Atomic Electric Company. It is in that capacity \nthat many of us came to know Jim as a wise counselor on the intricacies \nof electricity and tax legislation. Jim always had a firm grasp on the \nissues, he often had an innovative approach to solving a problem, and \nhe was unfailingly respectful of the political process and the \ndifficult decisions that elected representatives face when supporting \nor opposing legislation.\n  I came to know Jim personally under just such circumstances. He was \nan advocate for licensing the Seabrook nuclear plant in my state of New \nHampshire, arguably the most controversial construction project ever \nundertaken in this country. Throughout good times and bad, through the \nmany legislative attempts to derail the project, Jim Flanagan stood his \nground, he argued with facts not rhetoric, and he represented his \ncompany's interests with integrity and passion. We eventually licensed \nthat plant, something I am personally proud of, and today Seabrook is \none of the safest, best-performing nuclear plants in the world. Without \nthe efforts of Jim Flanagan, that would not have happened.\n  Jim had another, equally important, side to him. Beyond the issues of \nthe day, Jim Flanagan was a loyal friend, a gentleman who looked out \nfor others and who would take that extra step to do someone a favor. He \nwas a believer in young people, and took it upon himself to be a mentor \nto many here in Washington, including members of my staff. Many of us \nwho know Jim know that he has a bad knee, but few of us realize that he \ngot that bad knee teaching Little Leaguers how to slide into second \nbase more than 40 years ago. From his hometown of Waltham, \nMassachusetts, to here in the Nation's Capital, Jim Flanagan cared \nabout people.\n  In an industry that has gone through several sea changes, and in a \ntown where people and ideas come and go, Jim Flanagan was a constant--\nyou could always count on him. Jim will be sorely missed--some say the \nEdison Electric Institute will not survive without him--but he will \ncertainly not be forgotten. Jim's wife Beth, and his two grown children \nBilly and Lisa, should be very proud of him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S643-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNITION OF JASON LEE MIDDLE SCHOOL IN VANCOUVER, WA\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as I have traveled throughout \nWashington State, meeting with parents and educators, I have learned \nabout the unique needs that exist in each of our school districts. One \nof those challenges is teaching children who speak English as their \nsecond language. In Vancouver, Washington, Jason Lee Middle School has \ncreated a program called the Jason Lee English Transition System (JETS) \nthat tackles this challenge head on and not only teaches English, but \nalso identifies exceptional and special needs students and helps them \nto excel. I am proud to present my 32nd ``Innovation in Education'' \naward to the JETS program of Vancouver's Jason Lee Middle School.\n  Twenty-five percent of Jason Lee's students are English Language \nLearners [ELL] and speak 14 different languages. A majority of these \nstudents speak either Russian, Ukrainian, or Spanish, creating a \ndiverse student body and enhancing every child's education. When a \nchild begins to learn English at Jason Lee, they do not immediately \nenter mainstream classes and instead are taught in their native \nlanguage to demonstrate their math and reading levels. Students must \nalso go through an intensive instruction in English before they are \nbrought into general education classes. This advance preparation means \nthat ELL students are greeted with a more inclusive atmosphere and will \nhave a greater understanding of their classes and coursework.\n  Another challenge that faces students new to the United States is \nunderstanding American culture while maintaining ties to their own \nnative culture. The JETS program also recognizes this difficult \nadjustment by putting a great emphasis on encouraging both the \ncelebration of the native culture and in actively encouraging parental \ninvolvement.\n  In addition, JETS has taken the further step of working to not only \nprovide these students with a smooth transition into English, but it \ngoes one step further and identifies gifted students and students with \nspecial needs. Too often, programs for non-English speaking students \nstruggle to identify children needing special attention. Clearly, JETS \nhas addressed that obstacle and serves as a model for school districts \nstruggling with the same challenges.\n  The JETS program does not just teach students English, it identifies \nand addresses the many issues that a child new to this country must \nsuddenly deal with and seeks an understanding of each student's \nlearning level. I applaud the teachers and staff at Jason Lee Middle \nSchool for developing the JETS program which demonstrates the \ninnovation and creativity that is happening in our schools today. I \ncongratulate Jason Lee Middle School for its outstanding work in this \nfield of education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S643-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BEULAH COOL'S 96TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Beulah Cool \nand congratulate her on the celebration of her 96th birthday. Ms. Cool \nwas born on June 20, 1903 in Elmdale, MI, and is currently a resident \nof Webberville County, MI.\n  Ms. Cool has lived a life dedicated to helping others, as evidenced \nby her commitment to education and community service. She graduated \nfrom Clarksville school in 1921, took a six-week course in teaching, \nand taught at a rural school that same year. Upon her marriage to \nKenneth Cool in 1929, she put a hold on her teaching career and gave \nbirth to two sons, William Kenneth (1940) and Robert Arthur (1943), \nstaying at home until they were both in school. In 1950, Ms. Cool \nreturned to teaching, instructing first grade for 21 years until her \nretirement in 1971.\n  After her retirement from teaching, Beulah commenced her ``second \ncareer'' as a volunteer, with organizations such as the Red Cross, CROP \nWalk and Sparrow Hospital. One of her specialities when working at \nSparrow was knitting caps for premature babies. Ms. Cool is also a \nmember of the Webberville United Methodist Church (where she has taught \nSunday School), the Webberville Women's Advance Club, the Webberville \nGarden Club, and the Webberville Extension Club.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize the St. Clair \nShores, Michigan, AMVETS Post 121 upon the celebration of its 50th \nanniversary taking place this February 24th.\n  For the past 50 years the post has strived to make a home for many \nAmerican service men and women, while in service and after they \nreceived an honorable discharge. The post has been involved in the St. \nClair Shores Memorial festivities, and has provided community service \nand child welfare for both veterans and non-veterans yearly by giving \ncollege scholarships, baskets of food during Christmas time, and food \nand clothing donations to local children's facilities.\n  I applaud AMVETS Post 121 for its committed remembrance of the men \nand women who have served our country in the Armed Forces. Their \ndedication and hard work for veterans and non-veterans alike should \nserve a model for other veteran organizations around the country.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nMichigan Association of Chiefs of Police (MACP) who are attending their \nMid-Winter Training Conference this week. I want to commend Michigan's \nChiefs of Police for their dedication to protecting Michigan's \ncitizens--for their unwavering effort to keep our communities safe, \neven when that means putting themselves in harm's way.\n  The MACP training conference is evidence of their commitment to \nlearning the most current state-of-the-art practices and systems used \nby law enforcement in order to keep Michiganians as safe as possible.\n  Mr. President, I have had the pleasure of working with some of these \npolice chiefs on legislation. Through this work, I have only gained \nmore respect and appreciation for their dedication and their expertise \nin law enforcement issues.\n  At a time when some politicians are supporting clemency for \nterrorists, and others are effectively pitting our law enforcement \nofficers against the very people they are protecting, I think it is \nessential that we publicly recognize the exemplary role that our police \nchiefs and officers play.\n  I am proud to have this opportunity, on behalf of the U.S. Senate, to \npublicly express our gratitude to police chiefs and officers across the \ncountry who risk their lives to keep us safe--who work every day on the \nside of law-abiding citizens. I call on all elected representatives to \njoin me in supporting the efforts of police chiefs to keep our \ncommunities safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S644-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CENTER LINE HIGH NAMED A BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL BY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to offer my congratulations \nto Center Line High School in Center Line, Michigan, upon its \nrecognition by the US Department of Education as a Blue Ribbon School. \nFully accredited by the North Central Association and continuously \nendorsed since 1956, Center Line High School has demonstrated \nexcellence in a variety of areas, including student focus and support, \nactive teaching and learning, leadership, community partnerships, and \neducational vitality.\n  The Department of Education's Blue Ribbon Program promotes and \nsupports the improvement of education in America by: identifying and \nrecognizing schools that are models of excellence and equity, that \ndemonstrate a strong commitment to educational excellence for all \nstudents; making research based, self-assessment criteria available to \nschools looking for a way to reflect on how they are doing; and \nencouraging schools, both within and among themselves, to share \ninformation about best practices which is based on a shared \nunderstanding of the standards which demonstrate educational success.\n  Center Line High School demonstrated its excellence to the Department \nof Education through a variety of innovative programs intended to \nprepare its students academically, physically, and socially to \nparticipate productively in this rapidly changing world. Center Line \nHigh is in its second year on an alternating A/B block schedule, which \nhas allowed the school to implement 11 new courses this past year. \nBeyond its academic and curricular superiority, Center Line offers an \narray of student-run activities that integrate learning and service \nwith community involvement. One such program allows students the \nopportunity to operate a branch of the Metro Credit Union (one of the \nfirst student-run credit unions in the county and state) while the \nstudent-initiated Community Outreach Program gives students the chance \nto engage in area service projects.\n  I applaud Center Line High School on its excellence in education and \nits commitment to the development of students and the community.

Anderson, \nS.S.E. Auxiliary Bishop of Detroit. Bishop Anderson was the first \nAfrican-American Catholic Bishop in the State of Michigan.\n  Bishop Anderson will be honored at a Gratitude Dinner at the Sacred \nHeart Major Seminary in the City of Detroit on February 17, 2000, at \nwhich time he will also be presented with the Mother Theresa Duchemin \nMaxis Award.\n  Bishop Anderson has served the Catholic Church since his ordination \nas a priest in 1958. He was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Detroit in \n1982, was consecrated in 1983 at the Blessed Sacrament Church, and was \nappointed Pastor of Precious Blood Parish in Detroit in 1992. While in \nservice to the Catholic Church in Greater Detroit, Bishop Anderson has \nspecialized in several areas, most notably those dealing with black \ntheology, art, and evangelization.\n  Bishop Anderson's membership list includes: the National Catholic \nConference of Bishops--United States Catholic Conference, the Society \nfor the Study of Black Religion, the New Detroit Board of Trustees, \nBoysville of America, and the Ecumenical Forum. He has also given \nlectures or written papers on the following topics: Black Theology, \nEvangelization-Indigenization, the History of the Black Church in \nLouisiana, Racism--The Impoverishment of the Body and the Spirit, Black \nAwareness--The Harlem Renaissance and the Negritude Poets, and Black \nSpirituality.\n  Bishop Anderson's lengthy list of accomplishments also includes \neducational achievements, including the following degrees: Doctor of \nHumane Letters, St. Michael College; Honorary Degree in L.L.D. from \nKansas Newman College; Honorary Doctor of Humanities Degree from \nMadonna College; and Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree from the University \nof Detroit Mercy.\n  I applaud the Most Reverend Moses B.

Mr. President, I rise to congratulate and honor \ntwo young Michigan students who have achieved national recognition for \nexemplary volunteer service in their communities. Jonathan Quarles of \nFlint and Gopalkrishna Trivedi of Grosse Pointe Park have just been \nnamed State Honorees in The 2000 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards \nprogram, an annual honor conferred on only one high school student and \none middle-level student in each state, the District of Columbia and \nPuerto Rico.\n  Mr. Quarles, a high school senior at Flint Northern High School, \nfounded Students Against Violence Everywhere\n\n[[Page S645]]\n\n(S.A.V.E.), a group that helps discourage crime through creative \npresentations. Since the group was founded in 1997, they have worked in \ncollaboration with many organizations, including leadership workshops. \n``In the past year, not one teen was killed by violence in Flint,'' \nsays Jonathan.\n  Mr. Trivedi, an eighth-grader at Pierce Middle School, repaired and \nupgraded 120 obsolete computers to help non-English speaking students \nlearn and work in English. He encouraged two of his computer classmates \nto help with the project, and the three students proceeded to carry the \noutdated computers from the school basement to the computer lab. They \nthen inspected each computer to diagnose problems, and replaced all \ndefective parts. Once the computers were repaired, Gopal then formatted \nthe hard drives, installed CD-ROM's, and loaded each with an operating \nsystem. Most of these modified computers were donated to students who \nhad recently arrived from Albania with very few financial resources. \nGopal donated the rest of the computers to the school's science lab and \nthe computer keyboarding lab. ``It is a really good feeling when \nsacrifices are made for other people and those sacrifices actually \nchange some lives for the better,'' said Gopal recently.\n  In light of numerous statistics that indicate Americans today are \nless involved in their communities than they once were, it's vital that \nwe encourage and support the kind of selfless contributions these young \npeople have made. People of all ages need to think more about how we, \nas individual citizens, can work together at the local level to ensure \nthe health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods. Young \nvolunteers like Mr. Quarles and Mr. Trivedi are inspiring examples to \nall of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow.\n  The program that brought these young role models to our attention--\nThe Prudential Spirit of Community Awards--was created by The \nPrudential Insurance Company of America in partnership with the \nNational Association of Secondary School Principals in 1995 to impress \nupon youth volunteers that their contributions are critically important \nand highly valued, and to inspire other young people to follow their \nexample. In only five years, the program has become the nation's \nlargest youth recognition effort based solely on community service, \nwith nearly 75,000 youngsters participating since its inception.\n  Mr. Quarles and Mr. Trivedi should be extremely proud to have been \nsingled out from such a large group of dedicated volunteers. As part of \ntheir recognition, they will come to Washington in early May along with \nother year-2000 Spirit of Community honorees from across the country, \nfor several days of special events, including a Congressional breakfast \nreception on Capitol Hill. While here in Washington, ten will be named \nAmerica's top youth volunteers of the year by a distinguished national \nservice selection committee chaired by Senators Byron Douglas of North \nDakota and Susan Collins of Maine.\n  I heartily applaud Mr. Quarles and Mr. Trivedi for their initiative \nin seeking to make their communities better places to live, and for the \npositive impact they have had on the lives of others. I would also like \nto salute other young people in my state who were named Distinguished \nFinalists by The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards for their \noutstanding volunteer service. They are: Nupur Kanodia of Rochester \nHills, Lauren Lubowicki of Fenton, David Sherman of Dearborn, Korina \nSmith of Douglas, Brooke Southgate of Unionville, and Perry Williams of \nGrand Rapids.\n  All of these young people have demonstrated a level of commitment and \naccomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world. They \ndeserve our sincere admiration and respect. Their actions show that \nyoung Americans can--and do--play important roles in their communities, \nand that America's community spirit continues to hold tremendous \npromise for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S645-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RICK JONES TO RECEIVE 1999 SERVICE TO CHILDREN AWARD\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Rick Jones, \nCaptain of the Road Patrol for the Eaton County Sheriff Department, on \nhis selection as the 1999 Service to Children Award winner. This award \nwill be presented to Captain Jones by the Eaton County Child Abuse and \nNeglect Prevention Council.\n  Captain Jones was selected for his volunteer work benefitting youth \nactivities throughout Eaton County. Captain Jones' involvement in youth \nactivities in his area range from efforts to build both the Eaton \nRapids Playground of Dreams and the Potterville Imagination Station \nPlayground, to volunteer work with the ``Kids to the Rescue'' Earth Day \nactivities, Grand Ledge Kid's Day, 4H programs, and the Special \nOlympics.\n  Captain Jones' efforts toward improving his community also reach \nbeyond his work with area youth. He has participated in area programs \nincluding Meals on Wheels, 4-H, Eaton Shelter, and Eaton Community \nHospice.\n  The newsletter of the Eaton County Child Abuse and Prevention Council \nsaid this about Captain Jones: ``Living a life of service is paramount \nto Rick Jones * * * As a young Sheriff's deputy, Jones learned that \n`life could be pretty short.' After being shot at, Rick Jones found \nhimself evaluating life's meaning and concluding that what is truly \nimportant are contributions to his community.''\n  Eaton County, and all of Michigan, are lucky to have Rick Jones to \ncall their own. I am sure that his outlook on life and his volunteer \nwork have made a positive difference in the lives of many in his \ncommunity. It is an honor today, on behalf of the U.S. Senate, to \ncongratulate Captain Jones on his receipt of the Service to Children \nAward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S645-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS NATIONAL HOME\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

The 600 acre facility grew from a plot of land that \nwas initially donated by a Jackson farmer in 1925. Originally created \nas an orphanage for children of dead or disabled veterans, the home now \nhas professional case workers on staff, while offering full college \nfunding for children, a program for single parents, and other social \nprograms.\n  The house is home to 91 children and 27 single parents.

Res. 256\n\n       Whereas the primary goals of ``National Heart Failure \n     Awareness Week'' are--\n       (1) to promote research related to all aspects of heart \n     failure and provide a forum for presentation of that \n     research;\n       (2) to educate heart failure caregivers and patients \n     through programs, publications, and other media allowing for \n     more effective treatment and diagnosis of heart failure; and\n       (3) to enhance the quality and duration of life for those \n     with heart failure;\n       Whereas heart failure, a disease of the heart muscle, is of \n     epidemic proportions in the United States;\n       Whereas as of January 1, 2000, approximately 4,600,000 \n     Americans had been diagnosed with congestive heart failure, \n     and an estimated 450,000 more cases will be diagnosed in the \n     year 2000;\n       Whereas coronary artery disease is a cause in approximately \n     50 percent of the cases of patients with heart failure, and \n     in such cases, patients often have heart attacks or require \n     bypass surgery;\n       Whereas the incidence of heart failure increases with age \n     and is the most frequent cause of hospitalization for \n     individuals over the age of 65;\n       Whereas the prognosis for those diagnosed with heart \n     failure is not promising, as less than 50 percent of patients \n     live more than 5 years after their initial diagnosis; and\n       Whereas it is vital that the American public become aware \n     of the enormous impact of heart failure, and be better \n     educated regarding the signs and symptoms of the disease: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) in recognition of all the individuals who have devoted \n     time and energy toward increasing public awareness and \n     education on heart failure, designates the week of February \n     14-18, 2000, as ``National Heart Failure Awareness Week''; \n     and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe the \n     week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/10/senate-section/article/S646-4", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPERMITTING THE USE OF THE ROTUNDA OF THE CAPITOL FOR A CEREMONY AS PART \n   OF THE COMMEMORATION OF THE DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE OF VICTIMS OF THE \n                               HOLOCAUST\n\n  Mr. GORTON.
