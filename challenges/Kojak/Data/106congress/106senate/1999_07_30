Under the previous order, there will now be 15 \nminutes equally divided with respect to the Bingaman amendment No. \n1462.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. How much time is allotted to me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment I presented yesterday and \nthat we are going to vote on first this morning is a simple statement \nthat we should reduce the size of the tax cut that is proposed by $132 \nbillion so that we will have funds available to maintain the current \nlevel of effort in support of education. It, I grant you, is a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution. It does not ensure that the money is spent \nthere, but to my mind it at least reserves those funds so we can \nmaintain the current level of effort in support of education. In other \nwords, I believe we should be on record for funding education at least \nat current levels before we settle on the size of the tax cut that we \ncan afford.\n  Some might ask why am I singling out education. Well, S. 1429 is more\n\n[[Page S9886]]\n\nthan just a tax bill; it is a reconciliation bill, which means, at \nleast in rough form, it purports to set national priorities for the \nnext 10 years. I believe that a very top priority should be providing \nquality education to the young people of this Nation. Our future \ndepends more on that investment than it does on virtually any other \ninvestment we might make.\n  So if education is a priority, what is the relationship of this tax \ncut bill to education? Now, as I understand the estimates for the next \n10 years, the tax cut bill is so large that it will require us to make \nsignificant cuts in discretionary spending, including education, in \nthis coming decade, and that is the concern I have and that is what has \nprompted this amendment.\n  Yesterday, as I was describing the amendment, I was informed that my \nconcern is unfounded; that in fact even after the tax cut--and I know \npeople do not like to have it referred to as a massive tax cut; I \nnotice that is what the Wall Street Journal called it this morning in \ntheir headline--there will be plenty of discretionary funds for \neducation. That was the information I was given.\n  So let me look at the figures I have and see where I am confused on \nthis and where I have misunderstood the situation.\n  First of all, we all expect a surplus, and that is why we are having \nthis debate and talking about cutting taxes in the first place. So we \nall agree to that. We also all agree that the portion of that surplus \nattributable to Social Security should be left for Social Security. And \nthat is about $1.9 trillion. There is no dispute about that that I am \naware of, at least in this debate.\n  So after we take that out, what is left? At the beginning of the \ndebate, the Congressional Budget Office came out with the figure in the \nrange of $1 trillion, the non-Social Security-related surplus. So that \nis represented here. This chart shows CBO, Congressional Budget Office. \nThis column represents the non-Social Security surplus as it was \nunderstood by me when we started the debate.\n  Now I am informed that we have a new estimate and that the surplus is \nnot going to be $2.8 trillion over the next 10 years; instead, it is \ngoing to be over $3.3 trillion. So there is going to be substantially \nmore money. The question is, Where did we find this additional $400 to \n$500 billion?\n  Mr. President, let me yield myself 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. It was arrived at by assuming that less money is going \nto be spent on discretionary spending during the 10 years. The \nCongressional Budget Office assumed that $595 billion would be cut in \ndiscretionary spending. The new claim is that there is going to be $1 \ntrillion cut, and that by cutting discretionary spending by $1 trillion \ninstead of by $595 billion, we are going to have extra money that we \ncan turn around and spend on discretionary accounts.\n  Mr. President, that doesn't add up in my mind. I believe \ndiscretionary accounts are important. I believe education has to be at \nthe top of that list. I do not see where we can expect to find the \nmoney to maintain current levels of effort on education if we vote for \nthis very large tax cut. That is why the size of the tax cut should be \nreduced so that education programs will not have to be cut.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the balance of my time to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman. This is a very \nimportant amendment that he has offered. Certainly, as we are talking \nabout what the future of our country is going to be, we should be \nlooking at what we are doing to invest in our young children today so \nthey can be economically viable when they graduate from high school and \ncollege 15, 20 years from now, making sure that we have the money there \nfor the Head Start Program, Pell grants, early childhood education.\n  These are important investments in our children, and if we follow \nthrough on a massive tax cut at this time, as the Senator from New \nMexico has said, in the future we will not have the money to make sure \nthat our kids get the kind of education they need to be viable members \nof our community. This is a very important amendment.\n  As we come to the end of this debate about what we are going to do to \ninvest in our future, let's remember that if we put in place a tax cut \nsuch as this, we will harm our young children, we will harm Social \nSecurity and Medicare and critical programs for women in this country \nto make sure they don't live in poverty. We will not be able to pay off \nour debt, a very important issue that is facing us, which we have not \nleft ourselves room for with a massive tax cut of this size.\n  Most critically, we will not be able to do what we have a \nresponsibility to do, not only as Senators but as parents and as adults \nin this country, to make sure that those who follow us have the skills \nthey need to make sure this country continues to run well in the \nfuture. Investment in Pell grants and in early childhood education, and \ninvestment in education, class size reduction, and training of our \nteachers will make a difference for the future. We have a \nresponsibility to do that.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his work on education, and I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as I said yesterday, I don't normally \ntake to the Senate floor and speak in opposition to an amendment of my \ncolleague from New Mexico. But I did yesterday, and I must this morning \nbecause if this amendment is reported in New Mexico, and if it says to \nconstituents of our State that the budget resolution we adopted, and \nwhat will be left over after the tax cut would decimate education, then \nit would appear to me that I must answer because that isn't true.\n  First of all, the Senator from New Mexico, my colleague, is at least \nnot as sensational in his approach as the President was yesterday. The \nPresident even knows right down to the nickel what is not going to be \nspent in education. That is impossible. He says that 544,000 kids \naren't going to be able to learn to read. That is ludicrous. If that is \nthe kind of talk he needs to defeat a tax bill, then good luck to him. \nIt is just absolutely untrue.\n  Let's get the facts as I remember and understand them. We produced a \nbudget resolution. It is nothing new with reference to the taxes; $792 \nbillion spread out over 10 years was the tax cut in that bill. We also \nallocated the remaining money for the next decade and, incidentally, in \ndoing that, even though there was a reduction in discretionary \nspending, the highest priority domestic program was education, for all \nthe reasons stated on the floor by Senator Murray and Senator Bingaman. \nIt is terribly important that we use our education dollars right and \nbetter but that there be more of them. We put $37 billion in additional \nmoney during the first 5 years of that budget for education.\n  Now, what happened after that? After that, some 3 months later, the \nCongressional Budget Office did a midsession review and told us there \nwas more money than that. As a matter of fact, there was $170 billion \nmore in the surplus account. We didn't add some of that to the tax cut. \nIt is sitting there. What I did, so that everyone would understand, I \nsaid let's look at this surplus in the chart I used yesterday, and \nlet's assume that we freeze discretionary spending and ask CBO how much \nmoney would then be available to put back into discretionary accounts \nduring the decade.\n  They told us: We don't know whether you will use it in discretionary \naccounts. We can't say that.\n  But there is $505 billion that could be added into priority spending. \nI believe that means all of the discretionary spending can go up \nsignificantly and you can establish education as a high-priority item \nand fund it at levels higher than we have now, which I think \nRepublicans will do if we have reform in the educational allowances of \nthe Federal Government, so that there is accountability and flexibility \nin the programs that we send there.\n  I believe what my colleague from New Mexico is expressing on the \nfloor\n\n[[Page S9887]]\n\nis a sincere desire that we be sure that in the discretionary accounts \nwe fund education adequately. If that is what he was saying, I join \nwith him in saying that is true. But when he says you need to take $122 \nbillion--or whatever the number is--out of the tax cut in order to do \nthat, I disagree. I don't think you have to do that.\n  Plain and simple, I think there is plenty of discretionary money \navailable. I add, if you use the President's numbers on Medicare--and \nhe said you only needed $46 billion to fix prescription drugs--you have \n$505 billion, less the $46 billion, and all the rest can go to \ndiscretionary spending in the next decade. I am not trying to mislead \nanybody. In order to understand it, I said start with the premise that \nwe freeze all these accounts and put in what is left. If you look at \nthe budget resolution, we put $181 billion into those accounts, with \neducation being the highest priority. It just happens there is more \nthan that $181 billion because the midsession review added many \nbillions of dollars in accumulated surplus.\n\n  I am fully aware that Senator Bingaman, my colleague, has regularly \nand consistently as a member of the Committee on Education, and on the \nfloor, been a promoter and a staunch supporter of education. I agree \nwith him, but I believe he is wrong in thinking that we have to reduce \nthe tax cut in order to be sure we do that. I also remind everybody \nthat there are some very significant education programs in this tax \nbill. It makes it easier to continue your education because it has \nallowances, credits, and deductions in the adult education area. It \nmakes it easier to pay off student loans. It makes college more \naffordable, and it provides tax exempt financing for school \nconstruction. All of that is in the Roth bill.\n  Whatever time I had remaining, I yield back.\n  I make a point of order that the Bingaman amendment No. 1462 is \nextraneous to the bill before us. Therefore, I raise a point of order \nunder section 313(b)(1)(A) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the applicable sections of \nthat act for the consideration of the pending amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1472, As Further Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 15 \nminutes equally divided for concluding remarks with respect to the \nHutchison of Texas amendment, No. 1472.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, under the previous unanimous consent \nagreement, I send a modification of the amendment to the desk to \namendment No. 1472.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I now yield 2 minutes to Senator \nAshcroft of Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nTexas for her outstanding work correcting a pernicious discrimination \nagainst the most valuable institution in our society, the family. I \nthank the chairman for his sensitivity to this important issue, for \nplacing in this bill procedures to remedy the marriage penalty.\n  The marriage penalty simply is an anomaly. It is a strangeness in the \ntax structure that has evolved, that penalizes people for being \nmarried. It puts them into higher tax brackets when they get married \nthan when they were single. When people get married, they start paying \na tax penalty. That is something we should stop.\n  The Senator from Texas and the chairman of this committee have agreed \nthat we should stop it. And we should, as a matter of fact, according \nto the amendment of the Senator from Texas, of which I am an original \ncosponsor along with Senator Brownback, accelerate the time at which we \nbegin to stop this very serious fault with the tax system.\n  America should not penalize the family. It should not make it harder \nfor people to have families. It should not make it financially more \ndifficult for two people to be married and live together than unmarried \nand live together. That is a simple fact. It is because the family is \nthe best department of social services, the best department of \neducation; it is the best place in which individuals are enriched to \nlearn individual responsibility and the values and character our \nculture needs to survive.\n\n[[Page S9888]]\n\n  I am very pleased to be a part of this tax measure which will say \nabout America's families that we cherish them rather than punish them \nand it is time for all of us to join together and eliminate the \nmarriage tax penalty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is the 4 \nminutes from my 7\\1/2\\ minutes?\n  Mr. ROTH. I am yielding this from my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time in opposition to the amendment?\n  Mr. ROTH. Actually, Mr. President, I want to add my support for the \namendment put forward by Senator Hutchison. It builds on the basic \nobjectives of the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999, particularly objectives \nof helping families bring greater equity to the Tax Code.\n  One very important provision of the tax relief package we have \nproposed is the elimination of the marriage tax penalty. There is \nstrong bipartisan agreement that this penalty is not only unfair but \nthat it is counterproductive in a way that discourages couples from \nmarrying.\n  When I introduced the Taxpayer Refund Act 2 days ago, I introduced \nRobert and Dianne, a hypothetical couple who had fallen in love and \nwanted to marry. I explained how, as individuals, they would not be \nconsidered wealthy, how Robert worked as a foreman in an auto plant and \nDianne worked as a nurse. I then explained how, as a married couple \nwith a combined income, they would be considered well off and how they \nwould end up paying the Government $1,500 more in taxes than they would \nif they remained single.\n  The Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 does away with the marriage tax \npenalty. It completely eliminates the penalty for Robert and Dianne and \nfor any other couples who choose to marry. What I like about the \namendment introduced by our distinguished colleague from Texas, Senator \nHutchison, is that under her plan the tax relief is expedited. This is \ndone at a price. The change does require the delay of other provisions \nthat provide relief for the taxpayer. I regret that. But we do think it \nis desirable to provide marriage relief as early as possible.\n  Therefore, I encourage my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If the Senator will yield just a few minutes?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I again compliment my good friend, the \nSenator from Texas, as well as the chairman of the committee. The \nSenator from Texas offered this amendment last night, and at that time \nI explained we thought this was a very good amendment because it moves \nin the direction of the Democratic substitute, raising the standard \ndeduction, in her case for married couples, to eliminate the marriage \ntax penalty. We would have gone further, but we compliment the Senator \nin going in this direction.\n  Last night, too, there was a slight question how this was going to be \npaid for. We have worked it out overnight. As I understand it--the \nSenator may correct me if I am wrong--the AMT delayed relief provisions \nare no longer in place, but rather there will be a delay in the \nexpansion of the 15-percent bracket in order to pay for this.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The Senator is correct. There are delays. Nothing is \neliminated, but there are delays in several provisions because we are \ntrying to say this is our first priority.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think that is a good offset. It adds a \nlittle more progressivity, frankly, to the bill, than otherwise would \nbe there.\n  I compliment the Senator on her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield the Senator from Kansas, Senator Brownback, 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. I am \ndelighted to join her in this amendment that it appears will garner \noverwhelming support. I hope that sends a strong signal across this \ncountry that today is a day to celebrate. We should be celebrating the \ninstitution of marriage and support that institution rather than tax \nit.\n  For many years now we have taxed it. Clearly, if there is a policy in \nGovernment that stands it is if you want less of something, tax it; if \nyou want more of something, subsidize it. We have been taxing marriage, \nand marriage has fallen off in this country 43 percent over the last 30 \nyears. That is a terrible situation for an institution that is so \ncentral.\n  I note to my colleagues, we all frequently talk about family values. \nThomas, from Hilliard, OH, writes in about this point on the marriage \npenalty and the notion of family values:\n\n       No person who legitimately supports family values could be \n     against this bill. The marriage penalty is but another \n     example of how in the past 40 years the federal government \n     has enacted policies that have broken down the fundamental \n     institutions that were the strength of this country from the \n     start.\n\n  I could not have put it better. I am delighted it appears that this \namendment is going to be agreed to. I hope we can get it to the \nPresident's desk and that the President will be supportive of \neliminating the marriage penalty tax. I hope as well we could go \nfurther in the future and enact income splitting, that we could provide \nfor a couple to split their income. This would be even more supportive \nof this fundamental institution in our culture, in our Nation, of \nmarriage. I hope we can take that step on into the future.\n  I am delighted to have the chairman's support in this. I urge all my \ncolleagues in the name of family values, vote for this amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are remaining 3 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will finish on my statement.\n  Something very important is happening. What is important is, we are \napparently going to pass overwhelmingly the only amendment that will \nhave passed on this bill. On this very important tax cut measure, we \nare going to add certainly the first amendment, and maybe the only one, \nthat says the marriage tax penalty is not going to be allowed to stand \nin the United States of America. That is what we are doing today. The \nbill provides for marriage tax penalty relief in 2005. I applaud the \ncommittee for doing that. But I thought we should address it earlier. \nThat is why Senator Ashcroft, Senator Brownback, Senator Domenici, \nSenator Roth, and Senator Baucus have come together and said that is \nright. The people of this country who want to get married should not \nhave to pay $1,000 in taxes just because they got married. We are going \nto end it today because we are sending a signal that is joined by the \nHouse that this is our first priority.\n  So a high school football coach and a schoolteacher can get married \nand not move into a bracket that is almost double just because they got \nmarried. It hits our middle-income taxpayers the most. They are the \nones who are trying to save for a new house or a new car or to do \nsomething special for their new baby. We are going to send a signal out \nof the Senate, along with the House, to the President, saying: Mr. \nPresident, we are going to have $1 trillion in income tax surplus. Are \nyou serious in saying you would veto this bill that gives marriage tax \npenalty relief to our country, that gives pension relief to the women \nwho go in and out of the workforce who are unable to have the same \npension capabilities as those who never leave the workforce?\n  Is the President serious about vetoing a bill that provides for \nSocial Security, that provides for Medicare and education, and, yes, \nthe marriage tax penalty relief?\n  Mr. President, we are making a statement with this amendment. I am \nproud the Senate is going to take up and I believe overwhelmingly pass \na\n\n[[Page S9889]]\n\npriority of eliminating the marriage tax penalty in this country once \nand for all. I urge my colleagues to give a unanimous vote for the \nmarried people who have been living with a penalty that is not \nwarranted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, we yield back the remainder of the time.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1462\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have a motion at the desk and ask that it \nbe called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] moves to \n     recommit S. 1429, the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999, to the \n     Committee on Finance, with instructions to report back to the \n     Senate within 3 days, with an amendment to reserve $20 \n     billion over ten years for relief from the unintended \n     consequences of the Balanced Budget Act on teaching \n     hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health care \n     providers, rural and other community hospitals, and other \n     health care providers, by reducing or deferring certain new \n     tax breaks in the bill.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I understand I have 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me share with my colleagues what this \nis. Under the Balanced Budget Act, we set out to save some $103 billion \nin Medicare expenditures with respect to hospitals, home care, et \ncetera. The problem is the unintended consequences of the way that has \nhappened, coupled with the managed care process, in fact, about $205 \nbillion in Medicare payments has been reduced. The result is that, in \nhospitals, home care facilities, and nursing homes all across the \ncountry, all of our States are significantly affected in the quality of \ncare that is being delivered.\n  Special care units in hospitals are closing. Home care facilities are \nrefusing patients. There has been a significant reduction in the \nquality of care across the country. Our teaching hospitals are \nthreatened. What we are saying is that we need to reserve some $20 \nbillion in order to be able to adequately make up for the unintended\n\n[[Page S9890]]\n\nconsequences of the Balanced Budget Act.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, although the Kerry amendment is well-\nintended, it is not germane to this reconciliation bill. The Finance \nCommittee is paying close attention to the concerns of health care \nproviders and beneficiaries. Over ten Medicare hearings have been held \nthis year, three focusing specifically on BBA 1997 policies.\n  The Finance Committee is also developing a Medicare package that will \naddress the many concerns in the Balanced Budget Act. The tax package \nin no way interferes with this process.\n  Finally, I might add that even the President's Medicare proposal sets \naside a maximum of only $7.5 billion over 10 years to address BBA \nfixes, $12.5 billion less than this amendment.\n  The amendment is not germane to this reconciliation legislation, and \nI raise a point of order under section 305 (b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Budget Act, \nI move to waive that section in that act for consideration of this \nmotion.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 helped bring us to this \nera of budget surpluses and economic prosperity. But too much of the \nactual savings used to balance the budget have come from Medicare.\n  At the time the BBA was enacted, those savings were expected to total \n$116 billion over five years. Now, they are estimated by CBO to be \nnearly twice as great--nearly $200 billion over five years. Such deep \ncuts in Medicare are clearly unfair and unacceptable.\n  Not surprisingly, all of us are now hearing from bedrock health care \ninstitutions across the country that are being devastated by these \nexcessive cuts. Teaching hospitals--community hositals--community \nhealth centers and many others. We are hearing from those who care for \nthe elderly and disabled when they leave the hospital--nursing homes--\nhome health agencies--rehabilitation facilities. We are hearing from \nvirtually every one who cares for the 40 million senior citizens and \ndisabled citizens on Medicare. They are telling us in no uncertain \nterms that Congress went too far.\n  This motion is the first step toward reducing the steepest cuts. It \nwould provide $20 billion over the next ten years to slow or eliminate \nthe harshest impact of the Balanced Budget Act. It would ensure that \nthe nation's hospitals and other health care facilities will be able to \ncare for senior citizens and the disabled in the years ahead.\n  With the retirement of the baby boom generation, the last thing we \nshould be doing is jeopardizing the viability of the many health care \nfacilities that depend on Medicare for their survival. These \ninstitutions are being hard hit in cities and towns across the nation.\n  Often, the hospitals and other institutions that care for Medicare \npatients also care for other patients as well. Health care in the \nentire community is being threatened.\n  Teaching hospitals are on the receiving end of a triple-whammy. The \nslash in Medicare reductions is leading to less patient care, less \ndoctor training, and less medical research at the nation's top \nhospitals. In my own state of Massachusetts, for the first time in \nhistory, some of the finest and most renowned teaching hospitals in the \ncountry are now operating at a deficit. This situation is \nunsustainable--and it is happening all over our country. We will all \nsuffer if these great institutions are forced out of business or into \nthe arms of for-profit corporations.\n  Community hospitals are suffering, too. Throughout my State of \nMassachusetts, we are seeing red ink and cutbacks in essential \nservices. This, too, is happening all over the country.\n  In Massachusetts alone, house health agencies are losing $160 million \na year. Twenty agencies have closed their doors since the Balanced \nBudget Act went into effect. Many others are seeing fewer patients, and \nseeing their remaining patients less often. The home-bound elderly are \nespecially vulnerable, and are suffering even more. In just the last \ntwo weeks, two Massachusetts nursing homes have declared bankruptcy.\n  This proposal is an important step to restore the viability of these \nindispensable institutions in our health care system, and I urge the \nSenate to approve it. We must undo the damage before it is too late. \nThe last thing we need to see on the doors of the nation's teaching \nhospitals, community hospitals, home health agencies, and nursing \nhomes, is a sign that says, ``Closed because of the ill-considered \nactivities of the United States Congress.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It will in no way \nchange the outcome of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1467\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1467.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Frist) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1467.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in a previous edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment that goes right at the heart of what we should be doing about \nMedicare. It says Congress should be acting to modernize Medicare, to \nensure its solvency, and to include prescription drugs.\n  The congressional budget plan has $505 billion over the next 10 years \nin unallocated budget surpluses that could be used for long-term \nMedicare reform. In addition, the congressional budget resolution for \nthe year 2000 has specifically set aside $90 billion for this purpose.\n  Thus, my sense-of-the-Senate amendment says that the unallocated on-\nbudget surpluses provide adequate resources and that: No. 1, the \ncongressional budget resolution provides a sound framework for the \nmodernization of Medicare; No. 2, improving the solvency of Medicare; \nand No. 3, improving coverage of prescription drugs.\n  Congress should act to accomplish these goals for the Medicare \nprogram.\n\n[[Page S9891]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, with great respect, I must inform this \nbody that this amendment is pure fiction. It is pure fiction because \nthe House and the Senate this year have been using Congressional Budget \nOffice baseline numbers to predict what the surplus is or is not and \nwhat is left for spending. Under that formula, there is virtually no \nmoney in this tax bill left for discretionary spending.\n  A few days ago, a new chart suddenly popped up. The new chart comes \nup with this money. How does it come up with this money? It basically \nassumes that the Congress, over the next 10 years, is going to not only \ncut discretionary spending under the caps as planned but then not raise \ndiscretionary spending above inflation over the next 8 years.\n  I say that is a fiction--it is just not going to happen, so the money \nis not there--developed by this recent new chart.\n  If it is an accurate assumption that there is no spending, then it \ncuts discretionary spending by 50 percent, one or the other. It is a \nfiction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on amendment No. 1467.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending \namendment violates 313(b)(1)(A) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974.\n  Mr. FRIST. Pursuant to section 904 of the Budget Act, I move to waive \nthe Budget Act for the consideration of my amendment No. 1467, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 54, nays 46, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 235 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). On this vote the yeas are 54, the \nnays are 46. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of \norder is sustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                        Frist Medicare Amendment\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today I voted against the Medicare Sense of \nthe Senate amendment numbered 1467, offered by Senator Frist. For the \nbenefit of my constituents in West Virginia, I offer a brief \nexplanation for why I voted the way I did.\n  I opposed Senator Frist's amendment because, in my judgment, it is \nbased on a fiction. As we all know, the Congressional Budget Office \n(CBO) has projected a $996 billion non-Social Security surplus over the \nnext ten years. The Frist amendment said that, even allowing for the \n$792 billion tax cut, there was still enough money left over to provide \nfor the long-term solvency of the Medicare system. One need not be an \neconomist, or even an expert in budget policy, to understand why that \nwas just plain wrong.\n  The Republican tax cut plan will cost $971 billion over the next ten \nyears--$792 billion for the actual tax cut, plus $179 billion in \nadditional interest payments on the debt. That leaves $25 billion of \nthe non-Social Security surplus. From that amount, the Republicans have \nsaid we can provide for emergency expenditures for natural disasters \nand international conflicts, which averages $80 billion over ten years; \nfund current operations of government; and reserve enough money for \nMedicare. And, as I say, they would do all that without using the \nSocial Security surplus. As anyone can plainly see, that is just not \npossible. In all good conscience, I could not vote for the Frist \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Motion To Recommit\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I call up a motion we have at the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] moves to \n     recommit the bill to the Committee on Finance, with \n     instructions to report back to the Senate within 3 days, \n     with an amendment to correct the fact that the bill uses \n     Social Security surpluses for tax breaks by causing on-\n     budget deficits, taking into account both revenue losses \n     and additional interest costs caused by the higher levels \n     of debt that would result from the bill's enactment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the motion is very simple. It directs \nthe Finance Committee to correct the bill so that it does not raid \nSocial Security surpluses in any year to pay for tax cuts. In its \ncurrent form, this bill would use Social Security surpluses in each of \nthe second 5 years after enactment.\n  Altogether, $75 billion of Social Security money will be used to pay \nfor the broad-based tax rebates that are largely for special interests \nand for the very wealthy. That is the intent, and it is inconsistent \nwith the Social Security lockbox that the Republicans claim to support.\n  If my colleagues are serious about stopping Congress from raiding \nthese surpluses, they will support my motion. The Finance Committee can \ncorrect the problem very quickly, and then we can proceed to consider \nthe bill within only a few days.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I urge my colleagues to support the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table \nprepared by the Congressional Budget Office be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the

Mr. President, I begin today by thanking Senator Roth, the \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee, for recognizing that there is \na place for estate-tax relief in this bill. The measure reported by the \nFinance Committee includes a variety of changes: a one-time reduction \nin the top death-tax rate, converting the unified credit to a true \nexemption, and raising the annual gift exclusion. These are all steps \nin the right direction. The problem is, at the end of the day, the Roth \nbill leaves the death tax in place.\n  By contrast, the bill that the House of Representatives passed last \nweek phases out the death tax over a 10-year period, and then \nimplements a version of the bill I introduced back in May with Senator \nBob Kerrey and a bipartisan group of 19 other Senators.\n  The amendment I am offering today is based upon that bipartisan \ninitiative. I would replace the death tax with a tax on the appreciated \nvalue of inherited assets to be paid when the assets are sold. In other \nwords, the tax would be imposed when income is actually realized from \ninherited property. Death would no longer be a taxable event.\n  This amendment represents an effort to find bipartisan consensus \nabout how to deal with the death tax, and I hope all Senators will \nconsider it with an open mind. It is an approach that Senators Moynihan \nand Kerrey actually suggested to me during a hearing before the Finance \nCommittee two years ago. Bill Beach of the Heritage Foundation \ndiscussed its merits at the same hearing. The more I looked into the \nidea since then, the more sense I thought it made. The essence of it is \nvery simple: It takes death out of the equation. Whether an asset is \nsold by the decedent during his or her lifetime, or by someone who \nlater inherits the property, the gain is taxed the same. Under this \napproach, death neither confers a benefit, nor results in a punitive, \nconfiscatory tax. This is an approach that I believe both Republicans \nand Democrats should be able to accept.\n  We know that many Americans are troubled by the estate tax's \ncomplexity and high rates, and by the mere fact that it is triggered by \na person's death rather than the realization of income. For a long \ntime, I have advocated its repeal, because I believe death should not \nbe a taxable event.\n  Others agree that the tax is problematic, but are concerned the \nappreciated value of certain assets might escape taxation forever if \nthe death tax is repealed while the step-up in basis allowed by the \nInternal Revenue Code remains in effect. That is a legitimate concern.\n  We try to reconcile these positions in this amendment by eliminating \nboth the death tax and the step-up in basis, and attributing a \ncarryover basis to inherited property so that all gains are taxed at \nthe time the property is sold and income is realized.\n  The concept of a carryover basis is not new. It exists in current law \nwith respect to gifts, property transferred in cases of divorce, and in \nconnection with involuntary conversions of property relating to theft, \ndestruction, seizure, requisition, or condemnation.\n  In the latter case, when an owner receives compensation for \ninvoluntarily converted property, a taxable gain normally results to \nthe extent that the value of the compensation exceeds the basis of the \nconverted property. However, section 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code \nallows the taxpayer to defer the recognition of the gain until the \nproperty is sold. This amendment would treat the transfer of property \nat death--perhaps the most involuntary conversion of all--the same way, \ndeferring recognition of any gain until the inherited property is sold.\n  Small estates, which currently pay no estate tax by virtue of the \nunified credit, and no capital-gains tax by virtue of the step up, \nwould be unaffected by the basis changes being proposed here. The \nestate tax would be eliminated for them, and they would still get the \nbenefit of the current law's step-up. The basis changes would apply \nonly to estates valued at over $2 million.\n  There are four problems I see with the underlying bill's death-tax \nprovisions. First, the bill tries to make palatable what is \nfundamentally indefensible. Taxing death is wrong.\n  Second, because it leaves the death tax in place, the need for \nexpensive estate-tax planning also remains. Some people will have to \ndivert money they would have spent on new equipment or new hires to \ninsurance policies designed to cover death-tax costs. Still others will \nspend millions on lawyers, accountants, and other advisors for death-\ntax planning purposes. But that leaves fewer resources to invest, start \nup new businesses, hire additional people, or pay better wages.\n  Third, the higher exemption proposed in the committee bill provides \nsome relief, but I believe it also serves as an artificial cap on small \nbusinesses' growth. To avoid the death tax, an entrepreneur merely \nneeds to limit the growth of his or her business so it does not exceed \nthe $1.5 million exemption amount. That means fewer jobs, and less \noutput.\n\n[[Page S9894]]\n\n  I believe it would be better to eliminate the tax and, if there is a \nneed to impose a tax, impose it when income is actually realized--that \nis, when the assets are sold. That is what this amendment would do.\n  I want to stress to colleagues, particularly colleagues on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, that we do not allow appreciation in \ninherited assets to go untaxed, as other death-tax repeal proposals \nwould do. We are merely saying that if a tax is imposed, it should be \nimposed when income is realized. Earnings from an asset should be taxed \nthe same whether the asset is earned or inherited.\n  The question has been posed at various times during debate on this \nbill whether the American people want tax relief. Let me answer that \nquestion with respect to the issue at hand. Although most Americans \nwill probably never pay a death tax, most people still sense that there \nis something terribly wrong with a system that allows Washington to \nseize more than half of whatever is left after someone dies--a system \nthat prevents hard-working Americans from passing the bulk of their \nnest eggs to their children or grandchildren.\n  Seventy-seven percent of the people responding to a survey by the \nPolling Company last year indicated that they favor repeal of the death \ntax. When Californians had the chance to weigh in with a ballot \nproposition, they voted two-to-one to repeal their state's death tax. \nThe legislatures of five other states have enacted legislation since \n1997 that will either eliminate or significantly reduce the burden of \ntheir states' death taxes.\n  The 1995 White House Conference on Small Business identified the \ndeath tax as one of small business's top concerns, and delegates to the \nconference voted overwhelming to endorse its repeal. Outright repeal \nreceived the fourth highest number of votes among all resolutions \napproved at the conference.\n  A couple of other points to consider about the death tax. it is one \nof the most inefficient taxes that the government levies. Alicia \nMunnell, who was a member of President Clinton's Council of Economic \nAdvisors, estimated that the costs of complying with death-tax laws are \nof roughly the same magnitude as the revenue raised. In 1998, that was \nabout $23 billion. In other words, for every dollar of tax revenue \nraised by the death tax, another dollar is squandered in the economy \nsimply to comply with or avoid the tax.\n  The tax hurts the economy. A report issued by the Joint Economic \nCommittee in December of 1998 concluded that the existence of the death \ntax this century has reduced the stock of capital in the economy by \nnearly half a trillion dollars. By repealing it and putting those \nresources to better use, the Joint Committee estimated that as many as \n240,000 jobs could be created over seven years and Americans would have \nan additional $24.4 billion in disposable personal income. So much for \nthe contention that this is a tax that touches only a few.\n  It appears that the chairman of the Finance Committee will raise a \npoint of order against this amendment. I think that is regrettable. If \nthere is a way to improve this amendment, I am willing to work with \nChairman Roth on any ideas he might have. But if the point of order is \nintended to preserve the death tax as a permanent part of the Tax Code, \nwe have a very significant difference of opinion, and I think he should \nallow the Senate to work its will, rather than use a parliamentary \npoint of order to block it.\n  This is a good amendment; the policy it proposes is sound, and fair. \nIts time has come. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  As I say, this amendment would repeal the estate tax, the so-called \ndeath tax. According to the Joint Tax Committee, under scoring, it \ncannot occur until the eighth year or until 2007. But at that point it \nreplaces the death tax with a tax on the sale of the assets, usually a \ncapital gains tax, if and when the property is sold. In other words, it \nis a very fair compromise between those who believe there should be \nsome tax on the sale of assets and those who believe that death itself \nshould not be a taxable event.\n  I am advised that a point of order will be made that this amendment \nis not germane. If that is done, I believe that to be very unfortunate. \nBut because Senator Kerrey would prefer that we not proceed with a vote \non the point of order, I will not contest the ruling of the Chair.\n  I believe that repeal of the death tax enjoys more than majority \nsupport and am confident that in the conference committee, we will be \nable to accept the House version or something close to it which repeals \nthe death tax along the lines of the Kyl-Kerrey approach.\n  I urge my colleagues to support repeal of the death tax. If a point \nof order is made, I will not contest it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane. I \ntherefore raise a point of order that the amendment violates section \n305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken and the \namendment falls. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Motion To Recommit\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Lieberman, Senator \nLevin, and myself, I move to recommit the bill to the Finance Committee \nwith instructions that the committee report back within 3 days with an \namendment that implements the Greenspan recommendations by deferring \ntax reductions and by taking any projected revenue surplus and actually \nreducing the national debt.\n  Now, for days on end we have been talking about what Mr. Greenspan \nsaid here, what Mr. Greenspan said here. As our friend, the former \nAttorney General Mitchell said: Watch what we do, not what we say.\n  He has been trying to stay the course; namely, just take, in a sense, \nany surpluses--don't argue about them, but if you can find them, then \napply that to reducing the national debt. So often we say that all of \nus want to go to heaven but we don't want to do what is necessary to \nget there. All of us say we want to reduce or pay down the national \ndebt, but we don't want to do what is necessary to get there. All you \nhave to do in order to get there or reduce the debt is vote for this \nmotion.\n  I yield to Senator Lieberman.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in the interest of legislative \nefficiency, let alone fiscal responsibility, Senator Levin and I are \nwithdrawing our motion to strike the entire tax cut and joining to \nraise the same issue with Senator Hollings on this amendment which says \nyou can't have a tax cut if the surplus is not there, and there is no \nevidence the surplus is there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this motion. In a \nvery real way, this is the final vote on the legislation before us. Let \nme point out that both Democrats and Republicans have broadly agreed \nthat there should be a tax cut. That tax cut should be now. The \nAmerican people are entitled to relief. What we are really doing here \nis restoring the excess taxes already paid. For that reason, I shall \nmake a motion to table.\n  Let me reemphasize again, the Democrats have had a proposal of $300 \nbillion in a tax cut. There has been a $500 billion tax cut. We have \nfollowed the budget recommendations of $792 billion. To deny the \nworking people of America the tax break they deserve today makes no \nsense at all.\n  For that reason, I move to table the motion to recommit, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join in cosponsoring the Hollings motion \nto recommit the bill to the Finance Committee with instructions to \ndefer tax reductions in order to reduce the national debt. I \ncosponsored the Hollings motion in lieu of calling up the Lieberman-\nLevin amendment because the effect of the Hollings motion, had it been \nadopted, would have been largely the same as the Lieberman-Levin \namendment.\n  The tax program before the Senate is unfair to middle income \nAmericans, it is economically unwise and it's based on unrealistic \nassumptions. The unfairness is perhaps best shown by the fact that \nabout two-thirds of its tax benefits go to the upper one-fifth of our\n\n[[Page S9895]]\n\npeople. In addition to being unfair, it is economically unwise in that \njeopardizes Medicare, fails to strengthen Social Security, and risks \nhigher interest rates.\n  This bill takes us back to the bad old days of backloaded tax breaks \nwhose real costs explode several years after enactment. This budgetary \ntime bomb is set to go off at roughly the same time as the Medicare \ntrust fund is expected to be bankrupt and the bill begins to come due \nfor Social Security. In that decade, as the ``baby boomers'' begin to \nretire, the Social Security Trust fund will begin to run a deficit, \nrequiring the redemption of Treasury bonds which it holds.\n  It is also based on unrealistic projections. Projections are always \nrisky. We have seen many federal budget estimates, and we know well \nthat as quickly as these surpluses appear, they can disappear. In 1981, \nPresident Ronald Reagan introduced his Economic Recovery Tax Act which \nincluded huge tax cuts and predictions that the budget would be \nbalanced by 1984. In 1981, I opposed the Reagan tax cut because I was \nconvinced that it would lead to huge deficits. We have paid dearly for \nthe debt which resulted from that legislation. In 1992, the deficit in \nthe federal budget was $290 billion. The remarkable progress which has \nbrought us now to the threshold of surpluses has come about in large \npart as a result of the deficit reduction package which President \nClinton presented in 1993, and which this Senate passed by a margin of \none vote, the Vice-President's. We should not now, by passing a tax \nbill like the one before us, head back down the road toward new future \ndeficits.\n  I joined with Senator Hollings in his motion to defer the tax cut, \nbecause it seems clear to me that we should first see if the surplus is \nreal before we adopt tax cuts; second, if those surpluses are real, we \nshould pay down the national debt faster; and third, we should save tax \ncuts for a time of economic slow down.\n  During the consideration of this legislation and the national debate \nwhich has surrounded it, much has been made of the projected reduction \nof the national debt and concurrent reductions in interest payments. \nAlthough the debt held by the public, or the so-called external debt, \nis projected to be paid down by the surpluses accumulated in the Social \nSecurity Trust Funds, interest paid to the Social Security Trust funds \nin the form of bonds will continue to increase for more than a decade. \nAt that time, in approximately 2014, unless Social Security reform has \nbeen accomplished, the Trust Funds will no longer be in surplus, but \ninstead there will be a shortfall in those funds. As the bonds held by \nthe Social Security Trust Funds are redeemed, we will therefore begin \npaying a portion of the interest owed to the Social Security Trust \nFunds, and eventually all of the interest owed to the Social Security \nTrust Funds, in cash. Also, we will then have to redeem the trillions \nof dollars of bonds representing principal owed to the trust funds.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table entitled \n``Interest Payments and Social Security'' based on data which has been \nprovided to me by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) be printed \nin the Record. (See Exhibit 1.)\n  The table shows that through 2035, under current projections, that \nalthough the cash interest payments to the public on external debt go \ndown over the course of the next 15 years or so to zero, the amount of \ninterest that the Treasury will be required to pay to the Social \nSecurity Trust Funds in bonds and eventually in cash rises steadily \nduring that period and beyond. After that, the amount of cash necessary \nto redeem bonds representing principal held by the Social Security \nTrusts Funds kicks in and then rises sharply. The projections show that \nin the year 2025, for example, the Treasury would be required to pay to \nSocial Security $295 billion in interest payments and an additional $35 \nbillion in cash to redeem bonds representing principal held by the \nSocial Security Trust Funds which will then be needed to pay benefits \nto recipients. Ten years later, in the year 2035, the projections show \nthat, in the absence of Social security reform, the Treasury would be \nrequired to pay to Social Security $135 billion in interest payments \nand an additional $576 in cash for bonds representing principal \nredeemed.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1397 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1397.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in a previous edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, my amendment would create a national \nthree-year school choice demonstration for children from economically \ndisadvantaged families and the cost of this is fully paid for by \neliminating unnecessary corporate subsidies for the ethanol, oil, gas, \nand sugar industries.\n  This demonstration would provide educational opportunities for low-\nincome children by providing parents and students the freedom to choose \nthe\n\n[[Page S9896]]\n\nbest school for their unique academic needs, while encouraging schools \nto be creative and responsive to the needs of all students.\n  Each eligible child would receive $2,000 each year for attending any \nschool of their choice--including private or religious schools.\n  In total, the amendment authorizes $5.4 billion for the three-year \nschool choice demonstration program, as well as a GAO evaluation of the \nprogram upon its completion. The cost of this important test of school \nvouchers is fully offset by eliminating more than $5.4 billion in \nunnecessary and inequitable corporate tax loopholes which benefit the \nethanol, sugar, gas and oil industries.\n  These tuition vouchers would help provide over 1 million low-income \nchildren trapped in poor performing schools the same educational \nchoices as children of economic privilege.\n  Providing educational choice to low-income children is an important \nstep in ensuring all our children, not just wealthy children can make \ntheir dreams a reality.\n  We can not afford to continue subsidizing the ethanol, sugar, oil and \ngas industries at a time when we are struggling to save Social Security \nand Medicare, provide much needed and deserved tax relief to American \nfamilies and strengthening our investment in the health, security and \neducation of our children--our future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment on procedural \ngrounds. This is a highly complex subject. It is a subject that I am \nsure will be debated extensively as we consider the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. But in principle also I think it is \ninappropriate to divert these resources to private education when we \nhave so many unmet needs in public education.\n  I believe also that if we adopt the underlying tax bill there will be \neven less resources to devote to public education and it will \nexacerbate the demands that we already must meet with respect to public \neducation.\n  There is a difference between private schools and public schools. \nPrivate schools can exclude children. Public schools must educate every \nchild in America.\n  I believe our obligation and commitment is to public education, and \nthis amendment will defeat that.\n  I also note that the pending amendment is not germane.\n  Therefore, I raise a point of order that the amendment violates \nSection 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the point of order against \namendment No. 1397, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on rollcall No. 238, I voted ``aye''. It \nwas my intention to vote ``no.'' Therefore, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be permitted to change my vote since it would in no way change \nthe outcome of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1383\n\n            (Purpose: To Increase the Federal minimum wage.)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1383.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in a previous edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Republicans continue to deny us the \nopportunity to vote on our bill to raise the minimum wage for the \nlowest paid workers. That is why I have filed the Fair Minimum Wage Act \nof 1999 as an amendment to the Budget Reconciliation Bill.\n  Shame on Congress for giving tax breaks to the rich, but denying a \npay raise for the working poor. The $792 billion Republican tax package \nwill disproportionately benefit the richest Americans. Almost thirty \npercent of the tax breaks, once fully implemented, will go to the \nwealthiest 1 percent of Americans--those who make over $300,000 a year. \nSeventy-five percent of the tax breaks will benefit the wealthiest 20 \npercent of Americans--those with an average income of over $139,000.\n  But these tax breaks do virtually nothing for the lowest paid \nworkers. They give minimum wage earners less than $22 a year in tax \nrelief, compared to an average tax break of $22,964 a year for the \nwealthiest Americans. The Republicans want to give America's wealthiest \n1 percent a tax break that is equal to or higher than what 40 percent \nof Americans earn in a year.\n  The vast magnitude of these tax breaks is possible only because they \ndepend on severe budget cuts in Head Start, Summer Jobs for low-income \nyouth, and HUD housing subsidies for low-income tenants. Shame on \nCongress for ignoring the majority of America's workers to benefit the \nwealthy few.\n  Our amendment is a modest proposal to raise the minimum wage from its \npresent level of $5.15 an hour to $5.65 on September 1, 1999 and to \n$6.15 on September 1, 2000. It will help over 11 million American \nfamilies.\n  At $6.15 an hour, working full-time, a minimum wage worker would earn \n$12,800 a year under this amendment--an increase of over $2,000 a year.\n  That additional $2,000 will pay for seven months of groceries to feed \nthe average family. It will pay the rent for an average family for five \nmonths. It will pay for almost ten months of utilities. It will cover a \nyear and a half of tuition and fees at a two-year college, and provide \ngreater opportunities for those struggling at the minimum wage to \nobtain the skills needed to obtain better jobs.\n  The national economy is the strongest in a generation, with the \nlowest unemployment rate in three decades. Under the leadership of \nPresident Clinton, the country as a whole is enjoying a remarkable \nperiod of growth and\n\n[[Page S9897]]\n\nprosperity. Enterprise and entrepreneurship are flourishing--generating \nunprecedented expansion, with impressive efficiencies and significant \njob creation. The stock market has soared. Inflation is low, and \ninterest rates are low. We are witnessing the strongest peace-time \ngrowth in our history.\n  The sad reality, however, is that low wage workers are being left \nbehind. And the Republican tax bill only widens the gap between the \nwealthy and the working poor. The Republican pension provisions, for \nexample, only benefit high income Americans with extra income to \ncontribute to IRAs and 401(k) plans. Raising the contribution limits on \nthese savings vehicles only discourages companies from offering across-\nthe-board retirement plans that benefit all employees. The Republican \ntax bill also undermines the current tax code rules that require \nretirement benefits to be distributed fairly among lower and higher \npaid workers.\n  Under current law, minimum wage earners can barely make ends meet. \nWorking 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, they earn $10,712--almost \n$3,200 below the poverty line for a family of three. The real value of \nthe minimum wage is now more than $2.00 below what it was in 1968. To \nhave the purchasing power it had in 1968, the minimum wage should today \nbe at least $7.49 an hour, not $5.15. This unconscionable gap shows how \nfar we have fallen short over the past three decades in giving low \nincome workers their fair share of the country's extraordinary \nprosperity.\n  To rub salt in the wound, Congress recently signed off on a cost of \nliving pay increase for every member of the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives. Republican Senators don't blink about giving \nthemselves an increase--how can they possibly deny a fair increase to \nminimum wage workers?\n  It is time to raise the Federal minimum wage. No one who works for a \nliving should have to live in poverty. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin raising the minimum wage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we should not be passing a law on a tax \ncut bill to say it is against the law anywhere in the country to work \nfor $6.10 an hour, that the Federal Government, in its infinite wisdom, \ndecided if you don't have a job that pays at least $6.15 an hour you \nshould be unemployed. That would be a serious mistake.\n  This language in this amendment is not germane to the bill now before \nus. I now raise a point of order under section 305(b)(2) of the \nCongressional Budget Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive all the applicable sections \nof the Act for consideration of the pending amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1386\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a complete substitute)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1386.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1386.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in a previous edition of the Record.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this flat \ntax amendment realistically as a protest against the complicated Tax \nCode which now numbers some 7.5 million words, costs $600 billion in \ncompliance, and takes 5.4 billion hours to comply. This amendment is \nsupported by Senator Lott, Senator Nickles, Senator Craig, and others.\n  In a very shorthand statement, this is a tax return under the flat \ntax. It is a postcard, and it can be filled out in 15 minutes. It \neliminates taxes on capital gains, on estates, and on dividends, all of \nwhich have been taxed before. It is not regressive. There is no tax for \na family of four up to $27,500 in earnings, which is 53 percent of \nAmericans. There is a reduction in tax for $1,000 up to $35,000. It is \neven at $75,000. An affirmative vote will signal a protest to urge the \nFinance Committee and Ways and Means to give serious consideration to \nthis important reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we have not seen a copy of this amendment, \nbut I assume it is the standard flat tax that has been discussed for \nyears. If that is the case, then the net effect of it will be, for most \nincome earners, most American taxpayers, in effect, a tax increase. The \nonly taxpayers with a tax reduction under the standard flat tax \nproposal will be those of adjusted gross incomes of over $200,000, and \nthe tax reduction will be 50 percent. Stated differently, this is a tax \non workers but it is not a tax on investment income, it is not a tax on \nother income, which I think is unfair.\n  In any event, the amendment is not germane. I raise a point of order \nthat it violates section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, under the applicable provision, I move to \nwaive the provision as to germaneness, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. Smith of Oregon, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1416.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in a prior edition of the \nRecord.)\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair. I yield 30 seconds of my time to the \nSenator from Maine when I am completed.\n  This amendment is simple. It is bipartisan, sponsored by the Senator \nfrom Maine, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Bayh of Indiana, and \nmyself. It seeks no political advantage for either side. It helps the \nmiddle class in a vitally needed way, by making college tuition, up to \n$12,000, fully deductible for all those in the 28 percent bracket or \nlower. That is over 90 percent of all Americans. The average middle \nclass person making $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 a year sweats at night \nworrying about paying for the cost of college, which is getting higher \nand higher. I urge support of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator's 30 seconds have \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment. It will dramatically improve access for working American \nfamilies in this country to pursue higher education. The bottom line is \nthat even as the cost of college has quadrupled over the past 20 years, \nin fact, growing nearly to twice the rate of inflation, the value of \nPell grants has actually decreased. Where it used to cover 39 percent \nof the cost of public education, today it is 22 percent. In fact, in \nthe last 5 years alone, the total amount of college loans has soared by \n82 percent, even after adjusted for inflation. I hope that we will help \nAmerican families with this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, Senator Schumer's amendment would provide a \nfull tax deduction for higher education and a tax credit for student \nloans. While I recognize that we need to assist American families with \nthe cost of higher education, I cannot support this amendment. The \ncosts of this amendment are enormous. I understand that it would cost \nsomething like $25 billion over 10 years, but the pay-for would delay \nthe AMT relief that is provided in this bill. That delay would impact \non working Americans, depriving them of the child credit, personal \nexemptions, and, ironically, educational benefits such as the HOPE \nscholarship and lifetime earnings.\n  Mr. President, I regret that I must make a point of order against the \namendment under section 305 of the Budget Act on the grounds it is not \ngermane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader, the minority \nleader, and also Senator Roth, Senator Reid, and Senator Moynihan.\n  We have made very good progress in reducing the number of amendments. \nI think we are down to maybe a few amendments. I know that on this side \nwe are only looking at one or two that would require a rollcall vote. \nWe are trying to make it one or two. We have a few more requests. I \nthink we are making good progress. I know Senator Reid is making good \nprogress.\n  That is for the information of our colleagues.\n  We would also like to keep the rollcall votes to 10 minutes. The last \nrollcall vote went a little extra. We are going to finish this bill \ntoday. It is in everybody's interest to stay on the floor and to have \ntimely rollcall votes.\n  We expect to accept a couple of amendments right now. That will help \nexpedite the process.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1452\n\n  (Purpose: To increase the mandatory spending in the Child Care and \n Development Block Grant by $10,000,000,000 over 10 years in order to \n  assist working families with the costs of child care, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, the child development block grant has \nhelped thousands of families keep jobs by helping offset the enormous \ncosts of child care, which enable them to go to work. In most cases, \nsubsidies are so low that families are forced to use the cheapest and, \nin many cases, the poorest quality child care.\n  There are 66 Senators who voted for the money in the budget for this \npurpose. The kids at the Burlington YMCA are right: We must act now for \nquality child care.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is a very good amendment. Only one in \n10 eligible children is being served.\n\n[[Page S9899]]\n\n  I thank my colleagues, Senators Jeffords, Chafee, Snowe, Collins, \nRoberts, Specter, Stevens, and Domenici. This is a large bipartisan \ngroup that cares about this very much.\n  These are needed resources to get to children who are not being well \nserved. The tax credit is not refundable so it does not reach that low-\nincome category. This child care development block grant does assist \nthese families.\n  For those reasons, we urge adoption of the amendment. I thank the \nleadership for agreeing this be done on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1452) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROBB. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, despite the opportunities we have had in \nthis bill and in the Finance Committee to address the $112 billion \nschool repair needs in this country, this tax bill is simply inadequate \nin terms of infrastructure assistance for our Nation's schools.\n  We know 14 million children attend schools in need of extensive \nrepair or complete replacement. We know we need to build 2,400 new \nschools by 2003 to accommodate record school enrollments. We know we \nneed to equip our schools with modern technology and the infrastructure \nnecessary to support that technology. We know all these things. Yet we \nhave reported a tax bill that only helps build and renovate 200 \nschools. We cannot starve our schools of resources and then criticize \nthem when they are overcrowded or dilapidated.\n  On behalf of Senators Lautenberg, Conrad, Harkin, and Wellstone, I \nmove to recommit the bill to the Committee on Finance, with \ninstructions to report back to the Senate within 3 days with an \namendment reducing or deferring by $5.7 billion over the next 10 years \ncertain new tax rates in the bill that benefit those who least need \nrelief.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I think this procedure would be a serious mistake. We \ndon't want Federal bureaucrats trying to improve school construction \nprograms. I think it would be a serious mistake. We should leave those \ndecisions of which schools to be building and which schools to repair \nto the State and local governments.\n  I move to table the motion, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I call up my motion to recommit on veterans' health \ncare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] moves to \n     recommit the bill, S. 1429, to the Committee on Finance \n     with instructions that the Committee on Finance report the \n     bill to the Senate with provisions which--\n       Establish a reserve account for purposes of providing funds \n     for medical care for veterans;\n       Provide for the deposit in the reserve account of \n     $3,000,000,000 in each of fiscal years 2000 through 2004;\n       Make available amounts in the reserve account in those \n     fiscal years for purposes of medical care for veterans, which \n     amounts shall be in addition to any other amounts available \n     for medical care for veterans in those fiscal years; and\n       Provide that amounts for deposits in the reserve account \n     shall be derived by reductions in the amounts of new tax \n     reductions provided in the bill, wherever possible, for \n     individuals with incomes exceeding $200,000 per year.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I introduce this motion with Senator \nJohnson, Senator Daschle, and Senator Harkin. This motion calls for $3 \nbillion added to veterans' health care. That is consistent with what \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee has said we need to do. That is \nconsistent with the veterans independent budget. That is consistent \nwith the report we did last week on the gaps in veterans' health care, \nand every single Senator voted on the budget resolution for a $3 \nbillion increase for veterans' health care. That is the least we should \ndo to make sure there is high-quality health care for veterans in our \ncountry.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the underlying tax bill calls for \ndomestic spending reductions of anywhere from 24 to 38 percent, closing \ndown VA hospitals from one end of this country to the other. This is \nthe one vote on which my colleagues will have an opportunity to make \nsure there is enough money in the VA system to keep those hospitals \nopen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I agree with my colleagues on the other \nside. Yet the President's budget devastates veterans' health care. The \nflat-line budget proposed by this administration will result in some \n13,000 Veterans Affairs employees being RIF'd or furloughed. It will \nclose down facilities. It will throw people out of the care of the \nveterans facilities.\n  The problem is that this motion does nothing to get money to \nveterans. This body has already gone on record saying we do not want to \nstay at the low level submitted by the President. That is why we are \ngoing to increase by hundreds of millions of dollars in the \nappropriations bill the amount we spend for veterans' health care. We \nare concerned about veterans' health care. That is why we are not going \nto tolerate the unforgivably small budget that the President has \nproposed. This is an attempt to provide appropriations when, in fact, \nit will have no such impact. There is $505 billion set aside in this \nplan for spending on high-priority matters.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order against the amendment under \nsection 305 of the Budget Act on the grounds that it is not germane.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, we have a historic opportunity before \nus. For the first time in my nearly two decades in the Senate, we are \npresented with predictions of a growing surplus. We made the tough \nchoices in 1993 and again in 1997 to bring spending under control, to \nreduce the deficit, and to restore the federal budget to balance.\n  We are at a crossroads now and must decide how to respond to this \nopportunity. Will we invest it wisely and prudently, or will it be \nsquandered? Will we return to the disastrous policies of the 1980's, or \ncan we stay on the path of fiscal discipline? The American public is \ndeeply cynical about government. Now is our chance to prove we can come \ntogether in our national interest.\n  I am deeply concerned about the Republican plan for using this \nsurplus. In my opinion, they are squandering an opportunity we won't \nhave again to extend the solvency of Medicare and Social Security, to \ninvest in key priorities like education, the environment and medical \nresearch, and to pay down our national debt. We shouldn't go off on a \nspending or tax-cutting spree when we have this huge debt to repay.\n  Unfortunately, the Republicans have chosen to focus single-mindedly \non cutting taxes. I believe we should have a tax cut--I would favor tax \nrelief for working families, such as easing the marriage penalty and \nincreasing the per-child credit--but this bill goes much too far. \nInstead, we need to balance the money among several key priorities.\n  There is almost no single policy that is more important to the long-\nterm health of our budget, to the sustainability of the surplus, and to \nour overall economy, than paying off some of our three-and-half \ntrillion dollar national debt. We cannot leave this burden to our \ngrandchildren.\n  With a single voice, economists have told us of the benefits of and \nimportance of paying down that debt. It will lead to lower interest \nrates. It will produce higher surpluses, because we will be paying less \ninterest. And it will be of tremendous benefit to the economy, because \nit will free up private capital for productive investment that makes \nour economy grown, and raise the standard of living for us all.\n  Alan Greenspan himself has said repeatedly that the most important \nthing to do with the surplus is to pay down the debt. He has said it \nover and over and over again. And he's been saying it for quite some \ntime now. Some of my Republican colleagues have seized on another \nstatement he made--saying that if paying down the debt is not \npolitically feasible, then he prefers tax cuts to spending.\n  My colleagues, there is no one here but us. We are in charge. We are \nfree to vote for what's right, and to define what's possible or what's \nnot. We can vote to reduce the debt, or to irresponsibly spend this \none-in-a-lifetime surplus on an excessively large tax cut that would \ndamage our economy and endanger Medicare and Social Security, \neducation, law enforcement, defense--just about any important national \nprogram.\n  Paying off the debt today will also leave us in a much stronger \nposition to afford the cost of the baby boom's retirement. As other \nspeakers have pointed out, the cost of the Republican tax cuts begin to \nrise dramatically just at the same time the pressures on the budget \nbegin to grow as the baby boomers start to retire.\n  But Republicans have rejected our attempts to pay down the debt. They \nclaim they are doing plenty to pay down the debt--and that this is \nenough.\n  They may even talk about a Congressional Budget Office report that \npurports to show how their plan reduces the debt. But that analysis is \nbased on a fiction; the fiction that Republicans will be able to cut \nspending dramatically--by nearly one-fourth. And if defense is funded \nat the level the Administration has requested, other important domestic \nprograms would face cuts of nearly 40 percent. This means less medical \nresearch, dramatic cuts in the number of children participating in Head \nStart, substantial reductions in the number of law enforcement \npersonnel, no new environmental cleanups, closures at national parks. \nThe list goes on.\n  However, as we all know, Democrats and Republicans both, there is \nreally no support for cuts of that magnitude, either in Congress or \namong the public. A story on the front page of the Washington Post on \nJuly 27, 1999 puts the lie to Republican assertions that they will be \nable to cut spending. They can't even pass this year's appropriations \nbills without resorting to smoke-and-mirrors gimmickry to hid the cost \nof their bills.\n  Without those cuts, they need to raid the Social Security trust fund \nto pay for their tax cut. And they will increase, rather than reduce, \nour national debt.\n  The truth is, they want their excessive, risky tax cut so badly that \nthey are willing to put the health of our economy at risk, to endanger \nthe security of retirees, and to short-change important national \npriorities like investments in education, medical research, the \nenvironment and even national defense.\n  Republicans want to spend 97 percent of the available non-Social \nSecurity surplus on tax cuts--tax cuts whose cost explodes in the \nfuture, overheat our economy, and disproportionately favor the rich and \nspecial interests.\n  Democrats have offered reasonable alternatives that balance tax cuts \nwith Medicare solvency, debt reduction and investments in key domestic \npriorities. But these have all been rejected.\n  So I am making this last, very modest attempt to avoid wasting \nsurplus--asking that $100 billion of this excessive tax cut be used \ninstead for paying off more of our national debt. This would leave \nabout 86 percent of the surplus for tax cuts--this is less than 97 \npercent they want to spend, but is still a substantial amount. We could \ndo more to reduce the debt. I would like to do more. But this is a \nstarting point.\n  My motion would instruct the Finance Committee to report the bill \nback in 3 days, with an amendment to reduce the tax cut by $100 \nbillion, and use the savings to pay down more of our national debt. It \nalso instructs the Committee to find the savings by reducing narrowly-\ntargeted special interest tax breaks in the bill, and tax relief that \ndisportionately benefits the wealthy.\n  Last week, just days after Republicans passed their tax bill out of \ncommittee, the Washington Post ran a\n\n[[Page S9901]]\n\nstory detailing the special-interest giveaways in the Republican tax \nbills. These include special breaks for seaplane owners in Alaska, \nbarge lines in Mississippi, and foreign residents who use frequent-\nflyer miles to purchase airline tickets. Since then, we have also \nlearned just how skewed the bill is toward families with the very \nhighest incomes. The top 1 percent of all taxpayers would receive a \nwhopping 30 percent of the tax cuts. Overall, the top one-fifth of \ntaxpayers would receive 75 percent of the tax relief. It seems to me \nthere is plenty of room in this bill to reduce the tax cut by $100 \nbillion for the sake of reducing our national debt.\n  The Republicans have rejected our balanced alternative to a huge, \nimprudent tax cut, and they have rejected our lockbox that would set \naside money for Social Security and Medicare--but can't they even \nreduce their enormous, risky tax cut by $100 billion in order to \nfurther reduce our nation's indebtedness? That's only about 10 percent \nof the available surplus. Only 10 percent for prudence and \nresponsibility, the rest to fulfill their agenda.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. One, I appreciate our colleague's willingness to have a \nvoice vote. I encourage others to have voice votes.\n  For the information of all Senators, I think we are making good \nprogress. We only have a few amendments left, maybe just three or four \nthat require votes.\n  I urge our colleagues, on this particular motion--despite my \ncolleague's very good intentions--to vote no by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was rejected.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a motion to recommit. I will not \nseek a recorded vote on it. My motion to recommit is to recommit the \nbill to the Finance Committee with instructions to report back with an \namendment to reserve sufficient amounts to establish an improved income \nsafety net for family farmers and ranchers in fiscal years 2000 through \n2009 by limiting the bill's new tax breaks for large corporations and \nthose with annual incomes in excess of $300,000.\n  I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. ROTH.

The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I just note, sir, for the Record, there are several \nof us, including the junior Senator from Alaska, who regret that the \nrum cover-over provisions for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are \nnot included in this legislation. We hope to do so at some early future \ndate. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1470, Withdrawn\n\n(Purpose: Providing the Sense of the Senate regarding Capital Gains Tax \n                                 Cuts)\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1470.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1470.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in a previous edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment tries to address what I \nconsider to be one of the shortfalls in the Senate Finance Committee's \ntax bill. This tax bill does not include any provisions to reduce the \ncapital gains tax rate. I believe we need to address the needs of \nAmerica's growing investor class through mutual funds, pension plans, \nIRAs and other investment vehicles about 50 percent of Americans have. \nHalf the Nation's population own stocks and other financial assets.\n  I believe it is time to put to rest once and for all the old class \nwarfare slogan that only the rich pay capital gains taxes. Forty-nine \npercent of the investor class are women, and 38 percent are \nnonprofessional, salaried workers. Wall Street and Main Street are no \nlonger separated. I believe it is time we recognize this fact and help \nnew middle-class investors succeed in their drive to invest and save \nfor the future.\n  I think it is time to cut the tax on mutual funds and pensions for \nworking Americans and, therefore, I have offered this amendment which \nis a sense of the Senate suggesting we should, in the conference that \nwill follow the passage of this legislation, recede to the House \nposition which reduces capital gains tax rates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane. \nAccordingly, I raise a point of order that the amendment violates \nsection 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I respond by saying that it is my \nimpression that we will not have a majority for this amendment. We will \nnot overcome the point of order. So at this time, in light of the time \nconstraints we are operating under today, I withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The distinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1439\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow employers \n    a credit against income tax for information technology training \n   expenses paid or incurred by the employer, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1439.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for himself, \n     Mr. Reid, and Mr. Robb, proposes an amendment numbered 1439.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in a previous edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this amendment, I believe, addresses a \ncritical national need. The Commerce Department tells us we have a \nshortage of information technology workers of 34,000 and that that will \ngrow by 130,000 a year every year for the next 10 years. This amendment \nseeks to deal with that situation by providing for a tax credit of 20 \npercent, up to a limit of $6,000 per worker per year.\n  This means that the Federal Government would be in partnership with \nbusinesses training high-technology workers. The company would have to \nput up 80 percent of the cost, the Federal Government, through a tax \ncredit, 20 percent. This is a reasonable response to a critical \nnational need.\n  This amendment is cosponsored by Senator Reid of Nevada, Senator Robb \nof Virginia, and Senator Abraham of Michigan. It is endorsed by the \nInformation Technology Association of America, the Software Information \nIndustry Association, the American Society for Training and \nDevelopment, Cisco Systems, EDS, Intel, Microsoft, Texas Instruments, \nand many others.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to vote no on this\n\n[[Page S9902]]\n\namendment, both on substance and also on a germaneness point, which I \nwill raise in a moment.\n  The Senator is proposing a $6,000 tax credit if somebody is trained \nas a high-tech employee. We are going to have the Federal Government \nsaying in this one area we want to pay $6,000 for this person to be \ntrained how to run computers.\n  I want people to learn how to run computers. Millions of people are \ndoing it today. They don't need the Federal Government to give them \n$6,000 to do it. What about steelworkers? What about auto workers? What \nabout oil workers? What about factory workers? We don't do it for them. \nWe shouldn't do it for this industry.\n  Also the Senator pays for it by taking away the tax benefits we have \nthat allow people to enhance their retirement income. I think that is a \nserious mistake.\n  I make a point of order against the amendment under section 305 of \nthe Budget Act on the grounds that it is not germane, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I move to waive the Congressional Budget \nAct point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), for himself, and Mr. \n     Kennedy, and Mr. Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1454.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in a previous edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, right now companies are changing pension \nplans. They are going from defined benefit plans to these cash balance \nplans. That is OK. This amendment doesn't stop that. But what is \nhappening now is workers who have worked at these companies for \nsometimes 20 or 25 years have their pensions degraded. There are 5 to \n7, and sometimes as many as 10, years when nothing is put into their \npension plans. The younger workers are getting money paid into their \npensions and the older workers are not.\n  This amendment says that if they change pension plans they can not \ndiscriminate against the older workers, and the companies have to put \ninto the older workers' pension accounts whatever they are putting into \nthe younger workers' pension accounts so that we don't have this kind \nof wear away for 5 or 7 years when older workers are denied their \npension benefits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this amendment.\n  Employer sponsorship of defined benefit pension plans have been \ndeclining over the last few years, mainly due to the increased \nregulatory burden that Congress and the IRS has placed on employers who \noffer these plans to employees.\n  This amendment would also substantially impair the employer's ability \nto design and change their pension plans to meet the changing needs of \nthe business and of the employees. In addition, it would punish good \ncorporate citizens who maintain pension plans while leaving other \ncompanies free to terminate their plans in order to get from under this \nnew law.\n  We have dealt with the concerns that participants do not know or \nunderstand changes to their pension plans with the more expansive \ndisclosure requirements that are contained in this bill.\n  We should focus on revitalizing the defined pension system, rather \nthan adding new burdens on employers who voluntarily establish these \nplans. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order against the amendment under \nsection 305 of the Budget Act on the grounds that it is not germane.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] moves to \n     recommit the bill to the Committee on Finance, with \n     instructions to report back to the Senate within 3 days, with \n     an amendment to reserve $39 billion to provide permanent \n     appropriations to the Pell Grant program in years 2000 \n     through 2009 by reducing or deferring certain new tax breaks \n     in the bill, especially those that disproportionately benefit \n     the wealthy.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, there is a 2-minute time \nlimit, 1 minute to either side; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is limited to 1 minute.\n  If we could have order in the Senate, please, we could expedite \nthings.\n  The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is to try to provide some help and \nadditional assistance to those individuals who are receiving the Pell \ngrants. Those are virtually the lowest-income students. For the over 4 \nmillion students who are receiving Pell grants, their average income is \n$14,000 a year. They are the students who are encumbered to the \ngreatest degree as a result of borrowing. They start out, if they are \nlucky enough to get into college, having these overwhelming debts. This \nwould provide some $39 billion which would increase the Pell grants \nsome $400. It would still only make them about 60 percent of what the \nPell grants were some 20 years ago.\n  As we are looking out after providing tax breaks for those in the \nupper incomes, it does seem to me that to try to give further \nencouragement to able and gifted students at the lower income level \ndeserves support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We are all aware Congress has provided substantial funds \nfor Pell grants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, you would have had to have just come in on \na turnip truck not to realize this Congress is a major funder of Pell \ngrants. We provide substantial funding in Pell grants in guaranteed \nstudent loans. What we have before us is not another assistance \nprogram, not another program that is trying to single out every \ninterest group in America and give them something, but instead we have \na tax bill that is aimed at letting working Americans keep more of what \nthey earn so they can help send their children to college.\n  I hope we might see an amendment such as this withdrawn and not have \nto vote on it.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, the time has been \nused or yielded back. I look forward to a vote on this motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I have a motion at the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] moves to \n     recommit the bill to the Committee on Finance, with \n     instructions to report back within 3 days, with an amendment \n     to reserve sufficient amounts of funding to allow our nation \n     to reach our goal of serving one million children through the \n     Head Start program and to ensure that the number of \n     nutritionally at-risk women and children being served by the \n     Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, \n     and Children will not be reduced in fiscal years 2000 through \n     2009, by limiting the bill's new tax breaks for those with \n     annual incomes in excess of $300,000 and for large \n     businesses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to take just a few seconds \nand then yield to Senator Wellstone the remainder of the 1 minute.\n  This is a motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on Finance \nwith instructions to report back with an amendment to reserve \nsufficient amounts of funding to allow our Nation to reach our goal of \nserving 1 million children through the Head Start Program and to make \nsure we are not diminishing or threatening those who are receiving \nbenefits under the WIC Program.\n  We hope if there is enough opportunity to provide tax cuts for 9 or \n10 years, Members of the Senate will agree that Head Start and WIC also \nought to receive priority.\n  I yield to Senator Wellstone.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is all about whether or not we \nsupport children in our country. It is a terribly important program. We \nwill vote it up or down on a voice vote. On the ag appropriations bill \nwe will have a recorded vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does any Senator wish to speak in opposition?\n  Mr. ROTH. I suggest a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The motion was rejected.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1456\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1456 which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1456.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in a previous edition of the Record.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, this amendment simply eliminates from \nthis bill a special tax cut aimed at foreign technologies for \nconverting poultry waste into electricity. I agree with converting \npoultry waste into something useful, but I disagree with giving a tax \nbreak to foreign corporations when there are U.S. companies capable of \nachieving that end.\n  Two such companies exist in my home State. Agri-Cycle of Springfield, \nMO, processes chicken manure into pollution-free fertilizer pellets. \nThe British company that wants to build the facility here and burn the \nwaste claims they need the tax break because without it, they would not \nbe able to expand here because they are used to large subsidies they \nreceive from the British Government.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does any Senator wish to speak in opposition \nto the amendment?\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The \npoultry provision in the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 meets three \nimportant criteria:\n  First, it facilitates the development and use of alternative fuel to \ngenerate clean electricity--energy that is not only abundant, but \nenvironmentally friendly. Certainly, in this summer of rolling \nbrownouts, we cannot overstate how important this is.\n\n[[Page S9904]]\n\n  Second, the poultry provision in this bill addresses the need to \nsafely and effectively dispose of chicken waste. Poultry production in \nthe United States has tripled since 1975. Along with this growth, comes \nthe waste, and the need to dispose of it.\n  And third, the poultry provision in the bill demonstrates Congress' \nwillingness to help our poultry farmers, while encouraging \ntechnological advances. Providing incentives for facilities that turn \nchicken waste into clean energy is consistent with our objectives.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against this \namendment, and to support the production of clean electricity--\nproduction that will help America meet its energy needs, while helping \nour farmers and protecting our environment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this measure was thoroughly discussed in \nthe Committee on Finance and is well understood on our side. I support \nthe chairman in the existing provision of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition time has expired.\n  Mr. ROTH. I call for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have already been ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1456. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 23, nays 77, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 246 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--23\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Gorton\n     Gregg\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     McCain\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thomas\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--77\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bunning\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1417.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1417.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in a previous edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment eliminates the percentage \ndepletion allowance for minerals mined on Federal public lands. It \napplies only to hard rock minerals and does not touch oil and gas, and \nit preserves the deduction for private lands.\n  The President's fiscal year 2000 budget recommends eliminating this \ntax break. OMB estimates this amendment would raise $478 million over 5 \nyears.\n  We allow companies to mine on public lands for very low patent fees \nalready. We shouldn't continue to provide them with a double subsidy by \npreserving this special tax break for hard rock mining companies which \nordinary businesses do not get.\n  I understand this will be the subject of a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my understanding this will be \ndone by a voice vote. I am going to speak for about 50 seconds and \nyield to my coauthor, Senator Torricelli from New Jersey.\n  Seventy-five percent of stockholders today have household incomes \nless than $75,000. The Coverdell-Torricelli amendment targets middle-\nclass investors by exempting their first $1,000 capital gains from \ntaxation, beginning in fiscal year 2006. This is a bipartisan \namendment, which is also cosponsored by, as I said, Senators \nTorricelli, Domenici, Bayh, and Abraham. It will wipe out the gains tax \nfor millions of middle-class taxpayers and promote tax simplification.\n  I yield the remainder of my minute to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, Senator Bayh and I have joined with \nSenator Coverdell on this amendment. It is simple on its face: to \nencourage people to engage in modest savings, eliminating $1,000 of \ncapital gains tax for modest savers. Seventy-five percent of the people \nwho will be affected by this earn less than $70,000. It is to encourage \nthe culture of savings so people plan for their own retirements and \nsecurity in their own families.\n  The Nation today is in the midst of a savings crisis. I know of no \nbetter way to encourage people to participate in the growth of this \neconomy and investment than giving this simple $1,000 exclusion on \ntheir capital gains.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I call for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1426, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1426) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROTH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. I recognize Senator Snowe for the next amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1468\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1468.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1468.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in a previous edition of the Record.)\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nSchumer as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, essentially this takes a provision that is \nincluded in the amendment that Senator Schumer and I had offered that \naddresses the growing debt burden faced by recent college students.\n  The bottom line is, we all recognize that the cost of college \neducation has quadrupled over the last 20 years, growing at twice the \nrate of inflation. In fact, over the past 5 years, the demand for \ncollege loans has soared by more than 82 percent. Therefore, recent \ngraduates have been forced to assume a greater burden of debt after \nthey graduate from college.\n  My amendment would add a tax credit for interest on student loans for \nthe first 5 years upon graduation so that it would ease the amount of \ndebt that individuals have to assume. It would be a $1,500 tax credit. \nIn fact, this has received the support of the American Council on \nEducation.\n  I will quote from this letter:\n\n       By adding your amendment to the Roth provision, students \n     who are working hard to repay their loans will receive tax \n     relief for the duration of their repayment and benefit from \n     the additional relief of your credit during their first years \n     out of college.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nwhich I just quoted.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    American Council on Education,\n\n\n                                      Office of the President,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 1999.\n     Hon. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: The higher education associations \n     listed below write in support of your amendment to create a \n     tax credit for interest payments on student loans. Your \n     amendment, which would provide a $1,500 tax credit on \n     interest payments for the first 60 months of repayment, is a \n     welcome addition to the provisions already contained in \n     Chairman Roth's bill.\n       We strongly support the provisions that Chairman Roth has \n     included in his bill to expand the existing Student Loan \n     Interest Deduction by eliminating the 60 payment restriction \n     and by modestly increasing the income limits for married \n     couples. We understand that your amendment is fully offset,\n\n[[Page S9906]]\n\n     and will not change any of the underlying education \n     provisions in S. 1429.\n       By adding your amendment to the Roth provisions, students \n     who are working hard to repay their loans will receive tax \n     relief for the duration of their repayment and benefit from \n     the additional relief of your credit during their first years \n     out of college.\n       Thank you for your efforts to lessen the burden on student \n     borrowers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Stanley O.

The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1468.\n  The amendment (No. 1468) was rejected.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I recognize Senator Gregg for the next \namendment.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1375, As Modified\n\n (Purpose: To provide a minimum dependent care credit for stay-at-home \n                    parents, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1375, as modified.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 21, before line 1, insert:\n       (c) Minimum Dependent Care Credit Allowed for Stay-at-Home \n     Parents.--Section 21(e) (relating to special rules) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(11) Minimum credit allowed for stay-at-home parents.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (d), in the \n     case of any taxpayer with 1 or more qualifying individuals \n     described in subsection (b)(1)(A) under the age of 1, such \n     taxpayer shall be deemed to have employment-related expenses \n     for the taxable year with respect to each such qualifying \n     individual in an amount equal to the sum of--\n       ``(i) $200 for each month in such taxable year during which \n     such qualifying individual is under the age of 1, and\n       ``(ii) the amount of employment-related expenses otherwise \n     incurred for such qualifying individual for the taxable year \n     (determined under this section without regard to this \n     paragraph).\n       ``(B) Election to not apply this paragraph.--This paragraph \n     shall not apply with respect to any qualifying individual for \n     any taxable year if the taxpayer elects to not have this \n     paragraph apply to such qualifying individual for such \n     taxable year.''.\n       On page 21, line 1, strike ``(c)'' and insert ``(d)''.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this is the stay-at-home-moms amendment. It \nbasically extends the dependent care tax credit to stay-at-home moms. I \nnote that the Senate voted 96-0 in a sense of the Senate for this \nproposal. It applies to the first year of the child's life and would \napply the dependent care tax credit to that first year, so that mothers \nwho stay at home and raise children are treated the same way as mothers \nwho have to go to work and send their children to day care.\n  I note that it is an amendment that is targeted at middle- and low-\nincome families, with stay-at-home mothers in households with an \naverage $38,000 in income and with two working parents with an average \nincome of about $58,000. It is a proposal the Senate has spoken on \nrelative to the sense of the Senate. Therefore, I hope the Senate \nsupports this proposal.\n  I ask for a voice vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Gregg \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1375) was agreed to.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 1468\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, if I might have the attention of the \nSenate, a moment ago we had a voice vote on the Snowe amendment and \nthere was some question on the outcome. I think the Chair ruled ``no'' \non the Snowe amendment, and I personally think there was a significant \nquestion about that. A lot of people voted in favor of the Snowe \namendment. So I move to reconsider the vote on the Snowe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to reconsidering the vote?\n  Without objection, the vote will be reconsidered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1468 by the Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Snowe.\n  The amendment (No. 1468) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n\n                            Motion To Waive\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, section 202 of S. 1429 makes certain that \nthe marriage penalty relief in the bill also applies to married couples \nreceiving earned-income tax credits. Thus, the provision violates the \nBudget Act because it increases outlays.\n  In order to protect the provision against a point of order, I move to \nwaive any point of order against section 202 in this legislation, a \nsubsequent conference report, or in an amendment between the Houses if \nsuch point of order is made on the grounds that the enhancement of the \nearned-income tax credit for married couples is an increase in outlays.\n  I call for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Delaware.\n  In the opinion of the Chair, three-fifths of the Senators duly sworn \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding \nthe passage of the reconciliation bill, the managers of the bill have \nthe authority, in conjunction with the Secretary of the Senate, to make \nfurther changes to the bill.\n  I further ask consent that the changes just described must be cleared \nby both managers and the authority extend until 5 p.m. on Friday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendments Agreed To, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I send a series of amendments to the desk \nand ask unanimous consent that these amendments be considered agreed to \nen bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to these amendments appear at this point in the \nRecord. I indicate to my colleagues that these amendments have been \ncleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code \nwas enacted by Congress in 1958 and has been liberalized a number of \ntimes over the last two decades, significantly in 1982 and again in \n1996.\n  This reflects a desire on the part of Congress to reduce taxes on \nsmall businesses. Subchapter S eliminates the double taxation of small \nbusiness income.\n  Under Subchapter S the business is taxed at the shareholder level \nalone, it is not taxed at the corporate level. Subchapter S is \navailable only to small businesses that have a small number of \nshareholders.\n  Congress made small banks eligible for S corporation status in the \n1996 ``Small Business Job Protection Act.''\n  Since first becoming eligible, nearly 1,000 small banks have \nconverted from regular corporations to small business corporations.\n  Unfortunately, many more would like to convert, but are prevented \nfrom doing so by a number of remaining obstacles in the tax law.\n  My amendment builds on and clarifies the Subchapter S provisions from \n1996. It contains several provisions of particular benefit to community \nbanks that may be contemplating a conversion to Subchapter S.\n  The amendment is based on S. 875, legislation that I introduced \nearlier this year with the cosponsorship of Senators Gramm, Bennett, \nShelby, Abraham, Hagel, Enzi, Mack, Grams, Inhofe, Brownback, and \nThomas.\n  I have selected several provisions from the bill for this amendment \nand the Finance Committee has agreed to accept them. Let me review \nthese provisions:\n  First, we exclude investment securities income from the passive \nincome test for banks. Banks are unique, they are required to hold \npassive investments such as federal bonds and municipal bonds in order \nto comply with safety and soundness regulations.\n  This provision is only fair. If we require certain investments by \nregulation, we should not use this requirement to prohibit banks from \nbecoming Subchapter S small businesses.\n  Second, we permit Subchapter S small business corporations to have \nbank director stock. Again, regulations require banks to have bank \ndirector stock.\n  We clarify that this does not punish banks. They can still become \nsmall business corporations.\n  In addition, I will be working with Chairman Roth and his staff on \nseveral other provisions to consider for the future. These include one \nto permit Individual Retirement Accounts to be shareholders in an S \ncorporation. This provision is a recognition of the importance of IRAs.\n  We have found that many community bank owners have their shares in an \nIRA. There is nothing wrong with this. We should let them be \nshareholders.\n  In addition, we hope in the future to permit S corporations to issue \npreferred stock. This would give all small businesses that are S \ncorporations access to investment capital.\n  Let me conclude with a general statement on why we should enact these \nchanges. Last year we enacted broad legislation to support credit \nunions. I supported this legislation.\n  We should now give small banks some tax relief. They are in a tough \ncompetitive position.\n  We are about to approve financial modernization in this Congress. I \nam a member of the Conference on this important legislation. I support \nthe legislation.\n  But I think it is right to note that this legislation is of greatest \nappeal to larger financial institutions.\n  Again, our small community banks need help. They need tax relief to \nhelp them compete and survive. This amendment give the small banks tax \nrelief.\n  This amendment is supported by the Independent Community Bankers of \nAmerica, the American Bankers Association, the Independent Bankers of \nColorado, the Colorado Bankers Association, the Independent Bankers \nAssociation of Texas, and others.\n  I am pleased that the Finance Committee has accepted the passive \nincome and director stock provisions of the amendment.\n  In addition, Senator Roth  and his staff have agreed to work with us \non the remaining provisions of the amendment and S. 875.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1403\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my amendment mirrors a bill I introduced \non an earlier occasion-S. 1410.\n  This amendment would equate the tax treatment of persons flying what \nwould otherwise be empty seats on private noncommercial aircraft with \nthe treatment of airline employees flying on space available basis on \nregularly scheduled flights. Currently, use of these empty seats is \ndeemed taxable personal income to the employee. I refer to it as the \nempty-seat tax. In contrast, under current law, airline employees, \nretirees and their parents and children can fly tax-free on scheduled \ncommercial flights for nonbusiness reasons. Military personnel and \ntheir families can hop military flights for nonbusiness reasons without \nthe imposition of tax. Current and former employees of airborne freight \nor cargo haulers, together with their parents and children, can fly \ntax-free for nonbusiness reasons on seats that would have otherwise \nbeen empty.\n  Employers who own or lease these aircraft are compelled by IRS \nregulations to consider 13 separate factors or\n\n[[Page S9909]]\n\nsteps in determining the incidence and amount of tax to be imposed on \ntheir employees. My proposal seeks to deal with this inequity by \ntreating all passengers the same way, but includes a provision which \nretains a reasonable standard of proof at audit to prevent abuse.\n  This amendment would not allow an executive to use a company jet to \nfly with his family and friends on vacation. My amendment would require \nproof to be shown that the flight was made in the ordinary course of \nbusiness, the flight would have been made whether or not the person was \ntransported on the flight, and no substantial additional cost was \nincurred in providing the transportation for the passenger.\n  In addition to the facilitation of employee travel, this provision is \nan especially important issue to large States with smaller populations \nbecause air travel comprises such a large part of our transportation \nsystems. Instead of driving a car from city to city, many people from \nrural areas get on a plane to travel within their States. There are no \nroads from Barrow to Nome or Anchorage to Cold Bay. Additionally, in \nthe event of illness, many people in rural States must take an empty \nseat on a company owned airplane and incur a tax penalty because they \nneed medical treatment that can only be found in larger cities. My \namendment includes a provision to allow passengers to be treated as \nemployees if they live in remote areas that are not connected to a road \nsystem. For cases of medical emergency or other time sensitive \nsituations, a passenger could as if they were an employee of the \noperator of the non-commercial aircraft without being taxes on the \nvalue of the seat.\n  This is a modest proposal with small revenue impacts. The joint \nCommittee on Taxation estimates the revenue impact for this provision \nwould be approximately five million dollars per year over the next ten \nyear period. While this is a small amount against the backdrop of the \noverall tax cut measure we are considering, it is a large amount to the \npeople who are forced to pay the tax simply because they do not work \nfor or are not related to an employee of an airline, the military, a \ncargo freight company, or because they live in remote areas without \nroad access. Flights are often, at best, biweekly to some rural \nvillages in my State and during the long periods when no flights are \nscheduled, transportation out of these remote areas in emergency \nsituations requires chartering an aircraft.\n  We should keep in mind that we are currently debating a tax refund \nbill that seeks to level the playing field for the American taxpayers. \nThe tax refund bill would remove the marriage penalty that discriminate \nagainst married couples. It addresses inequities in pension plans that \ndiscriminate against certain workers. Yet, the Tax Refund Act does not \naddress the tax discrimination against the users of empty seats who \nlive or do business in rural areas.\n  It is my hope that we can address this basic issue of tax fairness \nand complexity by eliminating the empty seat tax.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1460\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the proposed Taxpayers Refund Act of 1999 \nincludes a provision to create farm and ranch risk management (FARRM) \naccounts to help farmers and ranchers through down times. The estimated \ncost for this provision is $887 million over the next ten years. The \nFARRM accounts would be used to let farmers and ranchers set aside up \nto 20 percent of their income on a tax deferred basis. The money could \nbe held for up to five years, then it would have to be withdrawn from \nthe individual's account. Once the money is withdrawn from the account, \nthe farmers and ranchers would pay tax on the amount that was \noriginally deferred. Any interest earned on the money in the account \nwould be taxed in the year that it was earned.\n  This approach to encouraging farmers and ranchers to set some money \naside for downturns in the market makes sense. However, this provision \nshould be expanded to include fishermen--I have an amendment that would \ndo just that. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates allowing \nfishermen to set aside 20 percent of their income into these tax \ndeferred accounts would cost only an additional $18 million over 10 \nyears.\n  Fishermen are the farmers of the sea. They face the same type of \neconomic problems that farmers and ranchers face and they shouldn't be \nexcluded from establishing their own tax deferred accounts. In previous \nyears we have had to bail out fishing areas that have been hit hard by \nfishery failures. A recent fishery failure in Alaska, and the impact of \nthat failure on families and communities, is still being felt today. We \nwere forced to allocate $50 million to bail out those fishermen and the \nlocal communities. This amendment, at a cost of $18 million over ten \nyears, is a far-sighted way to let fishermen play a part in a disaster \nrecovery and preserve the proud self-reliance that marks their \nindustry.\n  Fishermen should receive the same benefits as farmers and ranchers \nunder the Tax Code. They share seasonal cyclical harvest levels and \nshould not be left behind in the Tax Code. While this amendment is one \nstep toward equal treatment, it is an important part of ensuring the \nlong-term sustainability of our fishing industry. I thank my colleagues \nwho have joined me on this amendment, Senators Murkowski, Inouye, \nShelby, Breaux, Hollings, Gorton, and Murray.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1488\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the proposed Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 \ncontains a provision to coordinate a farmer's income averaging with the \nalternative minimum tax (AMT). This would ensure that a farmer's AMT is \nnot increased solely because he or she elects income averaging.\n  Under section 604 of the Finance Committee's bill, a farmer electing \nto average his or her farm income would owe AMT only to the extent he \nor she would have owned alternative minimum tax had averaging not been \nelected. I have offered an amendment that would extend the income \naveraging to fishermen and would coordinate the tax treatment with the \nAMT, just as the bill attempts to do for farmers.\n  Fishermen should receive the same treatment as farmers. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation estimates the measure for farmers would cost $22 \nmillion over the next ten years. According to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, my amendment for fishermen would cost $5 million over the \nnext ten years. This is a small amount to ensure that fishermen receive \nthe same benefits as farmers under our current tax structure.\n  Fishermen face the same type of economic ups and downs that farmers \nand ranchers face. Because of this, they shouldn't be excluded from \nincome averaging or coordination with the AMT. I thank my colleagues \nwho have joined me on this amendment, Senators Murkowski, Inouye, \nShelby, Breaux, Hollings, Gorton, and Murray.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 1485, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 1485, which was previously adopted, be modified with the changes \nthat are at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my motion to recommit is the substitute \ntax plan submitted by Majority Leader Lott in the Finance Committee. I \nwill not request a vote on this motion.\n  I commend the efforts of Chairman Roth in putting together the \nTaxpayer Refund Act. However, it is my belief that Congress right now \nhas a unique opportunity to enact broad-based tax cuts, providing more \npro-growth and pro-family relief than is currently provided in the \nFinance Committee bill.\n  This substitute combines the elements I believe are essential to \npreserving economic security for years to come: It preserves Social \nSecurity and Medicare; It reduces the near-record tax burden currently \nplaced on the American people; and It empowers America's growing \ninvestor class--working, middle class families who strive to save for \nthe future so that they may enjoy secure retirements and so that they \ncan bequeath a legacy to their children.\n  All this, Mr. President, without greatly increasing the complexity of \nthe tax code.\n  Over the next 10 years the federal government will accumulate \nsurpluses of about $3 trillion. Now that the age of surpluses has \narrived, we must decide what to do with them, how we can best use them \nto insure economic growth and security into the next millennium.\n  Thus, of the $3 trillion in coming surpluses, the $1.8 trillion for \nthe Social Security Trust Funds must be protected; it must stay in \nSocial Security. The question is, what should we do with the remaining \n$1 trillion?\n  I believe that we should give at least $800 billion back to the \nAmerican people. Whatever plan we adopt, it seems to me we must ensure \nthat Social Security remains strong so that the senior citizens of \ntoday and tomorrow may depend on it for security in their old age. We \nalso must approach our national debt in a responsible way seeing to it \nthat it never again becomes a drain on our economy. And, also for the \nsake of our economy, we must see to it that investments in plant, \nequipment and human capital increase over the coming decades. Finally, \nwe must address a worsening problem in American life: the overtaxation \nof the American people.\n  The President's plan addresses none of these needs. It does nothing \nto save Social Security, instead merely commencing a vast shell game \nwith taxpayer money. What is more, the President proposes massive new \nspending, and even $95 billion in new taxes.\n  The bottom line is this, Mr. President Clinton wants to spend the \nsurplus. According to the CBO, the President proposes $1 trillion in \nnew spending over the next 10 years. That would mean taking $29 billion \nout of the Social Security Trust Fund surplus.\n  Now I know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nbeen quoting from Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's recent \nCongressional testimony. In that testimony, Chairman Greenspan said \n``My first priority, if I were given such a priority, is to let the \nsurpluses run.''\n  Some of my colleagues have been claiming that, in these words, \nChairman Greenspan has rejected tax relief for the American people. But \nthis is simply not so, Mr. President. Any reasonable examination of the \nrecord would show Chairman Greenspan's true views on the matter, namely \nthat he would delay tax cuts ``unless, as I've indicated many times, it \nappears that the surplus is going to become a lightening rod for major \nincreases in outlays. That's the worst of all possible worlds, from a \nfiscal policy point of view, and that, under all conditions, should be \navoided.''\n  Chairman Greenspan was not saying ``I oppose tax cuts.'' Rather, he \nwas saying, quite reasonably in my view, that tax cuts must not come at \nthe expense of fiscal and monetary stability.\n  I agree with Chairman Greenspan that tax cuts cannot be our first \npriority. Our first priority must be to protect Social Security and \naddress the national debt. Which is exactly what this substitute does \nby setting aside more than half our projected surpluses for those \npurposes.\n  At the same time, we cannot allow these surpluses to become \n``lightning rods'' for yet more increases in the size and scope of \ngovernment, and in the tax burden on the American people. And that is \nprecisely what the President's plan would do; it would spend the \nsurplus, including the Social Security surplus, on further government \nprograms, leaving nothing for the American people.\n  That is simply wrong. And I was pleased to learn that Chairman \nGreenspan agrees. In his testimony he said ``I have great sympathy for \nthose who wish to cut taxes now to pre-empt that [spending] process, \nand indeed, if it turns out that they are right, then I would say \nmoving on the tax front makes a good deal of sense to me.''\n  It makes a great deal of sense, Mr. President, for us to set aside \nthe bulk of the surplus for Social Security and debt relief, then to \nreturn the rest to the American people. It makes a great deal of sense \nfor us, after reserving over $2 trillion for these essential functions \nto return $800 billion to the American people, as a refund of their tax \noverpayment.\n  I believe we are doing the right thing by giving 25 cents back to the \nAmerican people for every surplus dollar. I believe the plan crafted by \nthose on the other side of the aisle is wrong to give back only 10 \ncents on each surplus dollar.\n  Let me briefly outline the provisions of this substitute, crafted as \nI said by majority Leader Lott. It includes:\n  Broad-based rate cuts, expanding the 15% tax bracket upwards by \n$10,000.\n  Family tax relief, including an end to the marriage penalty and \nprovisions for child care and foster care.\n  An end to the estate or death tax.\n  Incentives for savings and investments, including exclusions for \ninterest and dividend income and a cut in individual capital gains \nrates to 15% and 7.5%.\n  Retirement savings incentives through an increase in the IRA \ncontribution limit to $5,000 per year.\n  Education incentives, including education savings accounts, student \nloan interest deductions and prepaid tuition plans for public and \nprivate schools.\n  Provisions making health care more affordable, including a new \ndeduction for health insurance expenses, long-term care provisions, \nMedical Savings Accounts, and an additional caretaker dependency \ndeduction.\n  Small business tax relief, including immediate 100% deductibility of \nhealth insurance for the self-employed and in increase in small \nbusiness expensing to $30,000.\n  Risk management accounts for farmers and ranchers.\n\n[[Page S9911]]\n\n  Permanent extension of the Research and Development tax credit, and\n  An extension of the work opportunity credit and welfare to work \ncredit.\n  I would like to focus on the provisions in this substitute that I \nbelieve differentiate it from the Finance Committee legislation; \nprovisions that in my view provide even more pro-family and pro-growth \ntax relief where it is most needed.\n  First is family tax relief. Families today pay a higher proportion of \ntheir incomes in taxes than ever before in our history--31.7 percent. \nThey pay more in income taxes than at any time since World War II. They \nspend more on taxes than on food, clothing and shelter combined. And \nthis tax burden leaves families with less money to spend on \nnecessities, and less to save for their retirement and for their \nchildren's education.\n  Families deserve tax relief, particularly at a time when they are \noverpaying to the tune of over a trillion dollars.\n  This substitute will give families the substantive tax break they \nneed and deserve.\n  First, it includes broad-based tax relief by increasing the amount of \nincome a family can earn while remaining in the 15% income tax bracket \nby $10,000. The figure for single taxpayers will increase by $5,000. In \nthis way, Mr. President, we will return 7 million taxpayers to the \nlower, 15% tax bracket, and 35 million taxpayers will receive a tax \ncut.\n  Under this proposal, even a single filer would save $550 on his or \nher taxes.\n  In addition, this substitute ends the marriage penalty and provides \nrelief for child and foster care services.\n  Taken together, these provisions will directly reduce the tax rate \nimposed on American families and increase incentives for work and \neconomic growth.\n  Second, this substitute will provide tax relief to literally millions \nof working Americans struggling to build a nest egg for the future. By \ncutting taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains.\n  This latest era of economic growth has been unique, Mr. President, in \nthat it has seen savings rates fall into negative numbers--indicating \nan increase in consumer borrowing in excess of savings. We cannot \nsustain economic growth and job creation unless Americans save and \ninvest for the future.\n  That is why this substitute will address the needs of America's \ngrowing ``investor class.'' These working Americans--125 million and \ncounting--are the real owners of the means of production in America.\n  Surveys conducted by a number of sources agree that, through pension \nplans, IRAs and other investment vehicles, roughly 50% of Americans--\nhalf our nation--owns stocks. They outnumber any of the special \ninterest groups you would care to name. Yet they want no special \nfavors, just the opportunity to save and invest. And, with $4.5 \ntrillion invested in mutual funds alone, America's investor class has \nbecome the bedrock of our economy.\n  It is time to put to rest once and for all the old class warfare \nslogan that only the rich pay capital gains taxes. Is half of America \n``rich?'' Do half our people earn so much money that they do not \ndeserve a tax relief?\n  I think not. Indeed, 49% of the investor class if female, 38% are \nnon-professional salaried workers. Wall Street and Main Street are no \nlonger separated by a vast socioeconomic divide. It is high time we \nrecognized this fact, and helped new, middle class investors succeed in \ntheir drive to invest for the future.\n  This substitute would do precisely that, Mr. President. It would make \nthe first $500 of interest and/or dividend income tax-free for \nfamilies, with the first $250 of this income becoming tax-free for \nindividuals. It also would increase the IRA contribution limit to \n$5,000 per year, allowing Americans to more effectively save for \nretirement. Finally, it would cut capital gains tax rates, reducing the \ncurrent 20 and 10% tax brackets to 15 and 7.5%, respectively.\n  Of course, not all of nation's economic growth comes from stock \ninvestment. Many entrepreneurs in this country invest their blood, \ntears, toil and sweat into family owned businesses--businesses that \nkeep our main streets vital and our economy growing.\n  Our nation was built on the strength of family-owned businesses. \nWhether on the frontier or in more settled urban areas, family \nbusinesses have delivered the goods for generations. Yet the federal \ngovernment sets up almost insurmountable obstacles to family \nbusinesses.\n  The death tax makes it impossible for many entrepreneurs to pass the \nbusiness on to their children. Too often today, children must sell the \nfamily business just to pay taxes. And the result is often a sell-off \nof assets to large corporations, destroying jobs and investment \nopportunities.\n  I realize that some people favor the death tax as a means of \npunishing people who have amassed great quantities of wealth. But the \nIRS' own records show that fully 80% of all taxable estates are worth \nless than $1 million.\n  $1 million still sounds like a lot of money, Mr. President. But \nconsider this: according to the Associated General Contractors of \nAmerica, any contractor who purchases the three pieces of equipment \nessential to this trade, an off-highway dump truck, bulldozer and \nfront-end loader, will have already amassed assets valued at over $1 \nmillion.\n  And relatively new businesses, such as those begun by black Americans \nuntil recent years deprived of the chance to compete, are especially \nvulnerable to the death tax. A Kennesaw State College survey found that \nclose to a third of African American-owned businesses would have to be \nsold by their inheriting heirs to pay taxes. The death tax destroys \nfamily businesses. It destroys wealth, and it destroys jobs. It is time \nto end it.\n  But entrepreneurs need more help from us. Current tax laws, by \nsubsidizing employer-purchased health plans, penalize small business \nowners. They make it more difficult for them to afford their own health \ninsurance and to attract and keep good employees without spending \nthemselves into bankruptcy.\n  The substitute framed by Leader Lott would address these barriers to \nfamily-owned business survival by accelerating the 100% deductibility \nof self-employed health insurance.\n  The provisions I have outlined aim to bring substantive tax relief to \nthe mainstream of the American economy. This is crucial to the economic \nwell-being of our nation.\n  But we must do more. We also must bring greater economic opportunity \nto disadvantaged urban and rural areas throughout the United States. If \nwe are to remain prosperous over the long term, we must bring more \nAmericans into the vast mainstream of our economy by empowering them to \ntake control of their own economic lives. That is why this substitute \nextends the critical work opportunity credit and welfare-to-work \ncredits through 2004.\n  Finally, we must continue to encourage the research and development \nso crucial to maintaining our competitive edge in global markets, \nparticularly in this era of high-tech development. That is why this \nsubstitute provides for the permanent extension of the R tax credit.\n  All told, the provisions making up this substitute will provide $800 \nbillion in tax relief for the American people. This substitute will \nencourage work, savings and investment, it will help working families, \nit will help distressed urban and rural areas, and it will provide $2.2 \ntrillion for Social Security, Medicare, and debt reduction.\n  It is my hope that the conference committee on the tax bill will \nproduce an agreement that mirrors the Leader's substitute tax plan.\n  I believe we must look to this era of budget surpluses with \nconfidence. Confidence in ourselves and confidence in the American \npeople. This is no time for business as usual. Rather, we are faced \nwith once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to free Americans from the burden \nof stifling overtaxation, freeing their energies and their intellects \neven as we provide a solid grounding of Social Security and Medicare \nfor generations to come.\n  There are voices of doom abroad in the land, Mr President. But these \nvoices are as wrong today as they have always been. They would have us \nput all of our faith and confidence in an ever-growing federal \ngovernment, with its ever-growing financial resources diverted by its \nbureaucratic experts into\n\n[[Page S9912]]\n\nprograms designed to protect us from ourselves.\n  I say no to these doomsayers. I say ``no'' to them because I believe \nit is important for us to say ``yes' to the American people. Yes to \ntheir dreams of financial security, yes to their desire to pass the \nfamily business on to their children, yes to their cries for help \nrelieving the highest tax burden since World War II.\n  It is time to provide the kind of broad-based tax relief in this \nsubstitute so that the American economy and the American spirit may \ngrow and prosper. This act of hope will protect our seniors, pay down \nour debt and constitute an investment in our future that will pay \ndividends for decades to come.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Rockefeller in \nproposing a prudent, fiscally responsible tax cut alternative.\n  Like many, we are skeptical with the underlying assumption that there \nwill be nearly a trillion dollar surplus. Indeed, the numbers show that \nmuch of the surplus is generated under the assumption that Congress \nwill significantly slash investments in education, veterans, and \ndefense below the level needed to keep pace with inflation. Such cuts \nin key investments are not what the American people want. Moreover, the \ncurrent majority has already exceeded last year's spending limit by $35 \nbillion in the first 10 months of this fiscal year.\n  The real surplus from our current economic growth is closer to $112 \nbillion when one eliminates the unrealistic, rosy scenarios painted by \nthe Republican's $800 billion tax bill.\n  Mr. President, our great economic growth has presented us with an \nopportunity to do many things. Sensible, modest, and targeted tax cuts \nfor working families is part of that mix along with domestic \ninvestments and Medicare reform.\n  In that spirit of balancing priorities, I supported the proposal of \nSen. Moynihan to provide $290 billion in targeted tax relief, while \nextending the life of Medicare and preserving funding for our most \npressing domestic needs. That proposal was realistic and based on sound \nfootings.\n  But, we should not enact an $800 billion tax cut based on mere \nprojections; which slashes domestic investments; and which does nothing \nto preserve Medicare.\n  Our $112 billion tax cut proposal is tied to a realistic review of \nthe actual unencumbered surplus. This is the judgement of many outside \nexperts including former Congressional Budget Office Director Robert \nReischauer. Using this figure we can still provide marriage penalty \nrelief, education tax credits, preserve Medicare, and meet the \nexpectations of America's families. That is why Senators Rockefeller, \nLeahy, and I have put forth this proposal.\n  Mr. President, my hope is that our colleagues on the side of the \naisle will take a moment to review the real surplus numbers and join us \nin our effort.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose S. 1429. Passing \nthis bill is like going on a spending spree just because a sweepstakes \ncompany tells you ``you might be a winner.''\n  I support tax cuts. The question for me is, when? I am a fiscal \nconservative and am happy to vote for tax cuts. Any tax cut, however, \nneeds to be done in a fiscally-responsible manner. This is common \nsense.\n  But we need to look at the big picture, and we can't engage in \nwishful thinking. So when we talk about cutting taxes we must do it in \nthe same breath as paying down the national debt and dealing with \nSocial Security and Medicare.\n  We should cut government spending. Working Americans pay taxes to the \nfederal government, and that money buys a lot of great things. But we \nhave a responsibility and obligation to only spend what is absolutely \nnecessary, and I am afraid that we haven't done a very good job of \nthat. The federal government is too big and spends too much, and we \nneed to do something about it.\n  We should pay down the public debt. If we reduce our public debt, we \nreduce the money the federal government owes to foreign investors and \nother bondholders. If we reduce our public debt--a debt that has \naccumulated because of out-of-control government spending in years \npast--it will lower interest rates, increase investment in America's \neconomy, and help ensure our economy's continued growth and success. \nThat has real benefits for average Americans: lower mortgage interest \nrates and a booming economy.\n  This isn't inside-the-Beltway stuff. This is important to North \nCarolinians and all other Americans. And I think all of them can relate \nto why it is unwise to cut taxes before we are certain there is a \nsurplus and before we are on the road to securing the future of Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  Look into your crystal ball. How much will you be earning in the year \n2008? Will your 10-year-old be going to Duke or UNC, and what will be \nthe tuition? What are you going to pay for health insurance during the \nnext 10 years? And how much can you put away for retirement?\n  I think these questions are important to North Carolinians and all \nother Americans. I have been thinking about how a family might try to \nanswer these questions, and two things come to mind.\n  First, answers are extremely difficult to find with any degree of \ncertainty. Unforseen expenses can arise. And other factors--career \nchanges, interest rates, or family size--may also affect the answers. \nIt seems to me very likely, given this uncertainty, that a family would \nbe very cautious about their financial planning.\n  Second, if that family had to make a decision now about which one of \nthose items they would forego if they needed extra money to cover \nunforseen expenses, which one would it be?\n  If making these projections for a family is difficult, what can be \nsaid about the difficulty of predicting the federal government's budget \n10 years?\n  I'll tell you what I think about it. I think it is extremely \ndifficult. And I am not alone.\n  I had an exchange the day before yesterday with Federal Reserve Board \nChairman Alan Greenspan during a hearing. I talked to him about his \nearlier comments about the surplus, the proposed tax cuts and about the \nproblems the federal government has showing restraint.\n  Mr. Greenspan noted that these projections are rarely accurate.\n  His advice, then, is very simple and practical: wait. ``Several \nyears,'' he said. ``In other words, one year, two years.'' Chairman \nGreenspan said he favors paying down the public debt--not using any \nsurplus for increasing government spending.\n  It is hard to wait. This has been a real struggle. I break with the \nPresident, with my party and with the Republican party. But I do so \nbecause first and foremost we should not imperil our unprecedented \neconomic prosperity by moving too quickly. To put it simply: look \nbefore you leap. A huge tax cut today is like entering the biggest \nwatermelon contest the day after an especially good-looking vine \nsprouts up.\n  I, myself, just don't have that much confidence that we have a \nsurplus at all or that the economic assumptions underlying the surplus \nprojections are reliable. It feels like smoke and mirrors--hocus pocus. \nAnd when people waive around numbers like $1 trillion, it's hard not to \nget swept away.\n  But if we step back and take a look at the facts, we get a more \nfrightening picture. If government spending is 1 percent higher than \nprojected and revenues are 1 percent lower than projected, then the so-\ncalled $1 trillion surplus would be off by $170 billion annually.\n  When it comes to government spending, the truth is Congress has not \nbeen able to live within its budgets. Federal spending should be cut, \nbut let's not be naive: Congress has bad spending habits.\n\n  Current projections are based on assumptions about our spending \nhabits that everyone admits have been impossible to live with. This is \na fact. I want to remind everyone that this body passed a $12 billion \n``emergency'' spending package--raiding the Social Security Trust \nFund--earlier this year. I voted against that package because nearly \nhalf of it was spending that no honest person would consider an \n``emergency.'' We've also been pouring money into defense spending--\nsomething I support--but it's not within the budget we tried to set for \nthe government. We can't stick to our limits now, and yet we are \ntalking about a tax cut\n\n[[Page S9913]]\n\nbased on the assumption that we are going to spend less. This just \ndoesn't make sense to me.\n  Having noted that we never stay within the spending caps, let me say \nthat we should not give up on them. They are important. And, despite \nour history of breaking them, they have acted to keep our spending \nlower than it would have been otherwise. This is important because we \nneed to make sure that the federal government doesn't just spend money \nbecause taxpayers send it to us. We need to constantly look for ways to \ncut unnecessary spending and pressure the federal government to operate \nmore efficiently.\n  Even as we propose to dramatically cut taxes based on the fantasy \nthat we will control spending and enjoy unprecedented economic \nprosperity, we are hiding our head in the sand about a very real and \nvery near fiscal catastrophe. In 2012, we will need to pay more for \nMedicare than we have. We'll need to dip into a Medicare trust fund. \nBut there is no Medicare trust fund. In 2014, Social Security benefits \npaid out will exceed receipts, and we will have to start dipping into \nthe trust fund. This tax cut puts the cart before the horse. Cut taxes \nand then try to figure out how to deal with a looming crisis? No one \ncould call that fiscally responsible.\n  What if there's a real emergency? This bill leaves me worried. \nSuppose a Class 5 hurricane were to strike North Carolina sometime in \nthe next few years. If we needed emergency relief, this proposal could \nleave us high and dry--or taking a dip into Social Security.\n  North Carolinians might be excused for thinking that the current tax \ndebate sounds like hocus pocus. And they might be excused for wondering \nwhether people are making promises they can't keep. This government has \nmade a great many promises:\n  Putting more money in your pocket;\n  Saving Social Security;\n  Reserving money for Medicare;\n  Improving Veterans' health care;\n  Funding for the National Institute of Health;\n  Putting 100,000 cops on the street;\n  Aiding America's farmers;\n  Funding for programs like Head Start;\n  Maintaining interstate highways; and\n  Supporting National Missile Defense and other spending to ensure a \nstrong national defense.\n  I don't think we can keep all of these promises. And I can't bring \nmyself to bait the American public with a tax cut only to be forced to \ncut their legs off on Social Security, Medicare and debt reduction or \nraise taxes again.\n  If not now, when?\n  I heard this question asked earlier today about tax cuts. My answer \nis the same as the one Chairman Greenspan gave at the hearing \nyesterday--he said wait a few years.\n  After a few years we may know a few things.\n  First, are we keeping spending reasonably under control?\n  Second, have we saved Social Security and reformed Medicare?\n  Third, how's the economy doing?\n  Fourth, have we paid down some of our national debt?\n  Our first real test will come this fall--when we will again start the \nprocess that will lead to meeting--or breaking--the spending caps. The \nfederal government needs to prove to the American public that it can \noperate under its own budgetary limits. If we can do this, if we can \nbreak the habit of busting the budget caps, we will then be able to \ntell if we do in fact have a surplus.\n  I want the American people to know this: I am for cutting taxes paid \nby working Americans. We've got an amazingly successful economy right \nnow. I want to make sure when I cast my vote that I'm voting for \nsomething that will ensure, not destroy, the continued growth of our \neconomy. Right now, the projections are too speculative, the \nassumptions too unrealistic, and to me, the solution is obvious. We \nshould not spend money until we know we have it--and when we do have \nit, we need to give it back to working Americans.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to make some comments \nregarding repeal of the ``temporary'' 0.2 percent Federal unemployment \ntax (FUTA) surtax.\n  Earlier this year I introduced S. 103 to repeal the surtax.\n  I commend Chairman Roth and my colleagues on the Finance Committee \nfor including in their tax bill repeal of the temporary 0.2 percent \nFUTA surtax.\n  I would, however, like to accelerate the effective date from 2004 to \nnext year.\n  I believe that this tax relief provision is very important for both \nbusinesses and employees. We should repeal the surtax immediately.\n  The ``temporary'' surtax was enacted in 1976 by Congress to repay the \ngeneral fund of the Treasury for funds borrowed by the unemployment \ntrust fund.\n  Although the borrowings were repaid in 1987, Congress has continued \nto extend the surtax in tax bill after tax bill.\n  Since 1987, Congress has used extension of the surtax to help raise \nrevenue to pay for tax packages.\n  In fact, the surtax was most recently extended to help pay for the \n1997 tax bill.\n  The tax takes money out of the private economy for no valid reason.\n  By repealing the surtax, Congress will honor a promise that it made \nwhen the surtax was first enacted.\n  Small businesses were told repeatedly that the tax was temporary and \nwould be repealed when it was no longer needed to finance the \nunemployment tax system.\n  Clearly a tax is not temporary when it has already been in place for \nover twenty years.\n  Based on the original purpose, the surtax is no longer needed.\n  The economy is experiencing the highest level of employment in \ndecades, and all state unemployment funds have surpluses.\n  It is inappropriate for the government to continue to raise excess \nunemployment taxes and then use the surplus for purposes completely \nunrelated to unemployment.\n  Repeal of the temporary unemployment surtax will also be beneficial \nto small businesses.\n  The surtax is especially hard on the small businesses because they \nare often labor intensive.\n  Any payroll tax is added directly to the employer's payroll costs.\n  In fact, according to the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, payroll taxes are the fastest growing federal tax burden on \nsmall business.\n  It is also important to note that the payroll taxes must be paid \nwhether the business experiences a profit or a loss.\n  As a former small businessman myself, I am particularly aware of this \nfact.\n  I suspect that my view is similar to the view of many other small \nbusiness owners.\n  It is one thing to have a surtax when unemployment is high and the \nsurtax is necessary.\n  However, it is totally unjustified when unemployment is at the lowest \nlevel in three decades.\n  Repeal of the 0.2 percent surtax will reduce the tax burden on \nemployers and workers by $6 billion over the next five years.\n  Lower payroll taxes mean higher wages for workers.\n  Although the employer appears to fully pay the unemployment surtax \nand other payroll taxes, the economic evidence is strong that the cost \nis actually passed along to workers in the form of lower wages.\n  Consistent tax relief will help to ensure that our economy remains \nthe strongest and most vibrant in the world.\n  Low taxes reduce unemployment and help ensure that future surtaxes \nare unnecessary.\n  The time has come to do away with this outdated and unnecessary \nsurtax.\n  Again, I commend the Finance Committee for their provision to repeal \nthe FUTA surtax, and I urge my colleagues to support efforts to \naccelerate the effective date so that repeal is immediate.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are at a historic juncture. In the \n1980's, we faced massive deficits and growing debts. In sum, Congress \ndebated red ink.\n  On the edge of the millennium, we are debating the question of what \nto do with about $1 trillion in anticipated budget surpluses.\n  Why are we here debating a surplus? We are here because of the tough\n\n[[Page S9914]]\n\nchoice we made in the past: a choice to use fiscal discipline. We \nstarted down the road of deficit reduction with the 1993 budget \npackage, which passed without a single Republican vote. In fact, some \nmembers on the other side of the aisle claimed the bill would lead to \neconomic collapse. However, because of the courageous stand we took \nthen, we have gone from a $290 billion deficit in 1992 to an estimated \n$70 billion surplus in 1999.\n  But we did more than reduce the deficit and restore fiscal \ndiscipline, we spurred tremendous economic growth and unprecedented \neconomic expansion. For the sake of perspective, I would like to list \nthe following facts: we have seen 3.5% annual growth since 1993, 18.9 \nmillion new jobs, 4.3% unemployment, and the median family income grow \nby more than $3,500 since 1993. This is good news, and we cannot afford \nto squander it.\n  The days of red ink as far as the eye can see are gone. Instead, \nbased on various budget projections, we can suppose that there will be \na total surplus of approximately $3 trillion over the next ten years. \nMore than $2 billion of that total comes from Social Security payroll \ntaxes and must absolutely be set aside to preserve Social Security for \ncurrent and future beneficiaries. Social Security is a promise to those \nAmericans who worked and fought to make this nation great, and it is a \nprogram that must be preserved.\n  The Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget \nOffice both project that the remaining non-Social Security surplus \ntotals roughly $965 billion. But these are merely projections, \ndependent upon the performance and vagaries of the economy. And, I \nwould caution that the Office and Management and Budget and the \nCongressional Budget Office have a history of predictions that fall far \nshort of the mark. Indeed, Mr. President, because of changes in the \neconomy between April and July of 1999, the Congressional Budget Office \nrevised its ten year projections, adding $300 billion to the surplus. \nImagine--a swing of $300 billion in three months.\n  But how are we generating the surplus, or more accurately, why is the \nCongressional Budget Office predicting a budget surplus?\n  Quite simply, the vast bulk of the non-Social Security surplus, \nnearly $600 billion of it, comes from the continuation of arbitrary \nspending caps established in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. When we \npassed that legislation, we still had a deficit, but many of us \nrealized then that if these budget caps were maintained beyond the \nperiod they were required to balance the budget, they would prevent us \nfrom meeting our long-term obligations for education, health care, and \nthe environment.\n  The American people cannot afford, as my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle have asked of them, to retain these caps for the next 10 \nyears. We cannot afford $600 billion in cuts to Pell Grants, Head \nStart, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and \nChildren, Brownfield cleanup, Community Policing, Veterans benefits, \nand the National Institutes of Health, to name a few essential \ninitiatives. Let me emphasize that the $600 billion figure is not for \nnew, outlandish investments. Rather, that figure represents the \nresources we need to maintain current levels of funding. Make no \nmistake, these are cuts, not ``reductions in the rate of growth'', but \nreal cuts.\n  Moreover, if we adopt the Republican $800 billion tax cut plan and if \nwe fund the President's plan to meet the military's personnel and \nequipment needs, as the Republican leadership has said it will do, non-\ndefense domestic spending will be cut by a whopping 38% in 2009. Under \nthis scenario, 375,000 children will not get Head Start services, 1.4 \nmillion veterans will lose medical care, and 6.5 million poor students \nwill lose Title I education aid. Simply put, the $800 billion tax cut \nbefore us today crowds out every priority we know must be met in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, the most serious shortfall of the Republican tax bill \nis that it disposes of the entire surplus without making any provisions \nto shore up Medicare. By using all of the projected surplus for tax \ncuts, we leave ourselves severely restricted in the options we will \nhave in the future.\n  Actuarial reports from the Medicare Trustees project that, under \ncurrent economic conditions, we will have to contend with the \ninevitable fact that the Medicare program will be insolvent by 2015. \nRegrettably, by allocating the entire federal budget surplus for tax \ncuts, we will be forced to make radical changes to the program, either \nin the form of dramatic benefit reductions, large increases in \npremiums, or tax increases.\n  In addition, the Republican tax cut plan completely ignores the \nimpending burdens of a retiring baby boom generation. The truth is that \nby 2030, there will be about 70 million Americans 65 years or older, \nmore than twice their number in 1996. In terms of the total population, \nseniors will grow from 13% to 20% between 1999 and 2030.\n  In spite of these imminent demographic challenges, the Republican tax \ncut bill is structured in a way that tax breaks would explode during \ntheir second ten years. As the baby boom generation retirements occur, \nthe cost of the tax cuts would explode to $2 trillion.\n  Prudence dictates that we should take the opportunity the surplus \npresents to make meaningful changes to the Medicare program. I believe \nthat we should be looking at the possibility of adding a prescription \ndrug benefit as well as additional preventive benefits to the basic \npackage of health care benefits. For elderly Rhode Islanders the cost \nof prescription drugs is a major concern and a major expense. \nUnfortunately, Medicare does not cover this expense nor does the COLA \nfor Social Security accurately represent the medical expenditures of \ntoday's seniors.\n  While consideration of these matters should be made in the context of \noverall structural reform, we must ensure that there are adequate \nresources to guarantee a basic benefit package upon which Medicare \nbeneficiaries continue to rely.\n  Sadly, the Republican tax bill saps these resources before the debate \ncan even begin. The massive size of the Republican tax plan threatens \nto unravel the many years of fiscal austerity that have brought us to \nthis important juncture. Their unrealistic and dangerous proposal \nsacrifices the future for short-term gratification.\n  Mr. President, these are good times in our nation. More Americans are \nemployed. More Americans own a home. Crime is down. Productivity is up, \nand inflation is low.\n  Working families in Rhode Island expect us to be responsible and \nprepare for the future. They want us to preserve Medicare, but the \nRepublicans say ``no''. They want us to invest in education, but the \nRepublicans say ``no''. They want us to care for our veterans, but the \nRepublicans say ``no''. They want us to address the shameful fact that \n1 out of every 5 children in America lives in poverty, but the \nRepublicans say ``no''.\n  Mr. President, saying ``no'' to the needs of the American people is \nnot an acceptable legacy for this Congress. On the edge of the \nMillennium, we should not put politics ahead of what is fair and \nresponsible. Let's build for the future.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, yesterday I offered an amendment to the \nTaxpayer Refund Act of 1999. My good friend Senator Coverdell and I \ncrafted this amendment to help our public school teachers pursue \nprofessional development and pay for incidental supplies for their \nclassrooms.\n  Our amendment will allow teachers to deduct their professional \ndevelopment expenses without subjecting the deduction to the existing \ntwo percent floor. It will also allow teachers to deduct up to $125 for \nbooks, supplies, and equipment related to their teaching.\n  Mr. President, while our amendment provides financial relief for \nteachers, its ultimate beneficiaries will be their students. Other than \ninvolved parents, a well-qualified teacher is the most important \nprerequisite for student success. Educational researchers have \ndemonstrated the close relationship between qualified teachers and \nsuccessful students. Moreover, teachers themselves understand how \nimportant professional development is to maintaining and extending \ntheir levels of competence. When I meet with teachers from Maine, they \nrepeatedly tell me of their need for more professional development and \nthe scarcity of financial support for this worthy pursuit.\n\n[[Page S9915]]\n\n  The willingness of Maine's teachers to fund their own professional \ndevelopment activities has impressed me deeply. For example, an English \nteacher who serves on my Educational Policy Advisory Committee told me \nof spending her own money to attend a curriculum conference. She is \ntypical of many teachers who generously reach into their own pockets to \npay for professional development and to purchase materials that enhance \ntheir teaching.\n  Let me explain how our amendment works in terms of real dollars. The \naverage yearly salary of a teacher in 1997 was about $38,500. Under \ncurrent law, a teacher making this salary could not deduct the first \n$770 in professional development and incidental instruction-related \nexpenses that he or she paid for out of pocket. Our amendment would see \nto it that teachers receive tax relief for all such expenses.\n  I greatly admire the many teachers who have voluntarily financed the \nadditional education that they need to improve their skills and to \nserve their students better and who purchase books, supplies, equipment \nand other materials that enhance their teaching. I hope that this \nchange in our tax code will encourage teachers to continue to take \nformal course work in the subject matter that they teach, to complete \ngraduate degrees in either their subject matter or in education, and to \nattend conferences to give them new ideas for presenting course work in \na challenging manner. This amendment will reimburse teachers for a \nsmall part of what they invest in our children's future.\n  Mr. President, this would be money well spent. Investing in education \nis the surest way for us to build one of the most important assets for \nour country's future, a well-educated population. We need to ensure \nthat our public schools have the best teachers possible in order to \nbring out the best in our students. Adopting this amendment will help \nus to accomplish this goal. I thank my colleagues in joining Senator \nCoverdell and me in support of this effort.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1429, the Taxpayer \nRefund Act of 1999.\n  This debate has been about numbers and surpluses and budget rules. To \nsome extent, it has to be. But our efforts to provide tax relief are \nalso about something more important:\n  People.\n  The kind of relief that both the Senate and House tax bills would \nprovide is a matter of providing real help to real people who have real \nneeds.\n  This tax relief is about returning some modest amount of liberty, \nsome small measure of power, to the people. This is the most heavily \ntaxed generation of Americans in history. Providing some degree of tax \nrelief will return to individuals and families more power over their \nown lives, more ability to meet their pressing needs, and more of an \nopportunity to pursue their dreams.\n  I've looked at both the Senate and House bills. I think we can come \nup with a very good conference report based on these two bills--a \nconference report that preserves the best of both bills, and helps \nimprove the lives of all Americans.\n  We are talking about a tax bill that removes some fundamental \nunfairness from the current system.\n  For example, it just isn't fair that two individuals should be forced \nto pay hundreds of dollars more in taxes simply because they get \nmarried. That's why the Senate bill ends the marriage penalty for two \nearners. I think we should go farther, which is why I've supported the \nGramm amendment and the Hutchison amendment and hope we can do more in \nconference.\n  Mr. President, it just isn't fair that working families sometimes \nhave to sell part or all of the family farm or the family business just \nto pay taxes. I've seen family farms carved up because of the death \ntax. The other side would have us believe that this is a debate about \nthe so-called ``estates'' of rich people. It's not.\n  Death tax relief is a question of saving the family farm; maintaining \nthe family business; and allowing people the fundamental freedom to \ndispose of their own property and their own savings as they see fit. \nThe death tax imposes a double tax, because it confiscates property and \nsavings built up from income left over after it's already been taxed \none, two, or three times before.\n  But we know where the other side and the Administration are coming \nfrom. In fact, this Administration's former Secretary of Labor, in one \nof his books, called it a ``loophole'' for the tax code to allow \nparents actually to pass along some of their savings and possessions to \ntheir children.\n  I support the relief from the death tax in this bill and wish we \ncould do more. That's why I've supported the Kyl amendment.\n  This tax relief bill is good for children. It would allow more \nparents to afford child care, both because it increases and expands the \nchild care tax credit, also called the Dependent Care Credit, and \nbecause it allows more modest- and middle-income families to make full \nuse of the child tax credit we enacted in the 1997 Tax Relief Act. It \nalso would expand the tax exclusion for foster care payments.\n  This bill will help make education more affordable and available to \nindividuals and families. It includes tax-free, qualified tuition \nplans; extends the employer-provided tuition assistance; and makes our \n1997 education tax credits more fully available to modest- and middle-\nincome families, by taking it out of the Alternative Minimum Tax \ncalculations.\n  We should be doing even more to help families meet their educational \nneeds and opportunities. This is why I've supported the Coverdell-\nTorricelli amendment to expand and improve Educational Savings \nAccounts.\n  The Coverdell-Torricelli amendment would give parents greater choice \nin how best to educate their children. The issue here is parental \nchoice. Who knows best--parents or a distant government bureau in \nWashington, DC? In recent years, the focus has been entirely too much \non growing the government and inventing federal programs. But much of \nthat national government is far removed from the year-to-year and day-\nto-day decisions that parents must make, and work on with teachers and \nschool boards, about their children's education.\n  This amendment would shift power and resources back to the most local \nlevel--Mom and Dad. The Coverdell amendment would allow more \nflexibility--and the use of more of their own money--as they face \ndecisions about paying for things like tutoring, home computers, \nprivate or religious school, higher education, and vocational \neducation. The amendment focuses especially on those who find it hard \nto pay for educational expenses now. In talking about public schools, \nsupplies and activity fees are a burden on parents today. The Coverdell \namendment would help families deal with those costs.\n  Mr. President, a few months ago, we passed the Ed-Flex bill. This law \ngives the state educational agency and the local educational agency the \nflexibility in how they spend federal dollars. Now, Mr. President, it \nis time to give parents similar flexibility in how they help provide \nfor their children's education.\n  I hope we can do more to help families with their children's \neducational needs when this bill goes to conference. I hope we can \ninclude provisions that come much closer to the Coverdell-Torricelli \namendment.\n  Besides helping families with the care and education of their \nchildren early in life, this bill also will help provide care in the \ntwilight of life, through an additional deduction for providing in-home \ncare for an elderly family member.\n  This bill takes a significant step forward in making health care \ncoverage more affordable and available for millions of Americans. Small \nbusinesses and farm families, especially, will be helped by the \naccelerated, full deductibility of health care premiums, as will other \nworkers not covered by an employer-provided plan. More Americans would \nbe able to plan for long-term care, a critical area of growing need, \nbecause of an above-the-line deduction for individuals and inclusion in \ncafeteria plans at work.\n\n  America's farm families are in a period of economic crisis today. \nThat crisis should be, and will be, addressed in a major farmers' aid \npackage a number of us are working on. But additional, much-needed help \nis provided in this bill, as well.\n  Besides self-employed health insurance and death tax relief, this \nbill would provide for increased expensing,\n\n[[Page S9916]]\n\nstarting next year, to $30,000; create the new FARRM Accounts--Farm and \nRanch Risk Management Accounts--that Senators Grassley, Burns, I, and \nothers have been working on; protect income averaging from the \nAlternative Minimum Tax; increase credits for reforestation; and allow \nfarmer co-ops more dividend flexibility.\n  Like farmers, small business, the over-taxed engines of job-creation, \ninnovation, and economic opportunity in our economy, will finally \nreceive some relief from many of these same provisions.\n  The Senate bill makes tremendous strides in retirement security. \nToday's baby boomers, the first generation to have spent their entire \nlives in the most heavily-taxed generation, are becoming increasingly \nanxious about their prospects for retirement security. Why is no \nmystery: Since the baby boomers were children, they have seen the \naverage family's tax burden, at all levels, increase by more than 50 \npercent, as a share of income. When the government takes 50 percent \nmore from you than it did from your parents, how do you save and invest \nfor your own retirement?\n  All taxpayers, of all incomes and all ages, stand to benefit from \nexpanding the use of Individual Retirement Accounts. In the past, IRAs \nwere a simple, universally-understood, readily-accessible to save for \nretirement. One of the worst things in the 1986 tax bill was the \nconfusing limitations placed on IRAs that, in fact, have discouraged \nmany modest- and middle-income workers from using them. Farmers and \nsmall business owners and their employees, especially, have an \nimportant stake in more accessible IRAs, because they have no other \nlarge, employer-provided pension plan to participate in.\n  Mr. President, the tax relief bills moving through Congress will help \nreal people. The real debate is over two competing visions of how the \ngovernment can help people. Those of us who support tax relief say, we \nhelp people when we give them back the power and freedom to control \ntheir own destinies. The other side says, they think it would help \npeople if the government made decisions for them, and dispensed \ndependency through an expensive bureaucracy.\n  You can confiscate more and more money from workers, savers, and \nfamilies. That, in fact, has been and is the trend. Then the government \ncan spend that money, grow the bureaucracy, write more rules, make \ncitizens feel more like supplicants, and, in the end, hand someone \nanother small government check.\n  Or we can let workers, savers, entrepreneurs, and families keep a \nlittle more of their fruits of their own labors, and let them apply \nthat directly to taking care of their children, their parents, their \nhealth care needs, and their education.\n  We can, as this bill does by extending the Work Opportunity Tax \nCredit, tell employers they can keep a little more of what they earn, \nif they also provide jobs for disadvantaged, hard-to-place workers.\n  Today, 70 percent of taxpayers receive no recognition of charitable \ngiving--because they don't itemize their deductions. We can, in this \nbill, reward and encourage those middle-class taxpayers who benefit \ntheir community, help the less fortunate, and promote the social good, \nby letting them keep a little more of their hard-earned income, with an \nabove-the line deduction for charitable donations.\n  We are talking about a modest and reasonable package of tax relief. \nBoth Houses are calling for a tax cut of only 3.5 percent over the next \n10 years, or less than one-fourth of the total amount taxpayers have \nbeen overcharged by their government.\n  We are proposing a modest amount of tax relief that leaves plenty of \nroom to safeguard Social Security completely. In fact, with the budget \nwe passed earlier this year, for the first time in history, Congress \nhas committed itself to reserving all of the Social Security surplus, \nand all future Social Security revenues, exclusively for future Social \nSecurity benefits.\n  Our tax relief is based upon huge over-collections of taxes from \nAmerican workers and taxpayers. In other words, yes, it is based upon \nprojections of budget surpluses--surpluses projected both by the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the President's own Office \nof Management and Budget. It is interesting that the same critics who \ncriticize the idea of basing tax relief on projections then make up \ntheir own, speculative projections about the cuts in future spending \nprograms they claim would result from this tax relief.\n  In point of fact, we all agree that Medicare, Veterans programs, \neducation, and other priorities must be maintained and improved in the \nfuture. The budget we passed earlier this year provides for that, and \nthis tax relief package doesn't infringe on them.\n  I remember how, just a few years ago, some in Congress, the White \nHouse, and special interest groups made dire predictions of how \nspending on all kinds of essential programs would have to be slashed to \nbalance the budget.\n  Since then, a new Congress came to town in 1995, committed to \nbalancing the budget and reining in the growth of government.\n  We've still had increases in spending, but they've been more \nmoderate. We do have some high priority programs to re-evaluate. Some \nincreases are needed. In other places, we need more restraint, and even \nsome cuts.\n  But a balanced budget and a significant surplus have emerged--along \nwith an economy that is strong because the people who work, save, \ninvest, and create jobs took us seriously when we said we would balance \nthe budget and limit the growth of spending.\n  Now, Congress has taken the first critical steps needed to save and \npreserve Social Security for the current generation of seniors and \nthose who expect to retire soon. We all agree the next step is to \nmodernize it for future generations. Our budget, and this tax relief, \nis perfectly consistent with that commitment.\n  Most of us agree with the majority of the bipartisan Medicare \nCommission that we need to shore up that program as well, too. That \nwill involve expanding or improving some of what Medicare provides, as \nwell as expanding consumer choice, increasing market discipline, \ncurbing waste and abuse, and finding savings. Unfortunately, the \nnecessary super-majority of the commission didn't allow it to turn its \nmajority views into what it could call its ``official'' \nrecommendations. But we in Congress stand ready to work with the \nPresident on the responsible reforms suggested by that commission and \nothers.\n  And this Congress remains committed to reducing the national debt. \nUnder our budget, and including this tax bill, we will cut the public \ndebt in half over the next ten years, and reduce the debt by more than \n$200 billion over what the President's budget recommendations called \nfor.\n  Still, Mr. President, even as we tackle all these challenges, we do \nhave the capability of refunding to the hard-working American taxpayers \na little of what they have been overcharged. That's what this \nlegislation, and this debate, are all about today.\n  The choice is simple: More government and more spending versus \nletting the people keep a little more of their hard-earned incomes and \na little more control over their own lives.\n  Mr. President, I vote for this tax relief bill because I am casting a \nvote of confidence for the wisdom of the people, and a vote to help by \nremoving some of the heavy tax burden they are bearing.\n\n\n          community renewal and charity empowerment amendment\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to discuss one of my amendments, \nNo. 1476, offered with Senator Abraham and Senator DeWine, to establish \nrenewal communities and encourage charitable giving to those \norganizations which make a lasting difference in the lives of people.\n  The amendment creates 100 renewal communities where businesses will \nhave the incentive to stay and locate to provide economic opportunity \nfor some of the most disadvantaged communities in America. The \namendment also allows states to utilize federal block grant funds, if \nthey choose to, in order to offset any revenue loss associated with \noffering a targeted state charity tax credit for individual donations \nto charities working predominantly to alleviate poverty.\n  Mr. President, I will continue to work with the chairman of the \nFinance Committee in order to see that these\n\n[[Page S9917]]\n\ncritical provisions for expanding opportunity and transforming lives \nare included in the conference report. The Renewal Community provisions \nwere included in the House of Representatives tax relief package and I \nlook forward to working with the chairman to see that these provisions \nare included which unleash the power of the private sector and American \ncharitable and faith-based resources to renew our commodities.\n  Mr. ROTH. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Pennsylvania. \nMy staff has been reviewing this proposal and we will continue working \nwith him toward a favorable outcome.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator. I appreciate his continued \nassistance.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I also rise in strong support of this \nlegislation creating Renewal Communities. These distressed communities \nwill be able to benefit from lower taxes, regulatory relief, and \nbrownfields clean-up while committing to lowering barriers to economic \nopportunity. The President of the United States has voiced his support \nfor helping these communities. The House of Representatives has already \npassed this legislation. Moreover, our amendment also provides states \nthe option to leverage federal dollars to transform lives and \ncommunities to the extent that individuals are motivated to contribute \nto charitable organizations walking along side those in need.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the Senator from Michigan for his comments and look \nforward to working with him.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Pennsylvania and \nthe Senator from Michigan and rise in support of the American community \nrenewal and charity empowerment amendment. I would also encourage the \nChairman to include these essential provisions in the conference \nreport. The legislation will also provide increased flexibility for \nstates that choose to offer targeted charity tax credits. This \nprinciple is consistent with the growing support for expansion of \ncharitable choice and recognizes that empowering faith-based and other \ncharities is an essential next step in welfare reform.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the Senator from Missouri and appreciate the \ncommitment of the Senators who have spoken to these important issues.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose what the \nRepublicans are calling a tax cut. This so-called tax cut is a gimmick \nto get attention, to get votes, but not to get America what it needs.\n  The Republicans are trying to pander to every interest group in \nAmerica and give them a tax break. And who doesn't want a tax break?\n  I oppose these tax cuts for three reasons. First, these tax cuts are \npremature. They are based on a projected surplus of funds that we do \nnot have. We all know that this surplus exists on paper only. It is no \nmore than a promissory note and we don't know if that note can or will \nbe delivered.\n  Second, these tax cuts are irresponsible. With no surplus, we are \nspending money before we have it. We are on a collision course between \nmonetary and fiscal responsibility. Shouldn't we combine our monetary \nand fiscal responsibilities to get the country in the right direction \ntowards growth in the future?\n  Third, these tax cuts are callous. We are giving money away that we \ndon't have--when we've not even met the compelling needs of our \ncountry: We've not fixed the draconian Medicare cuts stemming from the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997. We've not ensured the long-term solvency \nof Social Security and Medicare. We've not addressed the spending \ncaps--which are forcing cruel cuts in critical services for veterans \nhealth, and children's education, and which are crippling scientific \nresearch.\n  The Medicare cuts in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have already \ncaused 34 Home Health agencies in my state to close--only two public \nHome Health Agencies remain in Maryland. Maryland is also facing a \nmanaged care crisis. Because of Balanced Budget Act of 1997, 18,000 \npeople in Maryland will lose access to supplemental benefits such as \nprescription drug coverage and preventive health benefits.\n  Republicans may say that a tax cut will allow these senior citizens \nto use the money from a tax cut to buy supplemental coverage, such as \nMedi-Gap and that they are returning ``choice'' and ``freedom'' to the \nAmerican people. But what about the forty-percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries who do not even submit tax returns because their incomes \nare so low. Those people will not see a dime of the tax out. They will \nstill not have any way to afford prescription drugs like heart \nmedication or insulin for diabetes, because their HMO left town.\n  Spending caps will threaten our ability to meet compelling human \nneeds; to maintain the national security of the United States; and to \nstay the course on research and development.\n  Because of the spending caps, veterans of this nation are facing a \n10% cut in health care.\n  Because of the spending caps, our members of the military will \ncontinue to be forced to shop in consignment shops and use food stamps \nbecause they are not making enough money. Mr. President, we cannot have \na second-hand military. These are people who put their lives on the \nline to protect our nation. They should not have to use food stamps to \nfeed their families and shop in second-hand stores for clothing.\n  Because of the spending caps, our continued technological advancement \nwill be jeopardized. America must maintain its competitive edge if we \nare to maintain our leadership in science and technology.\n  I am not opposed to tax cuts when it is the right time to do so. I \nbelieve it is the right time for tax cuts when there is a real and \nactual surplus or an incredible recession and we need to stimulate \nconsumption. It is clear that neither of these conditions exists today.\n  We need to get back to basics--to save lives, save communities, and \nsave America. I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this phony \ntax cut.\n\n\n                                  CIAC\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in the Small Business Job Protection Act \nof 1996, I had the good fortune of working with my esteemed colleague, \nthe senior senator from Nevada, on an amendment restoring the exclusion \nfor the receipt of contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) for \nwater and sewage disposal property repealed by the Tax Reform Act of \n1986.\n  I rise today to voice my concern about the possible direction of the \nDepartment of the Treasury's regulations interpreting the definition of \nCIAC under Internal Revenue Code section 118(b). Specifically, I am \ntroubled by an effort to narrow the definition to exclude service \nlaterals.\n  The Senator from Nevada and I, along with many of our colleagues here \nin the Chamber worked hard over the course of a number of years to \nrestore the pre-1986 Act exclusion for the receipt of CIACs for water \nand sewage. As part of our efforts, we developed a revenue raiser in \ncooperation with the industry to make up any revenue loss due to our \nlegislation. This revenue raiser extended the life, and changed the \nmethod, for depreciating water utility property from 20 year \naccelerated to 25 year straight line depreciation. As a consequence of \nthis cooperation with the industry, our CIAC change made a net $274 \nmillion contribution toward deficit reduction.\n  In addition to these efforts, we made a number of changes to the pre-\n1986 language. The most important of these was a change to clarify that \nservice laterals should be included in the definition of CIAC.\n  These lines typically run from a larger water distribution line to \nthe property line of one or more customers. The utility is responsible \nfor all maintenance and liability associated with service laterals. \nAdditionally, state public utility commissions treat contributions for \nservice laterals (or any other capital component of the water supply \nsystem) as a CIAC and, therefore, do not allow a utility company to \ninclude them in its rate base.\n  It is important to distinguish that service laterals are not fees \ncharged to customers for the right to start and stop service. Such fees \nwould be treated as taxable income. However, as elements of utility \nplant, the service laterals should be treated as CIAC.\n  Additionally, it is my sense that the final revenue estimate done by \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation on the restoration of CIAC included \nservice\n\n[[Page S9918]]\n\nlaterals. In an October 11, 1995 letter to me the Joint Committee on \nTaxation provided revenue estimates for the CIAC legislation. A \nfootnote in this letter states, ``These estimates have been revisited \nto reflect more recent data.'' The industry had only recently supplied \nthe committee with comprehensive data, which reflected total CIAC in \nthe industry including service laterals.\n  It is my sincere hope that the Department of the Treasury drafts the \nregulations on this important matter clearly reflecting the intent of \nCongress to include service laterals in the definition of CIAC.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I, too, stand to express my concern over the \npossible direction of the Treasury regulations. The Senator from Iowa \nand I worked long and hard to fix this problem in 1996. We worked with \nthe various staffs here in Congress and at the Department of the \nTreasury to ensure that all contributions in aid of construction as \nregulated by the various state utility commissions were included under \nour legislation. We worked with the industry to develop a revenue \nraiser paid for by companies receiving relief in our legislation. I \nurge the Department to stick closely with the congressional intent of \nour amendment and look forward to working with my colleague to ensure \nthat we reach the correct result on this issue.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Roth tax bill \nand to express disappointment that Senator Moynihan's alternative did \nnot pass the Senate. The Moynihan amendment would have provided real \ntax relief to those Americans who need it most, maintained the balanced \nbudget that we fought so hard to achieve, and strengthened the Social \nSecurity and Medicare programs for generations to come.\n  Senator Moynihan's amendment would have reduced the unprecedented \n$800 billion, ten year tax cut to a more reasonable $295 billion. The \nMoynihan proposal pays a fair dividend, fairly distributed, to the \nworking families that have fueled the current economic recovery. The \nRoth proposal breaks the bank with tax breaks for those who don't need \nthem, and benefit cuts to those who have already suffered them. The \nMoynihan proposal takes a conservative, cautious estimate of the \nAmerican economic pie and divides it evenly. The Roth proposal uses \n``pie in the sky'' surplus estimates to justify huge tax breaks for a \nvery small segment of society.\n  The proponents of $800 billion worth of tax relief would have us \nbelieve that a $1 trillion surplus is as reliable and inevitable as the \nsun coming up in the morning. But as my colleagues know, this \nprojection is based on the most optimistic and unrealistic \nassumptions--assumptions about the precise direction of the economy, \nwhich is notoriously hard to predict, and assumptions about the \nwillingness of Congress to make large and drastic spending cuts, which \nis notoriously nonexistent.\n  Over the next 5 years, the smallest changes in the economy could lead \nthe $1 trillion surplus estimate to be off by as much as $250 billion.\n  And, who among us believes that Congress and the President have the \nability, or the desire, to cut programs like education, agriculture, \nand biomedical research by the approximately 50% required? In fact, \nalready this year we have increased spending by $35 billion with more \nadded every day. Furthermore, members of Congress from both sides of \nthe aisle admit there is no way we will finish our annual \nappropriations bill without yet another, end-of-the-year cash infusion.\n  The surplus is not a sure thing, and basing an $800 billion tax cut \non it is a long-shot gamble. It was wrong, during the years of deficit \nspending, to take money from future generations and spend it on \nourselves. It is equally wrong today to bet the money of future \ngenerations on shaky economic projections and the surreal expectation \nthat Congress will suddenly--for the first time--decide to make tough \ncuts in government spending.\n  None of this is to suggest that our budget is as bad as it was ten \nyears ago--it is just not as good as the Roth proposal assumes. Our \nnation is currently enjoying record unemployment, falling welfare \nrolls, and increased prosperity for more Americans than at any time in \nhistory. We can and should use this opportunity to fix oversights and \ninequities in our tax code. Working Americans have driven this economy, \nand they deserve to share in it--they deserve a tax code that helps \nthem send their children to college, that eases the burden of paying \nfor long-term care, that encourages marriage, saving and high quality \nchild care. Simply put, in times of economic prosperity, we have the \nchance--and the obligation--to expand the pool of winners in our \neconomy.\n  And there are definitely some provisions in the Roth proposal that do \njust that. Both Senator Roth's bill and the Moynihan amendment contain \na version of my Child Care Tax Credit to encourage employers to get \ninvolved in increasing the supply of quality child care. Both bills \nalso contain my Farmer Tax Fairness Act to allow farmers to realize the \nbenefits of income averaging. And both bills provide for education tax \nrelief, marriage penalty relief, full health insurance deduction for \nthe self-employed, tax relief to cover the costs of long-term care, and \nthe extension of tax credits that are vital to our economic health.\n  But despite any common elements, on almost every point, the Moynihan \nalternative not only does a better job of containing the overall cost \nof tax relief, it also focuses that relief on those taxpayers most in \nneed of help. It is a conservative package that leaves plenty of room \nto preserve Social Security and Medicare, preserve the fiscal balance \nwe have worked so hard to achieve, and pay down the national debt.\n  Mr. President, for all these reasons, I hope, when we finally get \nserious about writing a tax bill later this year, we will seriously \nconsider the Moynihan alternative. It is balanced, responsible and \nfiscally prudent. It will help us expand opportunities and make life \nbetter and easier for more Americans and their families. And we should \nreject the Roth proposal. It turns the clock back to the failed budget \npolicies of the past, while providing too much benefit for too few \nAmericans at too great a cost.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the question now being considered by the \nSenate is whether we should refund a portion of the federal government \nsurplus to American families.\n  Over the next ten years, the federal government will collect $996 \nbillion more in income and other taxes than is necessary to pay fully \nfor every existing federal program, agency and department. This means \nthat the IRS will be taking almost $1 trillion more in taxes from the \nAmerican people's paychecks than it needs to operate the government. \nThis is a tax surplus--a tax overpayment.\n  This tax relief debate, serious as it is, concerns only the non-\nSocial Security surplus. Both sides agree that the Social Security \nsurplus itself is to be reserved for Social Security recipients only, \nand not be diverted to any other purpose.\n  There is, however, an important distinction between the two parties \neven on Social Security. Republicans, myself included, believe that we \nshould pass a ``lockbox'' law, giving the strongest possible statutory \nprotection to that Social Security surplus. Democrats have consistently \nfilibustered our proposal, asking Americans simply to trust them not to \nraid the Social Security surplus in the future as they have in the \npast. That is not enough.\n  The difference between the parties on taxes is even more striking. \nRepublicans believe that the lion's share of the non-Social Security \nsurplus ought to be returned to the American taxpayer whose taxes \ncreated that surplus; Democrats want to spend that surplus on new and \nexpanded government programs.\n  I am convinced that this tax overpayment should be refunded to the \nAmerican people who worked for and earned it. It is their money and it \nshould be returned to them to invest and spend as they deem best for \ntheir families and their futures. The alternative to refunding the tax \nsurplus to taxpayers is to leave the money in Washington, DC where it \nwill be spent to create $1 trillion in new government programs.\n  The President and his supporters in Congress are making outrageous \nclaims that giving a refund to taxpayers is risky or even dangerous. \nThey say that somehow returning a portion of the government surplus to\n\n[[Page S9919]]\n\nAmerican families will somehow endanger the very livelihoods of women \nand children. On that point, I would ask every American citizen to \nchallenge the President and his Democratic allies to back up with facts \ntheir politically-charged claims.\n  This latest shameless charade by the President is absolutely \noutrageous. The inference propounded by President Clinton is that those \nof us in this Chamber who support a tax refund are out to harm women \nand children, and that those who oppose such a refund care more about \nwomen and children than we do. That's an absolute outrage, and I'm \ntruly sorry to see that the President of the United States will stoop \nto such low levels in order to keep this money here in Washington, D.C. \nso that he can spend it on new government programs.\n  I will resist the temptation to join the President in his game of \nscare tactics, but I will take this opportunity to challenge all \nAmericans to ask themselves this question when they hear these \nridiculous charges: how will women and children, or anyone else for \nthat matter, possibly be hurt by the government giving them back some \nof the money they overpaid to Washington, D.C.?\n  To further illustrate the weakness of the President's argument, I'd \nlike everyone watching this on C-Span back home to take three dollars \nout of his or her purse or wallet. Now imagine that each dollar bill is \nworth a trillion dollars. That's the surplus--the people's tax \noverpayment. That's the amount that Americans have overpaid the \ngovernment in personal income and other taxes.\n  We Republicans want to put two of these dollars aside to protect \nSocial Security and Medicare and other essential programs, and to cut \nthe national debt in half.\n  The debate with the Democrats is over what to do with the third \ndollar. Republicans want to give it back to the taxpayers who earned \nit. Democrats want to spend it on new programs and bureaucracies. It's \nas simple and clear as that.\n  The surplus is generated from personal income and other taxes, it \nbelongs to the American people. It's not the government's money--it's \nyour money .  .  . you sent it here. Shouldn't you get some of it back?\n  While I strongly support refunding the tax surplus to the taxpaying \nfamilies and hardworking individuals all across this country, it is my \nsincere hope that Congress will ultimately pass a bill that reduces the \ntax burden on Washington state families while moving towards \nsimplification of the federal tax code.\n  Fundamental reform of the tax code is my number one tax priority. I \nam a strong, committed advocate for the elimination of our current \nfederal tax system. It is too complicated, too burdensome, too unfair. \nThe current system should be scrapped and replaced with one that is \nmuch simpler and easier to understand. We need to focus our energy and \nattention in Congress on developing an alternative. I will support a \nreplacement code that is based on four principles: the new code must be \nfair, simple, uniform and consistent. Americans deserve a tax code they \ncan understand and predict.\n  A vast majority of the American people and those in Congress support \nreforming our tax code. I hope that when Congress takes action to ease \nthe cost burden of the federal tax code, the opportunity to simplify or \nreduce the complexity of the tax code will be seized. I do not pretend \nto believe there is consensus on how to reform the code completely at \nthis time, but at the very least Congress should pass a tax bill that \ndoes not make the code even more of a bewildering mess than it is \ntoday.\n  Unfortunately, the bill reported out of the Finance Committee does \nnot achieve the goals of either simplifying the code, or even to do no \nfurther harm. The bill contains 15 titles, 19 subtitles and 163 various \nsections to total over 400 pages in length. It takes a report of an \nadditional almost 300 pages to explain what the bill even does. Yes, \nthe bill does refund nearly $800 billion in unneeded tax dollars back \nto the American people, but at what price? Adding more pages to the tax \ncode? Making the code more complicated? Further confusing taxpayers as \nthey struggle to fill out their tax returns?\n  What is most unfortunate is that a tax relief bill need not be so \ncomplex. It is certainly possible to refund the tax surplus simply and \ndirectly. An alternative was proposed during committee consideration by \nSenator Gramm that accomplished the goal of simple tax relief by \nincluding just four elements: broad-based income tax rate relief, \nrepeal of death taxes, elimination of the marriage penalty, and full \ndeductibility for health insurance for all Americans. I voted for that \nalternative in the Senate.\n  While I may not fully endorse every aspect of this specific proposal, \nI strongly and enthusiastically support its intent to refund the \ntaxpayers' money in a manner that simplifies and corrects injustices in \nthe current tax code. We should get rid of death taxes, stop penalizing \nmarried couples through the tax code, allow self-employed and \nindividual Americans to fully deduct their health insurance costs just \nas corporations can, and we should permanently extend the R tax \ncredit so that our increasingly technology driven economy can continue \nto grow and create jobs.\n  I cannot, though, happily endorse a tax relief package that moves \ntoward such reform only to get lost in a 443-page swamp of countless \nnew provisions and rules. The citizens of Washington state and the \ntaxpayers of this nation deserve to have a significant portion of the \ntax surplus returned to them, and they deserve it in a manner that \ndoesn't make filling out their IRS return by April 15th even more of an \nexasperating experience.\n  For now, I will continue to push for a debate that reforms our tax \ncode. In the meantime, I am committed to pushing onward with the \nprinciples that guide this debate: Should a portion of the government \nsurplus be refunded to American families, or should the rest of the \nnon-Social Security and Medicare surplus be left in Washington, D.C. \nfor increased spending on government programs?\n  On that question, the answer is easy .  .  . give American families a \ntax refund. That requires a yes vote, though with serious reservations.\n\n\n                        captial gains exclusion\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, about a tax issue that \nis important to farm families across the country.\n  The Senate is on record in this year's budget resolution as \nsupporting legislation to end the disparity between family farmers and \ntheir urban and suburban counterparts with respect to the $500,000 \ncapital gains inclusion for homes sales that Congress passed in 1997 by \nexpanding it to cover capital gains from the sale of farmland along \nwith the farmhouse. Under current law, farmers receive little or no \nbenefit from the existing capital gains exclusion because farm homes \naway from town often hold little or no value.\n  It is my understanding that the chairman is supportive of the effort \nto end this tax inequity and will work to include this family farmers \ncapital gains fairness proposal in conference should the final tax bill \ninclude other capital gains tax relief.\n  Mr. ROTH. I understand the Senator's concerns. In the context of \ncapital gains, I believe the needs of farmers should be considered as \nwe develop future legislation. In the conference, we will certainly be \ndiscussing capital gains. And we will consider the special needs of \nfarmers in this area.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President. Today I express my support for S. 1429, \nThe Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999. This is a sound bill based on real \nneed and I believe the American taxpayers deserve and want this \nlegislation.\n  The Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 goes a long way to relieve taxpayers \nof an unfair tax burden. This bill provides: broad-based tax relief; \nfamily tax relief by addressing the Marriage Penalty Tax; retirement \nsavings and education incentives; health care tax reductions; small \nbusiness tax relief; international tax reform, and death and gift tax \nrelief, among other provisions.\n  I am particularly interested in the estate tax relief because earlier \nthis year I introduced the Estate and Gift Tax Rate Reduction Act of \n1999, (S. 38). Estate and gift taxes remain a burden on American \nfamilies, particularly those who pursue the American dream\n\n[[Page S9920]]\n\nof owning their own business. This is because family-owned businesses \nand farms are hit with the highest tax rate when they are handed down \nto descendants--often immediately following the death of a loved one. \nThese taxes, and the financial burdens and difficulties they create \ncome at the worst possible time. Making a terrible situation worse is \nthe fact that the rate of this estate tax is crushing, reaching as high \nas 55 percent for the highest bracket. That's higher than even the \nhighest income tax rate bracket of 39 percent.\n  Furthermore, the tax is due as soon as the business is turned over to \nthe heir, allowing no time for financial planning or the setting aside \nof money to pay the tax bills. Estate and gift taxes right now are one \nof the leading reasons why the number of family-owned farms and \nbusinesses are declining; the burden of this tax is just too much.\n  This tax sends the troubling message that families should either sell \nthe business while they are still alive, in order to spare their \ndescendants this huge tax after their passing, or run-down the value of \nthe business, so that it won't make it into their higher tax brackets. \nWhichever the case may be, it hardly seems to encourage private \ninvestment and initiative, which have always been such a strong part of \nour American heritage.\n  I am pleased that the bill before us takes the important step to \naddress this unfair burden. I will continue to work with my colleagues \nfor the complete elimination of the death tax.\n  I have heard the argument that this tax cut will threaten Social \nSecurity, but that's just not true. In fact, this bill saves every \npenny of the money set aside for Social Security. Social Security is \nsafe and secure with this bill. This bill also leaves $277 billion to \nfinance Medicare, emergencies or other priorities, so this bill does \nnot threaten Medicare or Medicare beneficiaries. In contrast, the \nadministration's budget would increase spending by $1 trillion and \nincrease taxes by $100 billion over the next 10 years according to the \nCongressional Budget Office. How can this administration believe that \nthey can increase spending and taxes even though they already admitted \nraising taxes too much? I think since we now have a balanced budget, \nthen the American people deserve this tax cut. The American people have \nearned this tax cut, this is their money and I think we should give it \nback to them.\n  I know that $792 billion is a lot of money, but we have a $3 trillion \nsurplus and one reason we have a $3 trillion surplus is the taxpayers \ngot their taxes raised too much. I realize that we could just go ahead \nand spend that extra money like the administration wants to do, but I \nthink that would be irresponsible. I think if the American people \noverpaid, then the American people should get their money back--that's \njust fair.\n  The Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 is the largest middle-class tax \nrelief since the Reagan administration and I think it's high time the \nhard-working taxpayer get this refund.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have pertinent information printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 1999.\n     Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: This is in response to your request \n     dated February 24, 1999, for a revenue estimate of your bill, \n     S. 38, ``The Estate and Gift Tax Rate Reduction Act.'' \n     Briefly, this bill would reduce the statutory estate and gift \n     tax rates contained in section 2010 of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (the ``Code'') each year by subtracting 5 \n     percent from each rate in each rate bracket contained \n     therein. In addition, your bill would also reduce the credit \n     for State death taxes contained in section 2011 of the Code \n     by subtracting each year 1.5 percent from each rate in each \n     rate bracket contained therein. As the result of these \n     reductions in the statutory estate and gift tax rates, \n     Subtitle B of the Code pertaining to estate, gift, and \n     generation-skipping transfer taxes will effectively be \n     repealed for decedents dying and gifts made after December \n     31, 2009.\n       Assuming that your bill would take effect for decedents \n     dying and gifts made after December 31, 1999, we estimate \n     that this proposal would decrease Federal fiscal year budget \n     receipts as follows:\n\n                        [In billions of dollars]\n\nFiscal years:\n  2000..............................................................\n  2001.............................................................-4.1\n  2002.............................................................-8.4\n  2003............................................................-13.4\n  2004............................................................-18.1\n  2005............................................................-22.1\n  2006............................................................-26.3\n  2007............................................................-30.8\n  2008............................................................-35.1\n  2009............................................................-39.5\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n      Total......................................................-197.8\n\n       I hope this information is helpful to you. Please let me \n     know if we can be of further assistance in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lindy L. Paul.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 11, 1998.\n       Dear Colleague: As we prepare to convene the 106th \n     Congress, I am writing to seek your co-sponsorship of \n     legislation that would eliminate the burden of the death \n     taxes. On July 16, 1998, I introduced S. 2318, a bill that \n     took a fresh and prudent approach to reducing the burden of \n     estate and gift taxes. This important bill, which I plan on \n     re-introducing as soon as we reconvene, would amend the \n     Internal Revenue Service Code of 1986 to phase out gift and \n     estate taxes completely over a ten year period. A copy of S. \n     2318 is enclosed for your convenience.\n       Just this month, the Joint Economic Committee released its \n     study entitled, ``The Economics of the Estate Tax.'' This \n     thorough analysis concluded that ``the estate tax generates \n     costs to taxpayers, the economy and the environment that far \n     exceed any potential benefits that it might arguably \n     produce.'' The study shows persuasively that this unfair and \n     byzantine tax restricts economic growth and squelches \n     entrepreneurial initiative. Of special importance to me, the \n     study also demonstrates how this tax undermines family-owned \n     businesses and farms--a segment of our economy responsible \n     for about \\2/3\\ of new job creation since the early 1970s. \n     Clearly, the time for eliminating the estate tax has arrived.\n       My bill would gradually eliminate this tax completely, by \n     reducing the tax five percent each year, until the highest \n     rate reaches zero. Although the $23 billion received from \n     this tax last year represents only a tiny percentage of \n     overall IRS receipts, eliminating it requires a gradual \n     approach. A gradual reduction over ten years is wise as we \n     struggle to maintain our commitment to balance the budget and \n     prune the federal government. A gradual approach minimizes \n     possible dislocations.\n       Several states have already taken a similar initiative and \n     phased out their state taxes on their own. I think it's time \n     we follow their example and eliminate this federal tax. My \n     bill last year was endorsed by the American Farm Bureau, the \n     Family Business Estate Tax Coalition, the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, and other interested groups.\n       Should you wish to be an original cosponsor of this bill \n     when I reintroduce it, or if you have any questions about \n     this bill, please contact me, or have your staff contact Amy \n     Amato of my staff at 224-5852. I look forward to working with \n     you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 1999.\n       Dear Colleague: We are writing to request your \n     cosponsorship of S. 38, the Estate and Gift Tax Rate \n     Reduction Act of 1999. This bill takes a fresh and prudent \n     approach to reducing the burden of estate and gift taxes by \n     phasing out gift and estate taxes completely over a ten year \n     period.\n       In December, the Joint Economic Committee released its \n     study entitled, ``The Economics of the Estate Tax.''

The study also demonstrates how \n     this tax undermines family-owned businesses and farms--a \n     segment of our economy responsible for about \\2/3\\ of new job \n     creation since the early 1970s. In fact, in large part due to \n     this tax, only 30% of family-owned businesses survive through \n     the second generation and only 13% survive through the third. \n     Clearly, the time for eliminating the estate tax has arrived.\n       S. 38 would gradually eliminate this tax completely, by \n     reducing the tax five percent each year, until the highest \n     rate reaches zero. Although the $23 billion received from \n     this tax last year represents only a tiny percentage of \n     overall IRS receipts, eliminating it requires a gradual \n     approach to minimize possible dislocations.

It's time \n     we follow their example and eliminate this federal tax. \n     Eliminating the tax has widespread support. In fact, 60% of \n     business owners report that they would increase investment \n     and add more jobs if this tax were eliminated. That kind of \n     positive effect on the American economy is tremendous. This \n     bill has the endorsement of the American Farm Bureau, the \n     Family Business Estate Tax Coalition,\n\n[[Page S9921]]\n\n     the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of \n     Business, and over 100 other interested organizations. The \n     time to eliminate this tax has clearly come.\n       Should you wish to be a cosponsor of this bill, or if you \n     have any questions about this bill, please contact us, or \n     have your staff contact Amy Amato of Senator Campbell's staff \n     at 224-5852 or Kolan Davis of Senator Grassley's staff at \n     224-3744. We look forward to working with you.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Charles Grassley,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise, while we are debating the budget \nreconciliation bill, to talk about an important family issue that I \nraised during debate on the emergency supplemental bill in March. I \nwant to voice my strong opposition to efforts by Members in the other \nbody to use $6 billion in unspent welfare and health care funds, \nintended for low-income children and their families, as a gimmick to \novercome their problem with this year's low budget caps.\n  Mr. President, I am referring to attempts to rescind $6 billion in \nunobligated Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF money, and \nunobligated Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Plan funds. I \nlearned of this proposal after reading the July 28, 1999, New York \nTimes, in which appeared a story entitled, ``Leaders in House Covet \nStates' Unspent Welfare Money.'' Why do they want to do this? To help \nfund the $792 billion tax cut proposal that the other body passed last \nweek--a proposal that would mostly help the wealthy in our nation. Any \nsuch action would be a repudiation of our promise to help families \nliving in poverty. It is a classic situation of reverse Robin Hood: \nrobbing the poor to give more to the rich.\n  Mr. President, during debate on the welfare reform bill in 1996, \nstates agreed to trade entitlement status under the Aid to Families \nwith Dependent Children program for the assurance of a fixed, annual \namount in the form of a block grant. Those of us who opposed the \nwelfare bill for this and other reasons warned that it would be harder \nunder a block grant to keep welfare funds from being cut. Now, certain \nmembers are turning our fears into reality. The cuts in this former \nentitlement program have begun. Cutting funds in this manner, Mr. \nPresident, would represent a betrayal of our promise to protect \nAmerica's poor families.\n  Again, as I explained in March, the term, ``unobligated,'' may seem \nself-explanatory--that these are simply funds that have not been spent \nunder TANF, Medicaid, or CHIP. Under TANF, according to the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, a combined total of $4.2 \nbillion from fiscal years 1997, 1998 and 1999 is available. Some would \npoint out that many poor families have worked their way to self-\nsufficiency and that welfare rolls have fallen by record numbers, as \nreasons why this money is not needed by states and remains unobligated.\n  However, many states are relying heavily on these unobligated funds \nand have already committed them for a wide variety of uses. States need \nto distribute some of this funding to counties and local agencies, or \nto child care and social services activities. Governors are keeping \n``rainy day'' funds for contingencies such as recessions or periods of \nstagnant growth--as we have now in my State of Hawaii--that force \nfamilies back onto welfare and leave states without enough money until \nthe next quarterly federal payment. States are also planning to use \nthis money for fundamental or new, innovative expenses to help poor \nfamilies become financially independent.\n  In July 23, the National Governors Association wrote to Congressmen \nJohn Porter and David Obey of the House Appropriations Committee, to \nplead their case. This letter is signed by Governors Thomas R. Carper \nof Delaware and Michael O. Leavitt of Utah, one Democrat and one \nRepublican. The letter states, ``Cutting funding for vital health and \nhuman services programs such as Medicaid, CHIP, TANF, and child support \nwould adversely affect millions of Americans--with the greatest impact \non children and the elderly in the greatest need. We reiterate our \nadamant and uniform opposition to these unprecedented cuts and to any \nproposal that would result in such drastic cuts to our most vulnerable \ncitizens.''\n  I concur with the Governors' sentiments about these valuable \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, I do this especially because the monies in question \nwere originally designated to help our poorest children and their \nfamilies. Instead, they would, over the next 10 years, go toward such \nthings as estate tax relief and capital gains tax relief--tax benefits \nfor the wealthiest taxpayers in the Nation.\n  Tax relief can be a good thing. However, it should not be the top \npriority when we face the urgent need to pay down our country's debt \nand save Social Security and Medicare. I hope my colleagues agree with \nme on an issue that is important to many poor Americans. I hope funding \nis not taken out of TANF, Medicaid or CHIP, as a solution to low budget \ncaps.\n\n\n                       independent bakery drivers\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have been working for several years to \nclarify a provision of the tax code which treats certain truck drivers \nas ``statutory employees,'' meaning they are independent contractors \nexcept for payroll tax purposes.\n  Prior to 1991, these individuals could pay their own payroll taxes if \nthey had a substantial investment in a distribution route. However, a \n1991 IRS ruling said that an investment in a distribution route no \nlonger qualified as an investment in ``facilities.'' This reversal by \nthe IRS has created much uncertainty, particularly in the bakery \nindustry.\n  I have prepared an amendment to clarify that an investment in \nfacilities can include a substantial investment in a distribution \nroute, area, or territory. Thus, an independent-contractor truck driver \nwho has a substantial investment in a distribution route or territory \nwill not be treated as a statutory employee for FICA and FUTA tax \npurposes.\n  Unfortunately, I am prevented from offering my amendment to this tax \nreconciliation bill because it affects the Social Security program. \nUnder Section 310(g) of the Budget Act, the adoption of my amendment \nwould cause the entire bill to be subject to a 60-vote point of order.\n  Therefore, I will not offer my amendment to this bill. However, I ask \nmy colleague from Delaware, Senator Roth, if he would work with me to \nconsider this amendment on the next non-reconciliation tax measure \nconsidered by the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his comments on this \nissue. The budget reconciliation procedures do prevent the \nconsideration of some amendments such as the one described by the \nSenator from Oklahoma. I look forward to working with the Senator from \nOklahoma on this important issue on the next non-reconciliation tax \nbill.\n\n\n       tax rules for consolidation of life insurance compensation\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, let me ask the Chairman. As I \nunderstand it, the tax rules regarding the taxation of life insurance \ncompanies have changed substantially over the past years. As a vestige \nof these old tax rules, however, there are certain limitations on when \nlife insurance companies can file consolidated tax returns with non-\nlife companies.\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes, I agree.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I also want to note that in the Senator's tax bill and in \nthe House tax bill, some of these restrictions on life insurance \nconsolidation have been addressed.\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes, that is true.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I ask that the Chairman keep in mind the further \nrationalization of these restrictions as this bill heads into \nconference and in future action in the Committee.\n  Mr. ROTH. I will keep in mind the concerns of both Senators in this \nimportant issue.\n\n\n                  bringing computers to the classroom\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the New Millennium \nClassrooms Act, introduced by Senators Abraham and Wyden, I am very \npleased the Senate adopted this provision to encourage computer \ndonations to schools. While I oppose the underlying bill, and believe \nthe magnitude of the Republican tax cut is irresponsible, I do support \na more reasonable level of tax relief with provisions targeted to \naddress national needs. This provision, which has strong bipartisan \nsupport,\n\n[[Page S9922]]\n\nmeets that test. I would also like to point out that Senator Baucus \nsponsored a similar provision that was part of the Democratic \nalternative considered earlier.\n  Technology is playing an increasingly important role in our society, \nin homes, in businesses, and in many aspects of everyday life. \nEmployers will require increasingly sophisticated levels of \ntechnological literacy in the workplace of the 21st Century. Education \nSecretary Riley has pointed out that we can expect 70 percent growth in \ncomputer and technology-related jobs in the next 6 years.\n  Yet, a recent U.S. Department of Commerce report, ``Falling Through \nthe Net: Defining the Digital Divide,'' finds there is a growing \ndisparity in terms of who has access to technology. While more \nAmericans are embracing technology, African Americans and Hispanics, \nparticularly from lower-income families and from rural areas, have less \naccess to computers, and that gap is growing. We find ourselves with a \nnew, information-age definition of ``haves'' and ``have-nots.'' These \nconditions are not good either for those left behind, or for those who \nwill be looking to hire employees in the future.\n  Every child should be able to gain technological skills through his \nor her classroom. Yet many schools are having difficulty meeting this \nchallenge. Sadly, while some schools have access to the latest in \nequipment, too many schools, particularly in fiscally strapped urban \nand rural areas, have an insufficient number of computers, and most of \nthose are outdated. The average computer in the classroom is 7 years \nold--and many are even older. A large proportion of these computers \ncannot run current educational software or connect to the Internet.\n  The Department of Education recommends that the optimal ratio of \nstudents per computer is five to one. Yet schools where 81 percent or \nmore of the children meet the Title I eligibility standards have only \none multimedia computer for every 32 students. Even schools where less \nthan 20 percent of the students are economically disadvantaged have \nonly one multimedia computer for every 22 students.\n  At the same time, research shows that students with the least access \nto technology can be helped most from effectively integrating \ntechnology into the classroom. A study by City University of New York \nfound test scores of disadvantaged children increased dramatically with \ncomputer-aided instruction.\n  We have taken several steps at the federal level to increase schools' \nability to integrate technology into the classroom. The creation of the \nE-rate program, for example, is helping schools obtain access to the \nInternet. Technology Challenge grants are providing resources to \nschools to upgrade their computer programs. We are also providing more \nresources to help train teachers on the best ways to use technology \neffectively in their classes. But many schools have a fundamental \nproblem in obtaining suitable hardware.\n  Current law provides an enhanced deduction for corporate donations to \nschools until December 31, 2000. Unfortunately, few corporations are \ntaking advantage of the enhanced deduction for two main reasons: the \nrequirement that donated equipment be 2 years old or less does not fit \ncompanies' equipment use cycles, and the deduction does not provide a \nsufficient incentive. Modifying the tax code to address these \nlimitations, as the Abraham-Wyden amendment proposes, will help us \nachieve the goal of putting a computer in every classroom and create \nongoing incentives to make sure the technology is kept reasonably up-\nto-date.\n  The Rand Institute has estimated the cost of providing our schools \nwith appropriate technology to be about $15 billion. The New Millennium \nClassrooms Act will help stretch federal funds efficiently and \neffectively to address this shortfall.\n  Mr. President, we all talk about the importance of encouraging \nbusinesses to become more involved in the educational process in their \ncommunities. This provision creates a strong incentive to help build \nthose relationships while providing school children with access to \nupdated equipment. I thank my colleagues for supporting it and intend \nto work to see it enacted as part of a more responsible budget plan.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased that last night the Senate \nadopted the Abraham-Wyden New Millennium Classrooms Act as an amendment \nto the reconciliation tax bill. Senator Abraham and I have worked on \nmany technology issues together as members of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee.\n  The New Millennium Classrooms Act is about digital recycling. It \ngives companies an incentive to recycle technology. It says the \ncomputer Bill Gates may see as a dinosaur, is really a dynamic new \nopportunity for seniors and students who have none.\n  There is a growing need to encourage access to information technology \nfor both seniors and students. The Administration on Aging estimates \nthere are about 11,500 senior centers throughout the United States \nserving millions of older Americans. The centers offer a variety of \nservices, including employee assistance and educational programs. \nEquipping senior centers with donated computer equipment could help \nopen the door to employment opportunities.\n  We know there is a growing demand for skilled high tech workers. Just \nlast year, the high tech community came to Congress asking for a large \nincrease in the number of skilled H-1B visas so they could hire foreign \nworkers to fill the gap. Congress agreed to boost the number of H-1B \nvisas from 65,000 to 115,000 for 1999 and 2000. Those are 50,000 jobs \nthat could have gone to Americans. Many seniors have the drive and the \ndesire to keep working; they simply need to gain some basic computer \nskills.\n  While it is important for all Americans to have equal access to \ninformation technology, the most pressing need is in our schools. The \nDepartment of Commerce recently published a report, ``Falling Through \nthe Net: Defining the Digital Divide.'' It shows that the rapid build-\nout of the information superhighway has by-passed many in rural and in \nless-advantaged urban communities. The report says factors such as \nrace, income and area of residence help limit access to information \ntechnology. For example, the study found that households earning more \nthan $75,000 are five times more likely to own computers than those \nearning less than $10,000. Households earning more than $75,000 are \nseven times more likely to use the Internet as those earning less than \n$10,000.\n  We know that very early in the next Century 60% of all jobs will \nrequire high-tech computer skills. To prepare our children for the jobs \nof the future, they not only must have access to technology, but they \nmust be trained to use it as well. But we cannot count on children in \nlow-income and rural communities even to have access to computers.\n  Schools can serve as great equalizers in this equation, giving all \nchildren access to information technology resources. However, a 1997 \nreport by the Educational Testing Service found that on average there \nwas only one multimedia computer for every 24 students. In economically \ndisadvantaged communities, the situation is worse: the computer to \nstudent ratio rises to one in 32.\n  The purpose of our amendment is to build more bridges between the \ntechnology ``haves'' and the ``have nots'' to build more on-ramps to \nthe information superhighway. You can't get 21st Century classrooms, \nusing Flintstones technology. However, technology is not cheap and \nschool budgets are limited, making it tough for schools to upgrade \ntheir systems by themselves. The point of our amendment is to enhance \nexisting incentives to businesses to donate computer equipment to \nschools.\n  There is a federal program in place, the 21st Century Classroom Act \nof 1997, but its use has been limited. It allows businesses to take a \ntax deduction for certain computer equipment donations to K-12 schools. \nBut most businesses take longer to upgrade their computers than allowed \nfor under the law.\n  The New Millennium Classrooms Act would make this law work the way it \nwas intended, and include donations to senior centers under this tax \ncredit. First, our legislation would increase the age limit from two to \nthree years for donated equipment eligible for a tax credit. This more \nrealistically tracks the time line businesses follow for their computer \nupgrades. It will cover hardware that possesses the necessary memory \ncapacity and graphics capability to support Internet and multimedia \napplications.\n\n[[Page S9923]]\n\n  Second, our bill expands the current limitation of ``original use'' \nto include both original equipment manufacturers and any corporation \nthat reacquires their equipment. We believe that by expanding the \nnumber of donors eligible for the credit, we will expand the number of \ncomputers donated to schools and senior centers.\n  Third, our bill provides for a 30% tax credit of the fair market \nvalue for school and senior center computer donations, and a 50% credit \nfor donations to schools located in empowerment zones, enterprise \ncommunities and Indian reservations. The Department of Commerce report \nhighlights the need to encourage school computer donation in these \nnotoriously under-served communities and we want to target donations \ntoward these communities.\n  Finally, our bill requires an operating system to be included on a \ndonated computer's hard drive in order to qualify for the tax credit. \nThis will ensure students and seniors don't get empty computer shells, \nbut the brains that drive the computers.\n  Our legislation is supported by a wide range of business and \neducation groups. Leaders of technology associations, like the \nInformation Technology Industry Council and TechNet, and the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers have joined education associations, such \nas the National Association of Secondary School Principals and the \nNational Association of State University and Land Grant Colleges, in \nsupport of the amendment.\n  The Digital Millennium Classrooms Act promotes digital recycling. It \nwill encourage companies to put their used computers into classrooms \ninstead of into landfills. It will help build a safety net under \nstudents trying to cross the digital divide. I thank my colleagues for \nsupporting this amendment, and again wish to commend Senator Abraham \nfor his leadership on this legislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as one who has advocated tax relief and \nreform for American families throughout my 17 years in Congress, I \nwelcome the opportunity to speak on the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999.\n  Americans want, need, and deserve tax relief. The government takes \ntoo much of the American people's earnings to fund the bloated \nbureaucracy in Washington. The notion that the government knows better \nthan families how to spend their money is absurd. Americans should be \nable to keep much more of their hard-earned money to use and invest for \nthemselves and their family's future.\n  Not only do Americans want and need tax relief, they also deserve \nfundamental reform of our unfair and overly complex tax code. For \nyears, and this bill is no exception, we have compounded the tax code's \ncomplexity and put tax loopholes for special interests ahead of tax \nrelief for working families. The result is a tax code that is a \nbewildering 44,000 page catalogue of favors for a privileged few and a \nchamber of horrors for the rest of America--except perhaps the \naccountants and lawyers.\n  No one can possibly believe it's fair to tax your salary, your \ninvestments, your property, your expenses, your marriage, and your \ndeath. Taxes claim nearly 40 percent of the average taxpayer's income. \nThis is simply not right.\n  This bill takes several steps toward relieving that excessive tax \nburden, and I congratulate the Chairman and his colleagues on the \nSenate Finance Committee for their hard work in crafting this bill for \nthe Senate's consideration.\n  There are many good provisions in this bill, and I intend to support \nit in the hope that a conference agreement can be reached that provides \nmeaningful tax relief and that the President will sign into law. \nHowever, I am concerned that the majority of the tax relief proposed in \nthis bill will not be available to taxpayers for several years. The \nbill also excludes other very good ideas but includes several \nprovisions that are clearly intended to benefit special interests. I \nhope the amendment process, limited though it is by the Senate's arcane \nrules for dealing with reconciliation measures, will improve it before \nwe are asked to vote on final passage.\n  Mr. President, the latest reports project a nearly $3 trillion \nfederal budget surplus over the next 10 years. About two-thirds of the \nprojected surplus comes from Social Security payroll taxes that are \ndeposited in the Social Security Trust Funds, and must be kept away \nfrom spendthrift politicians to ensure that Social Security benefits \nare paid as promised. Our first priority must be to lock up the Social \nSecurity Trust Funds to prevent Presidential or Congressional raids on \nworkers' retirement funds to pay for so-called ``emergency'' spending \nor new big government programs. Most Americans don't share the view \nthat dubious pork-barrel projects, such as millions of dollars in \nassistance to reindeer ranchers and maple sugar producers, should be \ntreated as emergencies to be paid for with their Social Security taxes, \nbut that is what Congress did earlier this year.\n  That leaves nearly $1 trillion in non-Social Security revenue \nsurpluses. Now, the typical Washington response would be to spend the \nmoney on new government programs and bureaucracies. Let me state very \nclearly that I vehemently oppose the view that ``growing government'' \nshould be a national priority. To the contrary, our goal should be to \ncontinue to shrink the size of the federal government, returning more \npower and money to the people.\n  I firmly believe a healthy portion of the projected non-Social \nSecurity surplus should be returned to the American people in the form \nof tax cuts. I also believe we have a responsibility to balance the \nneed for tax relief with other pressing national priorities.\n  After locking up the Social Security surpluses, I would dedicate 62 \npercent of the remaining $1 trillion in non-Social Security surplus \nrevenues, or about $620 billion, to shore up the Social Security Trust \nFunds, extending the solvency of the Social Security system until at \nleast the middle of the next century. The President promised to save \nSocial Security, but he failed to include this proposal anywhere in his \nbudget submission. In fact, he has since proposed or supported spending \nbillions of dollars from the surplus on other government programs, \ndepleting the funds needed to ensure retirement benefits are paid as \npromised.\n  I would also reserve 10 percent of the non-Social Security surplus to \nprotect the Medicare system, and use 5 percent to begin paying down our \n$5.6 trillion national debt.\n  With the remaining $230 billion in surplus revenues, plus about $300 \nbillion raised by closing inequitable corporate tax loopholes and \nending unnecessary spending subsidies, I would provide meaningful tax \nrelief that benefits Americans and fuels the economy.\n  My tax relief plan, which was filed as an amendment to this bill, \nprovides slightly more than $500 billion in tax relief over 10 years, \ntargeted toward lower- and middle-income Americans, family farmers and \nsmall businessmen, and families. The bill before the Senate includes \nprovisions that are similar to some of the proposals included in my \nplan.\n  The bill does provide relief from the marriage penalty and gift and \nestate taxes, but these important provisions do not take effect for \nseveral years. I believe we should repeal, once and for all, the \ndisgraceful tax penalty that punishes couples who want to get married. \nWe should also slash the death tax that prevents a father or a mother \nfrom leaving the hard-earned fruits of their labor to their children. \nWhy wait five or seven years to provide some relief from these onerous \nand unfair taxes?\n  The bill properly targets the lowest 15 percent tax bracket for a \none-percent rate reduction and provides for a gradual increase in the \nupper limit of the bracket. My plan would also expand this bracket to \nallow as many as 17 million more Americans to pay taxes at the lowest \nrate.\n  The bill also increases the income threshold for tax-deferred \ncontributions to IRAs, but not until 2008, and very gradually increases \nthe amount that employees can contribute each year to employer-\nsponsored retirement plans. We should make these increases effective \nimmediately to encourage more Americans to save now for their \nretirement.\n\n  What the bill before the Senate does not do is provide much-needed \nincentives for saving. Restoring to every American the tax exemption \nfor the first $200 in interest and dividend income would go a long way \ntoward reversing the abysmal savings rate in this country.\n\n[[Page S9924]]\n\n  Most important, we must eliminate immediately the Social Security \nearnings test. This tax unfairly penalizes senior citizens who choose \nto, or have to, work by taking away $1 of their Social Security \nbenefits for every $3 they earn. There is no justifiable reason to \nforce seniors with decades of knowledge and expertise out of the \nworkforce by imposing such a punitive tax.\n  Many of the other provisions in this bill that provide tax relief for \neducation, health care, and other issues important to American families \nare implemented gradually or simply delayed for several years. \nLikewise, some of the provisions that benefit small businesses and tax-\nexempt organizations do not take effect for a number of years. In fact, \nless than half of the 120 provisions in this bill provide any tax \nrelief at all in the year 2000. Those tax cuts that do take effect \nimmediately amount to just $5 billion of the nearly $800 billion total \ntax cuts in the bill.\n  But look at some of the provisions that do take effect immediately:\n  --A provision to extend the tax credit for electricity produced from \nwind and closed-loop biomass sources, and also extend the credit to \nelectricity produced from poultry waste, which is defined to include \nrice hulls, wood shavings, straw, bedding, and other litter. This \nprovision goes into effect immediately, and will cost $1.6 billion over \n10 years.\n  --A provision to exempt individuals with foreign addresses from \npaying the 7.5 percent air passenger ticket tax on frequent flier \nmiles, leaving American passengers to pay for our over-burdened air \ntraffic control system. The provision goes into effect on January 1, \n2000, and will cost $238 million over 10 years.\n  --A provision that exempts small seaplanes from paying ticket taxes. \nThis provision goes into effect on December 31, 1999, and will cost $11 \nmillion over 10 years.\n  --A provision to reduce the excise tax, from 12.4 percent to 11 \npercent, on component parts of arrows used for hunting fish and game \nthat measure 18 inches overall or more in length. This provision takes \neffect immediately.\n  How can we justify giving a $33 million tax break next year to \ncompanies producing electricity from chicken waste, when senior \ncitizens have to forego some of their Social Security benefits if they \nmust work to make ends meet. How can we justify writing off $15 million \nin revenue next year from people from other countries who fly to the \nU.S., when American families get absolutely no relief from the \negregious marriage penalty until 2005?\n  Mr. President, as I have said, there are many good provisions in this \nbill which reflect the hard work and difficult decisions that Chairman \nRoth and the Finance Committee faced. They have worked hard to do the \nbest we can for the American people who need and deserve relief from \nexcessive taxation and a burdensome tax code.\n  I intend to vote for this bill, even though I know, as do my \ncolleagues, that the President has pledged to veto both the Senate and \nHouse tax bills. Neither bill will ever become law, and the American \npeople will never see a nickel's cut in their taxes, if the President \nhas his way. That is the unfortunate reality that the conferees on this \nmeasure must recognize as they work to craft a meaningful tax relief \nbill that can be enacted and implemented for the benefit of the \nAmerican people.\n  I will vote for this bill to move the process along and send this \nbill to conference with the House. What will matter at the end is that \nwe focus on crafting a bill that can become law so that the American \ntaxpayers get the relief they deserve and need. I have put forward a \nplan, described briefly here, that I believe can be a starting point \nfor meaningful and achievable tax cuts. I urge the conferees on this \nlegislation to focus on a conference agreement that the President will \nsign and that will become law this year. That is what the American \npeople want and need.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my thoughts and observations on the Senate's consideration of \nS. 1429, The Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999.\n  Regrettably, in choosing to pass this bill, the Senate has missed a \nunique opportunity to provide Americans with long-term economic \nstability, improved retirement and health security for seniors, and \ntargeted tax cuts for working families.\n  Instead, the Senate has adopted--along largely partisan lines--a \npackage of reckless and fiscally irresponsible tax cuts that threatens \nour economic prosperity and short-changes our commitment to Social \nSecurity, Medicare, education, and other priorities.\n  Let me briefly express my concerns about this legislation in more \ndetail.\n  First, it would harm the country's long-term economic prospects. I \nfind it somewhat ironic that many of our Republican colleagues applaud \nFederal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's economic stewardship, yet choose \nto ignore his warnings about the ill-considered implications of their \ntax plan. In fact, the Chairman has made abundantly clear that this tax \npackage will stimulate an economy that is already performing at a high \nlevel. That will only contribute to the kinds of inflationary pressures \nthat have already caused the Fed to recently raise interest rates. The \nfurther irony, of course, is that, as we all know, an increase in \ninterest rates acts as a hidden tax on taxpayers. So by contributing to \na hike in interest rates, this tax package could actually have the \neffect of raising the cost of a mortgage loan, a car loan, a student \nloan, and so many other items upon which working families depend.\n  Second, S. 1429 fails the test of tax fairness. According to the \nDepartment of the Treasury, nearly 67 percent of the tax cuts would \nbenefit the wealthiest 20 percent of families. Only 12 percent of the \ntax benefits are targeted at the bottom 60 percent of income earners. \nThe bill contains estate tax relief that eases tax burdens for those \nwith estates exceeding $10,000,000 in worth. Is this middle America? I \ndon't believe so. Meanwhile, the Majority has once again refused to \nextend child care tax credits to people earning less than $28,000.\n  The Republicans stress the importance of securing the solvency of \nSocial Security and Medicare. Again, it is a cruel irony that, at \nprecisely the time early in the next century that Medicare is scheduled \nto become insolvent and Social Security surpluses are expected to \ndisappear, the cost of the Majority's tax cut will begin to skyrocket \nto almost $2 trillion. As the baby boomers begin to retire and the \nsolvency needle approaches zero, the Republicans have left virtually \nnothing to secure the viability of these important programs for future \ngenerations of retirees.\n  Drastic cuts to domestic and defense spending are a third consequence \nof this ill-conceived tax bill. It will have the effect, if not the \nintent, of crowding out investments in critical domestic and defense \npriorities. This bill assumes cuts in defense of $198 billion and cuts \nof $511 billion in discretionary priorities. As a result, 375,000 \nchildren would be cut from the Head Start program, 1.4 million veterans \nwould be denied much needed medical services from VA hospitals, and \napproximately 1.25 million low-income tenants would lose rental \nsubsidies in FY 2009. Even more troublesome is the fact that if defense \nspending is funded at the President's request, cuts in domestic \nspending would be as high as 40 percent.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply disturbed not only by the details of this \ntax plan but also by the erosion of the integrity of the budget process \nthat it represents. It is premised on accounting gimmicks, false \nassumptions, and budgetary slights of hand to achieve its desired \nnumbers on spending and revenues. That was tried in the 1980's, with \ndisastrous results. In this decade, we have restored the integrity of \nthe budget process. In some ways, that is an achievement almost as \nimportant as balancing the budget itself, since it has given confidence \nto taxpayers and financial markets that the Administration and Congress \ncan keep its fiscal house in order. Now, with S. 1429, we risk simply \nsquandering the gains that have been made. This distorted process using \nbudgetary smoke and mirrors will, I fear, lead this nation down a \nprecarious path in years to come.\n  This is not to say that I do not support some reasonable tax relief \ntargeted at those who need it the most. But just as no family would \nleave for vacation without making sure that their bills could be paid, \nthe Congress should not provide tax cuts without first meeting our \nobligations to\n\n[[Page S9925]]\n\nstrengthen Social Security and Medicare, reduce the debt, and invest in \ndefense and domestic priorities. What the supporters of this bill have \ndone is essentially to buy a vacation without making sure they could \npay for the necessities.\n  Senator Moynihan's amendment struck the proper balance among these \nimportant obligations by devoting one-third of the surplus to \ndiscretionary spending, one-third to paying down the debt, and $290 \nbillion in tax cuts for low and middle income Americans. It would have, \namong other provisions, increased the standard deduction for the 73 \npercent of Americans who claim the standard deduction, provided a 100 \npercent deduction for health insurance for the self-employed, and \noffered a 25 percent credit for employers who operate child care \ncenters on site or who help employees pay the cost of off-site child \ncare. This is broad-based tax relief targeted to the people who need it \nthe most. While the Dodd-Jeffords amendment on child care was adopted \nby voice vote, regrettably the Moynihan amendment did not prevail. Nor \ndid other important amendments. Chief among these was Senator Kennedy's \nefforts to provide a much needed prescription drug benefit. Three-\nquarters of American seniors lack dependable private sector coverage of \nprescription drugs. Yet seniors increasingly rely on new and often \ncostly medicines to preserve their health and prolong their life. In a \nbill providing $792 billion in tax breaks, I regret that the Senate \ncould not find $49 billion for modest drug coverage for seniors.\n  My friend and colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, along \nwith Senator Hollings, offered an important amendment that would have \nstricken all of S. 1429's provisions, effectively eliminating the tax \ncut for now. The surplus would have then been used to pay down the \ndebt. I voted in favor of this amendment not as a statement against all \ntax cuts, but rather to support its message of fiscal responsibility \nand to express my utter opposition to the Majority's tax bill.\n  Mr. President, in simple terms, tax cut may be compared to apple pie. \nEveryone likes them. Everyone would like a slice. But we have other \nresponsibilities. We should provide tax cuts, but we should take care \nof our other priorities as well. Especially now, when economic times \nare as good as they have been in our lifetimes, we should build a \nstrong foundation for long-term prosperity by reducing the national \ndebt, strengthening Social Security and Medicare, boosting our national \ndefense, and investing in education, the environment, and other vital \npriorities. The bill that has just passed the Senate fails to do that. \nI remain optimistic that in conference we can craft legislation that is \nmore faithful to our shared vision of future prosperity and stability \nfor all Americans.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the amendment I submitted would reduce \nthe capital gains holding period for horses from 24 months to 12 months \nand would correct an inequity in the tax code that has discriminated \nagainst the horse industry since 1969. Currently, all capital assets--\nwith the exception of horses and cattle--qualify for the lowest capital \ngains tax rate if held for 12 months. This discrepancy in the tax code \nis simply not fair to the horse industry and must be changed.\n  The horse industry is extremely important to our economy, and \naccounts for thousands of jobs. Whether it is owning, breeding, racing, \nor showing horses--or simply enjoying an afternoon ride along a trail--\none in thirty-five Americans is touched by the horse industry. In \nKentucky alone, the horse industry has an economic impact of $3.4 \nbillion, involving 150,000 horses and more than 50,000 employees.\n  What supports this industry is the investment in the horses \nthemselves. Much like other businesses, outside investments are \nessential to the operation and growth of the horse industry. Without \nothers willing to buy and breed horses, it is impossible for the \nindustry to remain competitive. The 2-year holding period ultimately \ndiscourages investment, putting this industry--and the 1.4 million jobs \nit supports nationwide--at risk. Clearly, this is bad economic policy \nand must be changed.\n  The two-year holding period for horses is sorely outdated. It was \nestablished in 1969, primarily as an anti-tax shelter provision. Since \nthen, there have been a number of changes in the tax code. \nSpecifically, the passive loss limitations have been adopted, putting \nan end to these previous tax loopholes.\n  Although horses are categorized as livestock, they have an entirely \ndifferent function than other animals, like cattle. While both are \nlivestock, the investment in these two animals is entirely different. \nBeef is a commodity, with a finite and generally short life span. \nHowever, horses--whether they are used for racing, showing, or \nworking--are frequently bought and sold multiple times over their \nlonger life in order to maximize the return on the owner's investment. \nAdditionally, once horses retire from the track or show arena, they \ncontinue to enhance their value through breeding.\n  The cost of my amendment will be completely offset by postponing for \none year the 7.5 percent Air Passenger Ticket Tax that has been \nproposed on the frequent flier miles for persons with foreign \naddresses. Changes to the capital gains holding period for horses would \ngo into effect in 2001 and the Air Passenger Ticket Tax would also go \ninto effect in 2001.\n  There is no sound argument for distinguishing horses from other \ncapital assets. The two-year holding period discriminates against the \nhorse industry and must be reduced. I urge my colleagues to join me in \ncorrecting this unfair tax policy.\n\n\n                          Veterans Health Care\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I filed a motion to protect veterans' \nhealth care because veterans are apt to be hurt by the tax reduction \nbill before us. I was joined in this effort by Senators Mikulski, \nBryan, Daschle, Harkin, and Bingaman. Senator Mikulski, as vice chair \nof VA Appropriations Subcommittee, and my other cosponsors all \nunderstand what is at stake here. I did not proceed in offering this \nmotion, however, because Senator Wellstone offered a similar motion.\n  The issue raised by my amendment still applies to this tax bill. It \nis very simple: approval of this $800 billion tax reduction bill leaves \nno ability to meet our obligations to veterans. If we spend all of the \nfederal surplus on tax giveaways, there will be nothing left to fund \nveterans' health care.\n  In my view, the Senate Finance Committee needed to rethink this tax \nbill and reserve $8.5 billion over 5 years to appropriately fund VA \nhealth care.\n  This is simple math. My motion instructed the Finance Committee to \nprovide for slightly more than 1 percent of the tax cut included in the \nbill before us. I want to repeat that--it would have set aside about 1 \npercent of the tax cut included in the bill for veterans.\n  The amount included in the motion--$8.5 billion over 5 years--has \nbeen fully justified by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs in its Views \nand Estimates letter to the Committee on the Budget.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 1999.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman,\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     Ranking Minority Member,\n     Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Pete and Frank: Pursuant to section 301(d) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Committee on Veterans' \n     Affairs (hereafter, ``Committee'') hereby reports to the \n     Committee on the Budget its views and estimates on the fiscal \n     year 2000 (hereafter, ``FY 00'') budget for veterans' \n     programs within the Committee's jurisdiction. This report is \n     submitted in fulfillment of the Committee's obligation to \n     provide recommendations for programs in Function 700 \n     (Veterans' Benefits and Services) and for certain veterans' \n     programs included in Function 500 (Education, Training, \n     Employment, and Social Services).\n\n                               I. Summary\n\n       VA requires over $3 billion in additional discretionary \n     account funding in FY 00 to support its medical care \n     operations: an additional $1.26 billion to meet unanticipated \n     spending requirements; an additional $853.1 million to \n     overcome the effects of inflation and other \n     ``uncontrollables'' in order that it might maintain current \n     services; and at least $1 billion in additional funding to \n     better address the needs of an aging, and increasingly \n     female, veterans population. At\n\n[[Page S9926]]\n\n     this time, however, we limit our request to $1.7 billion in \n     additional FY 00 medical care funding. We believe that this \n     level of additional funding, coupled with ongoing VA efforts \n     to gain efficiencies and passage of VA Medicare subvention \n     legislation this year, will allow VA to meet veterans' \n     medical care needs in FY 00.\n       With respect to mandatory account programs, the Budget \n     Committee has already approved provisions of S. 4, the \n     ``Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights \n     Act of 1999,'' which will raise VA mandatory account spending \n     by $3.8 billion over fiscal years 2000-2004. We do not \n     request ``pay-go'' relief beyond that amount. We will, \n     however, anticipate the availability of such funds in the \n     event that S. 4 falters.\n\n                          II. General Comments\n\n       We note at the outset that the Nation's veterans have \n     already contributed significantly to the cause of fiscal \n     restraint. On the mandatory account side, numerous money-\n     saving measures, unanimously approved by the Committee's \n     membership in both 1996 and 1997, were enacted into law as \n     Title VIII of Public Law 105-33, the ``Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997.'' Relative to baseline assumptions then in effect, \n     these measures are resulting in savings of $2.783 billion in \n     mandatory account outlays over fiscal years 1998 through \n     2002. In addition, the statutory bar on VA compensation for \n     disabilities stemming from in-service tobacco use, approved \n     as section 8202 of the ``Transportation Equity Act for the \n     21st Century,'' Public Law 105-178, has resulted in net \n     savings of $15.2 billion during fiscal years 1999 through \n     2003.\n       In addition to these mandatory account savings, the \n     Balanced Budget Act froze veterans' programs discretionary \n     spending outlays through fiscal year 2002. This freeze has \n     required--and will continue to require at an accelerating \n     pace--unacceptable cuts in veterans' discretionary spending, \n     particularly medical care spending, even after projected \n     third-party receipt/Medical Care Cost Recovery (MCCF) funds \n     are collected. Whatever the merits of this plan when enacted, \n     it was passed before budgetary surpluses has materialized. \n     The freeze on medical care funding can no longer be \n     justified. It must now be lifted.\n       Regrettably, the Administration has proposed a budget that \n     would impose further cuts in veterans' medical care programs \n     by freezing appropriated medical care funding at $17.306 \n     billion, the FY 99 appropriation. Since VA anticipates an \n     increase in MCCF receipts of only $124 million in FY 00, \n     overall medical care spending would increase under the \n     Administration's plan by less than \\7/10\\'s of 1%. This is \n     unacceptable; after three years of flat-line medical care \n     appropriations, VA requires, at minimum, a 10% (or $1.7 \n     billion) increase in appropriated funding.\n\n                  III. Discretionary Account Spending\n\n\n                   a. proposed medical care spending\n\n       The standstill level of funding proposed by the \n     Administration for FY 00 medical care spending is inadequate \n     for VA to fulfill unanticipated spending requirements imposed \n     on VA by events outside the Department's control. Indeed, the \n     proposed flat-line budget will not even allow VA to maintain \n     current services. Clearly, the budget will not permit VA to \n     better address the single most pressing, and least met, \n     medical need of the World War II/Korean War veteran \n     generation: long-term care. Nor is it sufficient for VA to \n     serve the growing cohort of female veterans. Thus, budget \n     relief is imperative.\n     1. Unanticipated VA spending requirements--$1.26 billion\n       VA will require an additional $1.26 billion in FY 00 to \n     meet care requirements which could not be anticipated when \n     the Balanced Budget Act was enacted.\n       Hepatitis C treatment\n       Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is today the most common chronic \n     bloodborne infection in the United States. The Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports highest \n     prevalence rates among males aged 30-49 and intravenous drug \n     users. VA studies now indicate that at least 20% of \n     hospitalized veteran-patients test positive for HCV, twice \n     the rate reported among the population generally.\n       No vaccine against hepatitis C exits, nor is there a cure. \n     And while it is true that HCV was first identified in the \n     late 1980's no treatment regime was generally recognized \n     until last year, when a recommended drug therapy of \n     interferon and ribavirin was approved. This drug therapy \n     alone cost $13,200 per patient--costs that VA did not \n     anticipate prior to approval of this treatment regime in late \n     1998. Related testing, biopsy and other costs amount to an \n     additional $1,820 per patient.\n       VA anticipates that of the 3.3 million patients it will \n     treat in FY 00, 36,300 will be candidates for HCV drug \n     therapy. Taking into account the completion of treatments \n     initiated in FY 99, VA will require an additional $625 \n     million in FY 00 to respond to this unanticipated medical \n     challenge.\n       Emergency medical services\n       VA currently provides enrolled veterans with a full range \n     of hospital care and medical services. It does not, however, \n     generally provide comprehensive emergency care services. \n     Rather, VA patients must rely on insurance they may have to \n     defray such expenses, or pay for such expenses themselves.\n       The Administration intends to propose legislation this year \n     declaring that emergency care is a basic right of all \n     Americans. Such legislation would, reportedly, require that \n     all health care plans provide such care, as a matter of \n     right, to the enrollees. In such circumstances, VA will be \n     compelled to offer emergency care services to its enrollees, \n     either directly or more likely, by reimbursing fees charged \n     by other providers. Prior to the development of the \n     Administration's proposal on the issue, VA had not \n     anticipated the assumption of this added responsibility. \n     Legislation requiring VA to pay for emergency care provided \n     to veterans by non-VA medical facilities has already been \n     introduced in the House and will be advanced in the Senate.\n       VA estimates the costs of providing emergency care services \n     and subsequent hospital admission to VA enrolles will be $548 \n     million in FY 00.\n       Weapons of mass destruction preparedness\n       In response to Public Law 105-114, VA has enchanced its \n     role in assisting the Department of Health and Human Services \n     (HHS) in stockpiling antidotes and other pharmaceuticals \n     needed for response to potential domestic terrorist attacks \n     with weapons of mass destruction. VA medical facilities \n     are dispersed nationwide and thus, along with Department \n     of Defense hospitals located within the continental U.S., \n     they are natural depositories of drugs, supplies and other \n     materials which might be needed to respond to such \n     emergencies.\n       VA participation in preparatory activities is cost-\n     efficient--but it is not without costs. Such costs, which had \n     not been anticipated by VA prior to enactment of Public Law \n     105-114, will amount to $14.619 million in FY 00.\n       Increased prosthetic costs\n       VA expenditures in meeting the prosthetic device needs of \n     its patients--needs which include not only artificial limbs \n     and the like, but also more conventional aids such as hearing \n     aids, eyeglasses, walkers, etc.--have increased markedly \n     between 1993 and 1998, at annual rates of up to 18.90%. A \n     portion of those increases are an unanticipated side effect \n     of ``eligibility reform'' legislation, enacted in 1996, which \n     allows VA to enroll all veterans, subject to available \n     funding, for VA medical care. That legislation appears to \n     have stimulated demand for VA services among persons needing \n     such devices.\n       Even after general inflation is factored out, VA \n     anticipates that its prosthetic device expenses will increase \n     by a rate of 14.8%. VA will require an additional $74.075 \n     million to defray these expenses in FY 00.\n     2. Current services--$853.1 million\n       We have closely observed VA's recent efforts to restructure \n     to deliver health care services to the Nation's veterans more \n     efficiently. Generally, we are satisfied with VA's effort, \n     and we acknowledge that fiscal restraints have been--and will \n     continue to be--a stimulus to change. Nonetheless, we believe \n     that a fourth consecutive year of non-growth in the medical \n     care budget would be destructive.\n       As anyone who pays medical bills or health insurance \n     premiums knows, medical costs are rising. Payroll inflation, \n     increases in the costs of goods, and other \n     ``uncontrollables'' dictate funding increases of $853.1 \n     million in FY 00 just to maintain current service levels.\n       Health care is an extremely labor-intensive enterprise; \n     that is why VA is the largest civilian agency, in terms of \n     employment, in the Federal government. Can labor efficiencies \n     be wrung out of health care systems, VA included? Most \n     assuredly so, as demonstrated by the annual shrinkage of VA's \n     medical labor force (from 201,000 in FY 95 to 174,000 in FY \n     00) even as the number of veterans treated during that period \n     increased by almost 40% (from 2.6 million to 3.6 million). \n     But even with the shrinkage of VA's medical labor pool, VA's \n     medical care payroll costs will increase by $562.6 million in \n     FY 00 due to non-optional cost-of-living and within-grade \n     salary and wage adjustments, and increases in Government-paid \n     Social Security, health insurance, retirement, and other \n     benefit costs.\n       Other inflation-related cost increases must also be borne \n     by the Veterans Health Administration. While VA has \n     implemented an aggressive pharmaceutical management program \n     which has saved more than $350 million--making VA the model \n     for Medicare, DOD and others to emulate--increases in VA's \n     annual pharmaceutical costs, medical and non-medical supply \n     costs, leased building space costs, and the like, will \n     account for an additional $267.1 million. Finally, the \n     Veterans Health Administration will be required to absorb an \n     additional $23.4 million in other uncontrollable expenses \n     (e.g., State home and CHAMPVA workload increases, storage and \n     space requirements, additional calendar day costs, etc.)\n       It is imperative that the Budget Committee understand that \n     requiring VA to absorb such cost increases continually must \n     result, at some point, in cuts in the amount of care--or, \n     more alarmingly, in the quality of care--which VA provides. \n     We have documented serious quality problems, e.g., an \n     increase in dangerous pressure ulcer sores, which appear to \n     be directly associated with inpatient staffing shortfalls. \n     With respect to outpatient care access, waiting times for \n     appointments for routine services have reached 100 days or \n     longer. Mental health services are simply unavailable at 60% \n     of VA's outpatient clinics.\n       In short, VA operates in a national environment where \n     medical care cost inflation exceeds the general inflation \n     rate by a factor of more than two; if the medical care \n     inflation rate, 3.6% were to be applied to VA's fiscal year \n     1999 medical care budget, on that\n\n[[Page S9927]]\n\n     basis alone a funding increase of $650 million would be \n     justified. Yet VA is required to--and is succeeding in--\n     treating more patients with funding that is declining in real \n     terms. Such a situation cannot persist into a fourth year \n     without drastically affecting quality.\n     3. Unmet needs--$1 billion +\n       The foregoing discussion has focused on additional funding \n     of $2 billion needed to meet unanticipated requirements and \n     to maintain current services. Further funding increases of $1 \n     billion or more are required to address the two largest unmet \n     needs VA faces due to demographic shifts in the veterans' \n     population: long-term care for aging World War II and Korea \n     veterans, and maternity and reproductive health services for \n     the growing number of female veterans.\n       Long-term care\n       In our view, the health care issue that VA must face over \n     the intermediate term--indeed, the health care issue that the \n     Nation must face over the next decade--is the need for long-\n     term care among the aging World War II generation. WWII \n     veterans saved Western civilization. We cannot turn our backs \n     on them now.\n       The Budget Committee can anticipate an extended dialog with \n     the Committee on Veterans' Affairs on this issue. For now, we \n     advise that, at minimum, an additional $1 billion per year in \n     funding will be necessary, starting in FY 00, to begin \n     addressing the needs of VA patients who seek long-term care. \n     For the most part, such funding would not be directed to new \n     programs. Rather, it would be devoted to providing VA-\n     supplied, State home-supplied, or VA- supported contract/\n     community-based care. These programs are, in our view, \n     effective. But they are grossly underfunded and do not \n     begin to meet the WWII generation's need for long-term \n     care services. In addition, we anticipate other \n     initiatives--e.g., increased VA support for State \n     veterans' homes in the form of both increased per diem \n     payments and pharmaceutical supplies, and initiatives to \n     transfer excess VA property in exchange for cash to \n     support medical operations or discounted medical services \n     to VA-eligible patients.\n       Maternity benefits and reproductive health services\n       Women now make up 13% of the active duty military. At lower \n     ranks, the percentage of women serving is higher. For \n     example, 20% of new recruits to the services other than the \n     U.S. Marine Corps are now women. These women will become \n     veterans, and VA must be prepared to meet their care needs. \n     Such needs invariably include maternity benefits and \n     reproductive health services since 62% of all women veterans \n     are under the age of 45, when childbearing generally ends. \n     Women who are drawn to service with a promise of benefits, \n     and then induced to enroll for VA care with the promise of a \n     full continuum of care, rightfully demand that their basic \n     health care needs be met.\n\n\n                    b. medical facility construction\n\n       As noted above, we are generally satisfied with VA's \n     efforts to restructure the delivery of health care services. \n     VA's construction programs, however, have not kept pace with \n     changes needed to accommodate the structural reorganization. \n     Older hospitals designed around an outmoded inpatient \n     treatment model lack space to handle increased outpatient \n     demand. In addition, such facilities generally fall far short \n     of modern patient privacy, handicapped accessibility, fire \n     sprinkler, and air conditioning standards. At best, these \n     shortcomings hinder VA's ability to attract veterans into the \n     system. At worst, they seriously compromise patient safety.\n       Two construction projects which would rectify such \n     shortcomings warrant particular mention. The first is a $29.7 \n     million outpatient clinic expansion at the VA Medical Center \n     in Washington, DC, which was authorized by Public Law 105-\n     368. The second is a relatively modest ($10.8 million) \n     environmental improvements project at VA's Medical and \n     Regional Office Center in Fargo, ND. That project would \n     address asbestos removal, fire prevention, patient privacy, \n     and handicapped accessibility needs. We particularly request \n     funding for these projects in FY 00.\n\n\n    c. general operating expenses--veterans benefits administration\n\n       In a reversal of recent trends, in the last two years the \n     Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) has experienced \n     increases in both the size of the pending compensation and \n     pension case backlog, and the average ``age'' of cases which \n     comprise the backlog. At the same time, the quality of VBA \n     decision making has not improved sufficiently despite \n     promises of improvements which were the rationale for a \n     slowdown in case processing. Internal VA reviews indicate an \n     error rate of 36%.\n       VBA requests $49 million in additional funding to support \n     an FY 00 personnel increase of 164 FTE. These new hires \n     would, according to VBA, join personnel shifted from other \n     duties to yield a net addition of 440 staff devoted to \n     adjudication functions. We have seen no specific plan which \n     identifies the source of the majority of these transferred \n     employees, so we must question whether this plan will \n     actually materialize. We do, however, support VBA's request \n     for an additional $49 million in funding to add new \n     adjudication staff. In addition, we believe that the \n     adjudication backlog must be attacked now using current staff \n     in a one-time, targeted, and carefully controlled overtime \n     effort.\n\n                IV. Projected Mandatory Account Spending\n\n\n                    a. education assistance programs\n\n       As part of the ``Soldiers', Sailors', Airmens' and Marines' \n     Bill of Rights Act of 1999,'' the Senate has already \n     approved, without objection from the Budget Committee, the \n     following improvements in VA educational assistance programs: \n     An increase in monthly assistance payments (from $528 to $600 \n     for veterans who served three-year enlistments, and from $325 \n     to $429 for two-year enlistees); a repeal of the requirement \n     that servicemembers contribute $100 per month for 12 months \n     from base pay to ``buy'' eligibility; the allowance of a \n     ``lump sum'' benefit at the beginning of a training term; and \n     a provision allowing veterans to transfer benefits to a \n     spouse and/or children. CBO has estimated that these \n     provisions will result in additional mandatory account costs \n     of $3.8 billion over fiscal years 2000-2004, and $13 billion \n     over fiscal years 2000-2009.\n       Had this business been conducted in the regular order, \n     these improvements would have been considered by the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs, the committee of primary \n     jurisdiction. Our committee, perhaps would have recommended a \n     different mix of program improvements--e.g., the Commission \n     on Servicemembers and Veterans Transition Assistance had \n     recommended enactment of a tuition-reimbursment benefits \n     program like that in force after World War II. We did not, \n     however, impede these Armed Services Committee-reported \n     measures, and we continue to support them. Of course, we \n     reserve the right to revisit the issue within our committee \n     irrespective of the fate of the ``Soldiers', Sailors', \n     Airmens' and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999.'' We almost \n     certainly will do so should that legislation falter.\n\n                             V. Conclusion\n\n       In summary, VA requires at least $1.26 billion in \n     additional discretionary account funding to meet \n     unanticipated spending requirements that have been thrust \n     upon VA by events beyond VA's control; an additional $853.1 \n     million to overcome the effects of inflation and \n     other ``uncontrollables'' and maintain current services \n     for eligible veterans; and at least $1 billion in \n     additional discretionary account funding to begin to \n     better address the needs of an aging, and increasingly \n     female, veterans population. These needs total over $3 \n     billion.\n       We do not request, however, that discretionary account \n     ceilings be raised $3 billion+ for FY 00. While such an \n     increase would be totally justified to make up for flat VA \n     medical care funding levels over the last three years, we \n     believe that recent budgetary restraints have stimulated \n     needed reform. We believe, further, that VA can squeeze out \n     yet more efficiencies in the way it provides health care, and \n     we would not want to impede such reforms by requesting \n     funding increases beyond VA's ability to absorb them without \n     waste. Thus, we request that VA discretionary spending be \n     allowed to increase by $1.7 billion for FY 00.\n       As for mandatory account spending, we do not, at this time, \n     request a five-year ``pay-go'' waiver beyond the $3.8 billion \n     already acceded to by the Budget Committee.\n       These views reflect our best judgment as of this date. If \n     we can provide further assistance in your consideration of \n     this report, please feel free to call on us.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter,\n       Chairman.\n     John D. Rockefeller, IV,\n       Ranking Minority Member.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is a reasonable amount which \ncovers $853 million in ``automatic'' costs such as inflation and wage \nincreases. It also allows for new initiatives, such as the need to \naddress the dramatic increase in deadly hepatitis C, particularly among \nveterans who served in Vietnam; emergency care; and the rising long-\nterm care needs of World War II veterans.\n  The Conference Report on the Budget Resolution includes this number. \nAnd in an April 30, 1999, letter to the Appropriations Committee, 51 \nSenators are on record supporting it.\n  Even with the economic prosperity our country has recently begun to \nexperience, if we approve the proposed huge tax cuts, or fail to adjust \nthe budget caps, there simply will not be money left to increase the \nveterans' health care budget to what it needs to be.\n  I can assure my colleagues that further cuts will seriously \njeopardize the quality of VA health care. Earlier this week, I spoke \nabout the erosion of VA's programs to help veterans with special needs. \nResource shortfalls have imperiled services for the spinal-cord \ninjured, for blind veterans, for veterans in need of prosthetics, and \nfor veterans in need of mental health care. Health care professionals \nwithin VA are overworked. Reductions-in-force have also become a \nreality for them.\n  In my own state, we are already seeing lapses in the availability of \nhealth\n\n[[Page S9928]]\n\ncare. For example, at the Beckley VA Medical Center, approximately 400 \nnew veterans are waiting to be seen in primary care. Approximately 500 \nveterans already in the system are on a waiting list for hearing \nevaluations. And the caseload in pharmacy has increased over 41 percent \nin the last year, with no increase in staffing, causing many veterans \nto wait two hours or longer to have a prescription filled.\n  At the Martinsburg VA Medical Center, veterans are waiting six months \nfor a urology appointment. In the PTSD program, the number of beds have \nincreased by 14 while the number of staff have been reduced, making \none-on-one counseling very difficult.\n  At the Clarksburg VA Medical Center, current staffing has not kept \npace with the demand for inpatient care, and veterans are too often \nreferred to private hospitals because no beds are available at the VA.\n  In outpatient care at Clarksburg, the waiting times for an \nappointment in optometry and dermatology are approximately four months, \nand in urology, veterans are waiting seven months for an appointment.\n  There has been a recent proposal to close both the inpatient and \noutpatient surgical programs at the Huntington VA Medical Center and to \nrefer veterans to a VAMC in Kentucky, over 130 miles away.\n  I can assure my colleagues that if these things are happening in the \nVA medical centers in my state of West Virginia--and trust me, they \nare--then you can be sure that they are occurring in the VA medical \ncenters in your states, as well.\n  Staff at each of our VA medical centers have been stretched to the \nlimit, and without additional funding, staffing will only get worse. \nThe erosion of services and the huge reductions in staff have already \nput the veterans' health care system in serious jeopardy, and I cannot \nallow it to continue.\n  In summary, there is no doubt that we are at a precipice, and the \nfate of veterans and their families, as well as millions of other \nAmericans, are threatened by this rush to enact hugely bloated tax \ngiveaways.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that a majority of the Senate recognized \nthat the size of this tax bill would have jeopardized veterans' health \ncare. As we proceed to conference, I now hope they will come to the \nsame conclusion about other critical domestic programs and rethink this \ntax cut.\n\n\n                       alternative fuel vehicles\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would like to engage the Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, and the Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch, in a \ncolloquy regarding alternative fuel vehicles. As the chairman knows, \nSenator Hatch and I presented an amendment during the finance \nCommittee's markup of the tax bill, to provide incentives for the sale \nand use of clean alternative motor fuels and alternative fuel vehicles. \nAlthough the amendment has not been included in the legislation we are \nconsidering today, I continue to believe that a tax bill should \nultimately include these provisions.\n  As the Chairman and Senator Hatch know, the increased use of these \nfuels and vehicles will provide substantial environmental and energy \nefficiency benefits. The vehicles targeted for credits by our amendment \nare far less polluting than conventional cars and trucks. So, one \nresult of our amendment would be improved air quality. One study of the \neffect of our proposal estimates that the number of natural gas \nvehicles in operation could more than triple by 2004, exceeding 250,000 \nvehicles. That number would continue to grow exponentially. These cars \nare so much cleaner than gasoline and diesel vehicles that our proposal \ncould eliminate 58,000 tons of smog-forming emissions by 2004. That \nnumber would more than double by 2009. In order to accomplish that \nwithout alternative fuel vehicles, we would have to remove 1.5 million \nconventionally-fueled vehicles from the road.\n  Furthermore, each gallon of alternative fuel used in such a vehicle \nrepresents one less gallon of gasoline that we need to obtain from \nimported oil. The Department of Energy estimates that nearly three \nbillion gallons of gasoline would be displaced, thus reducing our \nforeign oil dependence.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator from Rhode Island is correct. Millions of \nAmericans live in areas that are not in compliance with air quality \nstandards. The increased motor vehicle traffic anticipated in the four \ncounty Wasatch front in my home state of Utah will certainly push us \ntoward non-attainment compliance problems. Promoting the increased use \nof alternative fuel vehicles is a viable option available to help Utah \nachieve our clean air objectives. Alternative fuel vehicles represent \nthe cleanest vehicles in the world. Market-based incentives will help \nencourage the use of such vehicles. I am very pleased to be part of \nthis effort with my colleagues from the Finance Committee and am \nlooking into getting a natural gas car of my own at this very moment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The legislation Senator Hatch and I have drafted would \naddress the problem that currently prevents these fuels and vehicles \nfrom competing on their own in the market. Incentives to make them less \ncostly will stimulate demand and permit the economies of scale that are \nneeded in order for them to gain more widespread use. Our proposal has \nbeen endorsed by a diverse group of stakeholders including the Natural \nResources Defense council, the Union of Concerned Scientists, virtually \nall the major automobile manufacturers, and the American Gas \nAssociation. There is growing bipartisan support in the Senate for many \nof these concepts; on the Finance Committee, Senators Rockefeller, \nBryan, and Robb have all expressed support. I would ask Senator Roth \nwhether there might be an opportunity to consider this legislation and \nwhether he would work with us toward its inclusion in a future tax \npackage.\n  Senator ROTH. I thank my colleagues from Rhode Island and Utah for \ntheir hard work on this legislation. The bipartisan support for this \nproposal is impressive. This is legislation that could make an \nimportant contribution to the environment. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on this effort.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it has taken a lot of tough choices here in \nWashington--and a lot of hard work and restructuring in the private \neconomy--to put our country's budget into the black. For the first time \nin a generation, we have a balanced federal budget. And for the first \ntime in our modern history, we can project substantial surpluses for \nthe foreseeable future.\n  There were times I believed we would never see this day, Mr. \nPresident, but our official forecasts now call for as much as one \ntrillion dollars in surplus over the next ten years. That's on top of \nthe two trillion in Social Security surpluses that will build up over \nthat same time, money that is already promised to future retirees.\n  I want to say something about whether we should count on those \nsurpluses actually materializing, Mr. President, but first I want to \ntalk about what most families I know would do if they woke up to the \nkind of windfall in their household budgets that we anticipate in our \nfederal budget today.\n  Take your average family, Mr. President, with a mortgage, maybe \npaying for one or two children already in college, maybe another child \nwith college still in his or her future. They have some debts, some \nworries about how to pay for a retirement that gets closer every year, \nsome aspirations for their children that they may not be able to \nafford. Maybe Grandma and Grandad have moved in with them, bringing \nwith them some health care problems that add to the family's expenses.\n  Let's assume that after years of spending more than they took in, our \nfamily finally turns the corner. Let's borrow a story from today's new \nhigh-tech economy and say that the stock they hold in their new start-\nup company has just jumped in value. They cannot be sure that the stock \nwill stay that high next year, or the year after that, but they feel a \nwhole lot richer than they did before.\n  Now let's picture the discussion around their kitchen table, with \nthis new problem to discuss. I'm betting that most of the families I \nknow in Delaware would make plans to pay down their past debts, the \nmortgage hanging over their heads, make provisions for their children's \neducation, their parents' health needs, and their own retirement. \nMaybe, after they had taken care of those priorities, they would allow \nthemselves to relax and enjoy a more affluent lifestyle.\n\n[[Page S9929]]\n\n  Mr. President, I don't claim that this is a perfect analogy to the \nsituation before us in the Senate. I certainly don't claim that for \nmany hardworking Americans sensible tax relief is some kind of luxury. \nBut I think it makes an important point, which is simply that most \nAmericans would be a lot more cautious, and a lot more prudent, in \nusing any anticipated surplus in their family budget.\n  Those are the priorities that I think should guide us in our \ndeliberations today. We should take the opportunity given us with the \nexpectation of future budget surpluses first to pay down the debt that \nhas built up in a generation of deficit finance, then we should restore \nsolvency to Social Security and Medicare, and then we should prevent \nfurther erosion in funding for national security, law enforcement, \neducation, and the other basic functions of a space-age, high-\ntechnology, industrial economy.\n  I think we can do all that, Mr. President, and still provide tax \nrelief to the millions of Americans whose hard work and sacrifice--\nthrough downsizing, restructuring, and all the rest--has been the real \ndriving force behind the remarkable economy we enjoy today.\n  But as we all know, Mr. President, the forecasts on which our \nprojected surpluses are based make a lot of assumptions. That's all \nwell and good for making long-term economic projections. But it is not \ngood enough, as far as I'm concerned, for making long term economic \npolicy.\n  I ask my colleagues to listen to some of these assumptions, and to \nanswer honestly if our country can really afford the nearly $800 \nbillion tax cut before us today.\n  The surplus that is forecast assumes no major interruption in the \neconomic growth we have enjoyed in what is now the longest economic \nexpansion in our history. That unprecedented economic growth has \nkept revenues strong enough to meet and exceed our spending plans. But \nas Alan Greenspan has reminded us, it is not a question of if, but \nwhen, that growth will slow. Still, those who call for an $800 billion \ntax cut are basing policy on the false hope that inevitable day will \nnever come.\n\n  Mr. President, the surplus that some of my colleagues want to use to \npay for this tax cut also assumes that there will be no emergencies--no \nBosnias, no Kosovos, no Iraqs, no hurricanes, no floods--that could \nincrease spending, even though we regularly spend an average of $8 \nbillion a year on such emergencies.\n  The surplus also assumes that we will continue deep cuts in national \ndefense, in education, health care, law enforcement, in environmental \nprotection. It assumes that we will continue to reduce spending beyond \nthe current levels, levels that are already causing gridlock in our \nbudget process this year. Right now, Mr. President, spending for the \nbasic functions of government--as well as the number of people we pay \nto perform those functions, down more than 340,000 in the past seven \nyears--are both at levels we have not seen since 1962.\n  We should recognize the hard work that achieved those low numbers, \nMr. President. They are an important part of how we got to where we are \ntoday, with a balanced budget in hand, and surpluses in sight. As the \nprivate sector has become leaner and more efficient, the federal \ngovernment has also moved in the same direction.\n  But we must also realize that national defense, the FBI, medical \nresearch, education, veterans' health care, air traffic control, water \nquality--all of those things we have learned to count on as citizens of \nthe richest nation the world has ever known--combined now comprise just \n6.5 percent of GDP. But the surpluses my colleagues expect to be there \nto pay for this tax cut depend on pushing that down to just 5 percent \nof GDP--a further cut of more than 20 percent.\n  But after years of defense cuts at the end of the Cold War, the \nPentagon is asking for substantial increases to meet future threats. I \nagree with those who see the need for further investments in our \nnation's defense. If we actually increase defense spending to meet that \nrequest, we would have to cut the remaining functions of the federal \ngovernment by almost forty percent.\n  Now, Mr. President, I hear a lot of calls for responsible budgeting \nthese days, but I don't hear many people calling for cutting forty \npercent from our law enforcement, education, or health care programs. \nFor example, cuts of those size would eliminate health care for \n1,430,000 of our country's veterans. Cuts of that size would eliminate \n$6.0 billion from the research into cancer and other diseases at the \nNational Institutes of Health. Cuts of that size would require the FBI \nto cut over 4,000 agents from its current force of 10,600.\n  That's what a $800 billion tax cut would require, Mr. President--\neither cuts of unacceptable size in basic services, or, just as bad, we \nwould simply return to the destructive path of deficit spending.\n  Mr. President, one thing that ought to sober us up is what Alan \nGreenspan has been saying about delaying any tax cut until the \nsurpluses actually materialize, until a downturn in the economy might \njustify the boost that would come from a tax cut. Twice he has come \nhere to Congress in the past two weeks, to tell us that he continues to \nbe concerned about our economy overheating, and that he is prepared to \nbump interest rates up again to prevent that from happening.\n  Every American with a mortgage should think long and hard about the \ntrade off between a tax break now and the long term costs that an \nincrease in interest rates would mean. The Treasury Department \nestimates that a household in the lower 60 percent of the population--\n10 percent above the middle and on down--would get just an average of \n$174 a year from the tax plan before us today. But a one percent \nincrease in a 7 percent mortgage on a $250,000 house amounts to over \n$2,000 a year in additional payments. That is not a deal any informed \nAmerican would take, Mr. President.\n  If Greenspan thinks the economy is already at risk of overheating, \nimagine his reaction if we throw an $800 billion tax cut into his \ncalculations the next time he considers increasing interest rates.\n  Everybody here knows that low interest rates and low inflation have \nbeen the keys that have unlocked the potential of our economy. I can't \nthink of anything more likely to throw both of those keys out the \nwindow than a return to unbalanced budgets.\n  That is why I will oppose a tax cut of the size before us here today. \nNot because Americans don't deserve tax relief--of course they do. But \nthey also deserve our best judgement about how we manage the public \nfinances of their country after so many years of deficit financing. And \nas far as I'm concerned, I'll take my guidance from the common sense of \nthe average American family, and put first the priorities of debt \nreduction, Social Security and Medicare, funding national security and \nlaw enforcement, education and health care, and then, a more prudent, \nsensible tax cut.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I genuinely appreciate the courtesy of the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee (Mr. Roth) for allowing \nme to discuss an innovative new technology more readily available to \nthe dry cleaning industry.\n  Dr. Joe DeSimone, an highly-respected professor on the faculties of \nboth the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and N.C. State \nUniversity in Raleigh has developed an environmentally safe way to dry \nclean clothes while eliminating the millions of pounds of toxic \nsolvents currently now being used to clean clothes, and, at the same \ntime, advancing more energy-efficient technology. This procedure would \ndramatically reduce the dry cleaning industry's reliance on hazardous \nchemicals as solvents.\n  My amendment will allow for a 20 percent tax credit to new and \nexisting dry cleaners who purchase the equipment which uses non-toxic \nsolvents. The equipment includes both wet cleaning and liquid carbon \ndioxide cleaning systems which are now readily available. In fact, the \nEPA recently published a case study extolling the benefits of carbon \ndioxide technology.\n  The Joint Tax Committee estimates the tax credit would decrease \nrevenues by a little more than $500 million during the next 10 years. I \nfind this a modest price to pay considering the amount Americans rely \non dry cleaners and by the fact that so many of these Americans bring \npotentially hazardous chemicals into their homes when they dry clean \ntheir clothes.\n  I believe that clarification of a Treasury regulation's application \nto an international tax treaty would provide an ample offset for this \ntax credit. Let me briefly explain the current situation:\n  Just this month, a judge in New York overturned 19 years of tax \ntreaty policy. The judge ruled that an existing regulation that permits \nthe Treasury to allocate interest based on a company's worldwide \noperations did not comply with the 1980 treaty. I disagree. The \nregulations allowed the U.S. Treasury to disallow abusive tax \nstrategies and make sure that these companies pay their fair share of \ntaxes. Tax treaties are never intended to be a means to avoid taxes, \nsimply a means to prohibit double taxation. This amendment will \ncontinue this policy and avoid a rush for billions of dollars in tax \nrefunds by international corporations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the July \n9 edition of The New York Times entitled ``British Bank Wins Dispute \nWith the IRS'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HELMS. Unfortunately, Mr. President, under the rules of the \nbudget act, my amendment is subject to a point of order. However, I do \nappreciate the willingness of Chairman Roth to work with me to find a \nway to make this tax credit a reality.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 7, 1999]\n\n               British Bank Wins Dispute With the I.R.S.\n\n\n              Judge Rules Tax Treaty Supersedes Regulation\n\n                        (By David Cay Johnston)\n\n       In a stunning defeat for the Internal Revenue Service's \n     efforts to restrict strategies that foreign corporations \n     employ to avoid taxes, a Federal judge ruled in favor of \n     National Westminister Bank P.L.C. of Britain in its demand \n     for a $180 million tax refund.\n       Lawyers who specialize in international corporate tax said \n     yesterday that the decision would prompt more foreign \n     companies to challenge the I.R.S. in future cases and to \n     press for favorable rulings on issues currently in dispute.\n       Judge James T. Turner of the United States Court of Claims \n     ruled Wednesday that the I.R.S had violated a 1980 tax treaty \n     between the United States and Britain by refusing to allow \n     NatWest to deduct interest on loans from its home office and \n     Hong Kong operations to its American branches from 1981 to \n     1987.\n       In effect NatWest was taking money from one pocket, in, \n     say, Hong Kong, and lending it to another pocket in, say, New \n     York. Doing this allowed the bank to reduce its profits, and \n     thus its taxes, in the United States and to shift profits to \n     places, like Hong Kong, where tax rates are lower.\n       The 1980 tax treaty allowed NatWest and all other British \n     banks to take such deductions. NatWest contended that under \n     the tax treaty its American branch must be treated as a \n     separate company and not just another pocket in its worldwide \n     operations.\n       But the Treasury Department, ever on the alert for abusive \n     tax strategies, issued a regulation shortly after the treaty \n     took effect allowing the I.R.S. to disregard any deductions \n     deemed excessive. The regulation lets the I.R.S. apply a \n     complicated formula to allocate interest based on a company's \n     worldwide operations.\n       But, Judge Turner wrote, the Treasury regulation is \n     ``fundamentally incompatible'' with the tax treaty and must \n     be ignored. In his 21-page decision, he also castigated the \n     United States for its conduct, quoting in detail from written \n     promises made during the treaty negotiations and other \n     documents to show that NatWest was justified in relying on \n     the tax treaty in preparing its corporate tax returns for the \n     I.R.S.\n       The judge said the regulation ``plainly violates'' the tax \n     treaty and he characterized the reasoning behind it as \n     ``fundamentally flawed.''\n       He did not award the $180 million, plus interest, to \n     NatWest, however. Instead, Judge Turner ruled in the bank's \n     favor on the issue in a pretrial hearing.\n       Tax lawyers said the United States can now appeal the \n     judge's ruling, continue the case and then appeal the entire \n     case, or go to Congress for relief or give up.\n       The case may cause a stampede by other foreign banks to \n     recover billions of dollars in taxes paid when their interest \n     deductions were curtailed. More broadly, the case is an \n     important development in a growing global battle between \n     multinational corporations, which want to take profits and \n     pay taxes in countries of their choice, and national \n     governments that would be protect the integrity of their tax \n     regimes and maximize tax revenues, a variety of tax lawyers \n     said yesterday.\n       ``This is a tremendously important decision, although it \n     specifically involves a backwater of the issues about global \n     corporate taxation,'' said Richard E. Andersen of the law \n     firm Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue. He said the size of the \n     award, expected to ultimately be the full $180 million plus \n     interest that NetWest sought, and the ``drubbing'' the I.R.S. \n     took from the judge ``will force the I.R.S. to think hard \n     about thumbing their nose at this because if they do, they \n     will have to devote a lot of legal resources to fighting \n     other cases on similar issues and they will probably lose.''\n       Mr. Andersen and other lawyers said that because of its \n     enormous market the United States had been able to ``get away \n     with'' ignoring tax treaties. ``The fact is no bank has \n     withdrawn from the U.S. because of this issue,'' he said.\n       Arthur D. Pasternak, an international tax specialist at \n     Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, said that ``the I.R.S. has this no-\n     cheating concept that, to its credit, it tends to apply \n     evenly to American and foreign corporations operating in the \n     United States.''\n       ``And the I.R.S. has become much more aggressive in recent \n     years in fighting what it regards as using tax treaties for \n     aggressive tax avoidance,'' he said. ``The general rule is \n     that the United States Government has been saying that \n     statutes passed by Congress can override existing treaties, \n     but this case shows that mere regulations can't override \n     treaties.''\n       Sydney E. Unger, chairman of the tax department at Kaye \n     Scholer Fierman Hays & Handler in New York, said that foreign \n     corporations operating in the United States were a convenient \n     target for American politicians and that the regulation the \n     judge ruled on illustrated this.\n       ``Fundamentally, there has been a sense at Treasury and \n     among politicians that foreign entities with operations in \n     the United States are not paying their far share of tax,'' \n     Mr. Unger said. ``Whether that is true or not, certainly it \n     is a wonderful issue for American politicians and for \n     Treasury officials to want to pursue because it's about \n     taxing someone else, who doesn't vote.''\n       Inland Revenue, the British tax agency, filed a friend-of-\n     the-court brief supporting NatWest.\n       Jerome Libin, a tax specialist in the Washington office of \n     Sutherland Asbill & Brennan who filed the brief, said that \n     Inland Revenue believed that even if NatWest's interest \n     deductions were dubious--and that point was not conceded--the \n     deductions still had to be allowed under the tax treaty.\n       Mr. Libin won a similar case three years ago in United \n     States Tax Court over a tax treaty with Canada, but that case \n     involved allocating income, while the NatWest case involved \n     allocating deductions.\n       He said that in newer tax treaties the United States had \n     sought to reserve a right to disallow deductions if it could \n     show that they were abusive.\n       One of NatWest's lawyers, Jerry Snider of Davis Polk & \n     Wardwell, called Judge Turner's decision ``a terrific, \n     thorough and carefully written opinion.''\n       The Internal Revenue Service declined to comment or even to \n     make documents available. It referred questions to the \n     Treasury Department, where a spokeswoman, Maria Ibanez, \n     offered to make a senior official available for an interview \n     on condition that he neither be identified nor quoted \n     directly. That offer was declined.\n       The Justice Department said last night that senior \n     officials who could discuss the case had left and could not \n     be reached for comment.\n       NatWest sold its American retail branches to the Fleet \n     Corporation of Boston in December 1995.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S9931]]\n\nNorth Carolina in working with us to expedite consideration of the \nTaxpayer Refund Act by not asking for a roll call vote in relation to \nhis amendment. This is certainly an interesting idea, and my staff and \nI look forward to working with him in the future to explore the \npossibility of a drycleaning equipment tax benefit.\n\n\n                        republican tax cut plan\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will vote against this Republican tax cut \nplan. I cannot conceive of a more ill-advised fiscal plan for the \nNation over the next 10 years than the Republican tax cut bill. I say \nthis for a number of reasons.\n  Having seen the National debt explode from less than $1 trillion on \nthe day that President Reagan took office to over $5.6 trillion today, \nwe should have learned that the supply-side economic theories of the \nReagan-Bush years, which called for massive tax cuts together with a \nmassive defense build-up, while at the same time balancing the federal \nbudget, are pure, unadulterated hogwash. They didn't work then; they \nwon't work now.\n  Thankfully, due to a number of factors--for example, the fiscal \npolicies of the Federal Reserve, and improvements in the productivity \nof the Nation's businesses--we have been able not only to stem the tide \nof red ink that ran into the triple-digit billion-dollar levels for \neach of the Reagan-Bush years but, if the latest projections of both \nthe OMB and CBO pan out, we also can look forward to huge federal \nsurpluses each year as far as the eye can see. That's good news, if \nthose projections come true and if Congress is able to withstand \nanother round of tax cut fever.\n  The Congressional Budget Office projects surpluses over the next ten \nyears (FY 2000-2009) totaling nearly $3 trillion. Of that amount, about \n$2 trillion would be surpluses in the Social Security Trust Fund, and \nthe other $1 trillion ($996 billion to be exact) would be non-social \nsecurity surpluses. However, a closer look at these non-social security \nsurpluses projected by CBO over the next ten years, reveals that they \nrest on a very shaky foundation. The fact is, these non-social security \nsurpluses which are projected to total $996 billion, are based in large \npart on huge cuts in investments and national priorities--such as \nnational security, veterans' medical care, the FBI and other crime-\nfighting programs, the environment, agriculture, border patrol agents, \nhealth research, education, and many other critical programs. Of the \n$996 billion in non-social security surpluses projected by CBO for the \nnext 10 years, $595 billion results from real and devastating cuts in \nthese national priorities. As if that were not bad enough, the \nRepublican tax cut plan calls for additional cuts of some $180 billion \nto these same programs. That makes a total of $775 billion in cuts in \nthese national investments over the next 10 years. That is what is \nbeing proposed in the Republican tax cut bill now before the Senate. \nFurthermore, the Republican tax cuts of $792 billion would, if enacted, \nalso result in increased interest on the Federal Debt over the next 10 \nyears totaling $179 billion. In reality, then, the Republican tax cut \nbill eats up $971 billion of the $996 billion in projected non-social \nsecurity surpluses over the next 10 years, leaving only $25 billion \nremaining.\n  We should heed the advice of Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan in \nhis testimony before Congressional Committees when he advised caution \nwhen considering what to do with these projected surpluses. In the \nfirst place, it is extremely unlikely that these projections will come \ntrue. The fact is that CBO's estimates of revenues over the past two \ndecades have been off by an absolute average of $38 billion per year; \ntheir estimates on spending over that period have been off by $36 \nbillion per year; and their deficit/surplus projections have been off \nby an absolute average of $54 billion per year over the past two \ndecades. If these averages hold up over the next 10 years, the \ntrillion-dollar non-social security surpluses could be slashed by $540 \nbillion purely due to mis-estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. \nFurther, as CBO states in virtually every report that they publish, \ncyclical disturbances such as recessions, changes in interest rates, \ninflation, etc., could have significant effects on their projected \nsurpluses at any time during the projection period.\n\n  Then, there is the question of emergency spending. As Senators are \naware, under the Budget Enforcement Act, unforeseen emergencies, which \ncannot be predicted accurately and, therefore, are not budgeted, are \nallowed to be funded outside the spending caps that have been in place \nsince 1990 and which will remain in place through FY2002. The fact is, \nemergency spending over the past decade (other than spending for Desert \nStorm/Desert Shield and the $21 billion in emergency spending in the \nFY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act) has averaged $8 billion per year. In \nother words, but for those two instances, Congress has enacted spending \noutside of the budgetary caps for such things as disaster assistance to \nthe nation's farmers, relief for victims of floods, hurricanes, \ntornadoes, and earthquakes, as well as assistance for victims of \nsimilar occurrences overseas.\n  That type of assistance has averaged $8 billion per year since 1990. \nThere is no indication that these natural disasters will suddenly \ncease. To the contrary, there is substantial evidence that they have \nbecome more frequent and more severe in the latter part of this \nCentury. What does this mean? It means that it is highly likely that \nover the next decade, at least $80 billion in emergency spending will \nbe needed. But, keep in mind that the $996 billion in non-social \nsecurity surpluses projected by CBO, the large bulk of which results \nfrom real cuts in national priorities, does not allow for any emergency \nspending over the next 10 years. That being the case, wouldn't it be \nprudent to reduce the $996 billion projection by at least the $80 \nbillion historical average per decade that we have seen in the past? \nAfter so doing, even if Congress and the Administration agreed to the \n$775 billion of cuts in purchasing power for national priorities that \nthe Republican tax cut bill requires, there would not be sufficient \nsurpluses remaining to cover this Republican tax cut plan without \neither reverting back into deficit spending, or repealing the tax cut, \nor dipping into the Social Security Trust Fund surpluses.\n  Next, let's look at the question of whether Congress can, or should, \nstay within the existing spending caps for FY2000, much less the more \ndifficult caps of FY2001 and FY2002. One need only pick up the morning \nnewspaper on any one of the past several days to find an article or two \ndiscussing the progress, or lack thereof, that the Appropriations \nCommittees are making in completing action on the FY2000 funding bills. \nRecently, it is reported, the House Appropriations Committee found that \nthe VA-HUD Subcommittee could not stay within its allocations without \ndeclaring some $3 billion in funding for VA medical care, as well as \n$2.5 billion in FEMA funding, as ``emergency'' spending, which as I \nhave explained earlier, does not count against the spending caps, but \nwill, nonetheless, decrease the surplus. Additionally, some $4.5 \nbillion has been declared emergency spending for the Decennial Census \nby the House Appropriations Committee. Those three items alone, if \nenacted as emergency spending, will cut the projected FY2000 surplus by \n$10 billion. Furthermore, as CBO points out on page 6 of their mid-\nSession Review, they have been directed by the Budget Committees to \nreduce their outlay projections in FY2000 by $10 billion for defense, \n$1 billion for transportation, and $3 billion for other non-defense \nprograms. That knocks another $14 billion dent in CBO's non-social \nsecurity surplus projections for FY2000. On that same page, CBO also \npoints out that their non-social security surplus projections exclude \nsome $3 billion per year in spending for the administrative expenses of \nthe Social Security Administration. When all of these factors are taken \ninto account, for FY2000, actions by Congress to date have already \nadded emergency spending of some $10 billion; and have increased \noutlays by $14 billion. This $24 billion, together with the $3 billion \nin administrative expenses for the Social Security Administration, \nmeans that Congress is likely to not only spend all of the $14 billion \nFY2000 non-social security surplus projected by CBO, but, actually, to \nexceed it by at least $13 billion. In other words, it is highly likely \nthat for FY2000 alone, Congress and the Administration will enact \nspending levels which will not only use up the entire $14 billion non-\nsocial security surplus projected for that year,\n\n[[Page S9932]]\n\nbut will also eat into the Social Security Trust Fund surpluses by at \nleast $13 billion. So much for the Social Security Lock-box! Congress \nhas already found the key that unlocks it. What about next year, when \nthe spending caps are much tougher to stay within? Is one to believe \nthat Congress will make the Draconian cuts in national priorities that \nwould be called for to stay within the Republican tax plan? If not, \nfurther erosion of these projected surpluses will occur. Keep in mind \nthat once tax cuts are enacted, those revenues are gone, and can only \nbe retrieved by repealing the tax cuts. Does anyone think that Congress \nwill do that in an Election Year? If not, then it is a foregone \nconclusion that the surplus projections for even the upcoming three \nfiscal years, to say nothing of the remaining seven years of the next \ndecade, will be eaten away because they are based on virtually \nimpossible, and extremely unsound, cuts in spending on national \npriorities. Keeping two sets of books, as the Republicans are \nattempting to do, won't fool the American people for very long.\n\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me quote from the text of a recent \nstatement by 50 of the Nation's most revered economists, including six \nNobel laureates, concerning the tax cuts now before the Senate.\n\n       The federal budget is projected to show substantial \n     surpluses over the next 15 years. These surpluses offer an \n     exceptional opportunity to pay down government debt and \n     thereby strengthen Social Security and Medicare in order to \n     prepare for the retirement of the baby boomers. . . .\n       In contrast, a massive tax cut that encourages consumption \n     would not be good economic policy. With the unemployment rate \n     at its lowest point in a generation, now is the wrong time to \n     stimulate the economy through tax cuts. Moreover, an ever \n     growing tax cut would drain government resources just when \n     the aging of the population starts to put substantial stress \n     on Social Security and Medicare. Further, the projections \n     assume substantial undesirable reductions in real spending \n     for non-entitlement programs, including important public \n     investments. Given the uncertainty of long-term budget \n     projections, committing to a large tax cut would create \n     significant risks to the budget and the economy.\n\n  Mr. President, it could not be any clearer to any rational human \nbeing that this Republican tax cut plan is exactly the wrong fiscal \nblueprint for the Nation as we enter the next Millennium. As I have \nshown, it is highly unlikely that these forecasts will come true. Even \nif they do, some $80 billion in emergency spending for natural \ndisasters has not been accounted for; another $30 billion in \nadministrative costs of the Social Security Administration has not been \naccounted for; and the budget caps for FY2000 alone are likely to be \nexceeded by over $20 billion. Now is not the time to return to the \nfailed economic policies that prevailed during the Reagan-Bush years. \nRosy Scenario in all her splendor could not make their policies work. \nThe same is true of the policies that would be undertaken if we were to \nenact this Republican tax cut.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, very few decisions we make in Congress \nwill have more impact on the long-term economic well-being of our \nnation than how we allocate the projected surplus. By our votes this \nweek, we are setting priorities that will determine whether the \nAmerican economy is on firm ground or dangerously shifting sand as we \nenter the 21st century. These votes will determine whether we have the \nfinancial capacity to meet our responsibilities to future generations, \nand whether we have fairly shared the economic benefits of our current \nprosperity. Sadly, the legislation before us today fails all of these \nstandards. We should vote to reject it.\n  A tax cut of the enormous magnitude proposed by our Republican \ncolleagues would reverse the sound fiscal management which has created \nthe inflation-free economic growth of recent years. That is the clear \nview of the two principal architects of our current prosperity--Robert \nRubin and Alan Greenspan. Devoting the entire on-budget surplus to tax \ncuts will deprive us of the funds essential to preserve Medicare and \nSocial Security for future generations of retirees. It will force harsh \ncuts in education, in medical research, and in other vital domestic \npriorities. This tax cut jeopardizes our financial future--and it also \ndismally flunks the test of fairness. When fully implemented, the \nRepublican plan would give 75% of the tax cuts to the wealthiest 20% of \nthe population. The richest 1%--those earning over $300,000 a year--\nwould receive tax breaks as high as $23,000 a year, while working men \nand women would receive an average of only $139 a year.\n  Republicans claim that the ten year surplus is three trillion dollars \nand that they are setting two-thirds of it aside for Social Security, \nand only spending one-third on tax cuts. That explanation is grossly \nmisleading. The two trillion dollars they say they are giving to Social \nSecurity already belongs to Social Security. It consists of payroll tax \ndollars expressly raised for the purpose of paying future Social \nSecurity benefits. Using those dollars to fund tax cuts or new spending \nwould be to raid the Social Security Trust Fund. The Republicans are \nnot providing a single new dollar to help fund Social Security benefits \nfor future generations. They are not extending the life of the Trust \nFund for even one day. It is a mockery to characterize those payroll \ntax dollars as part of the surplus.\n  That leaves the $996 billion on-budget surplus as the only funds \navailable to address all of the nation's unmet needs over the next ten \nyears. Republicans propose to use that entire amount to fund their tax \ncut scheme. Since CBO projections assume that all surplus dollars are \ndevoted to debt reduction, the $996 billion figure includes nearly $200 \nbillion in debt service savings. The amount which is available to be \nspent--either to address public needs or to cut taxes--is only slightly \nabove $800 billion. Their $792 billion tax cut will consume the entire \nsurplus.\n  Even more troubling, the Republican tax cut has been designed to \nexpand dramatically beyond the tenth year. The cost between 2010 and \n2019 will dwarf the cost in the first decade. It will rise from $800 \nbillion to $2 trillion dollars. And the cost of the debt service \npayments necessitated by a tax cut of that magnitude will grow \nexponentially as well. The GOP plan will usher in a new era of \ndeficits--just as the baby boom generation is reaching retirement age.\n  While the Senate Rules have been invoked to prevent the current tax \ncut from going beyond ten years, the Republican leadership has made \nclear their intent to make these massive cuts permanent. If these tax \ncuts were to become permanent, they would precipitate a genuine fiscal \ncrisis.\n  Most Americans understand the word ``surplus'' to mean dollars \nremaining after all financial obligations have been met. If that common \nsense definitions is applied to the federal budget, the surplus would \nbe far smaller than $996 billion.\n  We have existing obligations which should be our first \nresponsibility. We have an obligation to preserve Medicare for future \ngenerations of retires, and to modernize Medicare benefits to include \nprescription drug assistance. The Republican budget does not provide \none additional dollar to meet these needs.\n  The American people clearly believe that strengthening Social \nSecurity and Medicare should be our highest priorities for using the \nsurplus. By margins of more than two to one, they view preserving \nSocial Security and Medicare as more important than cutting taxes.\n  We should use the surplus to meet these existing responsibilities \nfirst, in order to fulfill the promise of a secure retirement with \naccess to needed medical care.\n  If we do nothing, Medicare will become insolvent by 2015. The surplus \ngives us a unique opportunity to preserve Medicare, without reducing \nmedical care or raising premiums. The Republican tax cut would take \nthat opportunity away. It would leave nothing for Medicare.\n  We must seize this opportunity. Senate Democrats have proposed \ncommitting one-third of the surplus--$290 billion over the next ten \nyears--to strengthening Medicare and to assisting senior citizens with \nthe cost of prescription drugs. The Administration's 15 year budget \nplan provides an additional $500 billion for Medicare between 2010 and \n2014. Enactment of the Republican tax cut would make this $800 billion \ntransfer to Medicare impossible. If we squander the entire surplus on \ntax breaks, there will be no money left to keep our commitment to the \nnations' elderly.\n  Unless we use a portion of the surplus to strengthen Medicare, senior \ncitizens\n\n[[Page S9933]]\n\nwill be confronted with nearly a trillion dollars in health care cuts \nand premium increases. We know who the people are who will be asked by \nthe Republicans to carry this enormous burden.\n  The typical Medicare beneficiary is a widow, seventy-six years old, \nwith an annual income of $10,000. She has one or more chronic \nillnesses. She is a mother and a grandmother. Yet the Republican budget \nwould force deep cuts in her Medicare benefits, in order to pay for new \ntax breaks for the wealthy. As a result, elderly women will be unable \nto see their doctor. They will go without needed prescription drugs, or \nwithout meals or heat, so that wealthy Americans earning hundreds of \nthousands of dollars a year can have additional thousands of dollars a \nyear in tax breaks.\n\n  The projected surplus also assumes drastic cuts in a wide range of \nexisting programs over the next decade--cuts in domestic programs such \nas education, medical research, and environmental cleanup; and cuts in \nnational defense. We have an obligation to adequately fund these \nprograms. If existing programs merely grow at the rate of inflation \nover the next decade and no new programs are created and no existing \nprograms are expanded, the surplus would be reduced by $584 billion \ndollars. That is the amount it will cost to merely continue funding \ncurrent discretionary programs at their inflation-adjusted level. In \nfact, the real surplus over the next ten years is only slightly above \n$200 billion, roughly one-quarter the size of the proposed Republican \ntax cut.\n  In other words, the Republican tax cut would necessitate more than a \ntwenty percent across the board cut in discretionary spending--in both \ndomestic and national defense--by the end of the next decade. If \ndefense is funded at the Administration's proposed level, and it is \nhighly unlikely that the Republican Congress will do less, domestic \nspending would have to be cut 38% by 2009. No one can reasonably argue \nthat cuts that deep should be made, or will be made.\n  We know what cuts of this magnitude would mean in human terms by the \nend of the decade. We know who will be hurt: 375,000 fewer children \nwill receive a Head Start; 6.5 million fewer children will participate \nin Title I education programs; 14,000 fewer biomedical research grants \nwill be available from the National Institutes of Health; 1,431,000 \nfewer veterans will receive V.A. medical care; and there will be 6,170 \nfewer Border Patrol agents and 6,342 fewer FBI agents insuring safer \ncommunities. These are losses that the American people are not willing \nto accept.\n  The Democratic alternative would restore $290 billion, substantially \nreducing the size of the proposed cuts. A significant reduction would \nstill be required over the decade. One thing is clear--even with a bare \nbones budget, we cannot afford a tax cut of the magnitude the \nRepublicans are proposing.\n  Our Republican friends claim that these enormous tax cuts will have \nno impact on Social Security, because they are not using payroll tax \nrevenues. On the contrary, the fact that the Republican budget commits \nevery last dollar of the on-budget surplus to tax cuts does imperil \nSocial Security.\n  First, revenue estimates projected ten years into the future are \nnotoriously unreliable. As the Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice candidly acknowledged:\n\n       Ten year budget projections are highly uncertain. In the \n     space of only six months, CBO's estimate of the cumulative \n     surplus has increased by nearly $300 billion. Further changes \n     of that or a greater magnitude are likely--in either \n     direction--as a result of economic fluctuations, \n     administrative and judicial actions, and other developments.\n\n  Despite this warning, the Republican tax cut leaves no margin for \nerror. If we commit the entire surplus to tax cuts and the full surplus \ndoes not materialize, Social Security revenues will be required to \ncover the shortfall.\n  Second, even if the projected surplus does materialize, the cost of \nthe Republican budget exceeds the surplus in five of the next ten \nyears--2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. Unless the Republican proposal \nis restructured, Social Security revenues will be required to cover the \nshortfall in each of those years.\n  Third, the Republican tax cut leaves no money to pay for emergency \nspending, which has averaged $9 billion a year in recent years. Over \nthe next decade, we are likely to need approximately $90 billion to \ncover emergency needs. That money has to come from somewhere. With the \nentire surplus spent on tax cuts, the Social Security Trust Fund will \nhave to fund these emergency costs as well.\n  The three threats to Social Security I have described are very real. \nHowever, there is an even greater impact of the Republican plan on the \nfuture of Social Security. As I noted earlier, that plan does not \nprovide Social Security with a single new dollar to fund future benefit \npayments.\n  In contrast, the Administration has proposed using a major portion of \nthe surplus to strengthen Social Security for future generations of \nretirees. Beginning in 2011, the President's budget allocates to Social \nSecurity the savings which will result from debt reduction. Between \n2011 and 2014, the Social Security Trust Fund would receive 543 billion \nnew dollars from the surplus, and it would receive an additional $189 \nbillion each year after that. As a result, the solvency of Social \nSecurity would be extended for a generation, to well beyond 2050.\n  The Republican tax cut proposal, which costs over $2 trillion between \n2010 and 2019, will consume all of the surplus dollars which were \nintended for Social Security. There will be nothing left for Social \nSecurity. As a result, no new dollars will flow into the Trust Fund, \nand the future of Social Security will remain clouded.\n  For two-thirds of America's senior citizens, Social Security \nretirement benefits provide more than 50% of their annual income. \nWithout Social Security, half the nation's elderly would be living in \npoverty. Social Security enables millions of senior citizens to spend \ntheir retirement years in security and dignity. A Republican tax cut of \nthe magnitude proposed here today will put their retirement security in \nserious jeopardy.\n  The votes which we cast this week--the choices which we are required \nto make--will say a great deal about our values. We should use the \nsurplus as an opportunity to help those in need--senior citizens living \non small fixed incomes, children who need educational opportunities, \nmillions of men and women whose lives may well depend on medical \nresearch and access to quality health care. We should not use the \nsurplus to further enrich those among us who are already the most \naffluent. The issue is a question of fundamental values and fundamental \nfairness.\n  The Republican tax cut would consume the entire surplus, and \ndistribute the overwhelming majority of it to those with the highest \nincomes. The authors of the Republican plan have highlighted the \nreduction of the 15% tax bracket to 14%. They have pointed to this as \nmiddle class tax relief. But that relief is only a small part of the \noverall tax breaks in their bill. It accounts for only $216 billion of \nthe $792 billion in GOP tax cuts. Most of the remaining provisions are \nheavily weighted toward the highest income taxpayers.\n  If the Republican plan were enacted and fully implemented, nearly 50% \nof the tax benefits would go to the richest 5% of taxpayers, and more \nthan 75% of the benefits would go to the wealthiest 20%. Those with \nannual incomes exceeding $300,000 would receive tax breaks of $23,000 \nper year. The lowest 60% of wage-earners would share less than 11% of \nthe total tax cuts--they would receive an average tax cut of only $139 \nper year. That gross disparity is unfair and unacceptable.\n  This is not the way the American people want to spend their surplus. \nI urge my colleagues to reject this bill. The American people deserve \nbetter than this.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as the debate on the Senate's version of \nthe reconciliation tax bill winds down, I wanted to come to the floor \nand say a few words about where we are in this process, how we got \nhere, and where I think we ought to go.\n  Let me begin by saying that the discussions we have seen on the \nSenate floor these past few days should lead all of my colleagues--\nDemocratic and Republican alike--to agree on one thing: the issues \naffected by this bill--Social Security, Medicare, education, tax \nrelief--are serious and should not fall prey to political gamesmanship. \nIt is not an overstatement to say that the nation's economic and fiscal \nhealth are\n\n[[Page S9934]]\n\nat stake. What we do on these issues will affect the lives of millions \nof Americans for decades to come.\n  The discussion has also revealed another truth. The debate on the \nproper course for this nation and its people as we head into the 21st \ncentury is really a tale of two paradigms.\n  The Republican vision for the future is to replay the past. They \nwould have us follow their economic policies of the 1980s, a course \nthat can best be characterized as one of both wishful thinking and \nfiscal disaster. This is a course of irresponsible tax breaks for the \nwealthiest among us. This is a course of voodoo economics, where \nproviding huge tax breaks to the wealthiest was to somehow benefit \neveryone and reduce government deficits.\n  As history demonstrates, this really was a course of rosy scenarios \nand disastrous results. The benefits of their tax breaks were, not \nsurprisingly, essentially confined to the wealthiest. Small deficits \nturned into massive ones. Government debt exploded, quadrupling in the \n1980s. Unemployment averaged 7.1 percent in the previous decade. Median \nfamily income fell $1,825 in just four years. Welfare rolls were up 22 \npercent.\n  The Democratic vision for the future is to continue along the path we \nset forth in 1993, a path marked by fiscal responsibility and economic \nprosperity. Just to remind my colleagues of what we have accomplished \nsince we embarked on this road, let me talk about the state of our \neconomy when President Clinton took office. The deficit in 1992 was \n$290 billion and projected to grow to over $500 billion by the end of \nthe decade and to continue rising each year thereafter. Again, \nunemployment was up, and family income was down. Welfare rolls were \ngrowing.\n  The Democratic-led Congress enacted a comprehensive economic plan in \n1993. This plan was approved without a single Republican vote. And \ntoday, the results are clear. Economists have said this is the \nstrongest U.S. economy they have seen in a generation. The record \ndeficits have turned into record surpluses--$120 billion this year and \nlarger every year thereafter for at least a decade. We are experiencing \nthe longest peacetime economic expansion in this nation's history and, \nif it continues for several additional months, the longest in history, \nperiod. Economic growth during this period has averaged 3.5 percent--\nnearly double that experienced during the Reagan-Bush years. \nUnemployment is just over four percent--roughly one-half the level \nduring the Reagan-Bush years. Median income for a family of four is up \n$3,500 since 1993. Welfare rolls are down 35 percent since 1994.\n  These are the two choices presented during this debate--whether we \nstep back into a past filled with record deficits and debt or continue \nmoving forward to sustain the economic and fiscal progress we have \nachieved since 1993. The question for the Congress and the American \npeople is which road will we take--the dangerous one or the responsible \none? Will we build on our success or put our national health at risk?\n  After carefully listening to the debate, it is apparent to me that \nmany on the other side of the aisle would like to do it all over again. \nI have heard some of the same old, dangerous rhetoric and false rosy \nscenarios I heard in the early 1980s. Like then, I have heard \nmisleading representations of government spending--both current and \nfuture. I have again heard talk of irresponsible tax cuts tilted to the \nwealthy and special interests. Once again, my Republican colleagues are \nproposing that we give short shrift to Medicare and, in a new twist, a \nprescription drug benefit as well. And finally, Republicans are again \nproposing massive cuts in education, veterans' health, defense and \nagriculture. These cuts are as unprecedented as they are unrealistic. \nIf one assumes the Republicans simply match the President's defense \nspending proposals, all remaining discretionary programs would have to \nbe cut by 38 percent below today's levels. If we follow the new, \nphantom baseline created expressly for the floor debate by Senators \nDomenici and Frist, and again exempt defense, the cuts to all remaining \nprograms will easily exceed 50 percent.\n  Mr. President, it is all the more disappointing to me that in the \nface of the historic opportunity afforded this body by our unmatched \nfiscal strength, the Senate is about to fail on three counts. The \nRepublican majority is about to prevail and pass an irresponsible \nfiscal policy. Their tax cuts would reverse the progress of the 1990s \nand lead to us back to huge deficits and more debt. The Republican \nposition also constitutes irresponsible national policy. The cost of \nthe Republican tax cut would explode in the second decade of the 21st \ncentury--precisely when the baby boomer generation is retiring and \nresources are needed if the federal government is to keep its \ncommitments on Social Security and Medicare. Finally, the majority has \nchosen to pursue this course in the face of a certain Presidential \nveto, should the bill reach the President's desk in something even \nclose to its current form.\n  Instead of wasting the precious time of this Congress and the \nAmerican people, it would have been better if Republicans had opted to \nwork together with Democrats to develop a fiscally responsible plan \nthat could get the President's signature. Democrats have offered the \nmajor parts of such a plan during the debate. Our plan consists of five \ncomponents. Democrats protect the entire $1.9 trillion Social Security \nsurplus; every dollar, every year. Democrats strengthen and modernize \nMedicare by setting aside a portion of the on-budget surplus to extend \nsolvency and provide a prescription drug benefit for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. Democrats pay down the federal government's publicly \nheld debt, and, if our course is followed, eventually eliminate it. \nDemocrats invest some of the non-Social Security surplus in critical \npriorities, such as defense, education, veterans' health, agriculture, \nand NIH. Finally, Democrats believe in a significant, responsible tax \ncut.\n  It is projected there will be sufficient resources to do all of this. \nYet, Republicans refuse to do most of it. Instead, they choose to \nfollow a course that has become all too familiar to Americans. \nRepublicans again choose to pursue ideologically extreme positions that \nbest serve special interests instead of the needs of ordinary, hard-\nworking Americans. The Senate has seen this before, on the overall \nbudget plan, on juvenile justice, and, most recently, on the Patients' \nBill of Rights.\n  This is not a political game. We face serious challenges and historic \nopportunities. We have wasted precious time. The list of unresolved \nitems that the Senate should address is a long one. And time is short. \nI hope that when we come back next week and in September, Republicans \nwill discard their agenda written by special interests and pursue the \npeople's agenda. If they do so, we can accomplish much together. If \nthey do not, the American people will be the losers.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH.

Under the previous order, amendment No. 1496 \nis agreed to.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``amendments submitted.'')\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of the House companion bill, Calendar No. 234, H.R. 2480. \nI further ask consent that all after the enacting clause be stricken, \nand the text of the Senate bill be inserted in lieu thereof, the bill \nthen be read for the third time and passed, with a motion to reconsider \nlaid upon the table. I also ask consent that the Senate then insist on \nits amendment and request a conference with the House. I finally ask \nconsent that the passage of S. 1429 be vitiated and the bill be placed \nback on the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2480), as amended, was passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise first to compliment my senior \ncolleague from Delaware on his effectiveness. We agree on an awful lot \nof things. We disagreed on this tax bill, but that in no way diminishes \nmy admiration for his effectiveness. As a matter of fact, this is one \nof the few occasions I wish he were not as effective as he has been.\n  I compliment him and I echo the comments of my friend from New York \nwho said he is held in affection by Members on both sides of the aisle. \nI am first among those. I congratulate him for his success. I will not \nuse the word ``deplore,'' but I disagree strongly with the outcome. \nHowever, I admire the way in which he--and maybe only he--could have \nbeen able to put this together.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee and the ranking member of the Finance Committee for the \noutstanding work they have done together through this week to bring \ntogether a bill that could have bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  I particularly thank Senator Roth for the depth of understanding he \nhas on tax issues, the way he has worked across the aisle, the way he \nhas worked through such a variety of measures. There were over 126 \namendments we have just done. He understood and worked through and \nnegotiated those into a package that I hope will be accepted by the \nHouse and signed by the President.\n  As the accountant in the Senate, I have been fascinated by the debate \nwe have had this week. I volunteered to serve late a couple of nights. \nFor us accountants, what we have seen here this week has been live \nentertainment--some of the finest stuff you can see on television.\n  I know my fellow accountants across the Nation have been watching. \nWhile we did not get the simplification we would have liked to have \nhad, and that simplification is necessary for the American people, we \nhave gotten some\n\n[[Page S9937]]\n\nvery exciting, necessary provisions, some provisions where all \nAmericans taxpayer will receive back part of the overpayment they paid \nin.\n  We have made a dent in the death taxes. We fixed the marriage \npenalty--eventually, with a start immediately, and a myriad of other \nprovisions in there that will affect the lives of literally every \nperson in the United States.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee who has been a part of the last \ngreat tax relief that was done as well as this great tax relief.\n  I thank the chairman and my colleagues who worked on and supported \nthis measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I also associate myself with the \nremarks of the Senator from Wyoming commending Senator Roth and the \nFinance Committee for their work on this very important landmark tax \nrelief legislation the Senate passed today. I believe, in taking the \nstep we did today, in lowering the tax burden upon the American people \nfrom 21 percent of GDP to 20 percent of the gross domestic product, we \nhave taken a modest but a very important step in providing relief to \nall Americans. I commend the Senate today, and the staff, and ask the \nPresident to reconsider his proposed veto.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/30/senate-section/article/S9937-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON.

Mr. President, yesterday the Committee on Foreign \nRelations held a remarkable hearing on the prospects for democracy in \nYugoslavia. Testifying were two of the Administration's top Balkan \nexperts, two leading representatives of the non-governmental \norganization community with wide and deep experience in the Balkans, \nthe executive director of the Office of External Affairs of the Serbian \nOrthodox Church in the United States, and a courageous woman from \nBelgrade who chairs the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia.\n  One of the many topics raised during this hearing was the question of \nthe correctness of the decision of the United States to refuse to give \nreconstruction assistance--as distinct from humanitarian assistance--to \nSerbia as long as Slobodan Milosevic remains in control in Belgrade. I \ncompletely support the Administration's policy in this matter, which, I \nam certain, comes as no surprise to any of my colleagues.\n  Since on this very day President Clinton and more than forty other \nworld leaders are meeting in Sarajevo to discuss a so-called Balkans \nStability Pact, which would deliver reconstruction assistance on a \nregional basis, I thought it would be appropriate at this time briefly \nto discuss two alleged historical parallels, one of which I believe is \nfallacious, the other which I would assert is directly applicable to \nthe current situation.\n  At yesterday's hearing it was asserted that there was a moral \nimperative for NATO countries to offer reconstruction aid to Serbia \njust as after World War II the United States included Germany in its \nMarshall Plan assistance.\n  Mr. President, I would submit that this intended parallel falls short \nin several respects. First of all, in spite of twelve brutal years of \ncriminal Nazi rule, post-war Germany still had the democratic tradition \nof Weimar as a basis for rebuilding its political system, with several \nprominent surviving leaders. Nothing like that exists in Serbia today. \nThere are no Serbian Konrad Adenauers or Kurt Schumachers.\n  Secondly, the United States made as preconditions for Marshall plan \nassistance adherence to democracy, free-market capitalism, and \ncooperation with neighboring countries. Needless to say, the Serbia of \nSlobodan Milosevic would qualify on none of those grounds.\n  Finally, in order to guide post-war Germany toward democracy, the \nvictorious allies occupied the country, dividing up responsibility into \nfour zones. The Soviets quickly made clear their intention to impose \ncommunism in what became East Germany, and Stalin pressured the East \nGermans and other satellite countries to refuse the offer of Marshall \nPlan aid. In the U.S., British, and French zones of Germany, however, \nhundreds of thousands of troops and civilian officials essentially ran \npolitical life until the Federal Republic of Germany was established in \n1949, and allied troops have remained until today.\n  It may well be that in order to bring Serbia into the family of \ndemocratic nations just such an international occupation would have to \nhappen, but it is simply not in the cards.\n  So, Mr. President, the alleged parallel of today's Serbia with post-\nwar Germany is totally inappropriate.\n\n  There is, however, a historical parallel chronologically much closer \nto today, which is, in fact, an appropriate one. That is the case of \nthe Republika Srpska, one of the two entities of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina.\n  After the Dayton Accords were signed in late 1995 and the two \nentities--the Bosniak-Croat Federation and the Republika Srpska--were \nestablished, the Congress of the United States put together a \nreconstruction assistance package. Because of the brutal crimes of the \nBosnian Serbs under Radovan Karadzic from 1992 to 1995, the legislation \nexcluded the new Republika Srpska, then under Karadzic's control, from \nany reconstruction assistance except for infrastructural projects like \nenergy and water, which spanned the inter-entity boundary line with the \nFederation. That meant that in the immediate post-Dayton period the \nFederation received about ninety-eight percent of American development \nassistance to Bosnia.\n  Largely as a result of this policy, the Federation's economy \nimmediately began to recover from the war, while the Republika Srpska, \nunder Karadzic's control in the town of Pale, stagnated.\n  But our policy has not been one exclusively of sticks; there have \nalso been carrots. If localities in the Republika Srpska cooperated \nwith Dayton implementation, the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment was prepared to channel assistance to them. USAID lays down \nstrict conditions in contracts with the individual localities. The \npolicy is not perfect, and it is carefully monitored by Congress. But, \nin general, it has worked, and it has had positive results.\n  People in the Republika Srpska saw the economic resuscitation of the \nFederation and noticed the assistance that a few of their own \nlocalities were receiving. They compared this modest, but undeniable \neconomic progress with the persistent, grinding poverty of most of the \nRepublika Srpska, led by Karadzic and his corrupt, criminal gang in \nPale, which had been effectively isolated. The indicted war criminal \nKaradzic was finally banned from political life, but one of his puppets \ntook his place.\n  No matter how ultra-nationalistic or even racist many of the people \nin the Republika Srpska were, most of the population caught on pretty \nquickly that their future was an absolute zero as long as their current \nleaders stayed in office.\n  The result was a reform movement, initially led by Mrs. Plavsic, \nwhich legally wrested control from the Pale thugs and moved the capital \nof the Republika Srpska to Banja Luka. Last year she lost an election, \nbut the government of the Republika Srpska is now led by Prime Minister \nDodik, a genuine democrat, who has survived attempts from Belgrade by \nMilosevic to unseat him, is supported by a multi-ethnic parliamentary \ncoalition, kept the lid on the situation during the Yugoslav air \ncampaign, and now is beginning to implement Dayton.\n  The situation in Bosnia, as we all know, is far from satisfactory, \nbut real progress has been made. And, back to my original point, in the \nRepublika Srpska we have the real historical parallel of a policy of \nexcluding a government from economic reconstruction assistance as long \nas it is ruled by an indicted war criminal or his puppet.\n  I hope this discussion of historical precedents may be helpful as the \nSenate continues to debate our Balkan reconstruction policy.\n\n[[Page S9938]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/30/senate-section/article/S9937-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9937-S9938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BALKAN HISTORICAL PARALLELS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN.

Mr. President I rise today to speak on the Regulatory \nOpenness and Fairness Act of 1999, of which I am an original cosponsor.\n  This legislation will ensure that the Food Quality Protection Act \n(FQPA) will carry out its original intent while protecting agricultural \nproducers from unnecessary regulations. The FQPA, enacted in 1996, was \nput in place to ensure that highest level of food safety. This is a \nnecessary and worthwhile goal. However, the EPA currently makes rulings \nthat are based on data without a sound science base. Instead, \nassumptions are based on propaganda and worst-case scenarios.\n  This legislation requires EPA to modernize the laws governing \npesticide use, using science-based data and evaluations. This will \nensure that American consumers will continue to receive the world's \nsafest food supply, and still allow those agricultural producers that \nprovide food and fiber the means to do so.\n  This bill will also require EPA to establish and administer a program \nfor tracking the effect of regulatory decisions of U.S. agriculture as \ncompared to world trends. Producers in other countries often do not \nface the regulatory nightmare American producers do. This will provide \na measure for that different and the impact it has on agricultural \nproducers in the U.S.\n  Additionally, this bill will establish a permanent Pesticide Advisory \nCommittee including food consumers, environmental groups, farmers, non-\nagricultural pesticide users, food manufacturers, food distributors, \npesticide manufacturers, federal and state agencies. Such a diverse \ngroup will serve all interests and maintain a safe food supply.\n  I thank Mr. Hagel for sponsoring this fine bill and look forward to \nworking with him in its passage. Through it we can work for the good of \nagriculture and food consumers alike.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/30/senate-section/article/S9938-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9938-S9939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ADMINISTRATION'S CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH CHINA\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I submit for the Congressional Record a \ncolumn by Michael Kelly that appeared in the July 28th edition of the \nWashington Post. Mr. Kelly asks in his column whether it ``strikes \nanyone as odd'' that the Clinton-Gore Administration continues \ndesperately to hand onto its policy of ``constructive engagement'' with \nChina, even as Beijing breaths fire in response to reasonable statement \nmade by the freely- and fairly-elected President of Republic of China \non Taiwan.\n  This Senator, for one, has serious questions about the wisdom of \nPresident Clinton's foreign policy as it relates to China, and the \ncompetence of the Clinton-Gore Administration to protect and advance \nAmerica's interest in this vital region of the world.\n  In response to statements by Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui that \ndiscussions and talks between Taiwan and China should be conducted on a \n``special state-to-state'' basis, China has repeatedly issued not-so-\nveiled threats of its intent to use military force against Taiwan \nunless President Lee retracts his statements.\n  What was the response of the Clinton-Gore Administration? Let me \nreference a news story from the July 26th edition of the Washington \nPost entitled ``Albright, Chinese Foreign Minister Hold `Very Friendly \nLunch.' '' The article reads in part,\n\n       Lee's announcement triggered a ferocious response by \n     Beijing. Washington also criticized it and dispatched a \n     representative to pressure Taiwan to modify its statement.\n       Today, Albright said that Richard Bush, the U.S. envoy to \n     Taiwan, told Lee ``that there needs to be . . . a peaceful \n     resolution to this and a dialogue. And I think that the \n     explanations offered thus far don't quite do it.''\n\n  Mr. President, this is an amazing as it is outrageous. Rather than \ndefend the Republic of China on Taiwan and its right to live in peace \nand choose its own form of government, Secretary of State Albright has \na ``very friendly lunch'' with one of the highest ranking members of \nthe repressive communist Chinese regime while one of her assistants \nreprimands and pressures Taiwan to appease China. Can it truly be our \nnation's policy is to protect China from Taiwan?\n  Taiwan is not the bully in this matter. Taiwan deserves America's \ncommitment to defend it against China's threats. Our nation should \nproudly and firmly stand by Taiwan, a blooming and prosperous democracy \nwhere free speech, religious freedom and the benefits of capitalism are \npracticed and enjoyed. The United States should stand in the future, as \nit has in the past, for freedom and democracy whenever those great \nqualities are threatened by the forces of repression.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article ``On The \nWrong Side,'' by Michael Kelly be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe  Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 28, 1999]\n\n                           On the Wrong Side\n\n                           (By Michael Kelly)\n\n       Back in the dear, dead days when the Democratic Party stood \n     for dreams a bit loftier than clinging to power, the labor \n     wing of the party liked to ask a question: ``Whose side are \n     you on?'' It was a good question because it was an awkward \n     one and an inescapable one. The question presents itself \n     these days, awkwardly and inescapably as always, in the \n     matter of Taiwan and China. Whose side are we on?\n       On the one hand, we have Taiwan, which is an ally and a \n     democracy. It is not a perfect ally nor a perfect democracy \n     (but neither is the United States). Formed out of the \n     nationalist movement that lost China to Mao's Communists, \n     Taiwan increasingly has wished for independent statehood. In \n     recent years, as the island has become more democratic and \n     more wealthy, it has become more aggressive in expressing \n     this wish.\n       On the one hand, we have China. The People's Republic is a \n     doddering, desperate despotism, in which a corrupt oligarchy \n     presides, only by the power of the gun, over a billion people \n     who would rather live in freedom. China has always regarded \n     Taiwan as an illegitimately errant province, ultimately to be \n     subjugated to Beijing's rule. In recent years, as China's \n     rulers have found themselves increasingly uneasy on their \n     thrones, they have attempted, in the usual last refuge of \n     dictators, to excite popular support by threatening \n     belligerence against an exterior enemy--in this case, Taiwan.\n       For two decades, the United States has supported a \n     deliberately ambiguous policy, which says that there should \n     be ``one China,'' but carefully does not say who should rule \n     that China. Ambiguity worked pretty well for a long time, but \n     it is a Cold War relic whose logic has expired, and its days \n     are running out.\n       Two weeks ago, Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui, recognized \n     this reality and said that henceforth Taiwan and China should \n     deal with each other on a ``state-to-state'' basis. Beijing \n     reacted with its usual hysterical bellicosity. This week, \n     Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan used a session of the \n     Association of Southeast Asian Nations to again threaten \n     Taiwan: ``If there occur any action for Taiwan independence \n     and any attempt by foreign forces to separate Taiwan from the \n     motherland, the Chinese people and government will not sit \n     back,'' Tang said. He added a warning to Secretary of State \n     Madeleine Albright to ``be very careful not to say anything \n     to fan the flames'' of independence.\n       Not to worry. Neither Madame Secretary nor anyone else in \n     the Clinton administration has the slightest intention of \n     fanning freedom's flames. Quite the contrary. The \n     administration has reacted to Lee's ``state-to-state'' \n     remarks by repeatedly reassuring Beijing that the United \n     States is entirely with it in this matter. On Monday Albright \n     made a point of saying that Lee's efforts to back off of his \n     remarks ``thus far don't quite do it.'' So, we are on China's \n     side.\n       We are on the side of a regime that, the administration's \n     own Justice Department tells us, has engaged in (1) a massive \n     and perhaps still ongoing campaign to steal America's most \n     valuable nuclear secrets; and (2) an effort to corrupt the \n     1996 elections by funneling cash to, principally, the \n     Clinton-Gore campaign and the Democratic National Committee.\n       We are on the side of a regime that, the administration \n     assures, is becoming more tolerant of political freedom. Is \n     that so? Beijing has intensified the persecution of political \n     dissidents since Clinton began his policy of ``constructive \n     engagement'' with China. Most recently, Beijing has been \n     hosting old-fashioned Stalinist show trials of democratic \n     dissidents; three organizers of the fledgling China \n     Democratic Party drew sentences of, respectively, 13, 12 and \n     11 years.\n       China also continues its campaign to destroy independent \n     religious movements. Accordingly to the group Human Rights in \n     China, the regime arrested 7,410 leaders of the Protestant \n     house-church movement in two months last year. Currently, \n     Beijing is undertaking a countrywide effort to stamp out the \n     spiritual movement Falun Gong. The New York Times reports \n     that more than 5,000 people have been arrested, and 1,200 \n     government officials who are movement members have been \n     shipped off to re-education schools to study Communist Party \n     doctrine.\n       We are on the side of a regime that forces abortions on \n     women who attempt to give ``unplanned'' births; a regime that \n     exploits\n\n[[Page S9939]]\n\n     the accidental bombing of its embassy to incite anti-American \n     riots, threatening U.S. citizens; a regime that continues to \n     sell weapons of mass destruction to rogue states inimical to \n     U.S. interests.\n       We are acting against a regime that seeks democratic \n     independence and a society rooted in the pursuit of life, \n     liberty and happiness.\n       Doesn't any of this strike anyone as odd?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/30/senate-section/article/S9939-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE U.S. ARMY SCHOOL OF THE AMERICAS\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my continued \nsupport for the U.S. Army School of the Americas (SOA), located at Fort \nBenning, Georgia. Legislation has been introduced by my colleagues both \nin the House and the Senate which would close the School of the \nAmericas, and last evening the House adopted an amendment to do so. Mr. \nPresident, I rise to support the School of the Americas and the vital \nmission it performs in encouraging diplomacy and democracy within the \nmilitaries located in the Americas.\n  The School of the Americas has been a key instrument of U.S. foreign \npolicy in Latin and Southern America for over fifty years and is the \nsingle most important instrument of our National Security Strategy of \nengagement in the Southern Hemisphere.\n  The legislation opposing the School has been accompanied by a \nmountain of communications alleging that this School, operated by the \nU.S. Army and funded by taxpayers' dollars, is the cause of horrendous \nhuman rights abuses in Central and South America. In twelve separate \ninvestigations since 1989, the Department of Defense, the Army, the GAO \nand others have found nothing to suggest that the School either taught \nor inspired Latin Americans to commit such crimes. Yet, sponsors of \nthese measures reproduce the critics' list of atrocities allegedly \ncommitted by a small number of graduates in order to transfer \nresponsibility for these crimes to the backs of the School and the Army \nrather than to the individuals themselves.\n  The School is, and always has been, a U.S. Army training and \neducation institution teaching the same tactics, techniques, and \nprocedures taught at other U.S. Army schools and imparting the very \nsame values that the Army teaches its own soldiers. These U.S. military \npersonnel receive the same training as all graduates of our military \nschools. To suggest that terrorist activities are taught to students \nwould suggest that we in fact teach terrorist activities to all of our \nown military personnel. This is assuredly not the case.\n  The School is commanded by a U.S. Army colonel whose chain of command \nincludes the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Infantry Center and \nthe Commanding General of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. \nThe School also receives oversight and direction from the Commander-in-\nChief of U.S. Southern Command. The School's staff and faculty includes \nover 170 U.S. Army officers, noncommissioned officers, enlisted \nsoldiers, and Department of the Army civilians. The School counts among \nits graduates over 1,500 U.S. military personnel including five general \nofficers currently serving on active duty in our military.\n  I agree completely with critics of the School that ``Human rights is \nnot a partisan issue,'' and I further agree that, in the past there \nwere indeed some shortcomings in the School's fulfillment of its \nmission to transmit all of the values we hold dear in our country. In \nthat regard, today, the U.S. Army School of the Americas has the U.S. \nArmy's premier human rights training program. The program has been \nexpanded in recent years in consultation with the International \nCommittee of the Red Cross and Mr. Steve Schneebaum, a noted human \nrights attorney and a member of the School's Board of Visitors. Every \nstudent and instructor at the School receives mandatory human rights \ninstruction and the International Committee of the Red Cross teaches \nhuman rights each year during the School's Command and General Staff \nand Peace Operations courses. Last year, over 900 Latin American \nsoldiers, civilians, and police received human rights instruction at \nthe U.S. Army School of the Americas.\n\n  Latin America is currently undergoing an unparalleled transformation \nto democratic governance, civilian control of the military, and \neconomic reform along free market principles. Almost every nation in \nLatin America has a democratically elected government. During this \ntransition, the region's militaries have accepted structural cuts, \nreduced budgets, and curtailed influence in society. In many cases, \ntheir acceptance of this new reality has been encouraged and enhanced \nby the strategy of engagement of which the U.S. Army School of the \nAmericas is an integral part. However, many Latin American democracies \nare fragile. True change does not occur in days, months, or even years. \nWe must continue to engage Latin American governments, including their \nmilitaries. Marginalizing or ignoring the militaries of the region will \nnot help in consolidating hard-won democracy but, instead, will have \nthe opposite effect. Our efforts to engage the militaries of the region \nare more important and more relevant than ever. The U.S. Army School of \nthe Americas is unique in this regard because it trains and educates \nlarge numbers of Latin American students who cannot be accommodated in \nother U.S. military service schools due to limited student spaces and \nthe inability of other U.S. military schools to teach in Spanish.\n  Over the years, changes have been made to enhance the School's focus \non human rights and diplomacy. Recently introduced courses such as \nDemocratic Sustainment, Humanitarian Demining, International \nPeacekeeping Operations, Counternarcotics Operations, and Human Rights \nTrain-the-Trainer, directly support shared security interests in the \nregion, and are not offered elsewhere. Other proposed changes include \nplacing the School under the jurisdiction of U.S. Southern Command and \nexpanding the Board of Visitors to include congressional membership--\nboth proposals which I strongly support.\n  By focusing on the negative, critics ignore the many recent positive \ncontributions that U.S. Army School of the Americas graduates have \nmade. In 1995, this nation helped broker a cease fire between Peru and \nEcuador when a historical border dispute threatened to ignite into war. \nThe key members of the delegations that put together that accord were \nU.S. Army School of the Americas graduates, from Peru, from Ecuador, \nand from the guarantor nations of the United States and Chile. In fact, \nthe Commander of the U.S. contingent to the multinational peacekeeping \nforce, who received special recognition from the State Department for \n``extraordinary contributions to U.S. diplomacy,'' was a 1986 graduate \nof the School's Command and General Staff course, and serves as the \ncurrent Commandant of the School. More recently, in 1997, the President \nof Ecuador was removed from office, creating a constitutional crisis. \nSome of the people of Ecuador called for the military to take power, \nbut their military refused. Many of the officers in the high command \nwere U.S. Army School of the Americas graduates. Finally, less than \nfour months ago, the President of Paraguay was impeached for \nmisconduct. Once again, a constitutional crisis ensued. Once again, the \nmilitary refused to take power. Once again many of the officers in that \nmilitary were U.S. Army School of the Americas graduates, including one \ngeneral officer who played a key role in the refusal.\n  I ask each of you to take a careful look at the U.S. Army School of \nthe Americas as it exists today. Look to the future. As stated by the \nSchool's critics, ``The contentious politics of U.S. foreign policy in \nCentral America in the 1980s are over.'' I strongly urge you to \ncontinue your support of the Army School of the Americas and the U.S. \nArmy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/30/senate-section/article/S9939-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9939-S9940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REGULATORY FAIRNESS AND OPENNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise today to signify my support for the \nintroduction of the Regulatory Fairness and Openness Act of 1999.\n  According to data compiled in the last five years, the State of \nWashington produces more than 230 food, feed and seed crops; ranks in \nthe top five for the value of the commodities produced; leads the \nnation in the production of apples, spearmint oil, red raspberries, \nhops, edible peas and lentils, asparagus, sweet cherries, and\n\n[[Page S9940]]\n\npears; is second in the nation in the production of winter wheat, \npotatoes, Concord grapes, and carrots; and contributes more than $5 \nbillion to the State's economy annually. Not only do all these facts \nsignify the importance of the agriculture industry to the State of \nWashington and the nation, but highlight the importance of having the \nproper tools and chemicals necessary to produce one of the most \nabundant, economical, and safest food supplies in the world.\n  I agreed to be an original cosponsor the Regulatory Fairness and \nOpenness Act of 1999 for many reasons, but the most significant reason \ncomes down to common sense. I supported the passage of the Food Quality \nProtection Act in 1996 and still believe in the intent of the \nlegislation. However, recent accounts from the agriculture industry \ncite concern about the practical application of reliable data and \nscience to the process.\n  Just this week a 25-year-old apple farmer from Orondo, Washington \nvisited my office to voice her concerns over the implementation of \nFQPA. Karen Simmons explained that with the current manner in which \nFQPA is being implemented, entire classes of pesticides are threatened \nwith elimination. Should these tools of agriculture be lost, an orchard \nlike Karen's faces possible extinction. Karen's story is not the first \nI've heard, as farmers from Washington have been invaluable in \nexpressing their concerns to me over the future of their livliood.\n  Karen's account mimics the thousands of reports my colleagues and I \nhave heard from growers across this country. Karen, like many farmers, \nnever follows the application suggestions prescribed by the chemicals \nshe uses. Not only does she not follow these recommendations for \npractical purposes, but because of the cost incurred as well.\n  For example, one of the pesticides she utilizes recommends \napplication up to twice a week, but Karen informed us that she rarely \nuses it that frequently. While Karen might not utilize this chemical \noften, it is imperative that she has it as a tool. Should this tool be \neliminated altogether, Karen's crop is susceptible to infestation, \nthereby putting her entire orchard in jeopardy.\n  Unfortunately, in establishing the risk cup for chemicals, EPA has \nbeen using application recommendations, often referred to as default \nassumptions, and not taking into consideration actual usage. This \napproach is threatening the tools growers have at their disposal. That \nis why it is imperative that we incorporate into the implementation of \nFQPA a rulemaking process, allowing growers, chemical utilizers, and \nhousehold pest producers the ability to divulge actual usage and to \napply practical sense to the process. How could we suggest threatening \nthe livelihood of the American farmer and others, while not providing \nfor them an avenue to participate, comment and clarify?\n  Children's health is equally important, and, as several of my \ncolleagues have suggested, improper application of the FQPA to \nhousehold pest controls could create a host of health hazards for \nchildren and the elderly. For example, there is a real threat that \ncurrent FQPA implementation could eliminate the use of some household \ninsecticides and repellants. As many of you know, children and the \nelderly are susceptible to disease, often carried by cockroaches and \nother insects. Improper control of these pests could equate to serious \nhealth hazards across the nation, a scenario none of us predicted with \nthe passage of FQPA.\n  Again, I stress that the intent of the legislation is not to alter \nthe importance or significance of human health, but to ensure that \ndecisions regarding health risks are informed and not hasty, that the \nintent of the FQPA is carried out with the use of sound science and \npractical application, that a dose of common sense is applied, and that \nadequate time is available to make certain all decisions and tolerance \nstandards are healthy and equitable.\n  Without question, the United States produces the most abundant, \ndesirable, inexpensive, and safest food supplies in the world. The FQPA \nmust be implemented in a fashion that not only takes into account these \nvery facts, but continues to consider the needs, choices and health of \nthe American consumer.\n  I thank my colleagues for their continuing interest in this issue, \nand look forward to working with everyone to pass the Regulatory \nFairness and Openness Act of 1999.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for a \nmoment about the Regulatory Fairness and Openness Act that I am pleased \nto cosponsor with a number of my colleagues who are concerned about the \nstate of agriculture today. I want to thank Senator Hagel and his staff \nfor their work on this legislation which refects the input of a number \nof agriculture groups, including the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n  When the Congress passed the Food Quality Protection Act in 1996, the \nidea was to update our pesticide laws so that our farmers could \ncontinue to provide the safest and most economical food supply in the \nworld. FQPA eliminated the outdated zero-tolerance Delaney clause for \npesticide residues and provided the EPA a framework to review and \napprove pesticides based on the best scientific evidence available \nabout any health risks these chemicals may pose. What was not intended \nwas to give the EPA the authority to embark on a course to eliminate \npesticides based on unrealistic, worst-case scenarios while keeping \nimportant stakeholders in the dark.\n  Agriculture in my state of Oregon is incredibly diverse. We have \neverything from large wheat or nursery operations to small berry farms \nand hazelnut orchards. While implication of FQPA will surely have \nimplications for program commodities like wheat and soybeans, it is the \nsmall speciality crops grown in my state that I am most concerned will \nbe the first to find what may be the only available crop protection \ntool arbitrarily axed by EPA. At a time when farms all across the \ncountry are in the grip of a price depression crisis, our farmers \nsimply can't afford to take another hit--especially one from their own \ngovernment.\n  Despite our hopes to the contrary, it has become apparent in recent \nmonths that legislation is needed to steer the Environmental Protection \nAgency back towards science-based review of pesticide tolerances under \nthe Food Quality Protection Act. The Regulatory Fairness and Openness \nAct that we are introducing today requires the EPA to expose its \ndecisionmaking process for public comment, identify areas where \nassumptions were made, expedite data collection procedures where \nneeded, and streamline the process to get economically viable \nalternative products approved. The common-sense legislation is the \nresult of consultation with more than 60 agriculture and pest control \norganizations.\n  Mr. President, the public has a right to know what processes are \nbeingused in the implementation of the FQPA and how the EPA is arriving \nat its decisions. Our farmers have a right to know that important crop \nprotection chemicals will not be eliminated on a whim by a federal \nagency. I hope colleagues agree with me that this measure of regulatory \nrelief is urgently needed, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of the Regulatory Fairness and Openness Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/30/senate-section/article/S9940-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9940-S9941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, earlier this week I introduced the \nHutchinson-Lincoln Wetlands Reserve Program Enhancement Act to help \nstrengthen the popular Wetlands Reserve Program administered by the \nNatural Resources Conservation Service. Simply put, this legislation \nwill act to strengthen the current WRP which provides financial \nincentives to farmers and private landowners who voluntarily set aside \nmarginal lands and restore them to optimal wetland wildlife habitat.\n  These restored wildlife areas are some of the best wildlife \nconservation habitat in America and are critical to the future of \nwaterfowl throughout our Nation. Established by the 1990 farm bill as a \nlong-term conservation option for farmers, the WRP protects farm \nwetlands using 10-year, 30-year, and permanent easements. Land which is \neligible for WRP is characterized by wetlands that are farmed, lands \nadjacent to protected wetlands, and croplands and pastures which are \nnaturally prone to flooding.\n  If eligible, the landowner voluntarily limits the use of the lands \nwhile retaining private ownership and access to the land. In addition, \nthey may also lease the land for hunting, fishing, and other \nundeveloped recreational activities. The NRCS, in conjunction with the \nlandowner, then develops a plan for the restoration and the maintenance \nof the wetland.\n  Once restored, wetlands act to: No. 1, improve water quality by \nfiltering sediments; No. 2, reduce flooding; No. 3, recharge ground \nwater; No. 4, promote biological diversity; and No. 5, furnish \neducational, recreational, and aesthetic benefits. These benefits, as a \nresult of the WRP, have helped landowners throughout the 46 States \nwhere farmers have currently enrolled in what has become a very \nsuccessful program.\n  At the local level, I want to mention three farmers in Arkansas who \nare benefiting from the WRP. Hattie Neely of Moro, AR, in Lee County, \ngrows soybeans and has enrolled 31 acres in this very important \nprogram. Then there is Donald Wallace of Gillett, AR, in Arkansas \nCounty, who grows soybeans, and he has enrolled 30 acres in the WRP. \nAnd Dick Carmichael of Monticello, AR, in Drew County, grows soybeans \nand rice and has enrolled 115 acres in the WRP.\n  In each case, these farmers are using the WRP to restore bottom land \nhardwood forests and a natural wildlife habitat. Other farmers in \nArkansas are using WRP to retire agricultural lands unsuited for crop \nproduction because of elevated levels of salt from irrigation water. In \nthis case, WRP lands filter runoffs, keeping salts and sediments in the \nwetlands and out of the natural waterways.\n  Despite the benefits to farmers across America, the WRP will soon \nbecome a victim of its own success. The current WRP is authorized to \nenroll up to 975,000 acres nationally through the year 2002. WRP is in \nsuch high demand from America's farmers that it will reach its acreage \ncap next year. The top 10 States--Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, \nCalifornia, Missouri, Iowa, Texas, Florida, Oklahoma, and Illinois--\nhave a combined enrollment of almost 427,000 acres in these States \nalone.\n  In response to the success of WRP, my bill seeks to expand the \nacreage cap from the proposed 180,000 acres in fiscal year 2000 to a \nnewly authorized maximum of 250,000 acres per year through the year \n2005. This will help to ensure that farmers who want to enroll in the \nprogram will have the option to do so.\n  There is no doubt that the American farmer faces an industry that is \nin crisis. In the race to find solutions for the many challenges facing \nfarmers, I want to ensure that my colleagues in the Senate do not \noverlook the importance of conservation to family farmers, both as a \nway to protect valuable wildlife resources and as a source of \nadditional income.\n  In the Mississippi Delta, family farmers are using the WRP to move \nfrequently flooded farmland away from high-risk, high-cost farming back \nto original hardwood timberlands.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for this opportunity to speak on behalf of \nfamily farmers who care about protecting the natural resources with \nwhich they are entrusted. I ask my colleagues to consider the \nimportance of wildlife conservation in the life of family farmers. Join \nme in the support of what I think is very good, very important, \nbipartisan conservation legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/30/senate-section/article/S9941-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9941-S9942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:20 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Berry, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2587.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah relative to state-negotiated compliance \n     actions related to the environment: to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                     House Concurrent Resolution 3\n\n       Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein:\n       Whereas, protection of public health and the environment \n     are among the highest priorities of state governments;\n       Whereas, Congress has provided by statute for the \n     delegation of certain federal program responsibilities to the \n     states;\n       Whereas, to obtain delegation of federal environmental \n     programs, a state must demonstrate that it has adopted laws, \n     regulations, and policies as stringent as federal laws, \n     regulations, and policies.\n       Whereas, over the past 25 years, the states have developed \n     and demonstrated expertise in operation of federal \n     environmental program enabling states to obtain and maintain \n     the delegations;\n       Whereas, the state of Utah, Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, \n     North Dakota, and South Dakota constitute an area designated \n     by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as Region VIII;\n       Whereas, the states in Region VIII make compliance with \n     environmental laws, rules, and permits the highest priority;\n       Whereas, the state of Utah has full delegation in all \n     federal environmental programs;\n       Whereas, the EPA and the states have bilaterally developed \n     over the past 25 years policy agreements which reflect roles \n     and which recognize that the primary responsibility for \n     enforcement and compliance resides with the states, with the \n     EPA taking enforcement action principally when the state \n     requests assistance or is unwilling or unable to take timely \n     and appropriate enforcement action;\n       Whereas, inconsistent with these policy agreements, the EPA \n     has conducted direct federal inspections within programs \n     delegated to states, has taken direct enforcement actions, \n     has levied fines and penalties against regulated entities in \n     cases where the state previously took appropriate action \n     consistent with the agreements to bring the entities into \n     compliance, and has failed to notify the states in advance of \n     their action;\n       Whereas, the EPA had begun to use its enforcement authority \n     in cases where the state had worked with the regulated entity \n     to achieve compliance, and the overfiling by the EPA \n     accomplished no further protection of the public health or \n     environment but only imposed an additional penalty on the \n     regulated entity;\n       Whereas, the EPA's current enforcement practices and \n     policies and the resultant detailed oversight and overfiling \n     of state actions substantially weaken the state's ability to \n     take compliance actions and resolve environmental issues;\n       Whereas, the EPA's enforcement practices and policies have \n     had an adverse impact on working relationships between the \n     EPA and states;\n       Whereas, the EPA's reliance on the threat of enforcement \n     action to force compliance may not result in environmental \n     protection, but rather may result in delay and litigation, \n     cripple incentives for technological innovation and provoke \n     animosity between government, industry, and the public; and\n       Whereas, the Western Governor's Association has adopted \n     ``Principles of Environmental Protection in the West,'' which \n     encourages collaboration not polarization, advocates the \n     replacement of command and control with economic incentives \n     and rewarding results and encourages the weighing of costs \n     against benefits in environmental decisions:\n       Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Legislature of the \n     state of Utah, the Governor concurring therein, requests the \n     EPA to refrain from overfiling or threatening to overfile on \n     state-negotiated compliance actions if the actions achieve \n     compliance with applicable state and federal law and are \n     protective of health and the environment.\n       Be it further Resolved, That the Legislature and the \n     Government request that the EPA, in taking enforcement and \n     compliance actions, recognize and defer to individual state \n     and local priorities that are important for the protection of \n     the environment.\n       Be it further Resolved, That the EPA should work with and \n     assist states in evaluating the overall effectiveness of \n     state compliance programs and not focus on the detail of \n     individual actions.\n       Be it further Resolved, That the Legislature and the \n     Governor request the Congress of the United States to \n     investigate EPA enforcement activities and require the EPA to \n     defer to state enforcement and compliance actions in \n     delegated states where the actions achieve compliance and are \n     protective of health and the environment.\n       Be it further Resolved, That copies of this resolution be \n     sent to the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, each \n     member of the Utah congressional delegation, the \n     Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, \n     the Assistant Administrator of the U.S. EPA Office of \n     Enforcement and Compliance, the Regional Administrator of the \n     U.S. EPA Region VIII, the National Governor's Association, \n     the National Council of State Legislators, the Council of \n     State Governments, the Western Governor's Association, and \n     the Environmental Council of the States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-281. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah relative to Taiwan's participation in the \n     World Health Organization; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n                       House Joint Resolution 12\n\n       Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah:\n       Whereas, good health is a basic right for every citizen of \n     the world and access to the highest standards of health \n     information and services is necessary to help guarantee this \n     right;\n       Whereas, direct and unobstructed participation in \n     international health cooperation forms and programs is \n     therefore crucial, especially with today's greater potential \n     for the cross-border spread of various infectious diseases \n     through increased trade and travel;\n       Whereas, the World Health Organization set forth in the \n     first chapter of its charter the objective of attaining the \n     highest possible level of health for all people;\n       Whereas, in 1977 the World Health Organization established \n     ``Health for all by the year 2000'' as its overriding \n     priority and reaffirmed that central vision with the \n     initiation of its ``Health for All'' renewal process in 1995;\n       Whereas, Taiwan's population of 21 million people is larger \n     than that of \\3/4\\ of the member states already in the World \n     Health Organization and shares the noble goals of the \n     organization;\n       Whereas, Taiwan's achievements in the field of health are \n     substantial, including one of the highest life expectancy \n     levels in Asia, maternal and infant mortality rates \n     comparable to those of western countries, the eradication of \n     such infectious diseases as cholera, smallpox, and the \n     plague, the first country in the world to provide children \n     with free hepatitis B vaccinations;\n       Whereas, prior to 1972 and its loss of membership in the \n     World Health Organization, Taiwan sent specialists to serve \n     in other member countries on countless health projects and \n     its health experts held key positions in the organization, \n     all to the benefit of the entire Pacific region;\n       Whereas, Taiwan is not allowed to participate in may World \n     Health Organization-organized forums and workshops concerning \n     the latest technologies in the diagnosis, monitoring, and \n     control of diseases;\n       Whereas, in recent years both the Taiwanese Government and \n     individual Taiwanese experts have expressed a willingness to \n     assist financially or technically in World Health \n     Organization-supported international aid and health \n     activities, but have ultimately been unable to render such \n     assistance;\n       Whereas, according to the constitutions of the World Health \n     Organization, Taiwan does not fulfill the criteria for \n     membership;\n       Whereas, the World Health Organization does not allow \n     observers to participate in the activities of the \n     organization; and\n       Whereas, in light of all of the benefits that such \n     participation could bring to the state of health not only in \n     Taiwan, but also regionally and globally:\n       Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Legislature of the \n     state of Utah urge the Clinton Administration to support \n     Taiwan and its 21 million people in obtaining appropriate and \n     meaningful participation in the World Health Organization.\n       Be it further Resolved, That United States policy should \n     include the pursuit of some initiative in the World Health \n     Organization which will give Taiwan meaningful participation \n     in a manner that is consistent with such organization's \n     requirements.\n       Be it further Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be \n     sent to the President of the United States, the United States \n     Secretary of State, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the members of Utah's congressional \n     delegation, the Government of Taiwan, and the World Health \n     Organization.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-282. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to imported \n     apple juice concentrate; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                          House Resolution 51\n\n       Whereas. The production of apple juice concentrate is an \n     important component of Michigan's agricultural bounty. \n     Michigan, which is traditionally the third largest apple-\n     growing state, is the nation's top apple-processing state. \n     This record of consistency has been achieved in the face of \n     many uncertain times in farming, including wild swings in our \n     Midwestern weather; and\n\n[[Page S9945]]\n\n       Whereas, In recent years, however, our apple growers and \n     processors have come to face even more serious threats from \n     foreign sources of apple juice concentrate selling their \n     products in this country at artificially low costs. From an \n     average imported price of apple juice concentrate of $10 per \n     gallon in 1995, the price has fallen by fifty percent. This \n     is far below the break-even point for American growers. \n     Coupled with the erosion of export opportunities due to the \n     troubled economies in the Asian markets, Michigan apple \n     growers and those in other states face severe threats to \n     their livelihood; and\n       Whereas, The opening up of markets that has taken place in \n     the past few years has brought many benefits. However, there \n     can be situations in which the removal of restrictions on \n     trade offers the chance for abuses. When a country, for \n     whatever purpose, encourages certain activities by helping a \n     specific industry gain an unfair advantage through below-cost \n     prices, steps need to be taken to ensure the viability of \n     American economic and social interests. The United States \n     Department of Agriculture has taken steps to assist certain \n     American farmers on a number of occasions. The possibility of \n     apple juice concentrate being ``dumped'' on the American \n     market is a situation that demands immediate attention and \n     thorough study; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to investigate \n     the issue of apple juice concentrate from other countries \n     being sold in the American market at prices below cost; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-283. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of New Hampshire relative to tobacco settlement \n     funds; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                     House Concurrent Resolution 12\n\n       Whereas, on November 23, 1998, representatives from 46 \n     states signed a settlement agreement with the 5 largest \n     tobacco manufacturers; and\n       Whereas, the Attorneys General Master Tobacco Settlement \n     Agreement culminated legal action that began in 1994 when \n     states began filing lawsuits against the tobacco industry; \n     and\n       Whereas, the respective states are presently in the process \n     of finalizing the terms of the Mast Tobacco Settlement \n     Agreement, and are making initial fiscal determinations \n     relative to the most responsible ways and means to utilize \n     the settlement funds; and\n       Whereas, under the terms of the agreement, tobacco \n     manufacturers will pay $206 billion over the next 25 years to \n     the respective states in up-front and annual payments; and\n       Whereas, New Hampshire is projected to receive \n     $1,304,689,150 through the year 2025 under the terms of the \n     Master Tobacco Settlement; and\n       Whereas, because many state lawsuits sought to recover \n     Medicaid funds spent to treat illnesses caused by tobacco \n     use, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) contends \n     that it is authorized and obligated, under the Social \n     Security Act, to collect its share of any tobacco settlement \n     funds attributable to Medicaid; and\n       Whereas, the Master Tobacco Settlement Agreement does not \n     address the Medicaid recoupment issue, and thus the Social \n     Security Act must be amended to resolve the recoupment issue \n     in favor of the respective states; and\n       Whereas, as we move toward final approval of the Master \n     Tobacco Settlement Agreement, it is imperative that state \n     sovereignty be preserved; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the State House of Representatives, the Senate \n     concurring:\n       That the New Hampshire legislature urges the United States \n     Congress to enact legislation amending the Social Security \n     Act to prohibit recoupment by the federal government of state \n     tobacco settlement funds; and\n       That it is the sense of the New Hampshire state legislature \n     that the respective state legislatures should have complete \n     autonomy over the appropriation and expenditure of state \n     tobacco settlements funds; and\n       That the New Hampshire state legislature most fervently \n     opposes any efforts by the federal government to earmark or \n     impose any other restrictions on the respective states' use \n     of state tobacco settlement funds; and\n       That copies of this resolution be transmitted by the house \n     clerk to the President of the United States; the President \n     and the Secretary of the United States Senate; the Speaker \n     and the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives; \n     and to each member of New Hampshire's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-284.

The possibility of \n     apple juice concentrate being ``dumped'' on the American \n     market is a situation that demands immediate attention and \n     thorough study; now, therefore be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives (the senate \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to investigate the issue of apple juice concentrate \n     from other countries being sold in the American market at \n     prices below cost, and to strengthen laws to identify the \n     country of origin for all products using concentrate and to \n     ensure that imported concentrate meets United States \n     standards; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-285.

A bill to amend the Community Development Banking and \nFinancial Institutions Act of 1994 with respect to population out-\nmigration levels in rural areas; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n     community development financial institutions (CDFI) technical \n                            corrections act\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Community \nDevelopment Financial Institutions Fund Technical Corrections Act.\n  This legislation will make the CDFI program more responsive to low-\npopulation rural areas. It will allow the program to fulfill its \nmission of building the capacity of financial institutions in parts of \nthe country that have experienced chronic, sustained out-migration in \nrecent years.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the CDFI Fund was established by the \nRiegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. \nThis program is intended to stimulate the creation and expansion of \ndiverse community development financial institutions. The fund invests \nfederal resources in--and builds the capacity of--private, for-profit \nand nonprofit financial institutions, leveraging private capital and \nprivate-sector talent and creativity. The fund invests in CDFI's using \nflexible tools such as equity investments, loans, grants, and deposits, \ndepending upon market and institutional needs.\n  The Core Component is the CDFI Fund's main program. In order to be \ncertified for funding, an entity must demonstrate that it has a primary \nmission of promoting community development, principally serves an \nunderserved investment area or targeted population, makes loan or \ndevelopment investments as its predominant business activity, provides \ndevelopment services, maintains accountability to its target market, \nand is a non-government entity.\n  In order for a geographical area to be eligible for investment, one \nof a number of objectively-defined economic distress criteria must be \nmet.\n  The problem, Mr. President, is that the objective measures of \neconomic distress as currently defined by the CDFI Fund do not fully \nreflect economic distress in low-population areas. Allow me to share \njust a couple examples with my colleagues.\n  First, significant parts of low-population rural states like North \nDakota have historically low unemployment rates and therefore cannot \nqualify on that basis. In many rural areas unemployment remains \nstatistically nearly non-existent despite--and in fact because of--a \nlack of non-agricultural jobs. In rural North Dakota, the unemployed \nhave little choice but to leave for urban areas.\n  The result is unemployment rates as low as two or three percent in \nrural parts of my state and the misleading\n\n[[Page S9947]]\n\nimpression of a strong economy. It is also worth noting that such rural \nareas often suffer from high underemployment, rather than high \nunemployment.\n  Additionally, the CDFI Fund program considers an area economically \ndistressed if median family income is at or below 80 percent of the \nnational average, or if the percentage of the population living in \npoverty is at least 20 percent. Here again, Mr. President, these \ncriteria do not accurately capture the level of economic distress in \nlow-population rural areas. Prolonged out-migration in many rural areas \ndue to the loss of family farms and a shortage of non-agricultural jobs \nkeeps median incomes at higher levels.\n  There are other economic distress criteria in the CDFI program, Mr. \nPresident, but they all share one thing in common: they all fail to \nfully register the unique economic distress found in a good part of \nrural America.\n  This leads me to the most frustrating aspect of the CDFI program for \nmany low-population rural areas. Current CDFI guidelines consider an \narea economically distressed and suffering from out-migration if county \npopulation loss between 1980 and 1990 was at least 10 percent. This \neffort to utilize out-migration figures as a measure of economic \ndistress is laudable. However, the CDFI program does so in a manner \nthat does nothing for many parts of rural America, including my state.\n  Mr. President, change in the size of a population has two components. \nOne is what demographers term natural population growth. This is \ncomputed by subtracting deaths from births. The other variable is \nmigration, which is determined by subtracting departures from arrivals.\n  If you assumed that out-migration-related economic distress was \ndetermined under the CDFI program by looking at out-migration numbers, \nyou would be mistaken. In fact, birth and mortality rates are \neffectively factored into calculations of out-migration.\n  Instead of net migration loss, the determinate criterion under \ncurrent CDFI guidelines is the change in the overall sum total of the \npopulation from 1980 to 1990. Consequently, many counties that have \nexperienced a continual hemorrhage of population to the cities, but \nalso which have robust birth rates and long life expectancies, have not \nqualified for the CDFI program.\n  Mr. President, this makes no sense. Natality and mortality rates have \nnothing to do with out-migration.\n  Just a couple of statistics illustrate why this problem needs to be \nfixed. Nearly every non-metro county in North Dakota experienced a more \nthan 10 percent net migration loss between 1980 and 1990. However, \ntoday only slightly more than two thirds of rural North Dakota counties \nqualify for the CDFI program because the program's guidelines measure \noverall population change, not net migration loss. Birth rates have \nbeen high enough and lifespans long enough to hide the real story of \nout-migration in a dozen counties in my state.\n  Mr. President, instead of wheat or sunflowers, the top export in many \nparts of farm country is people. Unless they can find work in the \nshrinking agriculture industry, increasing numbers of Americans who \nwere born and raised in the rural Upper Great Plains are being forced \nto the cities to find work. They become statistics in a continuing and \nunder-recognized exodus driven by economic depression, one that is \ndestroying two of our nation's greatest assets: its small towns and \nfamily farms.\n  Mr. President, I want to see the CDFI program work for rural America, \nto help save our rural communities and keep people on the land. Today, \nI am introducing legislation that will help it do just that.\n  Mr. President, my bill is very simple. It amends the Riegle Community \nDevelopment and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 to allow non-metro \ncounties to qualify for the CDFI program if net migration loss--rather \nthan just overall population loss--was at least 10 percent during the \nyears 1980 to 1990.\n  Let me be clear: my bill does not strike any part of the Riegle Act \nand does not make major revisions to that landmark legislation. Rather, \nmy bill makes a technical, perfecting correction that will help make \nthe CDFI Fund work as intended for rural America. Consequently, I have \nentitled this measure the CDFI Technical Corrections Act.\n  Eighteen states and the District of Columbia, had populations of \nfewer than two million people during the 1990 Census, Mr. President. \nThat is roughly one-third of the states. Yet of all the Core Component \nloans the CDFI Fund has made over the past three years, only about 12 \npercent have been to entities in these low-population states. The CDFI \neconomic distress criteria need to be changed to more accurately \nreflect the level of economic distress in much of rural America. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in fixing the CDFI economic distress criteria \nby passing my technical corrections bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 1470. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to ensure that adequate \nactions are taken to detect, prevent, and minimize the consequences of \naccidental releases that result from criminal activity that may cause \nsubstantial harm to public health, safety, and the environment; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                     CHEMICAL SECURITY ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the \nChemical Security Act of 1999, a bill which will address the threat of \ncriminal attack on chemical facilities.\n  The FBI and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry have \nwarned us that the possibility of terrorist and criminal attacks on \nchemical plants is a serious threat to public safety. The scenarios \nthey describe are truly chilling.\n  The concerns about criminal attack on chemical plants were initially \nraised in the context of Internet access to chemical accident \ninformation. Some were concerned that criminals could use chemical \naccident information, gained through the Internet, to target their \nattacks. In response, we will soon send a bill to the President that \nwill balance the benefits of public access to chemical accident \ninformation against the threat of criminal attack.\n  However, Mr. President, the underlying issue is not Internet access \nto such information--no resourceful criminal needs the Internet to find \na chemical plant to attack. A chemical plant target can be found by \ndriving through neighborhood, reading a city map, or accessing \ninformation already available from government and business sources.\n  The real issue is the vulnerability of chemical facilities to \nattack--a vulnerability which can arise from a lack of adequate \nsecurity at chemical facilities, as well as the use of inherently \nhazardous chemical operations, even when safer technologies are \navailable.\n  The Chemical Security Act of 1999 will directly address the potential \ndanger of criminal attack on chemical facilities. First, the Act will \nclarify that it is the general duty of chemical facilities under the \nClean Air Act to reduce their own vulnerability to criminal attack. \nSecond, it will require the Attorney General, within one year, to \ndetermine whether chemical facilities are taking adequate measures to \nreduce their vulnerability to criminal attacks that could cause \nsubstantial harm to public health, safety, and environment. Third, if \nthe Attorney General finds that chemical facilities are not taking such \nactions, the Act will require the Attorney General, in consultation \nwith the Environmental Protection Agency, within two years, to \npromulgate regulations requiring appropriate measures to detect, \nprevent, and minimize the consequences of such criminal attack.\n  Mr. President, the American public has the right to chemical \nfacilities that are safe from criminal attack.\n  I urge my colleagues to co-sponsor this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"},

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 169--COMMENDING GENERAL WESLEY K. CLARK, UNITED \n                              STATES ARMY\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Stevens) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed \nServices:\n\n                              S. Res. 169\n\n       Whereas General Wesley K. Clark has had a long and \n     distinguished military career, which includes graduating \n     first in the class of 1966 from the United States Military \n     Academy at West Point and serving in command positions at \n     every level in the United States Army, culminating in service \n     concurrently in the positions of Supreme Allied Commander, \n     Europe and Commander-in-Chief of the United States European \n     Command;\n       Whereas General Clark was integral to the formulation of \n     the Dayton Accords;\n       Whereas General Clark most recently distinguished himself \n     by his tireless, resourceful, and successful leadership of \n     the first military action of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization despite severe constraints; and\n       Whereas General Clark's record of exemplary and dedicated \n     service is an example which all military officers should seek \n     to emulate and is deserving of special recognition: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That (a) the United States Senate commends and \n     expresses its gratitude to General Wesley K. Clark, United \n     States Army, for his outstanding record of military service \n     to the United States of America.\n       (b) The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy of \n     this resolution to General Wesley K. Clark.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am submitting today a resolution which \ncommends General Wesley K. Clark for his outstanding service to the \nUnited States. I am pleased to be joined by Mr. McCain and Mr. Stevens \nas cosponsors of the resolution.\n  I was sorry to learn from the Wednesday morning's newspapers that \nGeneral Clark would be leaving his current post, where he serves \nsimultaneously as the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe and as \nCommander-in-Chief of the United States European Command, before his \ntour was scheduled to end. When General Clark retires next year, the \nUnited States will be losing one of its finest officers. And I say that \nnot just because of what he just accomplished in successfully leading \nNATO forces into battle for the first time, but because of the \nexemplary record General Clark compiled over 33 years of service to our \nNation.\n  Wes Clark graduated first in his class from West Point in 1966, and \nwas selected to attend Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. After \ngraduating from Oxford General Clark distinguished himself in Vietnam, \nwhere he commanded a mechanized infantry company in combat. General \nClark went on to command two other companies, as well as an armor \nbattalion at Fort Carson, Colorado, a brigade in the 4th Infantry \nDivision, also at Fort Carson, the National Training Center at Fort \nIrwin, California, the 1st Calvary Division at Fort Hood, Texas, and \nthe United States Southern Command, headquartered in Panama.\n  I won't list the numerous staff jobs in which General Clark has \nserved, but I do point out that General Clark, as the Director of \nStrategic Plans and Policy on the Joint Staff, was integral to the \nformulation of the Bosnian Peace Accords, negotiated in Dayton. In \nreviewing the numerous positions General Clark has held since he \ngraduated from West Point, it is beyond question that Wes Clark is an \nofficer who has served our Nation well during the last 33 years.\n  I recently had a chance to visit with General Clark at his \nheadquarters in Brussels. Despite months of getting little sleep, I'm \ntold it was about four hours per night, General Clark was able to \nexplain to me clearly and in detail our military operations in Kosovo \nand Serbia. His grasp of every nuance of every plan and option, was \nevident, and only reinforced his reputation for thoroughness. Nothing \ndemonstrates his reputation for thoroughness and resourcefulness. \nNothing demonstrates this more clearly than one simple fact: In an \nenvironment where General Clark was operating under severe constraints, \nhe led NATO forces to victory. He was tireless; he was imaginative; and \nultimately, he was victorious.\n  This resolution commends General Clark and expresses the Senate's \ngratitude to him not just because of his recent service, but because of \nhis lifetime of service. General Clark deserves recognition not only \nfor achieving results, but also for his personal integrity. His record \nof saying what he believes should be said without respect to whether \nthat is what other people necessarily want to hear is an example that \nothers should seek to emulate.\n  General Wes Clark has had a career distinguished by exemplary and \ndedicated service to our Nation. I urge the adoption of the Senate of \nthis resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, first of all, I commend the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi for the introduction of this \nresolution. I associate myself with his remarks. I note for the Record, \namong the biographical comments that Senator Cochran made concerning \nGeneral Clark, special emphasis on the fact that he hails from Little \nRock, AK.\n  So with my fellow Arkansans, we express our pride at General Clark \nand his exemplary career, the service he has rendered our country with \ngreat distinction. I commend the Senator from Mississippi for \nintroducing, I think, a very important resolution.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas for his kind remarks.

After nearly 28 years of dedicated service \naround the world, Colonel Alsup will retire from the United States Army \non September 30, 1999. Colonel Alsup was born in Birmingham, Alabama. \nHe enlisted in the Army in 1971 as a private and was later commissioned \nas a Military Intelligence Second Lieutenant upon completion of the \nInfantry Officer Candidate School at Fort Benning, Georgia.\n  Throughout his military career, Colonel Alsup distinguished himself \nas a true professional and an exceptional leader. His initial \nassignments included: a tour with 8th Special Forces Group, Fort \nGulick, Panama; duties as a counterintelligence special agent and staff \nofficer with the 902th Military Intelligence Group, Fort Meade, MD; and \nintelligence officer, 4th Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, 8th Infantry \nDivision in Mainz, Germany during the height of the Cold War. He \nsuccessfully commanded at the company, battalion, and brigade levels, \nculminating with the prestigious 501st Military Intelligence Brigade, \nYongsan, Korea.\n  Colonel Alsup also excelled at a variety of teaching and staff \nofficer positions, including Reserve Officer Training Corps duty at the \nUniversity of Alabama; Staff Group Leader, Combined Arms and services \nStaff School, Fort Leavenworth; Director of Intelligence, 24th Infantry \nDivision, Fort Stewart, GA; Director of Intelligence, Eight U.S. Army, \nYongsan, Korea; and duty on the Army Staff in Legislative Liaison and \nthe Directorate for Operations and Plans.\n  Colonel Alsup's final assignment as Assistant Director of \nIntelligence for the Joint Staff, Washington, DC, showcased his \nsuperior grasp of national intelligence issues, his impressive \nmanagement skills, and his ability to perform under pressure. Colonel \nAlsup provided unparalleled intelligence support to the senior \nleadership of the Executive and Legislative Branches, contributing \nsignificantly to their understanding of national level crisis and \ncontingencies. His positive impact on the Joint Staff, the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, and the intelligence community will be felt for \nyears to come.\n  Colonel Alsup is a distinguished graduate of the U.S. Army Command \nand General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth and the Naval War College, \nNewport, Rhode Island. His awards and decorations include the Defense \nSuperior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, the \nMeritorious Service Medal with Four Oak Leaf Clusters, the Army \nCommendation Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the Special Forces Tab, \nthe Senior Parachutist Badge, and the Ranger Tab.\n  Through his distinctive accomplishments, Colonel Charles W. Alsup \nculminates a distinguished career in the service of his country and \nreflects great credit upon himself, the United States Army, the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, and the Department of Defense.\n  I wish every success to Colonel Alsup as he finishes his truly \nremarkable military career and thank him for a job exceedingly well \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/30/senate-section/article/S9953-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO RICHARD TORTORELLI\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor Richard Tortorelli of Milford, New Hampshire, who has retired \nfrom the Milford Fire Department after 41 years of service.\n  Richard began his career with the Milford Fire Department while in \nhigh school. At the age of 21, he joined the fire department as an on-\ncall fire fighter. In 1986, he became the first full-rime Fire Chief in \nMilford's history. Under his leadership, the fire department has seen \nmany changes: a move from Town Hall in 1974 into the current station, a \nchange from a one-town dispatch center to the regional Milford Area \nCommunication Center, and equipment updates along with specialized \ntraining.\n  Even though Richard works in one of the most dangerous professions in \nthe country, he has never lost a member of his department. One of the \nmost rewarding aspects of his career is that the number of fire calls \nin Milford has decreased over the years. He acknowledges that teaching \nfire prevention is not as thrilling as fighting a fire, however it is \nvery important.\n  I would like to thank Chief Tortorelli for his service to the Town of \nMilford, and his dedication and leadership to the Milford Fire \nDepartment. I commend Richard for his exemplary career and tireless \nefforts. I wish him luck in his future endeavors.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1467 introduced \nearlier today by Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1467) to extend the funding levels for aviation \n     programs for 60 days.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1467. This bill \nwill extend the Federal Aviation Administration's, FAA, Airport \nImprovement Program, AIP, for sixty days. It is critical that Congress \ncomplete the authorization for this program for this fiscal year. \nOtherwise, the FAA will be prohibited from issuing much-needed grants \nto airports in every state, regardless of whether or not funds have \nbeen appropriated. In fact, there are still nearly $300 million in \nappropriated funds for the current fiscal year that cannot be spent \nbecause AIP authority expires on August 6.\n  If we do not act to reauthorize this program for at least the \nremainder of this fiscal year, we will cause harm to the transportation \ninfrastructure of our country. AIP grants play a critical part in \nairport development. Without these grants, important safety, security, \nand capacity projects will be hampered throughout the country. \nTherefore, we must act swiftly.\n  The safety of the traveling public depends upon the continued flow of \nAIP monies. For example, airports use these funds to install instrument \nlanding systems, which help guide airplanes to safe landings when \nvisibility is impaired. AIP funds are also used for airport safety \nprojects related to runway\n\n[[Page S9954]]\n\napproach lighting; aircraft deicing equipment; snow removal equipment; \nrepair of damaged runways; rescue and firefighting equipment; and \nrunway safety areas for aircraft that have trouble stopping after a \nlanding. It is my understanding that AIP funds were used to construct \nan innovative ``arrestor bed'' at the end of a runway at New York's JFK \nAirport. A few months ago, that arrestor bed prevented a commuter plane \nfrom plunging into a bay. It was credited with saving lives on that \nflight.\n  This bill will also extend the Aviation Insurance Program, which is \ncommonly known as the War Risk Insurance Program. It provides insurance \nfor commercial aircraft that are operating in high-risk areas, such as \ncountries at war or on the verge of war. Commercial insurers will not \nusually provide coverage for such operations, which are often required \nto further U.S. foreign policy or national security objectives. For \nexample, commercial airlines were needed to ferry troops and equipment \nto the Middle East for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. If \nWar Risk Insurance had not been available, our troops may not have been \nadequately supported.\n  This extension will also give us more time to work on a more \ncomprehensive aviation bill that is still desperately needed. We have \nbeen working hard to accommodate the concerns that many Senators have \nwith respect to provisions in S. 82, the Air Transportation Improvement \nAct. I believe we can bring a bill to the floor that will require very \nlittle of the Senate's time.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to support swift passage \nof this short-term extension of the AIP. If we fail to act, the FAA \nwill not be able to address vital security and safety needs in every \nState in the Nation. We must reaffirm our commitment to providing the \npublic with a safe and efficient air transportation system. This bill \nwill help us meet that goal.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements relating to this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the Senate is returning a very \ndistinguished and qualified Commissioner back to the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission. I am pleased that my good friend Curtis L. \nHebert, Jr. of Pascagoula, Mississippi is that Commissioner.\n  As a former member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, I appreciate the high standard that FERC nominees are held \nto during committee consideration. Throughout Curt's nearly two-year \ntenure as a FERC Commissioner, he demonstrated that he has not only the \nknowledge, but the determination and skills to get the job done. He has \nbeen a responsible and able federal steward of the utility industry \nacross the United States. I expect that he will continue to serve the \nFERC and our nation with the same enthusiasm and foresight.\n  Before Curt came to Washington, he served the state of Mississippi as \na member and a chair of the Public Service Commission for several \nyears. During that time, he demonstrated the ability to balance the \ndiverse utility interests in our state. This was no easy task. \nMississippi is the home to both public and private power companies, \nPUHCAs and providers of all sizes. Curt was also my representative in \nthe Mississippi legislature, where he did an excellent job. Curt has \nproven that he has the skills necessary to address the needs of each of \nthese entities, while keeping the best interest of the consumer in \nmind.\n  Congress must recognize that national electric utility deregulation \nis on the horizon. How and when a new system will be created remains to \nbe seen. What is certain, however, is that the FERC will be \ninstrumental in guiding Congress toward competition in the utility \nindustry. I am confident that Curt has the experience and insight \nnecessary to help us reach the right balance of interests. Most \nimportantly, Curt understands what deregulation means at the state \nlevel. Already, Congress has witnessed deregulation of several states, \nbut Congress will value the FERC's input concerning deregulation.\n  There is no industry as complex as the utility world--and none that \nimpacts the lives of Americans more directly every hour of every day. \nThe challenges ahead are great and must be tackled head on. There is no \ndenying that the FERC Commissioners have their work cut out for them.\n  I have enjoyed working with Curt, and spending time with his wife, \nVirginia, and their two children, Lane and Ashley. They are an \nauthentic, Mississippi family.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has unanimously confirmed Curt Hebert as \na member of the FERC, thus ensuring that the future of the electric \nutility industry is in good hands. I congratulate him on this \naccomplishment and wish him the best of luck in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/30/senate-section/article/S9956-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
