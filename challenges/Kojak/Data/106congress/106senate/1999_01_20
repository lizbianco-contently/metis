Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 23 now at the desk.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 23) congratulating Michael Jordan on \n     the announcement of his retirement from the Chicago Bulls and \n     the National Basketball Association.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is, indeed, fitting that Senate \nResolution 23 in this 106th Congress be dedicated to a man who \nimmortalized the No. 23 as a player for the Chicago Bulls.\n  I rise today to pay tribute to a man who is a true legend both on and \noff the hardwood. Michael Jordan may have retired last week from the \nChicago Bulls and professional basketball, but he is anything but \nretired. He may well be remembered as the greatest basketball player of \nall time, but as long as boys and girls and men and women play this \nuniquely American game, they can also remember a great legacy beyond \nsports. We all owe Michael Jordan a special tribute, not only for his \nexcellence at the game and his practiced skills on the basketball court \nbut as a decent human being. Michael Jordan is an outstanding citizen \nof his community, the city of Chicago, the State of Illinois, his \nnative North Carolina, but also of America and the world.\n  It is often asked in many polls across the Earth: Who is the most \npopular man, the most well-known man? And it seems, now that the \nresults are in--and not surprising--it is a basketball player from \nChicago, No. 23, Michael Jordan.\n  Those who have not traveled around the world may find that hard to \nbelieve, but my own limited personal experience can tell you it is the \ncase. I can recall in the streets of Shanghai, in China, when my wife \nand I were walking along and saw a little boy with a Chicago Bulls \nbaseball cap on, and we went up to this little boy, who did not speak \nEnglish, and I leaned over to him --he was about 9 years old--and I \nsaid, ``Michael Jordan,'' he looked back at me and he said, ``Scottie \n`Peepin'.''\n  A friend of mine was traveling on the Trans-Siberian Railroad across \nMongolia. He was seated there for a while, and two native Mongolians \ncame in and sat down, and after they had been on the train several \nhours, one of them looked at him and said, ``Michael Jordan.''\n  When I visited Portugal a few years ago, in the streets of Lisbon the \nkids were wearing Chicago Bulls gear and talking about Michael Jordan. \nIn Budapest, in Hungary, at the little flea markets on the square you \nwill find these nestling dolls--the wooden dolls that we traditionally \nassociate with Russian culture--are now being made with Michael Jordan \non the outside and the entire Chicago Bulls teams on the inside. Isn't \nit amazing that this one man has now become so well known and so \npopular around the world.\n  Well, he is a gifted man, gifted as few individuals have ever been, \nand more significantly, he has not squandered those gifts. He continues \nto contribute to our communities through his support for the James R. \nJordan Boys and Girls Club, named after his father, the Jordan \nInstitute for Families at the University of North Carolina at Chapel \nHill, and the Ronald McDonald Houses of Greenville, Chapel Hill, Durham \nand Winston-Salem. For the families of seriously ill children who are \nbeing treated at nearby hospitals, Michael Jordan's charity makes a \nreal difference.\n  To have seen him perform on a basketball court is to have witnessed a \ntalent that has been fashioned out of years of dedication, planning, \npractice, conditioning, mental discipline, will and spirit. As the \ngreatest individual basketball player, he leaves his sport as the \nsupreme team player. Michael Jordan defined the 1990s. He gained \neternal fame as the greatest leader and ultimate team player in a team \nsport: six NBA championships in 8 years. He was so magnificent he \ncontinued to top the statistical lists, yet made everyone around him \nbetter, as individuals and components of a team.\n  I can recall that when my son was in college and we went to our first \nBulls game, you had the feeling, years ago, that at any moment in that \ngame Michael Jordan would take control; no matter what the score was, \nhe would be in control. The Bulls won their first NBA title in 1991, \nadded two more in a row before Michael Jordan's premature retirement to \nfollow another dream.\n  He tried baseball but returned 2 years later. I was at his first \ncomeback game. He was still good, but rusty, and a lot of men might \nhave been discouraged by that and decide to walk away. He did not. He \nrededicated himself to his skills, honed them, developed a new fade-\naway shot, and led the NBA in statistics as well as MVP, taking the \nBulls to the championship again. Defying conventional wisdom, Jordan \nand the Bulls picked up where they left off in 1993. With a new set of \nteammates, including the remarkable Scottie Pippen, whom we will miss \nin Chicago, a rejuvenated Jordan played the best basketball of his \nlife, and the Bulls registered the best league record in history with \n72 regular season games and a world championship in 1996. They added \nanother title in 1997, and completed the double three-peat last June, \n1998--six titles in 8 years in two clusters of three. The unifying \nlink? Michael Jordan.\n  Time was running out and the Bulls were trailing the Utah Jazz by a \npoint when Jordan stole the ball from Karl Malone, dribbled up court, \nand with everyone in the world knowing what he was going to do, \nanswered with a perfect swish--all net--on the last shot of the last \ngame of his career to win the Bulls' sixth NBA title. Jordan was named \nthe most valuable player in the playoffs again. In all six Bulls' \nchampionships the most valuable player each time was Michael Jordan. He \nhas done his work well, always with dignity, always with class, and \nalways with dedication.\n  He takes care of his own family. He has now said that he is going to \ndedicate his life to carpooling--I have to see that. He has dedicated \nhimself to his teammates and friends and to the communities that he \nlives in.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the citizens of my home State of Illinois \nand on behalf of my colleague in the U.S. Senate, Senator Peter \nFitzgerald--who truly makes this a bipartisan effort--and for fans \nthroughout America and the world, I am proud to offer S. Res. 23, \nhonoring Michael Jordan for his incredible accomplishments both on and \noff the court.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senator Dick \nDurbin, my distinguished colleague from Illinois, in introducing S. \nRes. 23, commending Michael Jordan on his retirement from the Chicago \nBulls and the National Basketball Association.\n  For thirteen years, Michael Jordan has entertained the people of \nChicago with his performance on the basketball court. The six \nchampionships he brought to Chicago have been a great source of pride \nand unity for the citizens of Illinois. His accomplishments are many, \nincluding ten scoring titles, five Most Valuable Player awards, and \ntwelve All-Star Game appearances. He was also the first player to win \nthe MVP and Defensive Player of the Year awards in the same year, which \nhe did in 1988. In addition, he was named the NBA's Rookie of the Year \nin the 1984-85 season.\n  I offer my congratulations to Michael Jordan on all of his \naccomplishments, and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.\n\n[[Page S729]]\n\n  I thank the Senate for its swift passage of this resolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, let me speak briefly, because I see the \nSenators from Iowa and Minnesota are here. Let me say, about the \nPresident's State of the Union Address last night, we are very proud of \nthe fact that the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate \noffered a battery of legislation supporting the President's goals. I \nwas heartened by the fact that the President lifted our eyes from the \ndrudgery of our Senate trial and spoke again to the many issues which \nreally have brought us to Congress in an effort to try to improve the \nlives of Americans and American families.\n  The President has taken a fiscally responsible approach by \nsuggesting, for example, that as we stabilize Social Security we do not \nrun up greater deficits. He is pledging a percentage of the future \nsurpluses to stabilize and protect Social Security. That is a \nresponsible approach and one which future generations will certainly \napplaud. He has made a similar commitment to the Medicare system, \nsaying that some 15 or 16 percent of the surplus will be dedicated to \nmake certain that it is solvent through the year 2020.\n  I was heartened by two other things that the President suggested. At \nthe turn of this century, as we embarked upon the 20th century, America \ndistinguished itself and the world as a nation dedicated to public \neducation. We became a nation of high school students, and during a \nspan of some 20 years on average a new high school was built once every \nday in America. We democratized education, we created opportunity, and \nwe created the American century.\n  Will we do it again for the 21st century? President Clinton \nchallenged us last night as a Congress to come together, Republicans \nand Democrats, dedicated to public education. I think we could and \nshould do that. I am happy that he has shown leadership again in this \nimportant field.\n  And finally, and this is on a personal note, for more than 10 years \nin Congress I have joined with many of my colleagues, including the \nSenator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, and Senator Wellstone from \nMinnesota, Senator Lautenberg from New Jersey, and so many others in \nour battle against the tobacco industry. We believe it is nothing short \nof disgraceful that we continue to have more and more of our \nadolescents in America addicted to this deadly product. The Senate \ndropped the ball last year. We had a chance to pass meaningful \nlegislation to protect our kids, but a partisan minority stopped the \ndebate. The tobacco lobby won.\n  Now I hope that we can reverse that on the floor of the Senate and \nthe floor of the House of Representatives. But if we cannot, President \nClinton said last night we will join, as some 42 other States have, in \ncourt, suing the tobacco companies as a Federal Government for the \ncosts that American taxpayers have incurred because of their deadly \nproduct.\n  I salute the President for doing that. I applaud him for his \nleadership, again, in this field of issues that is fraught with \npolitical danger. I believe that his speech last night gave us some \nhope that we can move forward, even if Congress fails to do the right \nthing and protect our children.\n  We stand at an important crossroads. There is no inherent reason why \nthe change in calendar from 1999 to 2000 should matter. Some say it is \njust another year. But we humans find significance in that event, and \nthe question is whether the 106th Congress, which will bridge the \ncenturies, will be a Congress that will be remembered as a productive \nCongress that came together on a bipartisan basis to help Americans, \nnot only today, but in generations to come.\n\n  We have to continue to ask ourselves why we are here, how we can make \nAmerica a better place, and the President's State of the Union Address \ngave us the direction.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/20/senate-section/article/S729-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S729-S733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       OPEN SENATE DELIBERATIONS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I take the floor today with my colleague \nand friend from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, to speak about an issue \nthat is going to be coming up here in the next several days that is \ngoing to have an importance to all of the American people and, indeed, \nto future generations. That is the issue of whether or not the Senate, \nin its deliberations on the impeachment of President Clinton, will do \nit in secret or will do it in public; will do it behind closed doors, \nbehind a curtain of secrecy, or do it openly so that the American \npeople know what we are doing. I want to take just a few minutes to lay \nout the case for why I believe it should be open.\n  Last week, Mr. President, I raised an objection during the trial to \nthe continued use of the word ``jurors,'' as it pertains to Senators \nsitting in a Court of Impeachment. I did that for a number of reasons, \nbecause we are not jurors. We are more than that. We are not just \nsimply triers of fact. We are not just simply finders of law. But \nsitting as a Court of Impeachment, we have a broad mandate, an \nexpansive role to play. We have to take everything into account, \neverything from facts--yes, we have to take facts into account--we have \nto take law into account, but we also have to take into account a broad \nvariety of things: how the case got here; what it is about; how \nimportant it is; how important is this piece of evidence weighed \nagainst that; what is the public will; how do the people feel about \nthis; what will happen to the public good if one course of action is \ntaken over another. These are all things we have to weigh, and that is \nwhy I felt strongly that Senators, in our own minds and in the public \nminds, should not be put in the box of simply being a juror.\n  One other aspect of that is if, in fact, we are jurors, the argument \nwent, then juries deliberate in secret and, therefore, if we are a \njury, we should deliberate in secret. Now that we know we are not \njurors, I believe that argument has gone away. I believe that we are, \nin fact, mandated by the Constitution to be more than that.\n  I quote from an article that appeared in the Chicago Tribune by \nProfessor\n\n[[Page S730]]\n\nSteven Lubet--he is a professor of law at Northwestern University--in \nwhich he pointed out that the Constitution does not allow us the luxury \nof being simply jurors. We have to decide; we have to judge.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Lubet's article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Jan. 13, 1999]\n\n                        Stop Calling Them Jurors\n\n                           (By Steven Lubet)\n\n       Some day soon, the actual impeachment trial of William \n     Jefferson Clinton will begin, with 100 United States senators \n     sitting in judgment. The senators, in anticipation of the \n     event, keep referring to themselves as a jury. On a recent \n     edition of ``Larry King Live,'' for example, no fewer than \n     six of them (three Republicans and three Democrats) virtually \n     chanted the mantra that it was their duty to act as \n     ``impartial jurors.'' It is tempting to agree.\n       After all, they have been sworn to do justice, they are \n     going to consider evidence and the resulting verdict must be \n     either conviction or acquittal.\n       But in fact, the senators are not jurors, and the repeated \n     use of that term is dangerously misleading.\n       In an ordinarily trial, the decision-making responsibility \n     is divided between judge and jury. The judge makes rulings of \n     law, while the jury's function is severely limited to \n     determination of facts. In other words, the jury only decides \n     ``what happened'' while the judge decides almost everything \n     else. That is not the case with impeachment. Article I of the \n     Constitution confers on the Senate the ``sole power to try \n     all impeachments.'' That power is comprehensive--including \n     law, facts and procedure--and it is to be exercised in its \n     entirety by the Senate itself.\n       (It is true that the chief justice is called upon to \n     ``preside'' over presidential impeachments, but only because \n     the vice president--who is ordinarily the Senate's presiding \n     officer--is disqualified by an obvious conflict of interest. \n     The chief justice does not sit as a judge in any ordinary \n     sense, but more as a moderator or chair. He holds no binding \n     legal or decisional power.)\n       And if there were any doubt, Article III of the \n     Constitution actually makes this explicit, providing that \n     ``the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, \n     shall be by jury.'' So, what are the senators, if not jurors? \n     In fact, they are all judges, or if you prefer, members of \n     the court of impeachment, each one delegated full power to \n     decide every issue involved in the case.\n       This distinction is crucial. President Clinton's most \n     fervent detractors have argued that the House of \n     Representatives, in exercise of its own constitutional power, \n     has conclusively determined the ``impeachability'' of the \n     alleged offenses, leaving the senatorial jury the limited \n     task of deciding whether the charges are true. But that is \n     wrong. The Senate's role is not at all confined to the \n     ascertainment of facts. Under the Constitution, the senators \n     need not--they may not--defer to the House of Representatives \n     on the critical question of ``impeachability.''\n       Thus, the Senators must decide not only whether Clinton \n     lied to the grand jury, but also whether so-called ``perjury \n     about sex'' constitutes a high crime or misdemeanor of \n     sufficient gravity to justify removing this president from \n     office.\n       It is easy to understand why a senator would want to be a \n     juror. The persona is so engaging: modest, contemplative, \n     nearly anonymous--the humble citizen called to civic duty. \n     But the constant references to senators-as-jurors can only \n     serve to diminish their role and distract them from the \n     expansive nature of their duty. It is not their job, as it \n     would be a jury's, simply to decide some facts and then move \n     on. The Constitution does not allow them that luxury.\n       The senators are not determining just one case; their \n     concern must be far greater than the fate of a single man. \n     Rather, they are setting a legal and political precedent that \n     may well guide our Republic for the next 130 years. Future \n     generations will look back upon this Senate for direction \n     whenever potential impeachments arise. Our descendants will \n     not want to know only what happened, but also what principles \n     govern the removal of the president. And so, the senators \n     cannot merely decide--they have to judge.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, a couple of other things regarding \nopenness. The hallmark of our Republic and of our system of government \nis openness and transparency. The history of this Senate has been one \nof opening the doors. The first three sessions of the U.S. Senate were \nheld in secret behind closed doors, the whole sessions. Up until 1929, \nall nominations and treaties were debated behind closed doors. In 1972, \n40 percent of all the committee meetings were done behind closed doors. \nIn fact, up until 1975, many conference committees, and still committee \nmeetings, were held behind closed doors.\n  We have washed all that away. We have found through the years that \nthe best political disinfectant is sunshine. I believe we are a better \nSenate, a better Congress and a better country for opening the doors \nand letting people see what we do and how we reach the decisions we \nreach.\n  Mr. President, there has been a spate of editorials recently \nregarding opening up the trial. I quote from one from the Washington \nPost dated January 14. It says:\n\n       It seems only right . . . that the Senate should be \n     expected to debate in public any charge for which it is \n     demanding of the president a public accounting.\n       This is not to prevent senators from caucusing in private \n     or even meeting unofficially, as senators did last week in \n     crafting the procedural compromise that will govern the \n     trial. Confidential contacts of this sort can certainly be \n     constructive. But when the Senate meets as the Senate and \n     considers arguments in its official trial proceedings, it \n     should not do so behind closed doors. Absent the most unusual \n     of circumstances, it should conduct its deliberations openly, \n     thereby ensuring that the final adjudication of Mr. Clinton's \n     case is as transparently accountable as possible.\n\n  The New York Times basically said the same thing. The Los Angeles \nTimes, the Des Moines Register and Roll Call. I think Roll Call \nbasically said it best, Mr. President, when they said:\n\n       . . . this is not a court trial . . . It is inherently a \n     political proceeding . . . Their constituents [our \n     constituents], the citizens of America, have a right to see \n     how they perform and to fully understand why they decided to \n     retain or remove their elected President.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all of these editorials \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From The Washington Post, January 14, 1999]\n\n                             An Open Trial\n\n       Sens. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) have \n     announced that they will move to suspend certain portions of \n     the Senate's impeachment rules to permit the full Senate \n     trial of President Clinton to be conducted in the public's \n     view. As the more than 100-year-old rules stand now, \n     testimony can be taken with the cameras on and the doors open \n     unless a majority votes to close the session, but any time \n     the senators debate a motion and, for that matter, when they \n     consider the final articles, they will do so in secret. This \n     is exactly the wrong way to conduct a trial whose purpose is \n     to pass public judgment on the conduct of the president. The \n     Harkin-Wellstone proposal to do the whole trial in public \n     offers a far better approach.\n       The desire to avoid public argument is understandable, \n     particularly in a case as filled with salacious material as \n     the Clinton trial must necessarily be. But it is not the job \n     of the Senate to protect citizens from the rationale for the \n     Senate's actions, nor are senators entitled to be shielded \n     from the embarrassment of discussing out loud the tawdry \n     evidence at issue in this case.\n       The often drawn analogy between senators and jurors, whose \n     deliberations are kept secret, also fails to offer a \n     persuasive reason to conduct secret debates. Jurors, after \n     all, did not seek public office and are not permitted, as \n     their trials are progressing, to go on talk shows to discuss \n     their own consideration of the evidence. The senators are, in \n     this proceeding, acting as far more than simple jurors, and \n     it makes little sense for this most solemn obligation of the \n     Senate to face less sunshine than does a routine legislative \n     matter. It seems only right, rather, that the Senate should \n     be expected to debate in public any charge for which it is \n     demanding of the president a public accounting.\n       This is not to prevent senators from caucusing in private \n     or even from meeting unofficially, as senators did last week \n     in crafting the procedural compromise that will govern the \n     trial. Confidential contacts of this sort can certainly be \n     constructive. But when the Senate meets as the Senate and \n     considers arguments in its official trial proceedings, it \n     should not do so behind closed doors. Absent the most unusual \n     of circumstances, it should conduct its deliberations openly, \n     thereby ensuring that the final adjudication of Mr. Clinton's \n     case is as transparently accountable as possible.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the New York Times, January 13, 1999]\n\n                            Open the Senate\n\n       Since the trial of President Andrew Johnson in 1868, the \n     Senate has conducted its debates on procedures and even the \n     final verdict of impeachments in closed session. The time has \n     come for that tradition to be altered, at least for the trial \n     of President Clinton. Two Democratic Senators, Tom Harkin and \n     Paul Wellstone, have announced that they will seek to change \n     the rule on closed debates after the opening presentations \n     begin tomorrow. Whatever would be gained by allowing senators \n     to deliberate privately, the overriding requirements is for \n     the American public to see and judge firsthand whether \n     justice is being done.\n       Some senators argue that the closed session last Friday, at \n     which Democrats and Republicans worked out a compromise on \n     trial procedures, showed that privacy can serve a \n     constructive purpose. But the Harkin-Wellstone proposal would \n     not preclude\n\n[[Page S731]]\n\n     the Senate's adjourning and meeting outside the chamber at \n     caucuses like the one last week. The principle that should \n     prevail is simply that proceedings that could lead to the \n     removal of a President should be conducted in open session, \n     especially since many Americans have questions about the \n     fairness of the House impeachment proceedings. Closing the \n     Senate's deliberations on so grave a matter would undermine \n     public confidence and be an affront to citizens' rights to \n     observe the operations of government.\n       Senators love their customs and ceremonies, but their \n     institution's commanding trend has been toward openness. At \n     the time of the nation's founding, all Senate sessions were \n     closed. Until 1929, the Senate debated nominations and \n     treaties in closed sessions. Until the reforms of the 1970's, \n     many Congressional hearings and meetings were in closed \n     session. No one would seriously argue that these old \n     practices should have been preserved. As for impeachment \n     trials, it is worth noting that they were open most of the \n     19th century. Privacy was adopted only for the trial of \n     President Johnson.\n       Some senators seem to believe that they should be regarded \n     as jurors in a trial, and therefore allowed a measure of \n     confidentiality. But the senators have privileges not \n     available to regular juries. They may ask questions, speak \n     publicly about the process and make motions. It is within \n     their power to change the rules on closing the session, which \n     would take a two-thirds majority to be adopted. If openness \n     drives senators toward partisanship or prolixity, as some \n     fear, let public scrutiny serve as the governor on their \n     excesses.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Jan. 13, 1999]\n\n                         Keep Trial Fully Open\n\n       Unless the Senate changes one of its rules for conducting \n     President Clinton's impeachment trial, the public will not be \n     allowed to witness crucial parts, including a possible \n     climactic debate on whether to convict Clinton on charges of \n     perjury and obstruction of justice. The Senate should change \n     this archaic rule; the trial's inestimable national \n     importance demands that the proceedings be completely open.\n       For guidance in the trial, which opens Thursday, the Senate \n     is relying on rules adopted in 1868, when Andrew Johnson \n     became the first and until now the only president to be tried \n     for alleged high crimes and misdemeanors. One of those rules \n     compels ``the doors to be closed'' whenever senators debate \n     among themselves, something they are allowed to do only when \n     deciding procedural issues--such as whether witnesses should \n     be called--or when they reach a verdict. Otherwise, by the \n     rules of 1868, the senators must sit in silence as House \n     prosecutors present the case against Clinton and White House \n     lawyers defend him. Any questions the senators have must be \n     submitted in writing to the chief justice, who may or may not \n     choose to ask them.\n       The precedents embedded in the Johnson trial rules should \n     not be put aside lightly. Without them the Senate could find \n     itself mired in prolonged and divisive arguments over how to \n     proceed. But no precedent is sacred. Times change and rules \n     must change with them. Congress has many times discarded \n     procedures and traditions that came to be seen as inimical to \n     the need for free discussion in an open society. for example, \n     as Sens. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) \n     note, in the earliest days of the republic all of Congress' \n     proceedings were secret. Until 1929 nomination hearings were \n     conducted behind closed doors. Until 1975 many committee \n     sessions similarly took place outside public scrutiny.\n       The Senate of Andrew Johnson's day was a far different \n     place from the Senate of today. Its members were not chosen \n     by the electorate--that did not come until 1913--but rather \n     were appointed by state legislatures and so were not directly \n     answerable to the popular will. And much of the Senate's \n     business was routinely conducted in secret.\n       Today, except when matters of national security are being \n     discussed, Congress' sessions are open--in the sunshine, as \n     they say in the Capital. If ever there was an occasion when \n     the sun should be allowed fully to shine in, it is in the \n     Clinton impeachment trial.\n       A two-thirds vote is needed to change Senate rules. Harkin \n     and Wellstone, the major proponents of full openness, know \n     the difficulty of getting 65 colleagues to agree with them. \n     But they are leading a fair and just cause. Put simply, \n     Americans have a right to witness this process in all its \n     facets. The people's representatives in the Senate now have \n     the responsibility to assure that right.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Roll Call, January 14, 1999]\n\n                            No Secret Trial\n\n       Imagine the spectacle. On, say, March 5, cameras are turned \n     on in the Senate and the roll is called on the articles of \n     impeachment against President Clinton. The votes are taken, \n     the decision is made--and then there is a mad rush for \n     Senators to explain why they voted as they did. But their \n     actual deliberations prior to the voting remain secret.\n       There is not even an official record kept, so \n     reconstructing one of the most portentous debates in American \n     history depends on the memories and notes of Senators and \n     staffers.\n       This secrecy scenario is exactly what's in store unless the \n     Senate changes its rules, as proposed by Sens. Tom Harkin (D-\n     Iowa) and Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), to open the impeachment \n     trial to the media and the public.\n       In fact, it will take strong action from Senate leaders to \n     open the trial, since changing Senate rules requires a two-\n     thirds vote. We urge Democratic and Republican leaders to \n     exercise their influence to prevent their institution from \n     being accused of conducting a ``secret trial.''\n       The allegation could turn out to be true. Senate rules call \n     not only for final deliberations on impeachment to be \n     conducted in secret, but any deliberations. This means that \n     motions to dismiss the case and consideration of whether to \n     call witnesses might be done in secret and with no subsequent \n     printing of the proceedings in the Congressional Record. All \n     but arguments by House managers and the President's lawyers, \n     witness testimony, if any, and the actual vote could take \n     place behind a shroud.\n       Some Senators say they would not have been able to reach \n     their bipartisan agreement on procedure last Friday if the \n     session had been open. If statesmanship requires secrecy--\n     which we doubt--then arrangements can be made for informal \n     closed discussions. But all substantive discussions should be \n     open. We have some sympathy for the view that some subject \n     matter conceivably could be so sexually explicit that \n     Senators will be ashamed to be seen discussing it in public. \n     But it's not worth closing off almost the entire Clinton \n     trial over this possibility.\n       Conceivably--if this is what it takes to sway skittish \n     Senators--the rules could be altered to permit some \n     discussion to be held in closed session with a record kept. \n     But the House debate on impeachment could have been rated PG-\n     13, and let's face it: The Clinton case record is already so \n     raunchy that there's little that schoolchildren haven't \n     already heard. So the proceedings ought to be open.\n       It will be argued: In court trials, jury deliberations are \n     conducted in secret. But this is not a court trial. It is \n     inherently a political proceeding. The ``jurors'' are not \n     ordinary citizens unused to the glare of publicity. They will \n     be up for reelection and judged partly on the basis of how \n     they handle this case. Their constituents, the citizens of \n     America, have a right to see how they perform and to fully \n     understand why they decided to retain or remove their elected \n     President.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me take off a little bit on one aspect \nof this. Some people say, ``Well, there is a benefit to Senators \nmeeting quietly, privately to discuss these.'' I believe that, and I \nwould not, in any way, want to close, for example, some of the caucuses \nthat we have--the occupant of the Chair remembers we had the closed \ncaucus between the two parties to reach an agreement under which we are \noperating. I think there is a benefit to that, as the Washington Post \narticle pointed out. That is fine, as we meet unofficially off the \nfloor amongst ourselves to discuss things. But when the Senate meets as \nthe Senate, as soon as that opening prayer is given by the Chaplain, \nthis place should be open, and the trial should be open.\n  Next, I believe that unless we open this trial up, we are going to \nsow the seeds of confusion, misinformation, suspicion and unnecessary \nconflict. Here is why I say that. As some wag once said, there is \nnothing secret about any secret meeting held here in Washington.\n  Think, if you will, of a closed session of the Senate. The galleries \nare cleared, the cameras are shut off, reporters are gone, and we \nengage in debate on whatever issue we are going to debate. The debate \nis over. We open the galleries again, and 100 Senators rush out of here \nand they see all the reporters standing out here.\n  What happens? ``Well, what happened, Senator?''\n  ``Well, don't quote me, not for attribution, but guess what this \nSenator said; guess what that Senator said?''\n  And so you get 100 different versions of what happened here on the \nSenate floor.\n  I believe that will sow a lot of confusion, misinformation and \nunnecessary conflict. If the doors are open and if we debate in the \nopen, there is no filter, it is unfiltered, and the public can see how \nand why we reached the decisions we reached.\n  The press, quite frankly, obviously, as perhaps is their nature, is \nquick to pick up on conflict and rumor. I believe if we follow the \nrules to close the doors of this trial it will turn it more into a \ncircus than anything else. If we open the debate, I don't believe we \nwill have any problems.\n  I was interested in an op-ed piece that was in the New York Times by \nformer Senator Dale Bumpers. I read it, and there is a part in there I \nthink really hits home. Former Senator Bumpers said:\n\n       In a visit with Harry Truman in his home in Missouri in \n     1971, he admonished me to always put my trust in the people. \n     ``They can handle it,'' he said.\n\n\n[[Page S732]]\n\n\n  ``They can handle it.'' I believe the American people can handle it, \ntoo. I believe they can handle any debate, any discussion, any \ndeliberation that we have on the Senate floor. Not only can they handle \nit, I believe they have a right to it.\n  So Senator Wellstone and I will, at the first opportunity, when the \nfirst motion is made to dismiss the case, if that motion is made--\nobviously the debate about that under the rules would be held in \nsecret--we intend at that point to offer a preferential motion that the \ndebate, the discussion in the Senate on the motion to dismiss be held \nopenly, to suspend the rules.\n  Obviously, that is a hurdle. To suspend the rules requires a two-\nthirds vote. It means that two-thirds of the Senate would have to vote \nto suspend the rules. As a further kind of anomaly, Mr. President, the \nmotion to open up the Senate, to open up our debate and deliberation, \nthe debate on that has to be held in private under the rules, strange \nas it may seem. And so we will at that point ask unanimous consent that \nthe debate and discussion on whether we will open up the debate on the \nmotion to dismiss be held openly. Of course, one Senator can object, \nand then we would have to go into a secret debate on our motion to open \nup the deliberation and the debate. And so that will happen sometime \nsoon.\n\n  Another issue has been raised, Mr. President--I would just like to \ncover it and then I am going to yield the floor to Senator Wellstone. \nThe point has been raised, well, you know, if Senators start debating \nthis and it gets in the open, then they get in front of the cameras, \nand, why, then this thing can go on and on and on because Senators--you \nknow, we Senators like to talk, we can talk forever. Under the rules of \nthe Senate, when we go into debate and deliberation on any motion, each \nSenator can be recognized only for 10 minutes--only for 10 minutes. And \nI think a lot of people are forgetting about that.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I remember in January of 1991 when I sat at \nthe desk on that side over there and Senators had just been sworn in; \nhousekeeping motions were being made. One motion was being made by the \nmajority leader at that time that the Senate recess or adjourn--I \nforget--adjourn to a date certain--I think it was for the State of the \nUnion--but during that period of time, that we would not have been in \nsession, and the time would have run out on whether or not we would use \nforce to get the Iraqis out of Kuwait, the gulf war.\n  I stood at that time and raised an objection to the Senate recessing \nor adjourning over to that point. And I raised an objection that \nenabled us to have an open and public debate on whether or not we would \nauthorize the President of the United States to conduct military \noperations in the gulf. We had that debate. And I think it was one of \nthe Senate's finest hours. Even those with whom I disagreed I thought \nwere eloquent and forceful in their arguments. We had the debate, we \nhad the vote, and then we moved on. And I think the American people \nwere better for that debate because it was held in the open.\n  Mr. President, if we in the Senate can debate whether or not to send \nour sons and daughters off to distant lands to fight and die in a war--\nsomething that touches every single American citizen--if we can debate \nthat in open and in public, then in the name of all that is right about \nour Republic and our country and our openness and our system of \ngovernment, why can we not debate and deliberate in the open something \nelse that touches every American citizen? And that is, why or if the \nPresident of the United States should or should not be removed from \noffice. If we can debate it openly, the issue of war, then certainly we \ncan debate an issue in the open, the issue of whether or not the \nPresident would be removed from office.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank my colleague, Senator \nHarkin. We have been working very hard on this. There are other \nSenators who support this motion--Senator Leahy, Senator Feingold, \nSenator Boxer, and Senator Lieberman. And I know Senator Hutchison has \nindicated interest in this question. This will be a very important vote \ncoming up next week.\n  First, let me just, if I could, Mr. President, say that I feel very \nhonored to be speaking from Dale Bumpers' desk. I don't think there is \nanybody who could match his oratory, but I am sure lucky to have this \ndesk and this long cord. And Dale Bumpers, wherever you are, I will do \nmy very best to try to carry on in your tradition, or at least give it \neverything that I have.\n  Mr. President, next week before the Senate goes into its own \ndeliberations on this question of whether to dismiss charges, we will \ntake this one step at a time. We most definitely will try to move \nforward with a motion to suspend the rules so that the Senate \ndeliberations will not be in closed session. We also would like to make \nsure that the very debate as to whether our deliberations are in closed \nsession or secret session be open to the public. And we will, on the \nfloor of the Senate, make every effort possible to keep that debate in \nthe open.\n\n  I am going to be very brief and just make the following arguments \nbecause there are some very, very good people who do a lot of work when \nit comes to interpretation of the rules. I will say, since the \nParliamentarian is here, that Bob Dove has been eminently fair. He has \ntreated all of us from both political parties with the utmost respect.\n  My own feeling about this is that this trial has been momentous. I \npersonally wish that it had not come over from the House. I have always \nmade my point that I believe the House overreached on the impeachment \ncharges. But, Mr. President, they are here in the Senate.\n  I think here are the following questions: If in fact we as a Senate \nare going to go into deliberations over whether to dismiss the charges \nagainst the President, or later on whether we will have witnesses, or \nlater on whether the President shall be removed, I cannot imagine that \nthe U.S. Senate would go into closed session. I cannot imagine that our \ndeliberations and our debate and the arguments we make would not be \nopen to the public.\n  The public isn't going to believe in this political process if we go \ninto secret or closed session. The public is not going to have trust in \nwhat we are doing if they don't get a chance to evaluate our debate and \nwhat we are saying and why we reached the conclusions we reached.\n  Mr. President, I really do believe that if there is to be healing in \nour country--and I certainly pray that there will be--it would be a \nterrible mistake for the U.S. Senators, Democrats or Republicans, to \ncut the public out. The part of the public that is looking at the \nproceedings right now, that is evaluating the arguments that are being \nmade--and there are people who have made very good arguments on both \nsides of the question--to then say to them, ``Listen, when it comes to \nnow the Senate, the U.S. Senate, going into our own deliberations and \nmaking our own decisions, you, the public, you're cut out of it,'' this \ngoes against the very essence of accountability. It goes against the \nvery essence of what a representative democracy is about.\n  Mr. President, some of these rules go back to 1868. That was a time \nwhen the U.S. Senators were not even directly elected. They were \nelected by State legislatures. The 17th amendment changed all that in \n1913 as part of the Progressive movement and the progressive change in \nthe country. The idea was that the U.S. Senators would be a part of \nrepresentative democracy, directly elected by the people, accountable \nto the people.\n  This is a huge decision we are going to be making in the U.S. Senate. \nAnd I think it will be a terrible mistake for the U.S. Senate to go \ninto closed session, to cut the public out, to not let people have the \nopportunity to hear what we are saying in the debate.\n  Mr. President, it is really quite amazing, if you think about it. \nPeople will know what our votes are--dismissal of charges, witnesses, \nwhether the President should be removed from office--and somewhere \nthere will be a transcript of the proceedings, but I don't think they \nwill even be published. There will not even be a public record of what \nU.S. Senators--the Senator from Arkansas or the Senator from Minnesota \nor the Senator from Iowa--had to say in this debate.\n\n[[Page S733]]\n\n  I just say to all of my colleagues, I hope that, No. 1, you will \nagree to a unanimous-consent agreement that in our discussion or our \ndebate whether or not we go into closed session, that it be open to the \npublic. What an irony it would be if, in the very debate about whether \nor not our deliberations will be open or closed, our deliberations were \nclosed. It seems to me that debate ought to be open to the public.\n\n  Second, I certainly hope that we will have the two-thirds vote that \nit will take to suspend the current rule that says we must be in closed \nsession.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important for the public right now to be \nengaged in this process. I hope people will be calling their Senators, \nbecause I really do believe that part of our deliberations, part of our \nmodus operandi as Senators, whatever States we represent, should be to \nstay in touch with people. Of course, we reach our own independent \njudgment. We reach our own independent judgment about the facts, about \nthe charges.\n  Then there is another question, the threshold question, about whether \nor not these charges rise to the level of removing a President from \noffice.\n  I think part of what we are about as Senators is to try to stay in \nclose touch with the public, with people in our States, whatever \ndecision we make. It can be a matter of individual conscience, but I \nthink it is terribly important that we operate as a representative \nbody, as the U.S. Senate, as a part of representative democracy of the \nUnited States of America. We can't on this question, we can't on these \nquestions, if we go into closed session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/20/senate-section/article/S729-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S733-S734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, regarding the President's speech last \nnight, I will start out with his style. I thought it was rather amazing \nthat, given all that has happened--like our trial here--that the \nPresident came before the Congress and delivered a very good speech. He \ncertainly had confidence and he outlined some important proposals.\n  I think his proposal dealing with Social Security was extremely \nimportant. I think it is a solid proposal. And it does not go in the \ndirection of some of the privatization schemes which I think would have \ntaken the ``security'' out of Social Security. But it also recognizes \nwe need to make some changes and we need to make sure that we support \nor save the Social Security system. But we keep it as a social \ninsurance program. It is a contract. It is for all the people in the \ncountry.\n  The emphasis on the COPS Program, community policing, is right on the \nmark. The law enforcement community in Minnesota has done some great \nwork with this community policing program, including dealing with all \nof the issues having to do with domestic violence. Every 13 seconds a \nwoman is battered in the United States of America in her home--a home \nshould be a safe place--and many children see this, as well. God knows \nwhat the effect is on the children.\n  Mr. President, I also want to just be very honest about my \ndisappointment in this speech. Here we are, going into the next \ncentury, the next millennium. Here we have this great economy, booming \nalong. We hear about it all the time. This is our opportunity now to \ntake bold initiatives, to put forth bold proposals that really respond \nto children in America.\n  The President talked about low-income, elderly citizens, many of them \nwomen. I think it is terribly important to address that reality. Mr. \nPresident, what about the reality of close to 1 out of 4 children under \nthe age of 3 growing up poor in our country? What about the reality of \n1 out of every 2 children of color under the age of 3 growing up poor \nin our country?\n  We have heard from the experts. We have had the conferences. We have \nseen the studies. We know about the involvement of the brain. We know \nwe have to get it right for these children by age 3 or many of them \nwill never be able to do well in school and never be able to do well in \nlife.\n  I see a real disconnect between some of the words uttered by our \nPresident and his proposals that don't meet the challenge. The \ncommitment of resources to affordable child care for so many families \nin our country doesn't even come close to meeting the need. I thought \nwe were going to make a commitment to affordable child care for \neveryone, not just for welfare mothers and their children. Not that \nwe've done enough for those on welfare. That, in and of itself, is \nimportant, and we are not doing nearly as well as we should. But we \nneed to help not just low income, but working income, moderate income, \neven middle-income families, for whom good child care is a huge \nexpense, so that their children can get the best of nurturing and \nintellectual stimulation. But this is not in this budget. It is not in \nthis budget. There's money, but the President's solutions are not in \nthe same scope as the problems themselves.\n\n  The President has a proposal that focuses on afterschool care. I am \nall for that. But when I think about the poverty of children in our \ncountry, when I think about a set of social arrangements that allow \nchildren to be the most poverty-stricken group in our country, when I \nthink about what a national disgrace that is, and when I think about \nall we should be doing to make sure that every child in our country has \nthe same opportunity to reach his and her full potential, and when I \nthink about what we are going to be asking our children to carry on \ntheir shoulders in the next century, I don't see in the President's \nState of the Union Address a bold agenda that would lead to the \ndramatic improvement of the lives of so many children in our country. \nWhy the timidity? With this economy booming along, in the words of \nRabbi Hillel, ``If not now, when?'' If we are not going to speak for \nour children now, when will we? If we are not going to move forward \nwith bold proposals, start with affordable child care, when will we?\n  Finally, Mr. President, on the health care front, some important \nproposals:\n  Give credit where credit should be given. I meet with people in the \ndisabilities community and this is a huge problem. You want to work and \nthen when you get a job you lose your medical assistance and you are \nworse off. To be able to carry health care coverage for people in the \ndisabilities community so more people can work--yes.\n  A tax credit proposal that says if you have a problem of catastrophic \nexpenses--I know what this is about; I had two parents with Parkinson's \ndisease--as a family, you can get up to a $1,000 tax credit per year. \nBut this credit is not refundable. Why in the world do we have a tax \ncredit that is not refundable, in which case families with incomes \nunder $30,000 a year get no help whatever? Are we worried about \nproviding assistance to low-income people, poor people, as if they have \nit made in America?\n  Second of all, catastrophic expenses go way beyond $1,000 a year.\n  And here is what I don't understand about the President's downsized \nagenda. Whatever happened to universal health care coverage? Now we \nhave 44 million people with no health insurance, more than when we \nstarted the debate several years ago. Now we have another 44 million \npeople who are underinsured. We have people falling between the cracks. \nThey are not old enough for Medicare, prescription drug costs are not \ncovered, they can't afford catastrophic expenses, they are not poor \nenough for medical assistance, they are getting dropped for coverage by \ntheir employers, and copay and deductibles are going up and are way too \nhigh a percentage of family income.\n  Several years ago, the health insurance industry took universal \nhealth care coverage off the table. We ought to put it back on the \ntable. I don't understand the timidity of the President's State of the \nUnion Address when it comes to making sure that we can provide good \nhealth care coverage for all of our citizens. Our economy is booming, \nwe are going into the next century, this is the time for bold \ninitiatives. This is not the time for timidity. This is a time to make \na connection between the words we speak and the problems we identify \nand the challenges we say we have as a Nation and the investment.\n  Where is the investment in the health, skills, intellect and \ncharacter of our children in America? Where is the investment to make \nsure that every citizen has health coverage that he and she can afford \nfor themselves and their families? I didn't see it in the\n\n[[Page S734]]\n\nPresident's State of the Union Address. For that reason, I am \ndisappointed. I believe our country can do better. I believe our \ncountry can do better. I believe the U.S. Congress can do better, and I \nhope that we will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/20/senate-section/article/S733-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE PRIVATE PROPERTY FAIRNESS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I have introduced S. 246, the Private \nProperty Fairness Act of 1999. This bill will help ensure that when the \nGovernment issues regulations for the benefit of the public as a whole, \nit does not saddle just a few landowners with the whole cost of \ncompliance. This bill will help enforce the U.S. Constitution's \nguarantee that the Federal Government cannot take private property \nwithout paying just compensation to the owner.\n  Recent record low prices received by American agricultural producers \nhas prompted great concern about the future of family farmers and \nranchers. What we must remember is that government regulations are \nunfairly burdening this vital sector--hitting family farmers the \nhardest.\n  The dramatic growth in Federal regulation in recent decades has \nfocused attention on a very murky area of property law, a regulatory \narea in which the law of takings is not yet settled to the satisfaction \nof most Americans.\n  The bottom line is that the law in this area is unfair. For example, \nif the Government condemns part of a farm to build a highway, it has to \npay the farmer for the value of his land. But if the Government \nrequires that same farmer stop growing crops on that same land in order \nto protect endangered species or conserve wetlands, the farmer gets no \ncompensation. In both situations the Government has acted to benefit \nthe general public and, in the process, has imposed a cost on the \nfarmer. In both cases, the land is taken out of production and the \nfarmer loses income. But only in the highway example is the farmer \ncompensated for his loss. In the regulatory example, the farmer, or any \nother landowner, has to absorb all of the cost himself. This is not \nfair.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is an important step toward \nproviding relief from these so-called regulatory takings. My bill is a \nnarrowly tailored approach that will make a real difference for \nproperty owners across America. It protects private property rights in \ntwo ways. First, it puts in place procedures that will stop or minimize \ntakings by the Federal Government before they occur. The Government \nwould have to jump a much higher hurdle before it can restrict the use \nof someone's privately owned property. For the first time, the Federal \nGovernment will have to determine in advance how its actions will \nimpact the property owner, not just the wetland or the endangered \nspecies. This bill also would require the Federal Government to look \nfor options other than restricting the use of private property to \nachieve its goal.\n  Second, if heavy Government regulations diminish the value of private \nproperty, this bill would allow the landowners to plead their case in a \nFederal district court, instead of forcing them to seek relief. This \nbill makes the process easier, less costly, and more accessible and \naccountable so all citizens can fully protect their property rights.\n  For too long, Federal regulators have made private property owners \nbear the burdens and the costs of Government land use decisions. The \nresult has been that real people suffer.\n  Joe Jeffrey is a farmer in Lexington, NE. Like most Americans, he is \nproud of his land. He believed his property was his to use and control \nas he saw fit. So, after 12 years of regulatory struggles, Mr. Jeffrey \ngot fed up and decided to lease out his land. The Central Nebraska \nPublic Power and Irrigation District now has use of the property for \nthe next 17 years. The Government's regulatory intrusion left Mr. \nJeffrey few other options.\n  Joe Jeffrey first met the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Army \nCorps of Engineers in 1987. Mr. Jeffrey's introduction to the long arm \nof the Federal bureaucracy was in the form of wetlands regulations. Mr. \nJeffrey was notified that he had to destroy two dikes on his land \nbecause they were constructed without the proper permits. Nearly 2 \nyears later, the corps partially changed its mind and allowed Mr. \nJeffrey to reconstruct one of the dikes because the corps lacked \nauthority to make him destroy it in the first place.\n  Then floods damaged part of Mr. Jeffrey's irrigated pastureland and \nchanged the normal water channel. Mr. Jeffrey set out to return the \nchannel to its original course by moving sand that the flood had \nshifted. But the Government said ``no.'' The corps told him he had to \ngive public notice before he could repair his own property.\n  Then came the Endangered Species Act.\n  Neither least terns nor piping plovers--both federally protected \nendangered species--have ever nested on Mr. Jeffrey's property. But \nthat didn't stop the regulators. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nwanted to designate Mr. Jeffrey's property as ``critical habitat'' for \nthese protected species.\n  The bureaucrats could not even agree among themselves on what they \nwanted done. The Nebraska Department of Environmental Control wanted \nthe area re-vegetated. But the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wanted \nthe area kept free of vegetation. Mr. Jeffrey was caught in the middle.\n  This is a real regulatory horror story. And there's more.\n  Today--12 years after his regulatory struggle began--Mr. Jeffrey is \nfaced with eroded pastureland that cannot be irrigated and cannot be \nrepaired without significant personal expense. The value of Mr. \nJeffrey's land has been diminished by the Government's regulatory \nintrusion--but he has not been compensated. In fact, he has had to \nspend money from his own pocket to comply with the regulations. The \nFish and Wildlife Service asked Mr. Jeffrey to modify his center pivot \nirrigation system to negotiate around the eroded area--at a personal \ncost of $20,000. And the issue is still not resolved.\n  Mr. President, we do not need more stories like Joe Jeffrey's in \nAmerica. Our Constitution guarantees our people's rights. Congress must \nact to uphold those rights and guarantee them in practice, not just in \ntheory. Government regulation has gone too far. We must make it \naccountable to the people. Government should be accountable to the \npeople, not the people accountable to the Government.\n  What this issue comes down to is fairness. It is simply not fair and \nit is not right for the Federal Government to have the ability to \nrestrict the use of privately owned property without compensating the \nowner. It violates the principles this country was founded on. This \nlegislation puts some justice back into the system. It reins in \nregulatory agencies and gives the private property owner a voice in the \nprocess. It makes it easier for citizens to appeal any restrictions \nimposed on their land or property. It is the right thing to do. It is \nthe just and fair thing to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/20/senate-section/article/S734-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S734-S735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE SAFE SCHOOLS, SAFE STREETS AND SECURE BORDERS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Leahy and \nseveral other Democratic Senators in introducing the Safe Schools, Safe \nStreets and Secure Borders Act of 1999. Thanks in large part to the \nlegacy of success that Senate Democrats have had in the area of anti-\ncrime legislation, the crime rate in this country has been going down \nfor six consecutive years. This is the longest such period of decline \nin 25 years, and the comprehensive crime bill that we are introducing \nwill build on this success and reduce crime even further.\n  Despite the decrease in crime throughout the last six years, juvenile \ncrime and drug abuse continue to be problems that weigh heavily on the \nminds of the American people. In my home state of South Dakota, there \nhas been a particularly alarming increase in juvenile crime, and I have \nbeen working extensively with community leaders and concerned parents \nto focus public attention on this issue. Now is the time when we must \ntarget the real needs of American families and communities, and I \nbelieve that the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of \n1999 will do just that. This bill will reduce crime by targeting \nviolent crime in our schools, reforming the juvenile justice system, \ncombating gang violence, cracking down on the\n\n[[Page S735]]\n\nsale and use of illegal drugs, strengthening the rights of crime \nvictims, and giving police and prosecutors more tools and resources to \nfight crime. In addition, this bill would build on one of the most \nsuccessful initiatives of the 1994 Crime Act by extending the \nauthorization for the COPS program so that an additional 25,000 police \nofficers can be deployed on our streets in the coming years. We will \nsoon meet the commitment that we made in the 1994 Crime Act to put \n100,000 new police officers on the beat across America--under budget \nand ahead of schedule--and we should build on that success. Putting \nmore police officers on the streets, however, is not enough.\n  Unfortunately, in the last few years, our schools have been plagued \nby tragic shootings far too many times. These senseless tragedies must \nbe stopped, and the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act \nof 1999 targets violent crime in schools by providing technical \nassistance in schools, reforming the juvenile justice system, assisting \nstates in prosecuting and punishing juvenile offenders and reducing \njuvenile crime, while also protecting children from violence.\n  Moreover, we must stop street gangs from spreading fear in our \nneighborhoods and interfering with our livelihoods. A recent report by \nthe Department of Justice indicates that more than 846,000 gang members \nbelong to 31,000 youth gangs in the United States, and the numbers \nappear to be growing. The ramifications of this trend could be \ndisastrous. For this reason, an important provision of the Safe \nSchools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1999 would crack down \non gangs by making the interstate ``franchising'' of street gangs a \ncrime. It will also double the criminal penalties for using or \nthreatening physical violence against witnesses and contains other \nprovisions designed to facilitate the use and protection of witnesses \nto help prosecute gangs and other violent criminals. The Act also \nprovides funding for law enforcement agencies in communities designated \nby the Attorney General as areas with a high level of interstate gang \nactivity.\n  We can also do more to keep our children off the street and out of \ntrouble. The Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1999 \nwill do just that by providing additional funding for proven prevention \nprograms in crime-prone areas and creating after school ``safe havens'' \nwhere children are protected from drugs, gangs and crime with \nactivities including drug prevention education, academic tutoring, \nmentoring, and abstinence training. In this way, we can provide kids \nwith coaches and mentors now, so that they will not need judges and \nwardens later. This makes sense for our children, this makes sense for \nour communities, and this makes sense for our future.\n  There are many other provisions in the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and \nSecure Borders Act of 1999 that will make a real difference--a positive \ndifference--in the lives of the people of this country. This \ncomprehensive bill is a vital part of our ongoing effort to secure the \nsafety of our schools, streets and citizens, and I encourage my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to give it their full support.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/20/senate-section/article/S734-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SERIOUS SITUATION IN KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to address the Senate for a \nfew minutes about this very serious situation unfolding in Kosovo.\n  Last fall I gave a series of remarks regarding the increasing \nproblems relating to Kosovo. On September 3, 1998, having just returned \nfrom Kosovo at that time, and subsequently on October 2, October 8 and \nOctober 20, I stood at this very desk and said it was my belief that \nthe types of atrocities that the world has witnessed in the past few \ndays would quickly unfold, unless NATO placed in the Pristina region a \nground force to serve as a deterrent. That may not be a popular \nposition, but it is a realistic one, and I expressed it to the Supreme \nAllied Commander of NATO, General Clark, just a few days ago. I \nreiterated the fact that we simply had to put in place a deterrent \nforce.\n  Now, there is the complexity that Kosovo is a sovereign part of \nYugoslavia--a sovereign nation. However, if we are using the threat of \nair operations against that sovereign country, it seems to me that \nshort of taking that step, we could make it very clear to Milosevic, \nwho unquestionably is responsible for these atrocities, that it is \nabsolutely essential to have this ground force in place. Currently, \nover 800 individuals--unarmed verifiers--are in Kosovo, trying to help \nthe people of this tragic region sort out their lives and receive the \nbasics of food and shelter. Now, those people are at risk.\n  Mr. President, I also say that if that NATO force were to be placed \nin the Pristina region, as I so recommend, a part of that force would \nhave to be a U.S. component. General Clark, Supreme Allied Commander of \nNATO, is an American officer. In my judgment, we could not in clear \nconscience have a NATO force in place without some representation of \nAmerican servicemen and women. I recognize the risks, but there is a \ndirect parallel, Mr. President, between the disintegration in Kosovo, \nthe threat of atrocities and, indeed, conflict between the KLA and the \nSerbian forces. Conflict, which in the estimate of those on the scene, \nis looming just weeks ahead. There is a direct correlation between \nKosovo and Bosnia. Although I personally was initially opposed to the \ndeployment of U.S. ground troops in Bosnia, once done, I have been a \nstrong supporter of getting it done correctly. This Nation has \ncontributed a very significant investment, first, of men and women in \nthe Armed Forces serving as an integral part of the NATO forces in \nBosnia, and second, with respect to billions of dollars of the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  In my judgment, there has been very little progress of late in Bosnia \nbecause of the political factions still tenaciously holding on to their \nfractious relationships between Serbs and Croats, Muslims and Croats, \nand Muslims and Serbs--all of the ethnic, deep-rooted problems which \nbrought about this conflict many years ago. But we could lose that \ninvestment; what little gain has been achieved in Bosnia could be lost \nand, indeed, in all probability, any ability to advance toward an \nindependent nation--one that is militarily and economically able to \nstand on its own feet so that we can get our forces out, together with \nother allies involved. That is in jeopardy with this instability in \nKosovo because those various factions are going to watch Kosovo and \nsay, ``NATO is not going to do anything there, so let's just wait it \nout in Bosnia. Wait it out, and we will have that opportunity some day \nto go back and fight amongst ourselves to achieve our respective \ngoals.''\n  So, Mr. President, I so recommend to our President and other leaders \nin NATO today, other nations, examine very carefully, indeed, the \nsuggestion to place a ground force as a deterrent force in the Pristina \nregion as quickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, day before yesterday, our conference \nintroduced our agenda for the 106th Congress. We all know that the \nSenate is in a very stressful period. But we have said time and time \nagain that the people's business is going to continue. If anything, the \npresence of all Members of the Senate has accelerated our attention--\nthe Presiding Officer and I talked about that earlier today--\naccelerated the work of the people's business. But the outlining of \nthis agenda is extremely important and says volumes about our view of \nwhat is good\n\n[[Page S736]]\n\nfor America and what this Congress, the 106th, will be highly focused \nupon.\n\n  There are five core areas that were defined by Majority Leader Lott, \nother members of leadership, and our conference:\n  No. 1: Saving and strengthening of Social Security to create a more \nsecure retirement system for all generations--not just some.\n  No. 2: Improving education opportunities for every American child, \nregardless of circumstances. We all know--and last night the President \nacknowledged--that we have an enormous problem in kindergarten through \nhigh school. In the last Congress, the 105th, our conference put \neducation No. 1. I predicted then that we were going to stay with it. \nAnd we are. Nothing could be more important.\n  No. 3: Providing tax relief and economic opportunity for working \nfamilies.\n  When I first came to Washington not all too long ago, a working \nfamily in Georgia was only keeping 45 cents on the dollar after taxes--\nState, local, and Federal--and their cost of regulation. In this \nCongress, our majority has gotten it to where they now keep 52 cents on \nthe dollar. We are up 7 cents. But until we get two-thirds of their \npaychecks staying in their checking account--not coming up here--our \nwork isn't anywhere near finished.\n  Many in our leadership have already outlined dramatic proposals to \nreduce all taxes anywhere from 4 to 10 percent and 15 percent over 10 \nyears. I might add that if we can achieve that, we will indeed be \nrestoring to American families the right to keep two-thirds of their \npaycheck. What a wonderful celebration we ought to have when that is \nachieved.\n  No. 4: Increasing personal and community security by fighting drugs \nand crime.\n  Drugs are the axle of crime in America today, Mr. President. In any \nprison in America, 80 percent of the prisoners in it--a jail, a Federal \nprison--are there for direct or indirect drug-related problems. To \nbreak the back of crime in America, you have to break the back of the \nnarcotic Mafia.\n  No. 5: Strengthen our national security.\n  We just heard from Senator Warner, the world is a very, very \ndangerous place. We have undermined our military. We have not given \nthem sufficient resources, and therefore they cannot be as trained and \nready as they need to be--No. 1. No. 2, the President alluded to last \nnight--we are behind the curve in understanding that terrorism is a \ncomponent of strategic warfare today. No. 3: As the Rumsfeld Commission \nhas acknowledged, we cannot defend ourselves against ballistic missiles \nin the hands of rogues.\n  Saving Social Security, improving education, tax relief, personal \nsecurity at home and in school and in the workplace, and strengthening \nour ability to defend ourselves from world rogues--Mr. President, these \nare not episodic issues that somebody dragged out of a hole; these \nissues are an acknowledgment that America is great because her people \nhave been free, and an understanding that the core principles \nof American freedom are economic opportunity, the right to work and \nsave and pursue your dreams. That is what has made Americans so \nindependent and bold--and an understanding that a free society cannot \nfunction if its citizens are not safe, either from a world rogue or a \nnarcotic dealer, or that their property is not secure. To the extent a \ncitizen of America is not fully educated, they cannot enjoy the full \nbenefits of American citizenship, and indeed no uneducated people will \nremain free.\n\n  This agenda is designed to strengthen the components that have kept \nAmerica great: Our freedom--keep Americans free economically, let them \nkeep their paycheck, keep them secure and safe in their workplace and \nhome and school, and that their property is protected, and keep them \neducated. Mr. President, they will take it from there no matter who the \npolicymakers are; the American citizens will build that new American \ncentury that the President alluded to last night.\n  Mr. President, I now yield up to 5 minutes to my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Abraham from Michigan, who will continue addressing \nthe key components of this agenda for freedom.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nGeorgia for organizing today's presentation.\n  As he has already outlined, yesterday we on the Republican side \noffered an agenda which we think includes the key cornerstones for \nstrengthening our Nation and moving forward into the 21st century. I am \nnot going to talk about every one of those. I would like to address a \ncouple of them, though, briefly, because I think it is very important \nfor the public to understand exactly why these are at the top of our \nlist.\n  First, I want to talk about tax relief. As we learned last night from \nthe State of the Union--and the Budget Committee hearing in the Senate \nhas recently indicated--not only did last year mark the first time \nsince 1969 that we ran a budget surplus, but it now appears as if we \nwill run budget surpluses for the next 25 years, and potentially \nbeyond.\n  That is great news for our country. I think--I hope, at least--that \nit will address some of the cynicism that has existed in America \ntowards the U.S. Congress because for so many years, no matter what we \nwere claiming in our campaigns, we would come to the Senate and the \nHouse and not get the job done. But we have gotten the job done.\n  Today, Americans are sending sufficient revenues so we have a \nsurplus. That is going to be a very big surplus. In fact, it may be as \nmuch as multitrillion dollars of surplus over the next 10, 20, 25 years \nand beyond. The reason we have the surplus is in large measure--in \nfact, almost exclusively--because of two things: No. 1, our ability \nhere in Washington to tighten belts with respect to some spending \nprograms in recent years; and, much more importantly, the fact that \nAmerican taxpayers are sending more money to Washington in tax revenue \nthan we anticipated when we put in place the budget that we are working \nwith today.\n  Mr. President, obviously part of that is the result of the economy's \nstrength, and it is thriving. But if the American taxpayers are sending \nmore money to Washington than we even expected, than we even asked them \nfor, and that they should be spending, it seems to me obvious that the \ntime is here to let them keep some of those dollars that we didn't even \nask for in the first place.\n  So for that reason, the Republican agenda includes in every one of \nits key components an across-the-board tax cut for hard-working \nAmerican families.\n  We heard people say, ``Well, we shouldn't do a tax cut; we have so \nmany other things to get done first.'' When we had a budget deficit, we \nwere told we couldn't cut taxes now, that we have a deficit. Now we \nhave a budget surplus and it is projected to go for 25 years.\n  I would suggest that no matter what today's agenda items are that \ndeserve priority over tax cuts, there will always be more. There will \nalways be a new program, there will always be an old program, there \nwill always be some rainy day down the road we are worried about, and \nthe taxpayers consistently are told no, no, no, the time is not ripe \nyet for a tax cut. Well, I say it is. I think the families who are \nsending us the largest percentage of the GDP that we have ever seen \nsent to Washington in history deserve to keep some of those dollars and \nset their own priorities. And for that reason, we propose an across-\nthe-board tax cut.\n  We also believe that the families of America deserve protection in \nanother sense. Here in this Chamber we ought to talk about children and \nthe problems and the challenges that confront them and our desire to \nhave policies that will protect the young people of America.\n  The one thing we have to protect them against, in my judgment, and \ncontinue protecting them against, is the scourge of illegal drugs that \ncontinues to take an unhealthy and an increasing toll on young people.\n  Over the last few years, the drug statistics have suggested that \nthere has been a leveling out of the drug use in this country, that we \nmay have at least peaked, and it may be even getting better a little \nbit. But the one area where we are not seeing improvement is with \nrespect to the use of drugs by kids, kids as young as eighth grade, \nsome even younger than that.\n\n[[Page S737]]\n\n  Now, our drug plan, which is the second cornerstone of this agenda, \nwill help us to achieve the goal of protecting our kids from these \nillegal drugs. It will include a wide array, a wide focus of programs, \nfrom interdiction on the one hand to treatment and prevention on the \nother.\n  But a centerpiece that I want to briefly discuss before my time \nexpires is that this proposal of ours provides tough sentences for the \npeople who peddle drugs to our kids. The message we have to send to \ndrug dealers and the symbol we have to set for kids in America is that \nthe price of doing business in drugs is going up, not down. Now, this \nis an area where there is some disagreement between our legislation and \nthe administration.\n  I ask for an additional minute.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the Senator may please feel free. The \nnext presenter has not arrived, so the Senator might as well continue \nwith his remarks until they do.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. In the last Congress, the U.S. Sentencing Commission put \nforth a proposal, embraced by the administration and the Department of \nJustice and the President, that would address this issue in what I \nconsider to be the wrong fashion. That proposal suggests that because \nthere is a wide difference between the drug sentences that powder \ncocaine dealers receive and the sentence that crack cocaine dealers \nreceive, we ought to bring them more in line with each other by making \nthe sentences on crack cocaine dealers more lenient.\n  That is the wrong way to proceed, Mr. President. And our legislation \ngoes at it the right way, by making the sentences meted out to people \nwho sell powder cocaine tougher. That is an important part of this \nlegislation, not only because we need to make those sentences tougher, \nbecause we don't want people at the top of the drug chain to be getting \nlighter sentences than those at the bottom. But it is also important \nbecause it is critical that we send a signal that we are not going to \nmake anybody's drug sentences, if they are peddling crack cocaine to \nour kids, any lighter.\n  This is important for a variety of reasons that I have spoken about \nhere before, but I think it demonstrates the seriousness of the \nRepublican proposal. And taken as a whole, that proposal, I believe, \nwill have a tremendous impact on reducing the use of illegal drugs in \nthis country and, most specifically, reducing the use of illegal drugs \nby young people.\n  So for these reasons, I am very proud to endorse this agenda, and I \nwill be working as a cosponsor on a number of these bills. I believe we \ncan pass them in this Congress. I think we saw yesterday in the \nintroduction of these bills the makings of the kind of solid \nfoundation, as I said, the cornerstone for success, as we move our \ncountry to the 21st century.\n  So I want to thank Senator Coverdell again for having put together \ntoday's special order. I look forward to working with him and under his \nleadership on a number of these issues, and I thank the Chair for \nallowing me a chance to proceed here today.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan. I \ndon't think you can say enough about the fact that the new target of \nthe drug cartels, the drug infrastructure, which is in many ways better \nthan a lot of the soft drink distributors', is focused on children 8 to \n14--8 to 14. And the consequences of attacking that vulnerable segment \nof our society live with us an extended period of time.\n  Mr. President, I now yield up to 5 minutes to my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Grams of Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Georgia for \norganizing this time and giving us an opportunity to speak on some of \nthe subjects that I think are very important to this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in offering our perspective \non the State of the Union--on both last night's speech by the \nPresident, and also the direction I believe we are headed as a nation.\n  Let me begin with the speech.\n  What we heard from the President last night was vintage Bill Clinton. \nAnd that is lots of promises, lots of poll-tested proposals, lots of \ntalk, but that all adds up to more spending and more Washington \ncontrol. In fact, in about 77 minutes he made about 77 new promises of \nspending for Washington.\n  Each of us want good schools for our children, security for our \nretirement years, a tax system that lets us meet important family \nobligations, and more opportunities for Americans to sell their \nproducts around the world. But empty promises from Washington are not \ngoing to help.\n  The President believes the answer in part lies in targeted tax cuts \nthat try to regulate behavior. It is a way to bribe the taxpayers with \ntheir own money by saying, ``If you do this for me, I will cut your \ntaxes in return.''\n  That is the wrong approach. It is aimed at a certain political \nsegment, and because of that, 90 percent of the people in this country \nwill not benefit. The tax cuts proposed by the President add up to too \nfew dollars that only a few people would benefit from.\n  If we are truly going to pursue economic freedom for all, the real \nanswer is to reduce the roadblocks to success. That, I believe, begins \nwith our continuing efforts on cutting taxes for everyone.\n  Yesterday, I joined Chairman Roth in introducing S. 3, the Tax Cuts \nfor All Americans Act. Our legislation, one of the top five priorities \nof Republicans in the 106th Congress, would offer a ten percent across-\nthe-board tax cut for every American, instead of the President's \ntargeted tax scheme that ignores most working families. A ten-percent \ncut is meaningful tax relief for all, not token tax relief for just a \nfew.\n  Mr. President, in one word, the state of the union is ``overtaxed.''\n  American families are taxed at the highest levels in our history, \neven higher than during World War II, with nearly 40 percent of a \ntypical family's budget going to pay taxes on the federal, state and \nlocal levels. Over $1.8 trillion of their income will be siphoned off \nto Washington this year.\n  Certainly, the taxpayers are in desperate need of relief.\n  Freedom for families means giving families the freedom to spend more \nof their own dollars as they choose.\n  Our bill will cut the personal tax rate for each American by 10 \npercent across the board. It will increase incentives to work. It will \nincrease incentives to save and invest. It will help to improve the \nstandard of living for all Americans.\n  The 10 percent across-the-board tax cut will not only benefit \nfamilies, but it will also have a substantial, positive impact on the \neconomy as a whole. It will increase the financial rewards of hard \nwork, entrepreneurship, innovation, and productivity--the very \nfoundations upon which this nation has thrived.\n  If the state of the union is overtaxed, the President did not help \nmuch with the laundry list of new initiatives he proposed last night \nthat would expand the size and scope of the already enormous federal \ngovernment.\n  It was about 2 years ago that we heard the era of big government was \nover. Well, the era of big government is now alive and well. In fact, \nit is a mammoth new government under the proposals of President Clinton \nlast night. Many of these programs sound good, but what the President \ndid not spell out is exactly who is going to pay for it--and, of \ncourse, we all know that its the taxpayers. In other words, I say he \nled Americans into the candy store last night and said, ``you can have \nanything you want.'' The only problem is he didn't tell you who is \ngoing to have to pay for it. The White House ``spinmeisters'' suggested \nthe President's proposals would, ``knock your socks off.'' Instead, \nthose proposals will pick your pockets.\n  Mr. President, let me say this as clearly as I can: I will strongly \noppose any proposals that are designed to build the President's \npopularity at the expense of the American taxpayers.\n  I am also disappointed by the comments made by the President last \nnight about the ailing Social Security system.\n  We heard a lot of vague promises that ultimately leave the government \nin control of your retirement dollars and do nothing to save Social \nSecurity from bankruptcy or create a better retirement system for the \nnext generation. The President is worried about saving a failed \nretirement system that promises small benefits when he should be \nworking to create a system that\n\n[[Page S738]]\n\nprovides larger benefits and more security for everybody. Let us worry \nabout people, and not expend precious time and resources trying to save \na dying government program. If we are truly serious about offering \nAmericans the opportunity to achieve wealth and security in their \nretirement years, legislation I have introduced that would allow \nworkers to set up personal retirement accounts is a far better \napproach. Mr. President, the American people now have a choice: empty \nwords and poll-tested promises on one hand, and a real taxpayers' \nagenda of freedom and opportunity on the other. The state of the union \ncan be improved, as my colleagues and I have so vigorously suggested \ntoday. And the people are depending on us to lead the way. I thank the \nChair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank my colleague from Minnesota for his remarks. I \nam going to yield to the Senator from Mississippi for the purpose of a \nunanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Cochran and Mr. Hagel pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 257 are located in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to make a brief \nobservation and reflect on one of the points the President made last \nnight during his State of the Union Message. The President suggested--\nrecommended that America pause for a moment and understand and absorb \nthis dynamic, exciting time that we live in. And, indeed, it is \nexciting, dynamic, and full of hope and opportunity. But, as I listened \nto the President last night--and I listened to the 20 specific mentions \nof more government spending for more and new programs, and as I \nlistened to the 24 specific mentions of more Federal Government \nregulation--I failed to hear any reference to tax cuts, to turning back \nauthority, turning back regulation, turning back government to the \npeople.\n  I connected with what he said in his observation about the times we \nlive in. And isn't it amazing, especially when you look at the report \nthat Freedom House issued a month ago about where the world is going \ntoday. In that report, Freedom House pointed out that for the first \ntime since Freedom House has been calculating personal liberty in the \nworld, more peoples are free, with more personal liberties, today than \nat any time in the history of their measurement; in fact, they went so \nfar as to say maybe in the history, proportionally, of mankind. There \nis a long way to go, but in their calculations they said almost half of \nthe 5.6 billion people on Earth are free today. I find that rather \ninteresting, in that most of the world is moving this way--less \ngovernment, less regulation, more personal liberty--and here the \ngreatest Republic in the history of mankind, if you listen to the \nPresident, is going back the other way: more restrictions, more \ngovernment, more regulation, and less individual freedom.\n  On Sunday and Monday of this week I was back in Nebraska and met with \nteachers, students, parents. One of the things that came out of that \nmeeting from the teachers was this observation, and I say this in light \nof what the President proposed last night with his advocacy of more \nFederal Government involvement in education. As a matter of fact, he \nwent beyond that. He said, unless local school districts complied with \nwhat Washington said--with our money, the taxpayers' money; even more \ninteresting--then we would cut them off. What the schoolteachers told \nme, those we have charged to educate our children, those who have maybe \nthe heaviest burden except for the parents, in this debate--they tell \nme we don't want any more Government. But they also said this, and this \nis where we are missing the point: We are gliding over this gap of \nchildren from 1 to 5 or 6. When the teacher gets that child at 5 or 6, \nthat is a molded product. That is a molded product we can work and \ndevelop, but where is the emphasis on the parental responsibility? \nAccording to the President, we are going to, in fact, do more for day \ncare, and now summer programs, more education--the Federal Government, \nessentially, is going to really dictate the dynamics of our foundation.\n  The foundation of our country is not government. The foundation of \nthis country rests on a value system, and morals and honesty and \nrespect for one another. That is what we build from. That is what we \nhave always built from. Not more government programs; not more money. \nAnd, when we glide over that and act like that is not there or that is \nnot important, or even emphasize the responsibility of parents and the \nresponsibility of all society, we are in some trouble.\n  I find it interesting, in reading Governor George Bush's comments \nyesterday, what he said: Too much hope in economics, just as we once \nput too much hope in Government, may be our greater challenge. He is \nright. We must go beyond Government, beyond economics, and go back and \nemphasize parental responsibility and truth and values. That is what we \nbuild from.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank my good colleague from Nebraska for his \nremarks and insight, and now turn to yield up to 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Senator Craig is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me associate myself with the remarks of \nmy colleague from Nebraska and thank my colleague from Georgia for \nbringing us this special order as we attempt to analyze the President's \nState of the Union Message of last evening.\n  America tuned in, and so did we, to hear what our President would say \nabout the State of the Union. And he said what we expected him to say, \nthat the State of the Union itself at this moment in time is very, very \ngood. But, what would a Presidency in crisis try to do at a time that \nthe State of the Union is in excellent shape? My guess is that \nPresidency would attempt to appeal to his base in a very aggressive \nway, and to divert attention from the real issue at hand that will \ntranspire once again on the floor of this Senate in less than an hour, \nand that is an impeachment trial of this President, this Presidency in \ncrisis.\n  But, for a moment, let me talk about the speech and his effort to \ndivert attention. The polls show he did just that. He got excellent \nratings in the polls this morning in that snapshot of American opinion \nabout what this President said. The problem in the snapshot is that \nthere were no comparatives. The Senator from Nebraska offered \ncomparatives, the Senator from Georgia has offered comparatives this \nmorning, as to what this President has said in the past and done in the \npast versus what he said last night. About a year ago now, this \nPresident said the era of big government is over. We all cheered that. \nMost conservatives like myself for a long time have dedicated their \nenergies to reducing the size of government and its impact on our daily \nlives as citizens and taxpayers of this country. And we have come a \nlong way in doing that in the last several decades. So the President, \nonce again appealing to his ratings in the polls, said the era of big \ngovernment is over. That was 12 months ago.\n  As we all know, in the last 12 months a great deal has transpired as \nit relates to this President and his Presidency. Last night this \nPresident proclaimed a grand new great society. In fact, he probably \nproposed more new Government initiatives--75 or 80 new initiatives--\nmore so than Lyndon Johnson did with his proposal for a great new \nsociety. He literally reached out and attempted to touch every American \ncitizen to make them feel good. He is going to correct the schools and \nchange the character of the schools, as to which the Senator from \nNebraska referred. Obviously, he is going to attack us on our second \namendment rights to protect our citizens, so he says, and it went on \nand on and on.\n\n  But the one thing he did not mention was what was he going to do to \nthe taxpayer; more importantly, what was he going to do for the \ntaxpayer. He proposed to do nothing for them but do a heck of a lot to \nthem.\n  Three times or four or five times last night he talked about his \nbalanced budget. I say, ``Mr. President, how dare you.'' I say it with \na bit of a smile on my face because this President has no credibility \nin that area. But he is basking in the popularity of it now, made \npopular by a conservative Republican\n\n[[Page S739]]\n\nCongress that said, ``No more deficits, and we'll fight to get a \nbalanced budget.'' And we did that, even though the President opposed \nus every step of the way and then takes credit for it.\n  The reason I bring that up in the context of what did he do to or for \nthe taxpayers is that several news reporters said, ``What did you think \nof the speech?'' My reaction was, Well, for 15 years, I fought for a \nbalanced budget. I and others, collectively this Congress, was \nsuccessful in getting it, and we built this sizable growing surplus. We \nbuilt that surplus, or at least we hoped we could build a surplus when \nwe created a balanced budget to do a couple of things: to stimulate the \neconomy by returning to the taxpayers excessive taxes which we had \ntaken from them. Surpluses are not free moneys to spend, they are \nrepresentative of the fact that we are overtaxing our citizenry, and we \nought to return some of the money to them.\n  I won't argue with the President about Social Security reform and the \nvalue of that reform and using the surplus for those purposes. But, Mr. \nPresident, over $4 trillion worth of surplus in the next 15 years and \nyou don't want to give one dime back to the taxpayer?\n  I think I was right in my initial analysis, this President slipped \nback last night, because of the pressure and the crisis he is in, to \nhis old base of trying to give something to everybody. It was a feel-\ngood State of the Union speech that did nothing for the taxpayer, \nnothing for the economy and a heck of a lot to grow big government and, \nonce again, put shackles on the freedom of our citizens to perform \nindependent of their Government. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nIdaho. I heard this morning, just as an aside, that the speech was 77 \nminutes long and there were 77 new programs.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is about right.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. A program a minute. I now yield to my distinguished \ncolleague from Wyoming for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for arranging to have \nthis discussion and talk about where we are going. That is, after all, \nwhat it is about.\n  I listened to my colleagues state their impression, their \ninterpretation of last night's State of the Union Address, and it is \nright on target. What we really are faced with--all of us--is a vision \nof where we are going in this country, a broad vision in the long run \nof where we want to go and what we want to achieve and what it takes to \ncause that to happen. That is really the challenge that we have; the \nlong-term goal in a broad sense of things like freedom and opportunity \nand security, job security, business; smaller government rather than \nmore, moving government back to people in communities.\n\n  Those are the long-term goals that we ought to have so that as we \nthen put our agenda together, we have to ask how do these things fit.\n  When you talk about the things the President mentioned last night, 45 \nor whatever it was, how do they fit in this business of freedom, how do \nthey fit in making Government smaller? So each, then, has a challenge \nto transfer our goals into the specifics that we talk about.\n  Collectively, we need an agenda for ourselves narrowed down to those \nthings with which we really need to deal. Of course, we all have other \nissues, but there ought to be some priorities, and that is what we are \ndoing and that is what the Senator is doing in setting an agenda.\n  We need to talk about Social Security and make it work. We need to \nmake it work just as much for those who are now getting benefits as for \nthose who are just beginning to pay in. That is one of the things we \nneed to do.\n  Everyone knows we need to strengthen the military, and we must do \nthat. This administration has not. We can do that.\n  Of course, we need to strengthen health care, but we don't need a \nnational health care program. We already tried that. We already talked \nabout that. We don't need to do that. We need to take pieces and \nstrengthen the private sector.\n  Tax reform--I don't think there is a soul in this country who doesn't \nbelieve we need tax reform to make it more simple, but we are moving \nthe other way. Every time we want to effect some behavior, as in the \nPresident's message last night, we give them a tax break--a tax break \nhere, tax break there. We need to look at the overall reduction for all \ntaxpayers and earners in this country.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me, rather than comment particularly on \nthe State of the Union last night, I just am saying to myself and to \nyou, let's take a look at our long-term goals of where we want to be \nover a period of time, measure those things that need to be done then \nimmediately so that we can reach those goals, put some emphasis and \npriorities on a small number of items so that we can accomplish it and \nnot have the same result the President did a year ago, when he listed \nalmost the same number of events and, according to Broder in the \nWashington Post, was successful in one.\n  We have a chance to be successful within an agenda--Social Security, \nhealth care, strengthen the military, do something on crime, and \nsimplify and reduce taxes. I hope that is our agenda. It is our agenda. \nI hope it is the President's agenda as well. That is what we ought to \ndo this year. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Wyoming and return to the \nSenator from Idaho and extend another 2 minutes to him. I know, with a \nnumber of Senators coming to the floor, he wasn't able to complete his \nremarks. So I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia. I \nappreciate that. I wanted to add for the Record some of the analysis we \nare now doing about what the President said last night and, more \nimportantly, how he proposes to spend the taxpayers' money.\n  The surplus that he projects, and that I think we generally agree \nwith, based on the vibrancy of our economy today, is about $4.35 \ntrillion over the next 15 years. That is rough, give or take 1 percent, \ndepending on who is doing the calculation.\n  In that context, here is what the President proposes to do: He \nproposes to spend 62 percent of it for Social Security, about $2.7 \ntrillion. Probably we would not want to disagree with that, because \nabout 60 percent of the surplus is generated by Social Security taxes, \nand it ought to go into Social Security and it ought to go into \nstrengthening it and saving it and, hopefully, reforming it.\n  The President laid out a plan last night that we are looking at now, \nbut at least he opened the door for reform--and I am glad he has--and \nwill create some flexibility, because we are going to guarantee that \nthe current recipients and immediate future recipients of Social \nSecurity are going to have their Social Security. What I am worried \nabout are the young people who are entering the workforce today and \nbeginning to invest in Social Security and finding that the worst \ninvestment they have ever made. That is wrong, and we know how to \ncorrect it. We have an opportunity to so.\n  He has done something else that is very interesting. He is saying \nthat about 15 percent ought to go into Medicare. That would be the \nfirst time that general fund taxes would ever go to Medicare. That \nrepresents about a 20-percent increase in the current payroll tax that \nis going into Medicare--general fund dollars into Medicare, first time \nin history that would happen. That is a rather bold new break in his \napproach.\n  USA retirement accounts, 11 percent; new spending, about 11 percent, \n$479 billion. He also includes a substantial tax increase to get there.\n  That is a little bit of the economic analysis. Here is a President \nwho says we have a balanced budget, and he slides into major new tax \nincreases and creates a huge new approach toward Federal spending. We \nare going to work with him, but we are not going to spend that kind of \nmoney, that is for sure.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, again, I thank my colleague from Idaho.\n  I now yield up to 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page S740]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia for the \ntime. I know it is very scarce, but I felt compelled, Mr. President, to \nmake a couple of comments about what was not in the State of the Union \nMessage last night.\n  One of the most disturbing things was that out of 1 hour and 20 \nminutes, only about less than 90 seconds were devoted to our Nation's \ndefense. We are facing a crisis, and it is on two fronts. And I, just \nbriefly, would like to submit a couple things for the Record and \ndiscuss those two things.\n  First of all, not many Americans realize that we do not have a \nnational missile defense system. And that is to say, Mr. President, \nthat if a missile is fired from anyplace in China at Washington, DC, it \ntakes approximately 35 minutes to get over here. Now, the average \nperson would think, well, if it takes 35 minutes to get over here--and \nwe can remember the Persian Gulf war--we know you can knock down \nmissiles with missiles, therefore, we have a defense. But, in fact, we \nhave zero defense.\n  We don't have any defense at all. And the reason is that when you \nhave a trajectory, where a missile is fired in one area, it goes up, it \nis out of the atmosphere, and by the time it comes back in, it is \ncoming at a velocity that is faster than anything we have in our \narsenal; and, consequently, we have no defense.\n  So you might ask the question, well, is there really a threat out \nthere that is facing us that is imminent today? And I have to say that \nthere is. I know that it sounds extreme to say this, but I have often \nsaid--and others are now agreeing--that I look back wistfully on the \ndays of the cold war where there are two superpowers, the U.S.S.R. and \nthe United States of America; and we knew what they had, they knew what \nwe had. And we had this great agreement that was put together, not by \nDemocrats but by Republicans, called the ABM agreement of 1972 that \nsaid: ``I will make you a deal. If you agree not to defend yourself, \nwe'll agree not to defend ourselves, therefore, if you shoot us, we'll \nshoot you, and everyone dies and everyone's happy.'' That was something \nI didn't agree with at that time, but, however, today it makes \nabsolutely no sense at all.\n  I would like to repeat something that was said recently by Henry \nKissinger, who was one of the architects of that ABM Treaty of 1972, \nwhen he said it no longer has any application today. Today, when you \nare looking at the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, when \nyou see countries like Russia and China that have missiles that will \nreach any city in the United States of America from anyplace in the \nworld, that is a very, very serious thing. And that means that there is \nnot just one entity out there from which we must defend ourselves.\n  I can remember--I am old enough to remember--the 1962 Cuban missile \ncrisis when all of a sudden hysteria set out in the United States of \nAmerica. We discovered that there were 40 medium-range intercontinental \nballistic missiles, that were Soviet missiles, on the little island of \nCuba, 90 miles off of our shore, and they could reach any city outside \nof the States of Washington, Alaska and Hawaii. And I would say now the \ncrisis is even worse because they can reach anywhere. And we still have \nno defense at all.\n  I want to submit for the Record--to evaluate this, we on the Armed \nServices Committee have the nine most professional people, most \nknowledgeable people on missiles anywhere in the world--and it was \nchaired by Don Rumsfeld--and they put together an assessment of what \nour threat really is.\n  A lot of times people say the threat is not imminent when they talk \nabout indigenous capabilities. In other words, if Iran were trying to \ndevelop a missile to reach us, it would take them 5 or 6 years to do \nit. On the other hand, we know that Iran is trading, as we speak, with \nChina, trading technology, trading systems. And they have one that \ncould hit us today. So I only read the Executive Summary concluding \nparagraph:\n\n       Therefore, we unanimously recommend that U.S. analyses, \n     practices and policies that depend on expectations of \n     extended warning of deployment be reviewed and, as \n     appropriate, revised to reflect the reality of an environment \n     in which there may be little or no warning.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that material printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Executive Summary of the Report of the Commission To Assess the \n             Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States\n\n                             July 15, 1998\n\n\n                         ii. executive summary\n\n     A. Conclusions of the Commissioners\n       The nine Commissioners are unanimous in concluding that:\n       Concerted efforts by a number of overtly or potentially \n     hostile nations to acquire ballistic missiles with biological \n     or nuclear payloads pose a growing threat to the United \n     States, its deployed forces and its friends and allies. These \n     newer, developing threats in North Korea, Iran and Iraq are \n     in addition to those still posed by the existing ballistic \n     missile arsenals of Russia and China, nations with which we \n     are not now in conflict but which remain in uncertain \n     transitions. The newer ballistic missile-equipped nations' \n     capabilities will not match those of U.S. systems for \n     accuracy or reliability. However, they would be able to \n     inflict major destruction on the U.S. within about five years \n     of a decision to acquire such a capability (10 years in the \n     case of Iraq). During several of those years, the U.S. might \n     not be aware that such a decision had been made.\n       The threat to the U.S. posed by these emerging capabilities \n     is broader, more mature and evolving more rapidly than has \n     been reported in estimates and reports by the Intelligence \n     Community.\n       The Intelligence Community's ability to provide timely and \n     accurate estimates of ballistic missile threats to the U.S. \n     is eroding. This erosion has roots both within and beyond the \n     intelligence process itself. The Community's capabilities in \n     this area need to be strengthened in terms of both resources \n     and methodology.\n       The warning times the U.S. can expect of new, threatening \n     ballistic missile deployments are being reduced. Under some \n     plausible scenarios--including re-basing or transfer of \n     operational missiles, sea- and air-launch options, shortened \n     development programs that might include testing in a third \n     country, or some combination of these--the U.S. might well \n     have little or no warning before operational deployment.\n       Therefore, we unanimously recommend that U.S. analyses, \n     practices and policies that depend on expectations of \n     extended warning of deployment be reviewed and, as \n     appropriate, revised to reflect the reality of an environment \n     in which there may be little or no warning.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Resumes of Commission Members\n\n       The Honorable Donald H.

Recognizing my time is about up, I would only like to say \nthat is only part of the problem. The other problem is--and I say this \nwith some knowledge as chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee in the \nSenate Armed Services Committee--that we have roughly 60 percent of the \ncapability that we had, in terms of force strength, that we had during \nthe Persian Gulf war in 1991. And when I say that, I can quantify. \nTalking about 60 percent of the Army division, 60 percent of the \ntactical air wing, 60 percent of the ships floating around there; and \nyet we are in a more threatened world today.\n  So I believe that little pittance that the President is talking about \nof $110 billion over 6 years, of which only $2 billion of new money \nwould be in the coming fiscal year, does not meet the expectations of \nthe American people. It has not fulfilled the requirements of his own \nSecretary of Defense, his own Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nand the four chiefs who said: We are going to have to put a minimum of \n$25 billion of new money in each year for the next 6 years in order to \nget to a point where we can defend America on two regional fronts.\n  With that, I thank the Senator from Georgia for this very scarce time \nthat he has given me.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma and associate myself \nwith his grave concern on this issue. Now I turn to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas. I yield up to 5 minutes to her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia for talking \nabout our very important congressional agenda. I was very pleased to \nhear the closing remarks from my colleague from Oklahoma, because I \nthink one of the priorities of Congress has been laid right at our feet \nby the Senator from Oklahoma. And according to the Constitution it is \nthe one major responsibility that Congress must perform--to provide a \nnational defense for the United States and all of its citizens. That \ncore responsibility has been jeopardized in the last 5 years because we \nhave not kept up the investments needed to ensure that we keep and \nrecruit the best people for our military. Equipment is deteriorating, \nand the big strategic defenses that are vital to our national security \nhave not been deployed. Again, I am very pleased that the Senator from \nOklahoma talked about defense, and I am going to add some things that I \nbelieve are necessary to regain and maintain a strong national in \ndefense.\n  What we have seen with the President's State of the Union, and the \ncongressional statement of priorities, are some places where we will be \nable to work together. While we can agree on some goals, I also believe \nthere are some profound differences in how we get there.\n  The Republican plan is very simple while the President's plan is very \ncomplicated. It seemed like it was a new idea a minute. It was a \nshotgun approach to all of the major issues we face. I would like to \ntake each one of those and show how we will be different and hopefully \nhow we can come together.\n  Let us say, first and foremost, that our No. 1 priority is Social \nSecurity reform. I think that is also the President's first priority. \nHow we achieve reform is going to be very different, because the \nPresident has opted for a big federalized plan whereas the Republicans \nin Congress are trying to say: We want people to be able to have their \nown retirement accounts. We want them to be able to make some of the \nchoices in investing their Social Security taxes. And, most of all, we \nwant people to be able to pass their retirement accounts onto their \nchildren.\n  This is a very important difference from the President's plan, which \nis to take 60 percent of the surplus and have the Government invest it \nin the stock market. While it might make Social Security more secure, I \nthink it could have a disastrous impact on the stock market. The \nfederal government could use its investments to micro-manage certain \nindustries and markets. Free enterprise is the hallmark of our economy \nand having the government enter the stock market could pose a \nsignificant risk to the nature of our economy.\n  Tax relief. I think it is very important that we have simple, \nstraight-forward tax relief for every working American family. Every \nworking American in the Republican plan will get a 10 percent across-\nthe-board tax cut. In order to determine how this plan will benefit \nyou, while you are figuring your taxes in preparation for the April \n15th filing deadline, take 10 percent off of your tax liability; and \nthat is what our tax cut will give you. Now, compare our tax cut plan \nto the President's very complex tax cutting proposals. His plan will \nadd thousands of pages of new rules and regulations to an already \nburdensome and complex tax code. Only if you spend your money on his \npriorities will you get any tax relief. With our plan everybody \nwins. Our plan puts more of the money in the pockets of the people who \nearn it, rather than giving it to ``Big Brother'' Government to decide \nhow to spend the money you earn and you worked for.\n\n  Education: The primary difference between our education proposal and \nthe President's proposal has to do with who is in control of the \nresources. Both plans seek to achieve the same goals, but ours would \nkeep control with those who directly educate children--local school \nofficials, principals, teachers, and parents. We have the same goals, \nbut we will reach them in different ways.\n  The congressional plan is the right one for America. We are going to \npush ahead and hope that the President will work with us to reform \nSocial Security and make it secure, to give tax cuts to hard-working \nAmericans, and increase educational opportunity so that every child in \nAmerica can get a good public education and reach his or her full \npotential.\n\n\n                            order for recess\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nstand in recess at 12:55.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me start by saying in the past the President has \nsaid the era of big government is over, and last night what he meant \nwas that he was proposing an era of really big government and no tax \ncuts for the American people for 15 years. Frankly, I don't believe \nthat will sell. I think when the American people understand what the \nPresident recommended last night, they will ask: What happened to the \nsurplus that is not needed for Social Security, that we paid to the \nGovernment in taxes? Why don't we get some of it back?\n  That is the issue. They should get some of it back. We have \nunderestimated the tax take of this country; thus, we have an excess of \ntaxes in the coffers of the United States. Who paid that money to us? \nThe taxpayers. They should get some or all of it back. I believe the \nbest way to do that is an across-the-board tax cut. I don't write tax \nlaws here, but obviously what we are talking about is equity and \nfairness; but, in addition, something that is very good for the \nAmerican economy.\n  The world is in some kind of strange recessionary mood, with whole \npieces\n\n[[Page S742]]\n\nof it not working. The United States has been immune from that. Now is \nthe time to have a tax cut, and the best kind is across-the-board to \nmake sure that we are adding to the American economy an ingredient that \nis apt to keep us going at this formidable rate of sustained growth and \njobs and prosperity. That means a tax cut now for the American people \nand for the future prosperity of our country.\n  In addition, I suggest that people ought to look at what the \nPresident proposed to do with this surplus. I am amazed. This surplus--\nwhich is taxpayers' money, that is in excess of Social Security--the \nPresident has now decided he knows precisely how to use it. Every bit \nof it is spent, I say to my friend, Senator Thurmond: New programs, new \nideas, new needs, even some money for Medicare. And we have never \nheretofore put general taxpayers' money in Medicare. So he wants to \nspend it all and the taxpayers will get none of it back.\n  It seems to this Senator that that is a good issue to take to the \npublic, to take to the people of this land. What do you want to do with \nthis surplus? Do you want a bigger Government and spend more of it? Or \nspend all of it? Or do you want to give some of it back to the \ntaxpayers who work hard in this land to make ends meet and truly, truly \nare the engines of this growth period we have had? Hard-working \nAmericans caused this to happen. There is higher productivity because \nthey are more skilled and their employers are using new equipment and \nnew technology--higher productivity, more jobs.\n  Surplus means to me that taxpayers should get some benefit. We are \ngoing to work very hard to see to it that the people understand it and \nwe have a real opportunity to help them if they will help us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/20/senate-section/article/S735-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PROVIDING FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION AND SUBMISSION OF \n                               STATEMENTS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The material follows:\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Gorton):\n  S. 253. A bill to provide for the reorganization of the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, and for other purposes.\n\n\n            federal ninth circuit reorganization act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my \ndistinguished colleague from Washington, Senator Slade Gorton, in \nintroducing legislation that will go far in improving the consistency, \npredictability and coherency of case law in the Ninth Circuit U.S. \nCourt of Appeals.\n  Our bill, The Federal Ninth Circuit Reorganization Act of 1999, \nadopts the recommendations of a Congressionally-mandated Commission \nthat studied the alignment of the U.S. Court of Appeals. Retired \nSupreme Court Justice Byron R. White, chaired the scholarly Commission.\n  The Commission's Report, released last December, calls for a division \nof the Ninth Circuit into three regionally based adjudicative \ndivisions--the Northern, Middle, and Southern. Each of these regional \ndivisions would maintain a majority of its judges within its region. \nEach division would have exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from the \njudicial districts within its region. Further, each division would \nfunction as a semi-autonomous decisional unit. To resolve conflicts \nthat may develop between regions, a Circuit Division for Conflict \nCorrection would replace the current limited and ineffective en banc \nsystem. Lastly, the Circuit would remain intact as an administrative \nunit, functioning as it now does.\n  It is important to note that the Commission adopted the arguments \nthat I and several other Senators have put forth to justify a complete \ndivision of the Ninth Circuit--Circuit population, record caseloads, \nand inconsistency in judicial decisions. However, the Commission \nrejected an administrative division because it believed it would \n``deprive the courts now in the Ninth Circuit of the administrative \nadvantages afforded by the present circuit configuration and deprive \nthe West and the Pacific seaboard of a means for maintaining uniform \nfederal law in that area.''\n  While I don't necessarily reach the same conclusion as the Commission \n(that an administrative division of the Ninth Circuit is not \nwarranted), I strongly agree with the Committee's conclusion that the \nrestructuring of the Ninth Circuit as proposed in the Commission's \nReport will ``increase the consistency and coherence of the law, \nmaximize the likelihood of genuine collegiality, establish an effective \nprocedure for maintaining uniform decisional law within the circuit, \nand relate the appellate forum more closely to the region it serves.''\n  Mr. President, swift Congressional action is needed. One need only \nlook at the contours of the Ninth Circuit to see the need for this \nreorganization. Stretching from the Arctic Circle to the Mexican \nborder, past the tropics of Hawaii and across the International \nDateline to Guam and the Mariana Islands, by any means of measurement, \nthe Ninth Circuit is the largest of all U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal.\n  The Ninth Circuit serves a population of more than 49 million people, \nwell over a third more than the next largest Circuit. By 2010, the \nCensus Bureau estimates that the Ninth Circuit's population will be \nmore than 63 million--a 40 percent increase in just 13 years, which \ninevitably will create an even more daunting caseload.\n  Because of its massive size, there often results a decrease in the \nability of judges to keep abreast of legal developments within the \nNinth Circuit. This\n\n[[Page S743]]\n\nunwieldy caseload creates an inconsistency in Constitutional \ninterpretation. In fact, Ninth Circuit cases have an extraordinarily \nhigh reversal rate by the Supreme Court. (During the Supreme Court's \n1996-97 session, the Supreme Court overturned 95% of the Ninth Circuit \ncases heard by the Court.) This lack of Constitutional consistency \ndiscourages settlements and leads to unnecessary litigation.\n  Ninth Circuit Judge Diramuid O'Scannlain described the problem as \nfollows:\n\n       An appellate court must function as a unified body, and it \n     must speak with a unified voice. It must maintain and shape a \n     coherent body of law * * *. As the number of opinions \n     increase, we judges risk losing the ability to keep track of \n     precedents and the ability to know what our circuit's law is. \n     In short, bigger is not better.\n\n  The legislation that Senator Gorton and I introduce today is a \nsensible reorganization of the Ninth Circuit. The Northern Division of \nthe Ninth Circuit would join Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Montana, and \nIdaho. This proposal reflects legislation I introduced in the last \nCongress which created a new Twelfth Circuit consisting of the States \nof the Northwest. Like my previous legislation, the Commission's report \nwill go far in creating regional commonality and greater consistency \nand dependency in legal decisions.\n  However, it is my strong suggestion that when the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee conducts hearings on this legislation, certain modifications \nbe closely examined:\n  1. Elimination of the requirement that judges within a region are \nrequired to rotate to other regions of the Circuit;\n  2. Adjustment of the regional alignments to include Hawaii, the \nMariana Islands and the Territory of Guam in the Northern Region; and\n  3. Shortening the period in which the Federal Judicial Center \nconducts a study of the effectiveness and efficiency of the Ninth \nCircuit divisions from eight years to three years.\n  Mr. President, Congress has waited long enough to correct the \nproblems of the Ninth Circuit. The 49 million residents of the Ninth \nCircuit are the persons that suffer. Many wait years before cases are \nheard and decided, prompting many to forego the entire appellate \nprocess. The Ninth Circuit has become a circuit where justice is not \nswift and not always served.\n  Mr. President, we have known the problem of the Ninth Circuit for a \nlong time. It's time to solve the problem. The Commission's \nrecommendations, as reflected in our legislation, is a good first \nstart. I hope we can resolve this issue this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of our legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 253\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Ninth Circuit \n     Reorganization Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DIVISIONAL ORGANIZATION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR \n                   THE NINTH CIRCUIT.\n\n       (a) Regional Divisions.--Effective 180 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the United States Court of Appeals \n     for the Ninth Circuit shall be organized into 3 regional \n     divisions designated as the Northern Division, the Middle \n     Division, and the Southern Division, and a nonregional \n     division designated as the Circuit Division.\n       (b) Review of Decisions.--\n       (1) Nonapplication of section 1294.--Section 1294 of title \n     28, United States Code, shall not apply to the Ninth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals. The review of district court decisions \n     shall be governed as provided in this subsection.\n       (2) Review.--Except as provided in sections 1292(c), \n     1292(d), and 1295 of title 28, United States Code, once the \n     court is organized into divisions, appeals from reviewable \n     decisions of the district and territorial courts located \n     within the Ninth Circuit shall be taken to the regional \n     divisions of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals as follows:\n       (A) Appeals from the districts of Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, \n     Idaho, Montana, the Northern Mariana Islands, Oregon, Eastern \n     Washington, and Western Washington shall be taken to the \n     Northern Division.\n       (B) Appeals from the districts of Eastern California, \n     Northern California, and Nevada shall be taken to the Middle \n     Division.\n       (C) Appeals from the districts of Arizona, Central \n     California, and Southern California shall be taken to the \n     Southern Division.\n       (D) Appeals from the Tax Court, petitions to enforce the \n     orders of administrative agencies, and other proceedings \n     within the court of appeals' jurisdiction that do not involve \n     review of district court actions shall be filed in the court \n     of appeals and assigned to the division that would have \n     jurisdiction over the matter if the division were a separate \n     court of appeals.\n       (3) Assignment of judges.--Each regional division shall \n     include from 7 to 11 judges of the court of appeals in active \n     status. A majority of the judges assigned to each division \n     shall reside within the judicial districts that are within \n     the division's jurisdiction as specified in paragraph (2). \n     Judges in senior status may be assigned to regional divisions \n     in accordance with policies adopted by the court of appeals. \n     Any judge assigned to 1 division may be assigned by the chief \n     judge of the circuit for temporary duty in another division \n     as necessary to enable the divisions to function effectively.\n       (4) Presiding judges.--Section 45 of title 28, United \n     States Code, shall govern the designation of the presiding \n     judge of each regional division as though the division were a \n     court of appeals, except that the judge serving as chief \n     judge of the circuit may not at the same time serve as \n     presiding judge of a regional division, and that only judges \n     resident within, and assigned to, the division shall be \n     eligible to serve as presiding judge of that division.\n       (5) Panels.--Panels of a division may sit to hear and \n     decide cases at any place within the judicial districts of \n     the division, as specified by a majority of the judges of the \n     division. The divisions shall be governed by the Federal \n     Rules of Appellate Procedure and by local rules and internal \n     operating procedures adopted by the court of appeals. The \n     divisions may not adopt their own local rules or internal \n     operating procedures. The decisions of 1 regional division \n     shall not be regarded as binding precedents in the other \n     regional divisions.\n       (c) Circuit Division.--\n       (1) In general.--In addition to the 3 regional divisions \n     specified under subsection (a), the Ninth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals shall establish a Circuit Division composed of the \n     chief judge of the circuit and 12 other circuit judges in \n     active status, chosen by lot in equal numbers from each \n     regional division. Except for the chief judge of the circuit, \n     who shall serve ex officio, judges on the Circuit Division \n     shall serve nonrenewable, staggered terms of 3 years each. \n     One-third of the judges initially selected by lot shall serve \n     terms of 1 year each, one-third shall serve terms of 2 years \n     each, and one-third shall serve terms of 3 years each. \n     Thereafter all judges shall serve terms of 3 years each. If a \n     judge on the Circuit Division is disqualified or otherwise \n     unable to serve in a particular case, the presiding judge of \n     the regional division to which that judge is assigned shall \n     randomly select a judge from the division to serve in the \n     place of the unavailable judge.\n       (2) Jurisdiction.--The Circuit Division shall have \n     jurisdiction to review, and to affirm, reverse, or modify any \n     final decision rendered in any of the court's divisions that \n     conflicts on an issue of law with a decision in another \n     division of the court. The exercise of such jurisdiction \n     shall be within the discretion of the Circuit Division and \n     may be invoked by application for review by a party to the \n     case, setting forth succinctly the issue of law as to which \n     there is a conflict in the decisions of 2 or more divisions. \n     The Circuit Division may review the decision of a panel \n     within a division only if en banc review of the decision has \n     been sought and denied by the division.\n       (3) Procedures.--The Circuit Division shall consider and \n     decide cases through procedures adopted by the court of \n     appeals for the expeditious and inexpensive conduct of the \n     division's business. The Circuit Division shall not function \n     through panels. The Circuit Division shall decide issues of \n     law on the basis of the opinions, briefs, and records in the \n     conflicting decisions under review, unless the Circuit \n     Division determines that special circumstances make \n     additional briefing or oral argument necessary.\n       (4) En banc proceedings.--Section 46 of title 28, United \n     States Code, shall apply to each regional division of the \n     Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals as though the division were \n     the court of appeals. Section 46(c) of title 28, United \n     States Code, authorizing hearings or rehearings en banc, \n     shall be applicable only to the regional divisions of the \n     court and not to the court of appeals as a whole. After a \n     divisional plan is in effect, the court of appeals shall not \n     order any hearing or rehearing en banc, and the authorization \n     for a limited en banc procedure under section 6 of Public Law \n     95-486 (92 Stat. 1633), shall not apply to the Ninth Circuit. \n     An en banc proceeding ordered before the divisional plan is \n     in effect may be heard and determined in accordance with \n     applicable rules of appellate procedure.\n       (d) Clerks and Employees.--Section 711 of title 28, United \n     States Code, shall apply to the Ninth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals, except the clerk of the Ninth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals may maintain an office or offices in each regional \n     division of the court to provide services of the clerk's \n     office for that division.\n       (e) Study of Effectiveness.--The Federal Judicial Center \n     shall conduct a study of the effectiveness and efficiency of \n     the divisions in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. No later \n     than 3 years after the effective date of this Act, the \n     Federal Judicial Center shall submit to the Judicial \n     Conference of the\n\n[[Page S744]]\n\n     United States a report summarizing the activities of the \n     divisions, including the Circuit Division, and evaluating the \n     effectiveness and efficiency of the divisional structure. The \n     Judicial Conference shall submit recommendations to Congress \n     concerning the divisional structure and whether the structure \n     should be continued with or without modification.\n\n     SEC. 2. ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES; PANELS; EN BANC PROCEEDINGS; \n                   DIVISIONS; QUORUM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 46 of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 46. Assignment of judges; panels; en banc proceedings; \n       divisions; quorum\n\n       ``(a) Circuit judges shall sit on the court of appeals and \n     its panels in such order and at such times as the court \n     directs.\n       ``(b) Unless otherwise provided by rule of court, a court \n     of appeals or any regional division thereof shall consider \n     and decide cases and controversies through panels of 3 \n     judges, at least 2 of whom shall be judges of the court, \n     unless such judges cannot sit because recused or \n     disqualified, or unless the chief judge of that court \n     certifies that there is an emergency including, but not \n     limited to, the unavailability of a judge of the court \n     because of illness. A court may provide by rule for the \n     disposition of appeals through panels consisting of 2 judges, \n     both of whom shall be judges of the court. Panels of the \n     court shall sit at times and places and hear the cases and \n     controversies assigned as the court directs. The United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall \n     determine by rule a procedure for the rotation of judges from \n     panel-to-panel to ensure that all of the judges sit on a \n     representative cross section of the cases heard and, \n     notwithstanding the first sentence of this subsection, may \n     determine by rule the number of judges, not less than 2, who \n     constitute a panel.\n       ``(c) Notwithstanding subsection (b), a majority of the \n     judges of a court of appeals not organized into divisions as \n     provided in subsection (d) who are in regular active service \n     may order a hearing or rehearing before the court en banc. A \n     court en banc shall consist of all circuit judges in regular \n     active service, except that any senior circuit judge of the \n     circuit shall be eligible to participate, at that judge's \n     election and upon designation and assignment pursuant to \n     section 294(c) and the rules of the circuit, as a member of \n     an en banc court reviewing a decision of a panel of which \n     such judge was a member.\n       ``(d)(1) A court of appeals having more than 15 authorized \n     judgeships may organize itself into 2 or more adjudicative \n     divisions, with each judge of the court assigned to a \n     specific division, either for a specified term of years or \n     indefinitely. The court's docket shall be allocated among the \n     divisions in accordance with a plan adopted by the court, and \n     each division shall have exclusive appellate jurisdiction \n     over the appeals assigned to it. The presiding judge of each \n     division shall be determined from among the judges of the \n     division in active status as though the division were the \n     court of appeals, except the chief judge of the circuit shall \n     not serve at the same time as the presiding judge of a \n     division.\n       ``(2) When organizing itself into divisions, a court of \n     appeals shall establish a circuit division, consisting of the \n     chief judge and additional circuit judges in active status, \n     selected in accordance with rules adopted by the court, so as \n     to make an odd number of judges but not more than 13.\n       ``(3) The circuit division shall have jurisdiction to \n     review, and to affirm, reverse, or modify any final decision \n     rendered in any of the court's divisions that conflicts on an \n     issue of law with a decision in another division of the \n     court. The exercise of such jurisdiction shall be within the \n     discretion of the circuit division and may be invoked by \n     application for review by a party to the case, setting forth \n     succinctly the issue of law as to which there is a conflict \n     in the decisions of 2 or more divisions. The circuit division \n     may review the decision of a panel within a division only if \n     en banc review of the decision has been sought and denied by \n     the division.\n       ``(4) The circuit division shall consider and decide cases \n     through procedures adopted by the court of appeals for the \n     expeditious and inexpensive conduct of the circuit division's \n     business. The circuit division shall not function through \n     panels. The circuit division shall decide issues of law on \n     the basis of the opinions, briefs, and records in the \n     conflicting decisions under review, unless the division \n     determines that special circumstances make additional \n     briefing or oral argument necessary.\n       ``(e) This section shall apply to each division of a court \n     that is organized into divisions as though the division were \n     the court of appeals.

DISTRICT COURT APPELLATE PANELS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 5 of title 28, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding after section 144 the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 145. District Court Appellate Panels\n\n       ``(a) The judicial council of each circuit may establish a \n     district court appellate panel service composed of district \n     judges of the circuit, in either active or senior status, who \n     are assigned by the judicial council to hear and determine \n     appeals in accordance with subsection (b). Judges assigned to \n     the district court appellate panel service may continue to \n     perform other judicial duties.\n       ``(b) An appeal heard under this section shall be heard by \n     a panel composed of 2 district judges assigned to the \n     district court appellate panel service, and 1 circuit judge \n     as designated by the chief judge of the circuit. The circuit \n     judge shall preside. A district judge serving on an appellate \n     panel shall not participate in the review of decisions of the \n     district court to which the judge has been appointed. The \n     clerk of the court of appeals shall serve as the clerk of the \n     district court appellate panels. A district court appellate \n     panel may sit at any place within the circuit, pursuant to \n     rules promulgated by the judicial council, to hear and decide \n     cases, for the convenience of parties and counsel.\n       ``(c) In establishing a district court appellate panel \n     service, the judicial council shall specify the categories or \n     types of cases over which district court appellate panels \n     shall have appellate jurisdiction. In such cases specified by \n     the judicial council as appropriate for assignment to \n     district court appellate panels, and notwithstanding sections \n     1291 and 1292, the appellate panel shall have exclusive \n     jurisdiction over district court decisions and may exercise \n     all of the authority otherwise vested in the court of appeals \n     under sections 1291, 1292, 1651, and 2106. A district court \n     appellate panel may transfer a case within its jurisdiction \n     to the court of appeals if the panel determines that \n     disposition of the case involves a question of law that \n     should be determined by the court of appeals. The court of \n     appeals shall thereupon assume jurisdiction over the case for \n     all purposes.\n       ``(d) Final decisions of district court appellate panels \n     may be reviewed by the court of appeals, in its discretion. A \n     party seeking review shall file a petition for leave to \n     appeal in the court of appeals, which that court may grant or \n     deny in its discretion. If a court of appeals is organized \n     into adjudicative divisions, review of a district court \n     appellate panel decision shall be in the division to which an \n     appeal would have been taken from the district court had \n     there been no district court appellate panel.\n       ``(e) Procedures governing review in district court \n     appellate panels and the discretionary review of such panels \n     in the court of appeals shall be in accordance with rules \n     promulgated by the court of appeals.\n       ``(f) After a judicial council of a circuit makes an order \n     establishing a district court appellate panel service, the \n     chief judge of the circuit may request the Chief Justice of \n     the United States to assign 1 or more district judges from \n     another circuit to serve on a district court appellate panel, \n     if the chief judge determines there is a need for such \n     judges.

The path of destruction that this atmospheric \n     phenomenon left in the cities and rural areas is \n     unprecedented in our recent history. The damages to the \n     infrastructure, housing and economic development have only \n     begun to be calculated and already surpass billions of \n     dollars. Undoubtedly, it will take months to replace the \n     material damages caused by this traumatic event.\n       However, on this difficult moment for Puerto Rico, its has \n     been a source of hope and inspiration for everybody that the \n     Federal Government, by orders and the direct and decisive \n     intervention of Honorable William J. Clinton, President of \n     the United States of America, has responded with compassion, \n     quickness, promptitude and praiseworthy efficiency to the \n     petition for aid made by Governor Pedro J. Rossello on behalf \n     of the People of Puerto Rico. The effects of ``Georges'' had \n     barely stopped being felt over the territory of Puerto Rico, \n     when President Clinton had already declared the Island a \n     major disaster area. Due to the fact that we Puerto Ricans \n     are U.S. citizens, the Island is eligible to receive millions \n     of dollars in immediate aid from the Federal Government. This \n     aid has been initially channeled through the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), agency which immediately \n     sent dozens of its employees and officials to promptly begin \n     evaluating the damages and the distribution of aid.\n       The presidential declaration of disaster area, effective on \n     September 24, 1998, was followed by visible manifestations \n     and messages of concern and support to the residents of \n     Puerto Rico, as well as the immediate envoy to Puerto Rico of \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Andrew \n     Cuomo, and of the administrator of the Small Business \n     Administration (SBA), Aida Alvarez, in order to prepare and \n     submit to the President a detailed report of the damages. In \n     addition, he designated a Presidential Commission composed of \n     such federal officials and by the White House aide for Puerto \n     Rico affairs and co-chair of the Interagency Working Group on \n     Puerto Rico, Jeffrey Farrow, led by the First Lady of the \n     United States of America, Hillary Rodham Clinton. This \n     Commission traveled to Puerto Rico and its members were able \n     to personally examine on September 29, the damages caused by \n     the hurricane when they flew over and visited many affected \n     localities including the municipalities of Luquillo and \n     Guayama.\n       Among the aid authorized by President Clinton for Puerto \n     Rico as the result of the visit of the First Lady, in \n     addition to other aid authorized by law, came: the shipment \n     of two hundred thousand (200,000) gallons of water and one \n     hundred thousand (100,000) pounds of ice daily to Puerto \n     Rico; the allocation of thirty million dollars \n     ($30,000,000.00) to create temporary jobs for displaced \n     workers as a result of the hurricane; the allocation of \n     thirty nine million dollars ($39,000,000.00) for the \n     reconstruction of public housing units; five million dollars \n     ($5,000,000.00) for cleaning up roads and rebuilding bridges \n     that give access to remote areas; and a special program of \n     one hundred percent (100%) financing for owners who lost \n     their homes, sponsored by the Federal Housing Agency.\n       The personal interest taken by President Clinton regarding \n     the emergency caused by Hurricane ``Georges'' in Puerto Rico \n     and the rapid, agile and efficient response given by the \n     Federal Government to this situation, evidenced by the \n     mobilization of personnel and resources of the federal \n     agencies, by the presence in the island of important federal \n     officials and members of Congress, and the massive allocation \n     of funds and resources to help the victims of the hurricane, \n     have visibly helped the People of Puerto Rico to recover \n     their courage and hope after their sensible losses suffered.\n       The Senate of Puerto Rico recognizes and thanks the \n     Honorable William J. Clinton, President of the United States \n     of America, for his work on behalf of the People of Puerto \n     Rico on this difficult moment.\n  Be it resolved by the Senate of Puerto Rico:\n       Section 1.--Express to the Honorable William J. Clinton, \n     President of the United States of America, its recognition \n     for the agile, prompt and efficient manner in which he \n     responded to the petition for federal aid made by the \n     Government of Puerto Rico as the result of the emergency \n     caused by Hurricane ``Georges'', that hit the island on \n     September 21 and 22, 1998 and for the rapid declaration and \n     mobilization of Federal Government resources and officials to \n     attend to the damages caused by the Hurricane in Puerto Rico.\n       Section 2.--This Resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     William J. Clinton, President of the United States of \n     America.\n       Section 3.--The Office of the Clerk is instructed to remit \n     a copy of this Resolution to the Clerk of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives and to the Secretary of the U.S. Senate for \n     distribution to the members of their respective bodies.\n       Section 4.--This Resolution shall take effect immediately \n     after its approval.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-5. A resolution adopted by the House of the Legislature \n     of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 513\n\n       Whereas, The Delaware River represents one of \n     Pennsylvania's and one of the nation's most important water \n     resources, serving as a water supply for 17 million persons \n     in the states of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and \n     Delaware; and\n       Whereas, The Delaware River is an interstate stream forming \n     the boundary between states for its entire length of 330 \n     miles; and\n       Whereas, Two major sections of the Delaware River have been \n     designated under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act; and\n       Whereas, The remaining section of the Delaware River has \n     been studied and is now in the process of being designated \n     under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act; and\n       Whereas, The Delaware River and the Pennsylvania \n     tributaries serve as a major recreational facility for the \n     large population of the New York/Philadelphia Metropolian \n     Areas; and\n       Whereas, The Congress of the United States created the \n     Delaware River Basin Compact (Compact) in recognition of the \n     need to coordinate the efforts of the four states and Federal \n     agencies and to establish a management system to oversee the \n     use of water and related natural resources of the Delaware \n     River Basin; and\n       Whereas, The Compact was enacted by the legislatures of New \n     York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware and by Congress \n     and was signed into law on September 27, 1961, to provide a \n     mechanism to guide the conservation, development and \n     administration of water resources of the river basin; and\n       Whereas, The Compact established the Delaware River Basin \n     Commission (Commission) as the agency to coordinate the water \n     resources efforts of the four states and the Federal \n     Government and provided the Commission with authority for \n     management and protection of flood plains, water supplies, \n     water quality, watersheds, recreation, fish and wildlife and \n     cultural, visual and other amenities; and\n       Whereas, The Commission has provided for equitable \n     treatment of all parties without regards to political \n     boundary; and\n       Whereas, The Commission includes both the Delaware River \n     and Delaware Bay, which serve the port of Philadelphia, a \n     port that handles the largest volume of petroleum of all \n     United States ports; and\n       Whereas, Sections 3.3 and 3.4 of the Compact specifically \n     provide for the Commission, with the consent of the parties \n     in the matter of state of New Jersey v. state of New York et \n     al. 347 U.S. 995 (1954) to apportion the water to and among \n     the states; and\n       Whereas, The Commission has successfully negotiated all \n     disputes or conflicts between parties without any appeal to \n     the United States Supreme Court; and\n       Whereas, Section 13.3 of the Compact calls for the adoption \n     and apportionment of the Commission's annual expense budget \n     among the signatory parties to the Compact; and\n       Whereas, The United States is a duly constituted signatory \n     party to the Compact; and\n       Whereas, In fiscal years 1996, 1997 and 1998, the \n     Commission duly submitted its approved budgets to the \n     President's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and \n     Congress; and\n       Whereas, The Federal Government failed to provide full \n     funding in fiscal year 1996 and failed to provide any funding \n     in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 for the Commission's current \n     expense budget and has, therefore, not met the funding \n     requirement of section 13.3 of the Compact; and\n       Whereas, The Commission also has adopted and duly submitted \n     to OMB a current expense budget for fiscal year 1999 that \n     includes an apportionment for the Federal Government in the \n     amount of no dollars; and\n       Whereas, The fair share apportionment of the Commission's \n     annual expense budget for the Federal Government for fiscal \n     year 1999 is $628,000; and\n       Whereas, The cumulative shortfall of Federal funding for \n     the Commission since fiscal year 1996 is $1.716 million; and\n       Whereas, The Commission pays the Federal Government \n     approximately $1.3 million per year to purchase storage in \n     the Blue Marsh and Beltzville multipurpose reservoirs; and\n       Whereas, The Commission is the agent of Congress in the \n     allocation of the waters of the basin among the signatory \n     states; and\n       Whereas, The Commission, through its regulations and \n     programs, protects interstate waters and the Delaware Bay and \n     provides a forum for the prevention and settlement of \n     interstate disputes that arise over the use of interstate \n     waters; and\n       Whereas, Through these interstate functions and many other \n     programs and activities, such as the coordination of the \n     basin flood and drought forecasting and warning system, the \n     Commission saves the Federal Government time, resources and \n     money, thus advancing the welfare of the nation; therefore be \n     it\n\n[[Page S748]]\n\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of Pennsylvania \n     memorialize the President of the United States and Congress \n     to provide the Commission with funding in an amount equal to \n     what is owed for the Federal Government's share of the \n     Commission's operating budgets for fiscal years 1996, 1997, \n     1998 and 1999; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of Pennsylvania \n     memorialize the President of the United States and Congress \n     to fulfill the Federal Government's obligation under the \n     Delaware River Basin Compact to annually contribute the \n     apportioned share of the Commission's future operating \n     budgets; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, to the presiding officers \n     of each house of Congress and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-6. A resolution adopted by the House of the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 361\n\n       Whereas, In 1996, Congress enacted a provision that \n     requires the United States Department of Health and Human \n     Services to develop a computerized system of keeping track of \n     the health history of every American. This electronic code \n     represents the first national identification system since \n     Social Security was initiated more than sixty years ago; and\n       Whereas, The national health identifier is designed to \n     increase the information available to medical care \n     professionals, public health officials and the scientific \n     community for research purposes. One of the proposed ideas to \n     implement this is to use Social Security numbers. Proponents \n     of the national health identifier believe that the \n     information will benefit billing systems, streamline \n     treatment, and generally assist in the development of \n     national disease data bases, which could help research \n     efforts. While many of these worthy goals may result from an \n     electronic file on each person, there are grave concerns for \n     abuse resulting from the information; and\n       Whereas, Most people find little consolation in assurances \n     that information compiled through the national health \n     identifier would remain confidential. New reports of hackers \n     breaking into various computer systems--even top security \n     computers at the Pentagon--provide ample justification for \n     skepticism. Every person's personal health history must \n     remain private, Insurers, employers, and any number of groups \n     could abuse the information in many ways; and\n       Whereas, It is significant to note that, when this \n     provision was added to omnibus legislation in 1996, few \n     people understood the ramifications of the policy and its \n     potential threat to personal privacy. Many members of \n     Congress acknowledge that they had no awareness that the \n     measure included this mandate; and\n       Whereas, The Michigan House of Representatives has \n     requested that Congress rescind the requirement for Social \n     Security numbers to be included on applications for various \n     state licenses; and\n       Whereas, Clearly, the potential for damage to people far \n     outweights the advantages to research or the convenience to \n     insurance companies, now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to rescind its \n     mandate that the United State Department of Health and Human \n     Services develop a national health identifier to track the \n     health history of every American. We also urge Congress to \n     restrict the use of Social Security numbers to the purposes \n     of Social Security and uses permitted by law; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-7.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of California; to the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 48\n\n       Whereas, The federal Health Insurance Portability and \n     Accountability Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-191) authorized eligible \n     individuals to claim a deduction from gross income subject to \n     federal income taxes for amounts deposited during the taxable \n     year to a medical savings account; and\n       Whereas, The Legislature provided conformity to that law \n     under the Personal Income Tax Law by approving Chapter 954 of \n     the Statutes of 1996; and\n       Whereas, The federal law contains a ``cut-off year'' which \n     prohibits the deduction of contributions by otherwise \n     eligible individuals after that cut-off year unless the \n     individual had already established a medical savings account \n     or became covered under a high deductible health plan as an \n     employee of a medical savings account participating employer; \n     and\n       Whereas, The cut-off year is calendar year 2000, or sooner \n     if the number of participants in medical savings accounts \n     exceeds a certain number determined by a formula under the \n     federal law; and\n       Whereas, Health insurance, generally, may not be purchased \n     with amounts deposited in a medical savings account; and\n       Whereas, Health insurance premiums are not otherwise \n     deductible by individuals; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly, and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California respectfully memorializes the President and the \n     Congress of the United States to remove the limitation on the \n     number of persons who may have a medical savings account, to \n     permit funds in a medical savings account to be used to pay \n     premiums on any employee's health care medical plan or \n     provide that those health care plan premiums be otherwise \n     deductible, and to make the medical saving account provisions \n     permanent; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the President pro Tempore of the Senate, and \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n       POM-9.

Over the past century, the growth of this key \n     industry has constituted a remarkable chapter in our history \n     and our heritage. From the infancy of automobiles in Michigan \n     to the industry's role during war, the process of \n     manufacturing automobiles has meant more to our country than \n     can be measured by economic statistics alone; and\n       Whereas, In an effort to recognize and preserve the \n     cultural heritage of the automobile industry, interested \n     citizens and organizations are working with members of \n     Congress to establish a program to establish an automobile \n     heritage area. The automobile heritage area would join the \n     heritage areas already established in our country and \n     maintained in conjunction with the National Park Service; and\n       Whereas, Two bills have been introduced in Congress to \n     provide for the Automobile National Heritage Area. These \n     measures, H.R. 3910 and S. 2104, would extend the program to \n     corridors in the state with unique roles in Michigan's \n     automobile history, including not only the metropolitan \n     Detroit region, but also locations in Flint and Lansing; and\n       Whereas, There are presently sixteen heritage areas \n     throughout the country. These help to preserve the history of \n     the textile industry in Massachusetts, the role of the canals \n     and other waterways in our nation's development, and several \n     other unique components of America's past. The automobile \n     industry certainly is an appropriate addition to this effort \n     to save our cultural heritage; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact the \n     Automobile National Heritage Area Act; and be it further\n\n[[Page S749]]\n\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n       POM-10.

More and \n     more citizens work out of their homes. In addition to the \n     obvious influence of computers, people are choosing to work \n     at home to care for children and aging parents as well; and\n       Whereas, Under current law, expenses of maintaining a home \n     office can be deducted from income for federal tax purposes \n     only if an office is used exclusively for business. There are \n     also stringent record-keeping requirements. These \n     restrictions can place people working at home at a severe \n     disadvantage in the marketplace. The current status also \n     likely stifles the initiative of some entrepreneurs; and\n       Whereas, Government policies should encourage citizens to \n     be responsible to their families and should not hinder \n     efforts to increase productivity. Public policy must keep \n     pace with the changes that are taking place in how Americans \n     live and work. The models upon which the tax status of the \n     home office was based do not reflect today's working world; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to amend the Internal Revenue Code to \n     remove the requirement that a home office must be used \n     exclusively for business in order to be eligible for any tax \n     deduction; and be if further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n       POM-11.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 76\n\n       Whereas, The Republic of Cyprus has been illegally divided \n     and occupied by Turkish forces since 1974 in violation of \n     United Nations resolutions; and\n       Whereas, The international community and the United States \n     government have repeatedly called for the speedy withdrawal \n     of all foreign troops from the territory of Cyprus; and\n       Whereas, There are internationally acceptable means to \n     resolve the situation in Cyprus, including the proposal for \n     the demilitarization of Cyprus and the establishment of a \n     multinational force to ensure the security of both the Greek \n     and Turkish communities in Cyprus, which has been endorsed by \n     the international community including the United States \n     government; and\n       Whereas, It is recognized that the prospect of Cyprus \n     accession to the European Union will serve as a catalyst for \n     resolving the situation in Cyprus; and\n       Whereas, A peaceful, just, and lasting solution to the \n     Cyprus problem would greatly benefit the security and the \n     political, economic, and social well-being of all Cypriots, \n     as well as contribute to improved relations between Greece \n     and Turkey; and\n       Whereas, The United Nations has repeatedly stated the \n     parameters for such a solution, most recently in United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1092, adopted on December \n     23, 1996, with United States support; and\n       Whereas, In spite of unsuccessful high level meetings in \n     1997 and the United States led mediation efforts in May 1998, \n     the situation has led to a stalemate in the efforts of the \n     international community to reach a Cyprus settlement; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the solution of the situation in \n     Cyprus must be based on the parameters and principles set \n     forth in House Concurrent Resolution No. 81 and Senate \n     Concurrent Resolution No. 41 both of the 105th Congress and \n     the aforementioned United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1092, regarding the situation in Cyprus; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, call the United States to continue their \n     active support in finding a just, viable, and lasting \n     solution to the Cyprus problem within the United Nations \n     framework and according to the said parameters; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and to each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/20/senate-section/article/S746-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S749-S750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Thurmond, \n             Mr. Abraham, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Ashcroft):\n       S. 254.

Mr. President, I am proud today to introduce the Violent \nand Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of \n1999. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Sessions, the distinguished \nchairman of the Youth Violence Subcommittee, as well as Senator DeWine.\n  There are few issues that will come before the Senate this year that \ntouch the lives of more of our fellow Americans than our national \nresponse to juvenile crime. Crime and delinquency among juveniles is a \nproblem that troubles us in our neighborhoods, schools and parks. It is \nthe subject across the dinner table, and in those late night, worried \nconversations all parents have had at one time or another. The subject \nis familiar--how can we prevent our children from falling victim--\neither to crime committed by another juvenile, or to the lure of drugs, \ncrime, and gangs.\n  Their concerns should be our concerns. The sad reality is that we can \nno longer sit silently by as children kill children, as teenagers \ncommit truly heinous offenses, as our juvenile drug abuse rate \ncontinues to climb. In 1997, juveniles accounted for nearly one fifth--\n18.7 percent--of all criminal arrests in the United States. Persons \nunder 18 committed 13.5 percent of all murders, over 17 percent of all \nrapes, nearly 30 percent of all robberies, and 50 percent of all \narsons.\n  In 1997, 183 juveniles under 15 were arrested for murder. Juveniles \nunder 15 were responsible for 6.5 percent of all rapes, 14 percent of \nall burglaries, and one third of all arsons. And, unbelievably, \njuveniles under 15--who are not old enough to legally drive in any \nstate--in 1997 were responsible for 10.3 percent of all auto thefts.\n  To put this in some context, consider this: in 1997, youngsters age \n15 to 19, who are only 7 percent of the population, committed 22.2 \npercent of all crimes, 21.4 percent of violent crimes, and 32 percent \nof property crimes.\n  And although there are endless statistics on our growing juvenile \ncrime problem, one particularly sobering fact is that, between 1985 and \n1993, the number of murder cases involving 15-year olds increased 207 \npercent. We have kids involved in murder before they can even drive.\n\n  Even my state of Utah has not been immune from these trends. Indeed, \na 1997 study by Brigham Young University Professor Richard Johnson \nfound that Utah's juvenile arrest rate is the highest in the nation. \nAdditionally, as an indication of the increasingly serious nature of \njuvenile offenses in Utah, between 1990 and 1996 the number of \njuveniles sentenced to youth corrections increased 142 percent, and the \nnumber of juveniles requiring detention in a secure facility more than \ndoubled. And in 1995, the average Utah juvenile offender had \naccumulated an astonishing average of 23 misdemeanors, 8 felony \nconvictions, and 2.4 status offense convictions before being sentenced \nto a secure youth facility.\n  In short, our juvenile crime problem has taken a new and sinister \ndirection. But cold statistics alone cannot tell the whole story. Crime \nhas real effects on the lives of real people. Last fall, I read an \narticle in the Richmond Times-Dispatch by my good friend, crime \nnovelist Patricia Cornwell. It is one of the finest pieces I have read \non the effects of and solutions to our juvenile crime problem.\n  Let me share with my colleagues some of what Ms. Cornwell, who has \nspent the better part of her adult life studying and observing crime \nand its effects, has to say. She says ``when a person is touched by \nviolence, the fabric of civility is forever rent, or ripped, or \nbreached . . .'' This is a graphic but accurate description. Countless \nlives can be ruined by a single violent crime. There is, of course, the \nvictim, who may be dead, or scarred for life. There are the family and \nfriends of the victim, who are traumatized as well, and who must live \nwith the loss of a loved one. Society itself is harmed, when each of us \nis a little more frightened to walk on our streets at night, to use an \nATM, or to jog or bike in our parks. And, yes, there is the offender \nwho has chosen to throw his or her life away. Particularly when the \noffender is a juvenile, family, friends, and society are made poorer \nfor the waste of potential in every human being. One crime, but \npermanent effects when ``the fabric of civility is rent.''\n  This is the reality that has driven me to work for the last three \nyears to address this issue. In this effort, I have been joined by a \nbipartisan majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which last \nCongress reported comprehensive legislation on a bipartisan,\n\n[[Page S751]]\n\ntwo to one vote. Indeed, among members of the Youth Violence \nSubcommittee, the vote was seven to two in favor of the bill.\n  The Judiciary Committee's legislation last Congress would have \nfundamentally reformed the role played by the federal government in \naddressing juvenile crime in our Nation. It was supported by law \nenforcement organizations such as the Fraternal Order of Police, the \nNational Sheriffs Association, and the National Troopers Coalition, as \nwell as the support of juvenile justice practitioners such as the \nNational Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, and victim's \ngroups including the National Victims Center and the National \nOrganization for Victims Assistance.\n  The bill we introduce today builds on those efforts. Our reform \nproposal includes the best of what we know works. It combines tough \nmeasures to protect the public from the worst juvenile criminals, smart \nmeasures to provide intervention and correction at the earliest acts of \ndelinquency, and compassionate measures to rehabilitate juvenile \noffenders and to supplement and enhance extensive existing prevention \nprograms to keep juveniles out of the cycle of crime, violence, drugs, \nand gangs.\n   Mr. President, let me spell out in great detail the provisions of \nthis bill, and how it will help reform the juvenile justice system that \nis failing the victims of juvenile crime, failing too many of our young \npeople, and ultimately, failing to protect the public.\n  First, this bill reforms and streamlines the federal juvenile code, \nto responsibly address the handful of cases each year involving \njuveniles who commit crimes under federal jurisdiction. Our bill sets a \nuniform age of 14 for the permissive transfer of juvenile defendants to \nadult court, permits prosecutors and the Attorney General to make the \ndecision whether to charge a juvenile offender as an adult, and permits \nin certain circumstances juveniles charged as an adult to petition the \ncourt to be returned to juvenile status.\n  It also provides that when prosecuted as adults, juveniles in Federal \ncriminal cases will be subject to the same procedures and penalties as \nadults, except for the application of mandatory minimums in most cases. \nOf course, the death penalty would not be available as punishment for \nany offense committed before the juvenile was 18.\n  The bill similarly provides that juveniles tried as adults and \nsentenced to prison must serve their entire sentences, and may not be \nreleased on the basis of attaining their majority, and applies to \njuveniles convicted as adults the same provisions of victim \nrestitution, including mandatory restitution, that apply to adults.\n  Finally, in reforming the federal system, I believe that we must lead \nby example. So our bill provides that the federal criminal records of \njuveniles tried as adults, and the federal delinquency records of \njuveniles adjudicated delinquent for certain serious offenses such as \nmurder, rape, armed robbery, and sexual abuse or assault, will be \ntreated for all purposes in the same manner as the records of adults \nfor the same offenses. Other federal felony juvenile criminal or \ndelinquency records would be treated the same as adult records for \ncriminal justice or national security background check purposes.\n  The bill also permits juvenile federal felony criminal and \ndelinquency records to be provided to schools and colleges under rules \nissued by the Attorney General, provided that recipients of the records \nare held to privacy standards and that the records not be used to \ndetermine admission.\n  Let me assure any who may be concerned that it is not our intent in \nreforming the federal juvenile code to federalize juvenile crime--\nindeed, no conduct that is not a federal crime now will be if this \nreform is enacted. I do not intend or expect a substantial increase in \nthe number of juvenile cases adjudicated or prosecuted in federal \ncourt. It is our intent, rather, to ensure that when there is a federal \ncrime warranting the federal prosecution of a juvenile, the federal \ngovernment assumes its responsibility to deal with it, rather than \nsaddling the states with that burden.\n  Second, at the heart of this bill is an historic reform and \nreauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act \nof 1974, the most comprehensive review of that legislation in 25 years. \nThe States for several years have been far ahead of the Federal \nGovernment in implementing innovative reforms of their juvenile justice \nsystems. For example, between 1992 and 1996, of the 50 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, 48 made substantive changes to their juvenile \njustice systems. Among the trends in State law changes are the removal \nof more serious and violent offenders from the juvenile justice system, \nin favor of criminal court prosecution; new and innovative disposition/\nsentencing options for juveniles; and the revision, in favor of \nopenness, of traditional confidentiality provisions relating to \njuvenile proceedings and records.\n  While the States have been making fundamental changes in their \napproaches to juvenile justice, however, the Federal Government has \nmade no significant change to its approach and has done little to \nencourage State and local reform. Thus, the juvenile justice terrain \nhas shifted beneath the Federal Government, leaving its programs and \npolicies out of step and largely irrelevant to the needs of State and \nlocal governments. This bill corrects this imbalance between State and \nFederal juvenile justice policy, and will help ensure that federal \nprograms support the needs of State and local governments.\n  First, our bill reforms and strengthens the Office of Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) of the Department of \nJustice. The effectiveness of the OJJDP will be enhanced by requiring \nits Administrator to present to Congress annual plans, with measurable \ngoals, to control and prevent youth crime, coordinate all Federal \nprograms relating to controlling and preventing youth crime, and \ndisseminate to States and local governments data on the prevention, \ncorrection and control of juvenile crime and delinquency, and report on \nsuccessful programs and methods.\n  And, most important to state and local governments, in the future, \nOJJDP will serve as a single point of contact for States, localities, \nand private entities to apply for and coordinate all federal assistance \nand programs related to juvenile crime control and delinquency \nprevention. This one-stop-shopping for federal programs and assistance \nwill help state and local governments focus on the problem, instead of \non how to navigate the federal bureaucracy.\n  Second, our reform bill consolidates numerous JJDPA programs, \nincluding Part C Special Emphasis grants, State challenge grants, boot \ncamps, and JJDPA Title V incentive grants, under an enhanced $200 \nmillion per year prevention challenge block grant to the States. The \nbill also reauthorizes the JJDPA Title II Part B State formula grants. \nIn doing so, it also reforms the current core mandates on the States \nrelating to the incarceration of juveniles to ensure the protection of \njuveniles in custody while providing state and local governments with \nneeded flexibility.\n  This flexibility is particularly important to rural states, where \nimmediate access to a juvenile detention facility might be difficult. \nSince many communities cannot afford separate juvenile and adult \nfacilities, law enforcement officers must drive hours to transport \njuvenile offenders to the nearest facility, instead of patrolling the \nstreets. Another unintended consequence of JJDPA is the release of \njuvenile offenders because no beds are available in juvenile facilities \nor because law enforcement officials cannot afford to transport youths \nto juvenile facilities. Juvenile criminals are released even though \nspace is available to detain them in adult facilities. Our reform will \nprovide the states with a degree of flexibility which currently does \nnot exist.\n  However, this flexibility is not provided at the expense of juvenile \ninmate safety. The bill strictly prohibits placing juvenile offenders \nin jail cells with adults. No one supports the placing of children in \ncells with adult offenders. To be clear--nothing in the bill will \nexpose juveniles to any physical contact by adult offenders. Indeed, \nthe legislation is explicit that, if states are to qualify for federal \nfunds, they may not place juvenile delinquents in detention under \nconditions in which the juvenile can have physical contact, much less \nbe physically harmed by, an adult inmate.\n\n[[Page S752]]\n\n  These provisions are largely based on H.R. 1818 from the 105th \nCongress, but are improved to ensure that abuse of juvenile delinquent \ninmates is not permitted by incorporating definitions of what \nconstitutes unacceptable contact between juvenile delinquents and adult \ninmates.\n  Third, and finally, our reform of the JJDPA reauthorizes and \nstrengthens those other parts of the JJDPA that have proven effective. \nFor example, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and \nthe Runaway and Homeless Youth Act are reauthorized and funded. Gang \nprevention programs are reauthorized. And important, successful \nprograms to provide mentoring for young people in trouble with the law \nor at risk of getting into trouble with the law are reauthorized and \nexpanded. Operating through the Cooperative Extension Service program \nsponsored by the Department of Agriculture, the University of Utah has \ndeveloped a ground-breaking and highly successful program that mentors \nto entire families--pairing college age mentors with juveniles in \ntrouble or at risk of getting in trouble with the law, and pairing \nsenior citizen couples with the juvenile's parents and siblings. This \nprogram gets great bang for the buck. So our bill provides \ndemonstration funds to expand this program and replicate its success in \nother states.\n  Finally, our bill provides an important new program to encourage \nstate programs that provide accountability in their juvenile justice \nsystems. All or nearly all of our states have taken great strides in \nreforming their systems, and it is time for the federal government's \nprograms to catch up and provide needed assistance.\n  Despite reforms in recent years, all too often, the juvenile justice \nsystem ignores the minor crimes that lead to the increasingly frequent \nserious and tragic juvenile crimes capturing headlines. Unfortunately, \nmany of these crimes might have been prevented had the warning signs of \nearly acts of delinquency or antisocial behavior been heeded. A \ndelinquent juvenile's critical first brush with the law is a vital \naspect of preventing future crimes, because it teaches an important \nlesson--what behavior will be tolerated. Accountability is not just \nabout punishment--although punishment is frequently needed. It is about \nteaching consequences and providing rehabilitation to youth offenders.\n  According to a recent Department of Justice study, juveniles \nadjudicated for so-called index crimes--such as murder, rape, robbery, \nassault, burglary, and auto theft--began their criminal careers at an \nearly age. The average age for a juvenile committing an index offense \nis 14.5 years, and typically, by age 7, the future criminal is already \nshowing minor behavior problems. If we can intervene early enough, \nhowever, we might avert future tragedies. Our bill provides a new \nJuvenile Accountability Block Grant to reform federal policy that has \nbeen complicit in the system's failure, and provide states with much \nneeded funding for a system of graduated sanctions, including community \nservice for minor crimes, electronically monitored home detention, boot \ncamps, and traditional detention for more serious offenses.\n  And let there be no mistake--detention is needed as well. Our first \npriority should be to keep our communities safe. We simply have to \nensure that violent people are removed from our midst, no matter their \nage. When a juvenile commits an act as heinous as the worst adult \ncrime, he or she is not a kid anymore, and we shouldn't treat them as \nkids.\n  State receipt of the incentive grants would be conditioned on the \nadoption of three core accountability policies: the establishment of \ngraduated sanctions to ensure appropriate correction of juvenile \noffenders, drug testing juvenile offenders upon arrest in appropriate \ncases; and recognition of victims rights and needs in the juvenile \njustice system.\n\n  Meaningful reform also requires that a juvenile's criminal record \nought to be accessible to police, courts, and prosecution, so that we \ncan know who is a repeat or serious offender. Right now, these records \nsimply are not generally available in NCIC, the national system that \ntracks adult criminal records. Thus, if a juvenile commits a string of \nfelony offenses, and no record is kept, the police, prosecutors, judges \nor juries will never know what he did. Maybe for his next offense, \nhe'll get a light sentence or even probation, since it appears he's \ncommitted only one felony in his life instead 10 or 15. Such a system \nmakes no sense, and it doesn't protect the public.\n  So the reform we offer in this bill also provides the first federal \nincentives for the integration of serious juvenile criminal records \ninto the national criminal history database, together with federal \nfunding for the system.\n  Finally, we all recognize the value of education in preventing \njuvenile crime and rehabilitating juvenile offenders. When trouble-\ncausing juveniles remain in regular classrooms, they frequently make it \ndifficult for all other students to learn. Yet, removing such juveniles \nfrom the classroom without addressing their educational needs virtually \nguarantees that they will fall further into the vortex of crime and \ndelinquency. The costs are high--to the juvenile, but also to victims \nand to society. These juveniles too frequently become crime committing \nadults, with all the costs that implies--costs to victims, and the cost \nof incarcerating the offenders to protect the public. So our bill tries \nto break this cycle, by providing a three-year $45 million \ndemonstration project to provide alternative education to juveniles in \ntrouble with or at risk of getting in trouble with the law.\n  The bill we introduce today authorizes significant funding for the \nprograms I have described. In all, our bill authorizes $1 billion per \nyear for 5 years, in the following categories: $450 million per year \nfor Juvenile Accountability Block Grants; $435 million per year for \nprevention programs under the JJDPA, including $200 million for \nJuvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grants, $200 million for Part B \nFormula grant prevention programs, and $35 million for Gangs, Mentoring \nand Discretionary grant programs; $75 million per year for grants to \nstates to upgrade and enhance juvenile felony criminal record histories \nand to make such records available within NCIC, the national criminal \nhistory database used by law enforcement, the courts, and prosecutors; \nand $40 million per year for NIJ research and evaluation of the \neffectiveness of juvenile delinquency prevention programs.\n  Additionally, the bill authorizes $100 million per year for joint \nFederal-State-local law enforcement task forces to address gang crime \nin areas with high concentrations of gang activity. $75 million per \nyear of this funding is authorized for establishment and operation of \nHigh Intensity Interstate Gang Activity Areas, and the remaining $25 \nmillion per year is authorized for community-based prevention and \nintervention for gang members and at-risk youth in gang areas.\n  And, finally, as I have already noted, the bill authorizes $45 \nmillion over 3 years for innovative alternative education programs to \nmake our schools safer places of learning while helping ensure that the \nyouth most at risk do not get left behind.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, let me address a provision in the bill which \nwill prohibit firearms possession by violent juvenile offenders. This \nsection extends the ban in current law on firearm ownership by certain \nfelons to certain juvenile offenders. Juveniles who are adjudicated \ndelinquent for an offense which would be a serious violent felony as \ndefined in 18 U.S.C. 3559(C)(2)(f)(i)--the federal three strikes \nstatute--were the offense committed by an adult will no longer be able \nto legally own firearms. This is common sense. If tried and convicted \nas adults, these criminals would automatically forfeit their right to \nown a gun.\n  However, we should learn our lesson as well from the so-called \ndomestic violence gun ban enacted several years ago. If the offense \nrecords that allow us to know who is covered by the ban are not \navailable, the law is hollow, or worse--it will be enforced only in \narbitrary cases. For this reason, the ban we propose is prospective \nonly, applying only to delinquent acts committed after records of such \noffenses are routinely available within the National Instant Check \nSystem instituted pursuant to the Brady Law.\n  We should also resist seeing this provision as any sort of panacea. \nLaws banning criminals from owning firearms have not stopped them from \ndoing so, for a simple reason--criminals do not respect or obey the \nlaw. So\n\n[[Page S753]]\n\nwhile this provision is an appropriate step, we should be under no \nillusion that it is the answer to our juvenile crime problem.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe that we all agree that it is far better to \nprevent the fabric of civility from being rent than to deal with the \naftermath of juvenile crime. In the face of a confounding problem like \njuvenile crime, it is tempting to look for easy answers. I do not \nbelieve that we should succumb to this temptation. We are faced, I \nbelieve, with a problem which cannot be solved solely by the enactment \nof new criminal prohibitions. It is at its core a moral problem. \nSomehow, too frequently we have failed as a society to pass along to \nthe next generation the moral compass that differentiates right from \nwrong. This cannot be legislated. It will not be restored by the \nenactment of a new law or the implementation of a new program. But it \ncan be achieved by communities working together to teach accountability \nby example and by early intervention when the signs clearly point to \nviolent and antisocial behavior.\n  Mr. President, that is what the bill we introduce is all about. It is \na comprehensive approach to this national problem. I believe that it \nnow is time for the Senate to act. I urge my colleagues to review this \nlegislation, to support it, and to support its early debate and passage \nby the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a bill summary prepared \nby the Judiciary Committee staff and an article by Patricia Cornwell be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      The Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and \n        Rehabilitation Act of 1999--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Attached is a summary of the major provisions of S.   , the \n     Hatch-Sessions Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender \n     Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999, as introduced \n     January 19, 1999.\n       Should you have any questions about the bill not answered \n     by this summary or the Committee Report, please call Mike \n     Kennedy or Rhett DeHart of the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     staff at (202) 224-5225.\n\n\n                           general provisions\n\n       Sec. 1  Short Title, Table of Contents. This section \n     entitles the bill as the ``Violent and Repeat Juvenile \n     Offender Act of 1999'', and provides a table of contents for \n     the bill.\n       Sec. 2  Findings and Purpose. This section provides \n     Congressional findings related to juvenile crime, the \n     juvenile justice system, and the changes needed to reform the \n     juvenile justice system to curb youth violence, ensure \n     accountability by youthful criminals, improve federal \n     juvenile delinquency prevention efforts, and recognize the \n     needs of crime victims.\n       Sec. 3  Severability. This section provides severability \n     for the provisions of the Act.\n\n\n                    title i--juvenile justice reform\n\n       This title reforms the procedures by which juveniles who \n     commit Federal crimes are prosecuted and punished.\n       Sec. 101  Repeal of General Provision. This section repeals \n     the provision establishing the general practice of \n     surrendering to State authorities juveniles arrested for the \n     commission of Federal offenses.\n       Sec. 102  Treatment of Federal Juvenile Offenders. General \n     Provisions: This section gives the U.S. Attorney the \n     discretion to prosecute juveniles age 14 years or older as \n     adults for violations of Federal law which are serious \n     violent felonies or serious drug offenses (as these terms are \n     defined in 18 U.S.C. 3559, the Federal 3-strike statute). \n     Juveniles 14 and older may be prosecuted as adults for any \n     other felony violation of Federal law only with the approval \n     of the Attorney General. If approval is not given, or, for \n     all misdemeanor violations of Federal law, juveniles would be \n     proceeded against as juveniles, or referred to State or \n     tribal authorities. Referral to state or tribal authorities \n     would be presumed in all cases of concurrent state and \n     federal jurisdiction, unless a state refused the case, or an \n     overriding federal interest existed. In the special case of \n     juveniles alleged to have committed a federal offense and who \n     have a prior occasion been tried and convicted as an adult in \n     federal court, waiver to adult status would be automatic.\n       Reverse Waiver Provision: Juveniles 15 and younger charged \n     as an adult for serious violent felonies or serious drug \n     offenses, and juveniles of any age charged as an adult for \n     other felonies, may appeal their waiver to adult status. The \n     juvenile would have 20 days to seek a judicial order \n     returning the juvenile to juvenile status. The prosecutor \n     would be permitted in interlocutory appeal from an adverse \n     ruling, but a juvenile's appeal would be consolidated at the \n     end of the case.\n       Application to Indian Tribes: This section also includes a \n     limited tribal opt-in for Native American juveniles 15 and \n     under when federal jurisdiction is based solely on the \n     commission of the offense on tribal land. A tribal opt-in to \n     federal procedures would be required to prosecute these \n     juveniles as adults, although they could still be adjudicated \n     in federal delinquency proceedings, even in the absence of a \n     tribal opt-in.\n       Procedures: When prosecuted as adults, juveniles in Federal \n     criminal cases would be subject to the same procedures and \n     penalties as adults, including availability of records, open \n     proceedings, and sentencing procedures. Exceptions are \n     provided waiving the application of mandatory minimums to \n     juveniles under age 16 who have no previous serious violent \n     felony or serious drug offense convictions, and barring the \n     availability of the death penalty in any offense committed \n     before the juvenile was 18.\n       This section also provides that juveniles tried as adults \n     and sentenced to prison must serve their entire sentences, \n     and may not be released on the basis of attaining their \n     majority, and applies to juveniles convicted as adults the \n     same provisions of victim restitution, including mandatory \n     restitution, that apply to adults.\n       Sec. 103  Definitions. This section provides definitions \n     for terms used, including new definitions to ensure that \n     juveniles accused or convicted of Federal offenses are \n     separated from adults and to conform the definition of the \n     term ``juvenile'' with the procedural changes made by this \n     title.\n       Sec. 104  Notification after Arrest. This section conforms \n     the requirement, in 18 U.S.C. 5033, that certain persons be \n     notified of the arrest of a juvenile for a Federal crime, \n     with the procedural changes in section 102 of this subtitle, \n     which vests discretion to prosecute juveniles as adults with \n     the U.S. Attorney for the district in the appropriate \n     jurisdiction. This section also provides for the notification \n     of the juveniles' parents or guardians, and prohibits the \n     post-arrest housing of juveniles with adults.\n       Sec. 105  Release and Detention Prior to Disposition. This \n     section provides for pretrial detention juveniles tried as \n     adults on the same basis as adults, and prohibits the \n     pretrial or pre-disposition detention of juveniles with \n     adults.\n       Sec. 106  Speedy Trial. This section extends, from 30 to 70 \n     days, the time in which the trial of a juvenile in detention \n     must be commenced, and applies in juvenile cases the same \n     tolling provisions for such time period that apply in adult \n     prosecutions.\n       Sec. 107  Dispositional Hearings. This section provides for \n     the sentencing of that juveniles found to be delinquent, but \n     not tried as adults. It provides for a hearing on the matter \n     within 40 days of an adjudication of delinquency, and \n     provides for victim allocution at the hearing. The section \n     provides a range of sentencing options to the court, \n     including probation, fines, restitution, and/or imprisonment, \n     and provides that terms of imprisonment may be imposed upon \n     them for the same term as adults, except that such \n     imprisonment must be terminated on the juvenile's 26th \n     birthday. Juveniles sentenced to imprisonment may not be \n     released solely on the basis of attaining their majority.\n       Sec. 108  Use of Juvenile Records. This section provides \n     that the federal criminal records of juveniles tried as \n     adults, and the federal delinquency records of juveniles \n     adjudicated delinquent for certain serious offenses such as \n     murder, rape, armed robbery, and sexual abuse or assault, are \n     to be treated for all purposes in the same manner as the \n     records of adults for the same offenses. Other federal felony \n     juvenile criminal or delinquency records would be treated the \n     same as adult records for criminal justice or national \n     security background check purposes.\n       This section also permits juvenile federal felony juvenile \n     criminal and delinquency records to be provided to schools \n     and colleges under rules issued by the Attorney General, \n     provided that recipients of the records are held to privacy \n     standards and that the records not be used to determine \n     admission.\n       Sec. 109  Implementation of a Sentence for Juvenile \n     Offenders. This section provides for the implementation of a \n     sentence on a delinquent or criminal juvenile and directs the \n     Bureau of Prisons to not confine juveniles in any institution \n     where the juvenile would not be separated from adult inmates.\n       Sec. 110  Magistrate Judge Authority Regarding Juvenile \n     Defendants. This section extends the jurisdiction of Federal \n     magistrate judges to class A misdemeanors involving \n     juveniles; permits magistrate judges to impose terms of \n     imprisonment on juveniles, and conforms the section \n     conferring authority on magistrate judges with the procedural \n     changes made by section 102.\n       Sec. 111  Federal Sentencing Guidelines. This section \n     conforms the Sentencing Reform Act to ensure that the Federal \n     Sentencing Guidelines relating to maximum penalties for \n     violent crimes and serious drug crimes apply to juveniles \n     tried as adults.\n       This section also amends the Sentencing Reform Act to \n     direct the Sentencing Commission to promulgate sentencing \n     guidelines for sentencing juveniles tried as adults in \n     Federal court, and for dispositional hearings (the equivalent \n     of sentencing) for juveniles adjudicated delinquent in the \n     Federal system.\n       Sec. 112  Study and Report on Indian Tribal Jurisdiction. \n     This section requires the Attorney General to study and \n     report to the Congress on the capabilities of tribal courts \n     and criminal justice systems relating to the prosecution of \n     juvenile criminals under tribal jurisdiction, and requires \n     the Attorney General to evaluate an expansion of tribal court \n     criminal jurisdiction.\n\n[[Page S754]]\n\n                        title ii--juvenile gangs\n\n       Sec. 201  Solicitation or Recruitment of Persons in \n     Criminal Gang Activity. This section makes the recruitment or \n     solicitation of persons to participate in gang activity \n     subject to a one-year minimum and 10-year maximum penalty, or \n     a fine of up to $250,000. If a minor is recruited or \n     solicited, the minimum penalty is increased to four years. In \n     addition, a person convicted of this crime would have to pay \n     the costs of housing, maintaining, and treating the juvenile \n     until the juvenile reaches the age of 18 years.\n       Sec. 202  Increased Penalties for Using Minors to \n     Distribute Drugs. This section increases the penalties for \n     using minors to distribute controlled substances.\n       Sec. 203  Penalties for Use of Minors in Crimes of \n     Violence. This section increases twofold, and for a second or \n     subsequent offense threefold, the penalties for using minors \n     in the commission of a crime of violence.\n       Sec. 204  Amendment of Sentencing Guidelines With Respect \n     to Body Armor. This section directs the United States \n     Sentencing Commission to provide a minimum two level \n     sentencing enhancement for any defendant committing a Federal \n     crime while wearing body armor.\n       Sec. 205  High Intensity Interstate Gang Activity Areas. \n     This section authorizes the Attorney General to establish \n     joint agency task forces to address gang crime in areas with \n     high concentrations of gang activity. This provision \n     authorizes $100 million per year for this program; $75 \n     million per year is authorized for establishment and \n     operation of High Intensity Interstate Gang Activity Areas, \n     and $25 million per year is authorized for community-based \n     gang prevention and intervention for gang members and at-risk \n     youth in gang areas.\n       Sec. 206  Increasing the Penalty for Using Physical Force \n     to Tamper With Witnesses, Victims, or Informants. This \n     section increases the penalty from a maximum of 10 years' \n     imprisonment to a maximum of 20 years' imprisonment for using \n     or threatening physical force against any person with intent \n     to tamper with a witness, victim, or informant. This section \n     also adds a conspiracy penalty for obstruction of justice \n     offenses involving victims, witnesses, and informants. In \n     addition, this section makes traveling in interstate or \n     foreign commerce to bribe, threaten or intimidate a witness \n     to delay or influence testimony in a State criminal \n     proceeding a violation of the Federal Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. \n     Section 1952.\n\n\n  title iii--juvenile crime control, accountability, and delinquency \n                               prevention\n\n       This title reforms and enhances federal assistance to State \n     and local juvenile crime control and delinquency prevention \n     programs. Subtitle A amends and reauthorizes the Juvenile \n     Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (JJDPA), to \n     provide assistance to States for effective youth crime \n     control and accountability.\n       Sec. 301  Findings; Declaration of Purpose; Definitions. \n     This section rewrites Title I of the JJDPA. It updates and \n     revises the Congressional findings and declaration of purpose \n     contained in the JJDPA to reflect the reality of violent \n     juvenile crime, promote the primacy of accountability in the \n     juvenile justice system, and recognize the rights and needs \n     of victims of juvenile crime. This section also revises and \n     updates the definitions governing the JJDPA.\n       Sec. 302  Juvenile Crime Control and Delinquency \n     Prevention. This section rewrites Title II of the JJDPA. It \n     reforms and renames the current Office of Juvenile Justice \n     and Delinquency Prevention within the Department of Justice, \n     improves services to State and local governments, and reforms \n     and streamlines existing JJDPA grant programs. Among the \n     specific provisions of the rewritten JJDPA Title II:\n       Reforms JJDPA Title II Part A--the Office of Juvenile \n     Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) of the Department \n     of Justice, is renamed the Office of Juvenile Crime Control \n     and Prevention (OJCCP), with an Administrator appointed by \n     the President and confirmed by the Senate. This section also \n     enhances the effectiveness of the OJCCP by requiring the \n     OJCCP Administrator to: present to Congress annual plans, \n     with measurable goals, to control and prevent youth crime; \n     coordinate all Federal programs relating to controlling and \n     preventing youth crime; disseminate to States and local \n     governments data on the prevention, correction and control of \n     juvenile crime and delinquency, and report on successful \n     programs and methods; and serve as a single point of contact \n     for States, localities, and private entities to apply for and \n     coordinate all federal assistance and programs related to \n     juvenile crime control and delinquency prevention.\n       Consolidates numerous JJDPA programs, including Part C \n     Special Emphasis grants, State challenge grants, boot camps, \n     and JJDPA Title V incentive grants, under an enhanced \n     prevention challenge block grant to the States.\n       Reauthorizes the State formula grants under Part B of Title \n     II of the JJDPA:\n       Reforms the 3 current ``core mandates'' on the States \n     relating to the incarceration of juveniles (known as sight \n     and sound separation, jail removal, and status offender \n     mandates,) to ensure the protection of juveniles in custody \n     while providing state and local governments with needed \n     flexibility; provisions are based on H.R. 1818 from the 105th \n     Congress, but to ensure that abuse of juvenile delinquent \n     inmates is not permitted, includes modified definitions from \n     the 105th Congress S. 10 regarding what constitutes contact \n     between juveniles and adults--no prohibited physical contact \n     or sustained oral communication would permitted between \n     juveniles delinquents in detention and adult inmates;\n       Modifies the current ``core mandate'' requiring states to \n     address efforts to reduce the disproportionate number of \n     minorities in juvenile detention in comparison with their \n     proportion to the population at large, to make the language \n     race-neutral and constitutional;\n       The four ``core mandates'' retained in modified form are \n     each enforceable by a 12.5 percent reduction in a State's \n     Part B funding for non-compliance. The Administrator may \n     waive the penalty.\n       Revises JJDPA Title II Part C, to enhance federal research \n     efforts into successful juvenile crime control and \n     delinquency prevention programs; reauthorizes JJDPA Title II \n     Part D Gang prevention programs, and reforms the program to \n     provide an emphasis on the disruption and prosecution of \n     gangs; includes a discretionary prevention grant program \n     designated as Part E of Title II of the JJDPA; retains the \n     current Part G Mentoring program under Title II of the JJDPA, \n     redesignating it as Part F, and adding a pilot program to \n     encourage and develop mentoring programs that focus on the \n     entire family instead of simply the juvenile and which \n     utilize the existing resources and infrastructure of the \n     Cooperative Extension Services of Land Grant Universities; \n     and designates JJDPA Title II Part G for administrative \n     provisions, including: providing rules against use of federal \n     funds for behavior control experimentation, lobbying, or \n     litigation; subjecting JJDPA and Juvenile Accountability \n     Block Grants (in Title III, Subtitle B of this bill) to a \n     religious and charitable non-discrimination provision cross-\n     referenced from the welfare reform law; providing significant \n     funding directly from the Department of Justice for juvenile \n     delinquency prevention and juvenile accountability programs \n     in Indian country; and providing authorizations of \n     appropriations for the JJDPA and the Juvenile Accountability \n     Block Grants, as follows:\n       Authorizes $1 billion per year for five years, under the \n     following formula: $450 million (45%) for Juvenile \n     Accountability Block Grants; $435 million (43.5%) for \n     prevention programs under the JJDPA, including $200 million \n     for Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grants, $200 \n     million for Part B Formula grant prevention programs, and $35 \n     million for Gangs, Mentoring and Discretionary grant \n     programs; $75 million (7.5%) for grants to states to upgrade \n     and enhance juvenile felony criminal record histories and to \n     make such records available within NCIC, the national \n     criminal history database used by law enforcement, the \n     courts, and prosecutors; and $40 million (4%) for NIJ \n     research and evaluation of the effectiveness of juvenile \n     delinquency prevention programs.\n       Sec. 303  Runaway and Homeless Youth. This section reforms \n     the Runaway and Homeless Youth program, and reauthorizes it \n     through FY 2004. The reforms steamline the program, provide \n     for targeting federal assistance to areas with the greatest \n     need, and make numerous technical changes.\n       Sec. 304  National Center for Missing and Exploited \n     Children. This section improves and reauthorizes the Missing \n     and Exploited Children program through FY 2004, providing on-\n     going authorization for grants to the National Center for \n     Missing and Exploited Children.\n       Sec 305.  Transfer of Functions and Savings Provisions. \n     This section provides technical and administrative rules to \n     transfer functions, and to govern the transition from the \n     Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to \n     the Office of Juvenile Crime Control and Prevention.\n\nSubtitle B  Accountability for Juvenile Offenders and Public Protection \n                            Incentive Grants\n\n       Sec. 321  Block Grant Program. Accountability Block Grant: \n     This section establishes an incentive block grant program for \n     States, authorized at $450 million for each of the next five \n     fiscal years, as well as a separate $50 million per year \n     grant program for the upgrade and enhancement of juvenile \n     criminal records. The incentive block grants would fund a \n     variety of programs, such as constructing juvenile offender \n     detention facilities, implementing graduated sanctions \n     programs; fingerprinting or conducting DNA tests on juvenile \n     offenders; establishing record-keeping ability; establishing \n     SHOCAP programs; enforcing truancy laws; and various \n     prevention programs including after-school youth activities, \n     antigang initiatives, literacy programs, and job training \n     programs. Indian tribes receive separate grants under this \n     section.\n       State receipt of the incentive grants would be conditioned \n     on the adoption of three core accountability policies: the \n     establishment of graduated sanctions to ensure appropriate \n     correction of juvenile offenders, drug testing juvenile \n     offenders upon arrest in appropriate cases; and recognition \n     of victims rights and needs in the juvenile justice system.\n       Fifty percent of the funds under the grant program are \n     designated for implementing graduated sanctions or increasing \n     juvenile detention space if needed by the State. Federal the \n     remaining fifty percent can be used for any authorized grant \n     purpose. Detention space construction projects must be funded \n     by not less than fifty percent State or local (i.e., \n     nonfederal grant) money.\n\n[[Page S755]]\n\n       The block grant includes a pass-through requirement \n     intended to provide a formula for local funding that reflects \n     the needs and responsibilities of state and local levels of \n     government. Seventy percent of the funds received by the \n     State under this block grant must be passed through to the \n     local level, unless the state organizes its juvenile justice \n     system exclusively on the State level.\n       Juvenile Records Grants: Criminal and juvenile record \n     improvement grants for the States are authorized to encourage \n     states to treat the records of juveniles who commit and are \n     adjudicated delinquent for the felonies of murder, armed \n     robbery, and sexual assault be treated the same as adult \n     criminal records for the same offenses in the state, and to \n     treat records of juveniles who commit any other felony be \n     treated, for criminal justice purposes only, the same as \n     adult criminal records for the same offenses. Such records \n     would be available interstate within the NCIC system.\n       Sec. 322  Pilot Program to Promote Replication of Recent \n     Successful Juvenile Crime Reduction Strategies. This section \n     authorizes the Attorney General to fund pilot programs to \n     replicate the successful juvenile crime reduction program \n     utilized by Boston, Massachusetts. Pilot program grant \n     recipients would adopt a juvenile crime reduction strategy \n     involving close collaboration among Federal, State, and local \n     law enforcement authorities, and including religious \n     affiliated or fraternal organizations, school officials, \n     social service agencies, and parent or local grass roots \n     organizations. Emphasis would be placed on initiating \n     effective crime prevention programs and tracing firearms \n     seized from crime scenes or offenders in an effort to \n     identify illegal gun traffickers who are supplying weapons to \n     gangs and other criminal enterprises\n       Sec. 323  Repeal of Unnecessary and Duplicative Programs. \n     This section repeals duplicative and wasteful programs \n     enacted as a part of the 1994 crime law, including the Ounce \n     of Prevention Council, the Model Intensive Grant program, the \n     Local Partnership Act, the National Community Economic \n     Partnership, the Urban Recreation and At-Risk Youth Program, \n     and the Family Unity Demonstration Project.\n       Sec. 324  Extension of Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. \n     This section extends the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund, \n     established in the 1994 omnibus crime law, to fund programs \n     authorized by this act.\n       Sec. 325  Reimbursement of States for the Costs of \n     Incarcerating Juvenile Aliens. This section adds juvenile \n     aliens to the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, which \n     provides reimbursement to the States for the costs of \n     incarcerating criminal aliens.\n       Sec. 326  Sense of Congress. This section provides the \n     sense of Congress that States should enact legislation to \n     provide that if an offense that would be a capital offense if \n     committed by an adult is committed by a juvenile between the \n     ages of 10 and 14, the juvenile could, with judicial \n     approval, be tried and punished as an adult, provided the \n     death penalty would not be available in such cases.\n\n      Subtitle C--Alternative Education and Delinquency Prevention\n\n       Sec. 331  Alternative Education. This section amends the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) to provide \n     demonstration grants to state and local education agencies \n     for alternative education in appropriate settings for \n     disruptive or delinquent students, to improve the academic \n     and social performance of these students and to improve the \n     safety and learning environment of regular classrooms. \n     Certain matching amounts required under this program could \n     be made from amounts available to the State or local \n     governments under the JJDPA. Appropriations under the ESEA \n     of $15 million per year for four years are authorized.\n\n\n                   Title IV--Miscellaneous Provisions\n\n                     Subtitle A--General Provisions\n\n       Sec. 401  Prohibition on Firearms Possession by Violent \n     Juvenile Offenders. This section extends the ban on firearm \n     ownership by certain felons to persons who, as juveniles, are \n     adjudicated delinquent for an offense which would be a \n     serious violent felony as defined in 18 U.S.C. \n     3559(c)(2)(F)(i) (the federal three strikes statute), were \n     the offense committed by an adult. The ban is prospective, \n     applying only to delinquent acts committed after records of \n     such offenses are routinely available within the National \n     Instant Check System instituted pursuant to the Brady Law.\n\n                 Subtitle B--Jail-Based Substance Abuse\n\n       Sec. 421  Jail-Based Substance Abuse Treatment Program. \n     This section provides that 10 percent of grants to States for \n     drug treatment in prisons (RSAT grants) should be directed to \n     qualified treatment programs in jails; under current law, \n     these funds are limited to prison treatment. This section \n     also allows RSAT grants to be used to provide post-\n     incarceration substance abuse treatment for former inmates if \n     the Governor certifies to the U.S. Attorney General that the \n     State is providing, and will continue to provide, an adequate \n     level of treatment services to incarcerated inmates.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        When the Fabric Is Rent\n\n                         (By Patricia Cornwell)\n\n       There was a saying in the morgue during those long six \n     years I worked there. When a person is touched by violence, \n     the fabric of civility is forever rent, or ripped or \n     breached, whatever word is most graphic to you.\n       Our country is the most violent one in the free world, and \n     as far as I'm concerned, we are becoming increasingly \n     incompetent in preventing and prosecuting cruel crimes that \n     we foolishly think happen only to others. There was another \n     saying in the morgue. The one thing every dead person had in \n     common in that place was he never thought he'd end up there. \n     He never imagined his name would be penned in black ink in \n     the big black book that is ominously omnipresent on a counter \n     top in the autopsy suite.\n       I have seen hundreds, maybe close to a thousand dead bodies \n     by now, many of them ruined by another person's hands. I \n     return to the morgue at least two or three times a year to \n     painfully remind myself that what I'm writing about is awful \n     and final and real.\n       I suffer from nightmares and don't remember the last time I \n     had a pleasant dream. I have very strong emotional responses \n     to crimes that have nothing to do with me, such as Versace's \n     murder, and more recently, the random shooting deaths of \n     Capitol Police Agent John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut. \n     I can't read sad, scary or violent books. I watched only half \n     of ``Titanic'' because I could not bear its sadness. I \n     stormed out of Ann Rice's ``Interview With A Vampire,'' so \n     furious my hands were shaking because the movie is such an \n     outrageous trivialization and celebration of sexual violence. \n     For me the suffering, the blood, the deaths are real.\n       I'd like to confront Ann Rice with bitemarks and other \n     sadistic wounds that are not special effects. I'd like to \n     sentence Oliver Stone to a month in the morgue, make him sit \n     in the cooler for a while and see what an audience of victims \n     has to say about his films. I'd like O.J. Simpson to have \n     total recall and suffer, go broke, be ostracized, never be \n     allowed on a golf course again. I was in a pub in London when \n     that verdict was read. I'll never forget the amazed faces of \n     a suddenly mute group of beer-drinking Brits, or the shame my \n     friends and I felt because in America it is absolutely true. \n     Justice is blind.\n       Justice has stumbled off the road of truth and fallen \n     headlong into a thicket of subjective verdicts where evidence \n     doesn't count and plea bargains that are such a bargain they \n     are fire sales. I've begun to fear that the consequences and \n     punishment of violent crime have become some sort of mindless \n     multiple choice, a ``Let's Make A Deal,'' a ``Let's microwave \n     the popcorn and watch Court TV.''\n       I have been asked to tell you what my fictional character \n     Dr. Scarpetta would do if she were the crime czar or \n     Virginia, of America. Since she and I share the same opinions \n     and views, I am stepping out from behind my curtain of \n     imagined deeds and characters and telling you what I feel and \n     think.\n       It startles me to realize that at age 42, I have spent \n     almost half my life studying crime, of living and working in \n     it's pitifully cold, smelly, ugly environment. I am often \n     asked why people cheat, rob, stalk, slander, maim and murder. \n     How can anybody enjoy causing another human being or any \n     living creature destruction and pain? I will tell you in \n     three words: Abuse of power. Everything in life is about the \n     power we appropriate for good or destruction, and the \n     ultimate overpowering of a life is to make it suffer and end.\n       This includes children who put on camouflage and get into \n     the family guns. We don't want to believe that 12, 13, 16 \n     year old youths are unredeemable. Most of them aren't. But \n     it's time we face that some of them have transgressed beyond \n     forgiveness, certainly beyond trust. Not all victims I have \n     seen pass through the morgue were savaged by adults. The \n     creative cruelty of some young killers is the worst of the \n     worst, images of what they did to their victims ones I wish I \n     could delete.\n       About a year ago, I began researching juvenile crime for \n     the follow-up of ``Hornet's Next'' (Southern Cross, January, \n     '99) and my tenth Scarpetta book (unfinished and untitled \n     yet). This was a territory I had yet to explore. I was \n     inspired by the depressing fact that in the last ten years, \n     shootings, hold-ups at ATM's, and premeditated murders \n     committed by juveniles have risen 160 percent. As I ventured \n     into my eleventh and twelfth novels, I wondered what my \n     crusading characters would do with violent children.\n       So I spent months in Raleigh watching members of the \n     Governor's Commission on Juvenile Crime and Justice debate \n     and rewrite their juvenile crime laws, as Virginia did in \n     1995 under the leadership of Jim Gilmore. I quizzed Senator \n     Orrin Hatch about his youth violence bill, S. 10, a federal \n     approach to reforming a juvenile justice system that is \n     failing our society. I toured detention homes in Richmond and \n     elsewhere. I sat in on juvenile court cases and talked to \n     inmates who were juveniles when they began their lives of \n     crime.\n       While it is true that many violent juveniles have abuse, \n     neglect, and the absence of values in their homes, I maintain \n     my belief that all people should be held accountable for \n     their actions. Our first priority should be to keep our \n     communities safe. We must remove violent people from our \n     midst, no matter their age. As Marcia Morey, executive \n     director of North Carolina's juvenile crime commission, \n     constantly preaches, ``We must stop the hemorrhage \n     first.''\n       When the trigger is pulled, when the knife is plunged, kids \n     aren't kids anymore. We should not shield and give excuses \n     and probation to violent juveniles who, odds are, will harm \n     or kill again if they are returned to our neighborhoods and \n     schools. We should\n\n[[Page S756]]\n\n     not treat young violent offenders with sealed lips and \n     exclusive proceedings.\n       ``The secrecy and confidentiality of our system have hurt \n     us,'' says Richmond Juvenile and Domestic Relations District \n     Court Judge Kimberly O'Donnell. ``What people can't see and \n     hear is often difficult for them to understand.''\n       Virginia has opened its courtrooms to the public, and Judge \n     O'Donnell encourages people to sit in hers and see for \n     themselves those juveniles who are remorseless and those who \n     can be saved. Most juveniles who end up in court are not \n     repeat offenders. But for that small number who threaten us \n     most, I advocate hard, non-negotiable judgment. Most of what \n     I would like to see is already being done in Virginia. But we \n     need juvenile justice reform nationally, a system that is \n     sensible and consistent from state to state.\n       As it is now, if a juvenile commits a felony in Virginia, \n     when he turns 18 his record is not expunged and will follow \n     him for the rest of his days. But were he to commit the same \n     felony in North Carolina, at 16 he'll be released from a \n     correctional facility with no record of any crime he \n     committed in that state. Let's say he's back on the street \n     and returns to Virginia. Now he's a juvenile again, and \n     police, prosecutors, judges or juries will never know what he \n     did in North Carolina.\n       If he moves to yet another state where the legal age is 21, \n     he can commit felonies for three or four more years and have \n     no record of them, either. Maybe by then he's committed \n     fifteen felonies but is only credited with the one he \n     committed in Virginia. Maybe when he becomes an adult and is \n     violent again, he gets a light sentence or even probation, \n     since it appears he's committed only one felony in his life \n     instead of fifteen. He'll be back among us soon enough. Maybe \n     his next victim will be you.\n       If national juvenile justice reform were up to me, I'd be \n     strict. I would not be popular with extreme child advocates. \n     If I had my way, it would be routine that when any juvenile \n     commits a violent crime, his name and personal life are \n     publicized. Records of juveniles who commit felonies should \n     not be expunged when the individual becomes an adult. Mug \n     shots, fingerprints and the DNA of violent juveniles should, \n     at the very least, be available to police, prosecutors, and \n     schools, and if they young violent offender has an extensive \n     record and commits another crime, plea bargaining should be \n     limited or at least informed.\n       Juveniles who rape, murder or commit other heinous acts \n     should be tried as adults, but judges should have the \n     discretionary power to decide when this is merited. I want to \n     see more court-ordered restitution and mediation. Let's turn \n     off the TV's in correctional centers and force assailants, \n     robbers, thieves to work to pay back what they've destroyed \n     and taken, as much as that is possible. Confront them with \n     their victims, face to face. Perhaps a juvenile might realize \n     the awful deed he's done if his victim is suddenly a person \n     with feelings, loved ones, scars, a name.\n       Prevention is a more popular word than punishment. But the \n     solution to what's happening in our society, particularly to \n     our youths, is simpler and infinitely harder than any \n     federally or privately funded program. All of us live \n     in neighborhoods. Unless you are in solitary confinement \n     or a coma, you are aware of others around you. Quite \n     likely you are exposed to children who are sad, lost, \n     ignored, neglected or abused. Try to help. Do it in \n     person.\n       I remember my first few years in Richmond when I was living \n     at Union Theological Seminary, where my former husband was a \n     student and I was a struggling, somewhat failed writer. \n     Charlie and I spent five years in a seminary apartment \n     complex where there was a little boy who enjoyed throwing a \n     tennis ball against the building in a staccato that was \n     torture to me.\n       I was working on novels nobody wanted and every time that \n     ball thunked against brick, I lost my train of thought. I'd \n     popped out of my chair and fly outside to order the kid to \n     stop, but somehow he was always gone without a trace, silence \n     restored for an hour or two. One day I caught him. I was \n     about to reprimand him when I saw the fear and loneliness in \n     his eyes.\n       ``What's your name?'' I asked.\n       ``Eddie,'' he said.\n       ``How old are you?''\n       ``Ten.''\n       ``It's not a good idea to throw a ball against the \n     building. It makes it hard for some of us to work.''\n       ``I know.'' He shrugged.\n       ``If you know, then why do you do it?''\n       ``Because I have no one to play catch with me,'' he \n     replied.\n       My memory lit up with acts of kindness when I was a lonely \n     child living in the small town of Montreat, North Carolina. \n     Adult neighbors had taken time to play tennis with me. They \n     had invited me, the only girl in town, to play baseball or \n     touch football with the boys.\n       Billy Graham's wife, Ruth, used to stop her car to see how \n     I was or if I needed a ride somewhere. Years later, she \n     befriended me when I was a very confused teenager who felt \n     rather worthless. Were it not for her kindness and \n     encouragement, I doubt I would be writing this editorial. \n     Maybe I wouldn't have amounted to much. Maybe I would have \n     gotten into serious trouble. Maybe I'd be dead.\n       Eddie and I started playing catch. I gave him tennis \n     lessons and probably ruined his backhand for life. He told me \n     all about himself and amused me with his stories. We became \n     pals. He never threw a tennis ball against the building \n     again.\n       We must protect ourselves from all people who have proven \n     to be dangerous. But we should never abandon those who can be \n     helped or are at least are worthy of the effort. If you save \n     or change one life, you have added something priceless to \n     this world. You have left it better than you found it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 255. A bill to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in payments for home \nhealth services provided under the Medicare program, and to improve the \nquality of those home health services; read twice.\n\n\n             HOME HEALTH INTEGRITY PRESERVATION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, earlier today, I introduced the Home \nHealth Integrity Preservation Act of 1999. I am pleased that Senator \nBreaux cosponsored this bill, as he did when we introduced it in the \n105th Congress. This legislation will be an important tool in combating \nthe waste, fraud and abuse that has threatened the integrity of the \nMedicare home health benefit.\n  Although the majority of home health agencies are honest, legitimate, \nbusinesses, it is clear that there have been unscrupulous providers. In \nJuly 1997, the Senate Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, held a \nhearing on this topic. The hearing exposed serious rip-offs of the \nMedicare trust fund, and highlighted areas that need more stringent \noversight.\n  In response to the hearing, Senator Breaux and I followed up with a \nroundtable discussion on home health fraud. The roundtable brought \ntogether key players with a variety of perspectives. Participants \nincluded law enforcement, the Administration, and the home health \nindustry.\n  The roundtable yielded a number of proposals which were shaped into \ndraft legislation and circulated to a wide variety of stakeholders. In \nresponse to comments, the draft was changed to address legitimate \nconcerns that were raised. The result is a balanced piece of \nlegislation that includes important safeguards against fraud and abuse \nof the system, but does not stifle the growth of legitimate providers.\n  The Home Health Integrity Preservation Act of 1999 would do the \nfollowing:\n  It would heighten scrutiny of new home health agencies before they \nenter the Medicare program, and during their early years of Medicare \nparticipation.\n  It would improve standards and screening for home health agencies, \nadministrators and employees.\n  It would require audits of home health agencies whose claims exhibit \nunusual features that may indicate problems, and improve HCFA's ability \nto identify such features.\n  It would require agencies to adopt and implement fraud and abuse \ncompliance programs.\n  It would increase scrutiny of branch offices, business entities \nrelated to home health agencies, and changes in operations.\n  It would make more information on particular home health agencies \navailable to beneficiaries.\n  It would create an interagency Home Health Integrity Task Force, led \nby the Office of the Inspector General of Health and Human Services.\n  It would reform bankruptcy rules to make it harder for all Medicare \nproviders, not just home health agencies, to avoid penalties and \nrepayment obligations by declaring bankruptcy.\n  This legislation is an important step in ensuring that seniors \nmaintain access to high quality home care services rendered by \nreputable providers. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort by \ncosponsoring this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 255\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \npromote the use of universal product numbers on claims forms submitted \nfor reimbursement under the Medicare program; read twice.\n\n\n             medicare universal product number act of 1999\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Breaux and myself, \nI am introducing legislation today to require the use of universal \nproduct numbers (UPNs) for all durable medical equipment (DME) Medicare \npurchases. A similar bipartisan bill was introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Representatives Amo Houghton and Louise Slaughter. \nThe purpose of this legislation is to improve the Health Care Financing \nAdministration's (HCFA) ability to track and to appropriately assess \nthe value of the durable medical equipment it pays for under the \nMedicare program. Very simply, our bill will ensure Medicare gets what \nit pays for.\n  According to a report by the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the \nOffice of Inspector General's review of billing practices for specific \nmedical supplies, the Medicare program is often paying greater than the \nmarket price for durable medical equipment and Medicare beneficiaries \nare not receiving the quality of care they should. HCFA currently does \nnot require DME suppliers to identify specific products on their \nMedicare claims. Therefore it does not know for which products it is \npaying. HCFA's billing codes often cover a broad range of products of \nvarious types, qualities and market prices. For example, the GAO found \nthat one Medicare billing code is used by the industry for more than \n200 different urological catheters, with many of these products varying \nsignificantly in price, use, and quality.\n  Medicare's inability to accurately track and price medical equipment \nand supplies it purchases could be remedied with the use of product \nspecific codes known as ``bar codes'' or ``universal product numbers'' \n(UPNs). These codes are similar to the codes you see on products you \npurchase at the grocery store. Use of such bar codes is already being \nrequired by the Department of Defense and several large private sector \npurchasing groups. The industry strongly supports such an initiative as \nwell. I am submitting several letters of endorsement for the record on \nbehalf of the National Association for Medical Equipment Services, the \nHealth Industry Distributors Association, Premier Inc., and a joint \nletter from industry groups such as the Health Industry Business \nCommunications Council, Healthcare EDI Coalition, Health Industry \nPurchasing Association, and Invacare Corporation.\n  This bill represents a common sense approach. It will improve the way \nMedicare monitors and reimburses suppliers for medical equipment and \nsupplies. Patients will receive better care. And the Federal Government \nwill save money. I ask that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nsupport this legislation which I am introducing today with my friend \nand colleague, Senator Breaux.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and the letters of \nendorsement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 256\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Charles Grassley,\n     Chairman, Special Committee on Aging,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. John Breaux,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Special Committee on Aging, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Grassley and Breaux: We applaud you for \n     introducing the Medicare Universal Product Number Act, which \n     will require the inclusion of universal product numbers \n     (UPNs) on Medicare Part B billings for medical equipment and \n     supplies that are not customized. UPNs are codes that \n     uniquely identify an individual medical product; they are \n     often associated with the bar codes that allow scanners to \n     process them. These codes are a major enabling factor in our \n     efforts to minimize fraudulent billings and to automate the \n     distribution process.\n       The Department of Defense (DoD) and the Veterans \n     Administration have already taken a leadership position in \n     promoting the implementation of the industry standard of \n     UPNs. As a part of the decision to use commercial medical \n     product distributors, the DoD has mandated the use of UPNs \n     for all medical/surgical products delivered to DoD \n     facilities. The VA is prepared to implement a similar \n     requirement this year. Most private sector group purchasing \n     organizations also require the use of UPNs.\n       We believe that the Medicare Program would also benefit \n     greatly from the use of UPNs. By cross-referencing each UPN \n     with the current HCFA Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) \n     and requiring the inclusion of the UPN on each Medicare Part \n     B claim for medical equipment and supplies, Medicare's \n     ability to track utilization and combat fraud and abuse would \n     be greatly enhanced. As UPNs provide a unique, unambiguous \n     means of identifying medical products, Medicare would have an \n     exact record of the specific product used by the beneficiary. \n     For the first time, the Medicare Program could identify \n     precisely what items are being billed. Unusual trends in \n     product utilization and claims for ``suspicious'' items would \n     be easily identifiable. HCPCS alone cannot provide this \n     information, as many products of varying quality and cost are \n     included in a single code.\n       In addition, problems with ``upcoding'' and miscoding could \n     be greatly reduced through the implementation of UPNs. \n     Upcoding occurs when Medicare is intentionally billed under a \n     code that provides a higher reimbursement than the code \n     corresponding to the item that was furnished to the \n     beneficiary. Currently, upcoding is difficult to detect \n     because HCPCS are so inexact. UPNs would correctly identify \n     the specific medical product, thereby making it harder to \n     misrepresent the cost and quality of the product. In \n     addition, by cross-referencing each UPN to the appropriate \n     HCPCS, legitimate confusion about HCFA's current coding \n     system would be alleviated. As the General Accounting Office \n     has reported (GAO/HEHS-98-102), the HCPCS system is \n     needlessly ambiguous.\n       We believe that the Medicare Program and medical products \n     industry would benefit greatly from the use of UPNs. This \n     standard would not only increase Medicare's understanding of \n     what it pays for, but also assist in the effective \n     administration of the Program.\n       Again, thank you for introducing the Medicare Universal \n     Product Number Act.\n           Sincerely,\n       Health Industry Business Communications Council.\n       Healthcare EDI Coalition.\n       Health Industry Distributors Association.\n       Health Industry Group Purchasing Association.\n       National Association for Medical Equipment Services.\n       Invacare Corp.\n       Premier Inc.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          National Association for\n\n\n                                   Medical Equipment Services,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, January 12, 1999.\n     Hon.

John Breaux,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Special Committee on Aging.\n       Dear Senators Grassley and Breaux: As you know, the \n     National Association for Medical Equipment Services (NAMES) \n     was pleased to endorse your bill, The Medicare Universal \n     Product Number Act of 1997, S. 1362 in the 105th Congress. We \n     understand you will re-introduce this bill in substantially \n     the same form in the 106th Congress, and so, in concept, \n     support that legislation.\n       Requiring universal product numbers on home medical \n     equipment for product labeling and billing purposes would \n     accomplish two key objectives. First, it would improve home \n     medical equipment inventory control by creating a unique \n     numbering system that easily permits computerized optical \n     scanning of product information. Second, it would provide \n     third-party payers with more information on equipment \n     characteristics than does the current HCPCS coding system, \n     thus allowing reimbursement rates to be set more \n     appropriately.\n       While equipment manufacturers and retailers would need time \n     to comply with the bill, we note that S. 1362 provided more \n     than two years for compliance to be attained. We look forward \n     to working with you as this bill proceeds through the \n     legislative process.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                     William D.

HIDA \n     is the national trade association of home care companies and \n     medical products distribution firms. Created in 1902, HIDA \n     represents over 700 companies with approximately 2500 \n     locations nationwide. HIDA Members provide value-added \n     distribution services to virtually every hospital, \n     physician's office, nursing facility, clinic, and other \n     health care sites across the country, as well as to a growing \n     number of home care patients.\n       HIDA has long supported the use of UPNs for medical \n     equipment and supplies. By providing a standard, unique \n     identifier for each product, UPNs supply the information \n     needed to minimize fraudulent billings and streamline the \n     health care product distribution process. The Department of \n     Defense (DoD) has already recognized the many benefits \n     resulting from the implementation of the industry standard of \n     UPNs. As a part of their decisions to use commercial medical \n     product distributors, DoD has mandated the use of UPNs for \n     all medical/surgical products delivered to DoD facilities.\n       The Medicare Program could also benefit greatly from the \n     use of UPNs. By using UPNs, the Medicare system would be able \n     to correctly identify the specific items they are paying for, \n     a crucial piece of information that the agency is now \n     missing. As UPNs provide a unique, unambiguous means of \n     identifying each product on the market, Medicare would have \n     an exact record of the specific product used by each \n     beneficiary. Unusual trends in product utilization and claims \n     for ``suspicious'' items would be easily identifiable. The \n     HCFA Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) can not provide \n     this information, because many products of varying quality \n     and cost are included in a single code.\n       In addition, problems with ``upcoding'' and miscoding could \n     be greatly reduced through the implementation of UPNs. \n     Upcoding occurs when Medicare is intentionally billed under a \n     code that provides a higher reimbursement than the code \n     corresponding to the item that was actually furnished to the \n     beneficiary.

Charles Grassley,\n     Hon. John Breaux,\n     U.S. Senate, Special Committee on Aging,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Grassley and Breaux: On behalf of Premier, \n     Inc., the nation's largest healthcare alliance, I am pleased \n     to support the ``Medicare Universal Product Number Act.'' The \n     bill requires the use of universal product numbers (UPNs) for \n     all durable medical equipment Medicare purchases by 2002.\n       Premier represents more than 200 owner hospitals and \n     hospital systems that own or operate 800 healthcare \n     institutions and have purchasing affiliations with another \n     1,100. Premier owners operate hospitals, HMOs and PPOs, \n     skilled nursing facilities, rehabilitation facilities, home \n     health agencies, and physician practices. Through \n     participation in Premier, healthcare leaders can access cost \n     reduction avenues, delivery system development and \n     enhancement strategies, technology management, decision \n     support tools, and a variety of opportunities for networking \n     and knowledge transfer.\n       Premier welcomes federal government leadership in requiring \n     manufacturers to label their products at each unit of \n     inventory with a universal product number by the year 2002. \n     The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) recommended in a May \n     1998 report to Congress that HCFA require suppliers include \n     UPNs on their Medicare claims. This\n\n[[Page S761]]\n\n     requirement will not only aid the Medicare program, but also \n     will help the private sector reduce healthcare costs. A \n     recent study conducted by Efficient Healthcare Consumer \n     Response on improving the efficiency of the healthcare supply \n     chain concluded that $11.6 billion could be saved through \n     automation and integration of the product information stream \n     from point of manufacture to point of use across the \n     industry. UPN is a major component within that potential \n     remarkable savings stream. Therefore, we believe that UPN \n     will become as important to the medical industry as other bar \n     code standards have become to grocery and other retail \n     industries for many years.\n       This bill represents a common sense approach to reducing \n     healhcare costs in the United States. Thank you Senators \n     Grassley and Breaux for your leadership on this issue and we \n     look forward to assisting you with your efforts to enact this \n     legislation into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James L. Scott,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise to commend Senator Grassley for his \nleadership on the important issue of cutting waste, fraud and abuse in \nthe Medicare program. As chairman of the National Bipartisan Commission \non the Future of Medicare, I strongly support our legislation that will \nsave federal dollars by modernizing an outdated and confusing billing \nsystem. The Medicare Universal Product Number Act of 1999 is a \npractical solution which will ensure that the Health Care Financing \nAdministration (HCFA) knows what it is paying for when reimbursing for \ndurable medical equipment (DME) under the Medicare program.\n  Currently, HCFA's billing system uses overly broad and sometimes \noutdated codes. These codes can cover a wide range of products which \nvary in price and quality, making it difficult for HCFA to track and \nprice medical equipment accurately. By using Universal Product Numbers \n(UPNs), which provide a unique, unambiguous means of identifying each \nproduct on the market, HCFA will be able to track utilization more \nefficiently.\n  Because UPNs are unique identifiers, HCFA will be better equipped in \ncombating fraud against the Medicare program. Currently the system is \nvulnerable to a type of fraud called ``upcoding.'' This occurs when \nMedicare is billed for a product under an improper code. Perpetrators \nof fraud can use improper codes to receive higher reimbursement rates \nthen those given for the products which they actually provide. By \ntracking utilization, made possible by UPNs, HCFA will know what \nproduct is provided to the beneficiary and how much that product costs.\n  There is widespread support for the use of UPNs in the Medicare \nprogram. A recent GAO report addresses the need to reform Medicare's \nbilling system. The report found that HCFA ``does not know specifically \nwhat Medicare is paying for when its contractors process claims for'' \nmedical equipment and supplies. The Department of Defense and the \nVeterans' Administration have already begun to require UPNs, as do many \nprivate sector purchasing groups. Moreover, the medical products \nindustry recognizes the value of UPNs and strongly supports this \nlegislation.\n  Medicare's current billing system is vulnerable to abuse. This \nlegislation is a practical approach to help ensure that taxpayer \ndollars are protected and spent wisely. I thank Senator Grassley for \nhis leadership, and I encourage my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 257. A bill to state the policy of the United States regarding the \ndeployment of a missile defense capable of defending the territory of \nthe United States against limited ballistic missile attack; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                  national missile defense act of 1999\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce today we are \nintroducing, again, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999, a bill to \nmake it the policy of the United States to deploy, as soon as \ntechnologically possible, a system to defend the United States against \nlimited ballistic missile attack. I am happy to be joined by my friend, \nthe distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, in introducing this \nbill. And I am pleased that we have just heard that the Secretary of \nDefense has announced that funds will be included in this year's budget \nto pay for deployment of the National Missile Defense System, \nacknowledging that the threat does exist, or soon will. So the \nadministration is changing its policy now, faced with this push that \nwas begun in the last Congress and is culminating now in the \nreintroduction of this legislation.\n  Ballistic missiles are being developed and tested by a growing number \nof nations, some of which are hostile to the United States.\n  Iran has declared itself self-sufficient in missile technology and \nexpertise. It is building a missile system capable of striking Central \nEurope.\n  Last year, North Korea surprised experts with its test of the Taepo \nDong-1, a three-stage missile which, according to published reports, \nmay be capable of reaching Alaska. Last July, the Rumsfeld Commission \nconcluded that the United States may have ``little or no warning'' of \nthe development of intercontinental ballistic missile capability by a \nrogue state.\n  The United States has no defense against long-range ballistic \nmissiles, and administration policy had been limited to development of \na missile defense system and deployment only if a threat developed. Now \nthe threat has become obvious to the administration.\n  I welcome the announcement this morning by the Secretary of Defense \nthat the administration is acknowledging the need to proceed with a \nprogram to develop a missile defense system to meet this threat and to \ndeploy it. The time has come to remove all doubts about the resolve of \nthe United States on this issue. The National Missile Defense Act of \n1999 confirms this resolve as national policy.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Mississippi and now turn to \nthe Senator from Nebraska and yield up to 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the remarks \nof my colleagues here this morning. I also wish to commend my friend, \nthe senior Senator from Mississippi, for reintroducing his defense \ninitiative. Missile defense is as critical a challenge as this country \nfaces, not just for the short term, but for the long term, and I have \nbeen a strong proponent of what Senator Cochran is proposing. I wish, \nagain, to be a cosponsor of that measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Robb):\n  S. 258. A bill to authorize additional rounds of base closures and \nrealignments under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 \nin 2001 and 2003, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n\n\n  legislation to authorize two base realignment and closure rounds to \n                         occur in 2001 and 2003\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nauthorizes two rounds of U.S. military installation realignment and \nclosures to occur in 2001 and 2003. I am pleased to have Senator Levin \nand Senator Robb as cosponsors of this bill.\n  Mr. President, we have heard over the last 4 months of the dire \nsituation of our military forces. We have heard testimony of plunging \nreadiness, modernization programs that are decades behind schedule, and \nquality of life deficiencies that are so great we cannot retain or \nrecruit the personnel we need. As a result of this realization, there \nhas been a groundswell of support in Congress for the Armed Forces, \nincluding a number of pay and retirement initiatives and the promise of \na significant increase in defense spending.\n  All of these proposals are excellent starting points to help re-forge \nour military, but we must not forget that much of it will be in vain if \nthe Department of Defense is obligated to maintain 23 percent excess \ncapacity in infrastructure. When we actually look for the dollars to \npay for these initiatives, it is unconscionable that some would not \nlook to the billions of dollars to be saved by base realignment and \nclosure. Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have stated \nrepeatedly that they desire more opportunities to streamline the \nmilitary's infrastructure. We cannot sit idly by and throw money and \nideas at the problem when part of the solution is staring us in the \nface.\n\n[[Page S762]]\n\n  This proposed legislation offers two significant changes to present \nlaw. First, the process for the first round in 2001 is moved back two \nmonths to ensure there is no conflict of interest with a commission \nnominated under one administration but effectively working under the \ndirection of the follow-on administration. Second, under this \nlegislation, privatization in-place would be permitted only when \nexplicitly recommended by the Commission. Additionally, the Secretary \nof Defense must consider local government input in preparing his list \nof desired base closures.\n  Total BRAC savings realized from the four previous rounds exceed \ntotal costs to date. The annual net savings for previous rounds will \ngrow from almost $3 billion last year to $5.6-7.0 billion per year by \n2001. These savings are real, they are coming sooner, and they are \nestimated to be greater than anticipated.\n  Mr. President, we can continue to maintain a military infrastructure \nthat we do not need, or we can provide the necessary funds to ensure \nour military can fight and win future wars. Every dollar we spend on \nbases we do not need is a dollar we cannot spend on training our \ntroops, keeping personnel quality of life at an appropriate level, \nmaintaining force structure, replacing old weapons systems, and \nadvancing our military technology.\n  We must finish the job we started by authorizing these two final \nrounds of base realignment and closure. I urge my colleagues to join us \nin support of this critical bill and to work diligently throughout the \nyear to put aside local politics for what is clearly in the best \ninterest of our military forces.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 258\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to once again join my \ncolleagues from the Armed Services Committee, Senator McCain and \nSenator\n\n[[Page S763]]\n\nRobb, in introducing this legislation authorizing the Department of \nDefense to close excess, unneeded military bases.\n  For the past two years, Secretary of Defense Cohen has asked the \nCongress to authorize two additional base closure rounds. But Congress \nhas not acted.\n  Secretary Cohen and General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, have repeatedly said we need to close more military bases, \nand I am confident that they will once again ask us to close more bases \nwhen the President's budget is submitted next month.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is intended to start the \ndebate, and I anticipate the administration will make a similar \nlegislative proposal to the Congress.\n  This legislation calls for two additional base closure rounds, in \n2001 and 2003, that would basically follow the same procedures that \nwere used in 1991, 1993 and 1995, with two exceptions.\n  First, the whole process would start and finish two months later in \n2001 than it did in previous rounds, to give the new President \nsufficient time to nominate commissioners.\n  Second, under our legislation privatization in place would not be \npermitted at closing installations unless the Base Closure Commission \nrecommends it.\n  In a November 1998 report, the General Accounting Office listed five \nkey elements of the base closure process that ``contributed to the \nsuccess of prior rounds''. Our legislation retains all of those key \nelements. GAO also stated that they ``have not identified any long-term \nreadiness problems that were related to domestic base realignments and \nclosures, that ``DOD continues to retain excess capacity'' and that \n``substantial savings are expected'' from base closures.\n  Mr. President, every expert and every study agrees on the basic \nfacts--the Defense Department has more bases than its needs, and \nclosing bases saves substantial money in the long run.\n  The report the Department of Defense provided to the Congress last \nApril clearly demonstrated these facts. As the Congressional Budget \nOffice stated in a letter to me last July, ``the report's basic message \nis consistent with CBO's own conclusions: past and future BRAC round \nwill lead to significant savings for DoD.''\n  Every year we delay another base closure round, we deny the Defense \nDepartment, and the taxpayers, about $1.5 billion in annual savings \nthat we can never recoup. And every dollar we spend on bases we do not \nneed is a dollar we cannot spend on things we do need.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to make any detailed judgments on the \nPresident's defense budget proposal until we see the details, but I am \nprepared to support an increase in defense spending if the money is \nspent wisely.\n  However, Congress should not use defense funding increases as an \nexcuse to avoid tough choices. The addition of new resources cannot be \na substitute for the billions of dollars of savings that would be \ngenerated by a new round of base closures. We cannot justify spending \nmore for national defense unless we show our own willingness to make \nthe best use of defense dollars by reducing unneeded defense \ninfrastructure.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, last year I joined Senators McCain and Levin \nin introducing legislation authorizing another base closure round. I \nargued then, as I do today, that failing to enact another BRAC round \nonly makes the Congress look short-sighted and indecisive. I argued \nthen that if we don't bite the bullet quickly, the cost of excess \ninfrastructure will continue to drag down the readiness of our forces \ntoday and rob us of the resources so badly needed to modernize our \nforces for tomorrow.\n  For the first time since the late 1970's, military readiness is \nsuffering significantly. Ships are undermanned, pilots are flying too \nmany missions, reservists are being asked to leave family and job over \nand over. It doesn't take a budget expert to realize what we could do \nfor the troops with billions in savings from cutting excess \ninfrastructure.\n  This year we in the Congress will almost certainly add billions of \ndollars to the defense budget. This is a mixed blessing. While these \nadds will help resolve problems across the board, from recruiting to \nmodernization to preparing for the future, they will also undermine any \nincentives to better manage the Department of Defense and to eliminate \nthe wasteful assets and administrative inefficiencies that we the \nCongress are so determined to preserve.\n  BRAC failed in the past for reasons that have much to do with \npolitics, but little to do with ensuring our every defense dollar is \nspent for maintaining and equipping our armed forces for the \nbattlefields of the next century. Those politics are behind us now. We \nmust move forward and authorize more BRAC rounds.\n  Keeping excess military posts open won't bring more firepower to bear \nin the next war. Keeping an unneeded R lab open won't recruit more \ntalented young men and women to serve as the foundation for the world's \nfinest fighting force. Keeping an underutilized training range open \nwon't buy modern equipment so badly needed to replace systems now often \nolder than the men and women using them.\n  Mr. President, I reemphasize a point I've made time and time again in \nthe past--who suffers from Congressional inaction? In the end, we only \npunish those who most need the benefits of infrastructure savings. \nFirst, we punish the Nation's taxpayers when we fail to make the best \nuse of the resources with which they entrust us. Second, we punish \ntoday's soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines whose readiness depends \non sufficient, reliable resources for equipment, training and \noperations through the year. Finally, we punish tomorrow's force as we \ncontinue to mortgage research, development, and modernization of \nequipment necessary to keep America strong into the 21st century.\n  The bill we're introducing calls for a base closure round in 2001 and \nanother in 2003. Like the provision we offered last year and the year \nbefore that, the bill should answer concerns over the politicization of \nfuture BRAC rounds. Language is included to allow privatization-in-\nplace at a facility only if the BRAC Commission explicitly recommends \nprivatization-in-place.\n  The long-term savings from the first four base closure rounds already \nare generating substantial savings--about three billion dollars a year. \nEach new round will save another 1.5 billion dollars per year. It is no \nsurprise that scores of studies and organizations such as the \nQuadrennial Defense Review, Defense Restructure Initiative, National \nDefense Panel, and Business Executives for National Security have all \nconcluded that more base closures are crucial to the future of our \nArmed Forces.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to do what is right for our armed \nforces, what is right for the taxpayer, and support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 259. A bill to increase the role of the Secretary of \nTransportation in administering section 901 of the Merchant Marine Act, \n1936, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n\n\ntransportation in American vessels of government personnel and certain \n                                cargoes\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today \nwould centralize the authority to administer our nation's cargo \npreference laws in the Department of Transportation. Cargo preference \nstatutes assure U.S.-flag ships a minimum share of cargoes produced by \nU.S. government programs. They play an important role in ensuring our \nnation's economic security and the existence of a U.S.-flag merchant \nfleet to assist in national security during times of national \nemergencies. This tremendous benefit is achieved at a minimal cost. \nUnder present law, cargo reservation is the only direct support a \nmajority of the U.S. merchant fleet receives. I would also like to \npoint out that a cargo preference policy is not unique. Other nations \nalso provide their merchant fleet preference in carrying cargoes their \ngovernments generate.\n  The Maritime Administration, which is part of the Department of \nTransportation, has been tasked with the difficult duty of monitoring \nthe administration of and compliance with U.S. cargo preference laws \nand regulations by federal agencies with regard to programs generating \nocean-born cargoes.\n\n[[Page S764]]\n\nMajor programs monitored include humanitarian aid shipments provided by \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development, commodities financed by the Export-Import \nBank, foreign military sales, and Department of Defense cargo shipped \nby commercial ocean carriers. These are cargoes generated exclusively \nby our government.\n  In the past, compliance by federal agencies with the requirements of \nthe cargo reservation laws has been chaotic, uneven and varied from \nagency to agency. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy, in issuing a \ndirective to all executive branch departments and agencies, recognized \nthe importance of our cargo preference policy in fostering a modern, \nprivately owned, merchant marine capable of serving as a naval and \nmilitary auxiliary in time of war or national emergency. At the time, \nPresident Kennedy stated that, ``the achievement of this national \npolicy is even more essential now because of the worldwide economic and \ndefense burdens facing the United States.'' Never has this sentiment \nbeen more true than now.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will merely make certain that federal \nagencies adhere to existing cargo preference laws, and give the \nMaritime Administration authority to respond to violations with the \nproper penalties or sanctions. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthis bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 259\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TRANSPORTATION IN AMERICAN VESSELS OF GOVERNMENT \n                   PERSONNEL AND CERTAIN CARGOES.\n\n       Section 901(b)(2) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 (46 \n     U.S.C. App. 2141 (b)(2)), is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Secretary of Transportation shall have the sole \n     responsibility for determining and designating the programs \n     that are subject to the requirements of this subsection.

A bill to make chapter 12 of title 1, United States Code, \npermanent, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                              safety 2000\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce vitally \nimportant legislation to promote the well-being of America's family \nfarms by extending chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code. This bill, which \nis known as ``safety 2000,'' will also make needed changes to chapter \n12 which will make it work better for family farmers. I'm pleased that \nSenator Daschle is joining with me in this effort to save family farms. \nIn Iowa, pork prices recently hit an all time low. Pork producers are \nfacing serious hardship, and we must make sure that those farmers who \nneed bankruptcy relief to help save their farming operation have \nmeaningful protections.\n  Last year, again with the distinguished minority leader, I introduced \nlegislation to make chapter 12 permanent. That legislation passed the \nSenate by unanimous consent. However, the legislation was not enacted \ninto law. On April 1 of this year, chapter 12 will expire. Mr. \nPresident, we cannot let this happen.\n  As the only family farmer in the Senate, I feel I have a unique \nresponsibility to make sure that family farming remains a strong and \nvibrant part of American life. For generations, family farms have fed \nthis country. But farming has always had rough periods.\n  Allowing chapter 12 to expire will repeat a fatal mistake of the \npast. During the great depression, Congress created special bankruptcy \nprotections for farmers to help them ride out the severe economic \nconditions of that tragic era. However, Congress allowed these laws to \nlapse in the 1950s. So, when farmers in Iowa confronted the farm crisis \nof the mid-1980s, they were left without effective bankruptcy relief. \nBy passing my legislation, we can prevent the mistakes of the past from \noccurring again.\n  I think it's very important to realize that chapter 12 is not a hand \nout or a ``get out of debt free'' card. Farmers are hard-working people \nwho want the chance to learn their way. In fact, chapter 12 is modeled \non chapter 13, where individuals set up plans to re-pay a portion of \ntheir debts.\n  By all accounts, chapter 12 has been wildly successful. So many times \nin Washington we develop programs and laws with the best of intentions. \nBut when these programs get to the real world, they don't work well. \nchapter 12, on the other hand, has worked exactly as intended. \nAccording to Professor Neil Harl of Iowa State University, 74 percent \nof family farmers who filed Chapter 12 bankruptcy are still farming and \n61 percent of farmers who went through Chapter 12 believe that Chapter \n12 was helpful in getting them back on their feet.\n\n  But Chapter 12 can be made even better. ``Safety 2000'' will make \nChapter 12 better. The bill expands the definition of family farmer so \nthat more farmers can use Chapter 12. Under current law, family farmers \ncan't use Chapter 12 to save their farms if a farmer has more than $1.5 \nmillion in debt. This is too restrictive, and my bill would let farmers \nwho have up to $3 million in debt use Chapter 12.\n  ``Safety 2000'' also helps farmers to reorganize by keeping the tax \ncollectors at bay. Under current law, farmers often face a crushing tax \nliability if they need to sell livestock or land in order to reorganize \ntheir business affairs. According to Joe Peiffer, a bankruptcy lawyer \nfrom Hiawatha, Iowa, who represents many family farmers, high taxes \nhave caused farmers to lose their farms. Under the bankruptcy code, the \nI.R.S. must be paid in full for any tax liabilities generated during a \nbankruptcy reorganization. If the farmer can't pay the I.R.S. in full, \nthen he can't keep his farm. This isn't sound policy. Why should the \nI.R.S. be allowed to veto a farmer's reorganization plan? ``Safety \n2000'' takes this power away from the I.R.S. by reducing the priority \nof taxes during proceedings. This will free up capital for investment \nin the farm, and help farmers stay in the business of farming.\n  In conclusion, Chapter 12 works well and this legislation will make \nit work better. Let's make sure that we keep this safety net for family \nfarmers in place. I urge my colleagues to think of this bill as a low-\ncost insurance policy for an important part of America's economy and \nAmerica's heritage.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Grassley as a \ncosponsor of ``Safeguarding America's Farms Entering the Year 2000.'' \nThis measure would make permanent the bankruptcy code provisions that \nprotect family farmers in hard times by giving them the ability to hold \non to their farms while they reorganize their finances.\n  Without prompt action by Congress, the bankruptcy laws for family \nfarmers, known as Chapter 12, will expire on April 1, 1999. When \nCongress first enacted Chapter 12 in 1986 for seven years, we intended \nto make Chapter 12 permanent if it proved successful. Already, Chapter \n12 has been extended twice, in 1993 and again last year.\n  Family farmers need this permanent protection because Chapter 12 \nworks. It takes into consideration the unique circumstances faced by \nfamily farmers. It recognizes our special interest in keeping family \nfarms in the family, where possible. And in practice it pays off--\naccording to the National Bankruptcy Review Commission, farmers in \nChapter 12 are more likely to successfully reorganize than individuals \nfiling under parallel chapters.\n\n[[Page S765]]\n\n  The continued success of the tens of thousands of family farmers in \nWisconsin--and millions nationwide--is important to our national \ninterest. But their well-being is too often jeopardized by elements out \nof their control. For example, many Wisconsin farmers now are facing \ndistress due to unusually low prices for hogs, corn and soy beans. The \nopportunity to reorganize their business under Chapter 12 may be an \nimportant option in these difficult times. They deserve to know that \nthis protection will always be available. Thank you.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \n        DeWine, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Santorum, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Sarbanes, \n        Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. \n        Moynihan):\n  S. 261. A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     the trade fairness act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce legislation to try to deal with a very serious surge of steel \nimports into the United States, which is threatening to decimate the \nsteel industry and take thousands of jobs from American steelworkers in \na way which is patently unfair and in violation of free trade \npractices. My bill is entitled the ``Trade Fairness Act of 1999'' \nbecause it would bring our laws in line with those established by the \nGeneral Agreement on Tarriffs and provide relief to the flood of \nforeign steel imports dumped onto the American market.\n  On Monday, November 30, 1998, Senator Rockefeller and I convened a \nhearing of the Senate Steel Caucus to look further into the continued \ndumping of foreign steel on the U.S. market and its affect on domestic \nproducers. At that hearing, Hank Barnette, Chairman and CEO of \nBethlehem Steel, and George Becker, President of the United \nSteelworkers of America, testified to the magnitude of the crisis, the \ncontinued loss of high-paying jobs and the alarming lack of capital \ninvestment by the industry over the last several months. They both \nexpressed frustration at the lack of activity by the Clinton \nAdministration to respond to illegal dumping of foreign steel.\n  On October 7, 1998, Senator John D. Rockefeller, Congressman Ralph \nRegula and Congressman Jim Oberstar, and I met with representatives of \nthe Clinton Administration, specifically Treasury Secretary Robert \nRubin, Commerce Secretary William Daley, United States Trade \nRepresentative Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky and National Economic \nCouncil Advisor Gene Sperling, to discuss the steel import issue. At \nthat meeting, representatives of the Clinton Administration assured us \nthat they were looking into actions that the Administration could take \nto respond to the illegal dumping of foreign steel on the U.S. market \nbut had yet to make a final decision on their response.\n  The urgency of this crisis and the failure of the Administration to \ntake action was evident from testimony presented on September 10, 1998, \nwhere, as Chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus, I joined House Chairman \nRegula in convening a joint meeting of the Senate and House Steel \nCaucuses to hear from members of the United Steelworkers of America and \nexecutives from a number of the nation's largest steel manufacturers \nabout the current influx of imported steel into the United States. At \nthat meeting, I expressed my profound concern regarding the impact on \nour steel companies and steelworkers of the current financial crises in \nAsia and Russia, which have generated surges in U.S. imports of Asian \nand Russian steel.\n  The United States has become the dumping ground for foreign steel. \nRussia has become the world's number one steel exporting nation and \nChina is now the world's number one steel-producing nation, while \nenormous subsidies to foreign steel producers have continued. In fact, \nthe Commerce Department revealed that Russia, one of the world's least \nefficient producers, was selling steel plate in the United States at \nmore than 50 percent, or $110 per ton, below the constructed cost to \nmake steel plate. The dumping of this cheap steel on the American \nmarket ultimately costs our steel companies in lost sales and results \nin fewer jobs for American workers.\n  Specifically, the October 1998 import level was the second highest \nmonthly total ever, with 4.1 million net tons--an increase of 56 \npercent over October 1997 of 2.6 million net tons. Only August 1998 \n(4.4 million net tons) surpassed it. The October level, if annualized, \nwould exceed 49 million net tons, or 48 percent of expected total U.S. \ndomestic steel shipments for the entire year. Total imports in October \nwere 35 percent of apparent consumption, up from 23 percent a year \nearlier.\n  Imports of steel from various countries have dramatically increased \nwhen the first six months of 1997 are compared to the first six months \nof 1998. The percent increases from four countries are as follows: \nJapan, 141 percent; South Africa, 124 percent; South Korea, 96 percent; \nRussia, 29 percent.\n\n  The following is an example of the layoffs and plant slowdowns since \nSeptember, 1998:\n  Geneva Steel has laid off 460 workers;\n  U.S. Steel's Philadelphia operations have been reduced by 70 percent;\n  LTV Steel's plant closure has cost 320 jobs; and,\n  Weirton Steel has suffered 300 layoffs with 200 additional layoffs \nexpected by January 1, 1999.\n  The American Iron and Steel Institute estimates that 5,000 \nsteelworkers, nationwide, have been laid off since September, 1998. An \nadditional 10,000 U.S. steelworkers' jobs are at risk of imminent \nlayoffs.\n  I believe that the growing coalition of steel manufacturers, \nsteelworkers, and Congress must work together to remedy this import \ncrisis before it is too late and the U.S. steel industry is forced to \nendure an excruciatingly painful economic downturn. The United States \nhas many of the tools at its disposal to protect our steel industry \nfrom unfair and illegally dumped steel; therefore, I introduced Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 121 on September 29, 1998, to call on the \nPresident to take all necessary measures to respond to the surge of \nsteel imports resulting from the Asian and Russian financial crises. I \nam pleased to state that the resolution passed both houses of Congress \non October 19, 1998. Unfortunately, the President's report to Congress \nfailed to take the immediate action needed to stop the importation of \nforeign steel.\n  While this resolution was an appropriate way for Congress to express \nour concerns and request immediate actions by the Administration to \nrespond to the steel import crisis, I think it is also important to \ngive the Administration all the necessary tools to fight the surges of \nforeign steel. After reviewing the U.S. trade laws, I discovered that \nour trade laws place the United States at a disadvantage in the \ninternational trade arena. Our laws are more strict than those \nagreements made during the Uruguay Round negotiations on the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). That agreement, which the Senate \nconsidered and passed on December 1, 1994, established the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) to administer these trade agreements.\n  The GATT established rules for the application of safeguard measures. \nThe agreement provides that a member of the WTO may apply a safeguard \nmeasure to a product if the member has determined that such product is \nbeing imported into its territory in such increased quantities, \nabsolute or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions \nas to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic \nindustry that produces like or directly competitive products. The \ncomparable U.S. statute, referred to as safeguard actions, or Section \n201 of the 1974 Trade Act, provide a procedure whereby the President \nhas the discretion to grant temporary import relief to a domestic \nindustry injured by increased imports. Our statute goes further than \nGATT by requiring that foreign imports are the substantial cause of the \ninjury. It just does not make sense to hinder the Administration by \nplacing this additional burden on it in evaluating a claim of injury \ndue to surges of imports. We need to level the playing field so that \nall countries are playing by the same rules. This oversight is one \nexample of the technical corrections that must be made to U.S. trade \nlaws to bring them in line with WTO's rules.\n  For these reasons and to provide relief to the domestic steel \nindustry injured by these overly strict laws, I am\n\n[[Page S766]]\n\nintroducing the Trade Fairness Act of 1999, which seeks to: lower the \nthreshold for establishing injury in safeguard actions under Section \n201 of the 1974 Trade Act; and, establish an import monitoring program \nto monitor the influx of foreign steel on the U.S. market.\n  During the last days of the 105th Congress, I introduced the Trade \nFairness Act of 1998 which sought to amend the Trade Act of 1974 by \nmaking technical corrections to our strict laws; the first section of \nthe legislation I am introducing today is based on that bill. First, \nregarding safeguard actions, this legislation removes the requirement \nthat imports must be a ``substantial'' cause of the serious injury by \ndeleting the word ``substantial.'' The WTO's Safeguards Agreement does \nnot require that increased imports by a ``substantial'' cause of \nserious injury. This change will lower the threshold to prove that the \ninflux of imports were the cause of injury to the affected industry and \nwill make U.S. law consistent with the WTO rules.\n  Second, the legislation clarifies that the International Trade \nCommission (ITC) shall not attribute to imports injury caused by other \nfactors in making a determination that imports are a cause of serious \ninjury. This provision clarifies that there only needs to be a causal \nlink between the imports and the injury in order to gain relief. This \nclarification is a more faithful implementation of the GATT Agreement \nand will prevent circumstances such as a recession from blocking \ninvocation of Section 201 by the Administration.\n  Finally, this legislation brings the definition of ``serious injury'' \nin line with the definition codified in the GATT Agreement. The bill \nstrikes the definition of serious injury and replaces it with the WTO's \nlanguage regarding evaluation of whether increased imports have caused \nserious injury to a domestic industry. Specifically, it states ``with \nrespect to serious injury'', the ITC should consider ``the rate and \namount of the increase in imports of the product concerned in absolute \nand relative terms; the share of the domestic market taken by increased \nimports; changes in the levels of sales; production; productivity; \ncapacity utilization; profits and losses; and, employment.'' These \nfactors are important guidance to the ITC in evaluating a petition of \nserious injury. Again, I think it is appropriate to be consistent with \nthe WTO language as America increasingly interacts on a global scale.\n\n  Next, my legislation establishes a comprehensive steel import permit \nand monitoring program, which is modeled on similar systems currently \nin use in Canada and Mexico. The program created by this legislation \nrequires importers to provide information regarding country of origin, \nquantity, value and Harmonized Tariff Schedule number. The program also \nrequires the Administration to release the data collected to the public \nin aggregate form on an expedited basis. The information provided by \nthe licensing program will allow the Commerce Department and the steel \nindustry to monitor the influx of steel imports into the United States. \nCurrently, unfairly traded imports can cause significant damage to the \nU.S. market long before the data is available for even preliminary \nanalysis. This program will allow the U.S. government to receive and \nanalyze critical data in a more timely manner and, as a result, allow \nthe industry to determine more quickly whether unfairly traded imports \nare disrupting the market.\n  Specifically, the bill directs the Secretary of Commerce and the \nSecretary of Treasury to implement a steel import monitoring program \nthat requires importers of all products classified within Chapters 72 \nand 73 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) \nto obtain an import permit prior to entering such products in the \nUnited States. In order to obtain an import permit, the importer is \nrequired to submit an import permit application containing specific \ninformation. An import permit is issued automatically upon receipt of \nthe application and is valid for a period of thirty days.\n  This legislation will enhance U.S. law to better respond to surges of \nforeign imports that injure U.S. industries. It is important to note \nthat, with the exception of the steel import licensing provisions, this \nlegislation applies to all industries and is not limited to the steel \nindustry. As such, other U.S. industries that are faced with an import \ncrisis such as the steel industry is currently confronting would also \nbenefit from these improvements to the U.S. trade laws.\n  The U.S. steel industry has become a world class industry with a very \nhigh-quality product. This has been achieved at a great cost: $50 \nbillion in new investment to restructure and modernize; 40 million tons \nof capacity taken out of the industry; and a work force dramatically \ndownsized from 500,000 to 170,000. With these technical changes, the \nAdministration will be armed with ammunition to bring a self-initiated \nSection 201 action on behalf of the steel industry that has been harmed \nnot only by the onslaught of cheap imports on a daily basis but by U.S. \nlaw that has prevented swift and immediate action by the U.S. \ngovernment. This legislation is essential to allow the President to \nrespond promptly to the current steel import crisis. It will allow \nsteel companies to compete in a more fair trade environment, preventing \nbankruptcies that would cause the loss of thousands of high-paying jobs \nin the steel industry. Too many steelworkers have lost their jobs due \nto unfair cheap imports. I intend to stand up for the steel industry \nand prevent the loss of any more jobs.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nadoption of legislation to bring fairness to our trade laws and needed \nrelief to the steel industry.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the ``Trade Fairness Act of 1999'' and thank Senator \nSpecter for his hard work in crafting this legislation which will help \nalleviate the economic turmoil in our domestic steel industry caused by \nillegal dumping.\n  Recent trade data indicates that steel imports to the United States \nfor the first ten months of 1998, ending in October, have reached an \nall time record of 34,628,000 tons. In contrast, imports to the United \nStates in for the first ten months of 1997, which was itself a record \nyear, equaled 26,708,000 tons. This represents a 30 percent increase.\n  The bill I am joining in cosponsoring with Senator Specter today will \nhelp make it easier for the President to enforce our existing trade \nlaws in two ways; it will lower the threshold necessary for the \nPresident to take immediate action to stem the tide of illegal imports \nunder section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 and it will create an \n``Import Monitoring Program'' for steel, similar to the systems in \nplace in both Mexico and Canada, to identify the country of origin, \nvalue and quantity of steel imports into the United States.\n  These actions are in line with the General Agreement on Tarriffs and \nTrade (GATT) and will not hinder free trade with our international \ntrading partners. The bill will provide necessary information, critical \nin determining whether illegal trade practices are occurring. This \nprovision will ensure the President can take immediate, decisive action \nwhen those practices are identified.\n  The men and women who work in the United States steel business are \nthe most efficient and hardest working people in the world. Given a \nfair shake, our domestic steel producers have and can continue to \ncompete with any of our international trading partners. Illegal dumping \nhas forced America's steel industry into jeopardy. The jobs of \nthousands of steel workers in my home state of Alabama and across the \nNation are threatened. Our steel workers and companies deserve the \nprotection afforded to them by United States trade law and the rigorous \nenforcement of those laws by our President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 262. A bill to make miscellaneous and technical changes to various \ntrade laws, and for other purposes. A bill to make miscellaneous and \ntechnical changes to various trade laws, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S767]]\n\n       miscellaneous trade and technical corrections act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, on behalf of \nSenator Moynihan and myself, the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical \nCorrections Act of 1999. This bill reflects unfinished business from \nthe 105th Congress and I am hopeful that the Senate will quickly move \nto approve this legislation this year.\n  On September 29, the Finance Committee reported unanimously H.R. \n4342, the Miscellaneous Tariff and Technical Corrections Act of 1998. \nOn October 20, 1998, the House passed and sent to the Senate H.R. 4856, \nthe identical bill with the addition of several provisions. \nUnfortunately, for reasons unrelated to the substance of the bill, the \nSenate was unable to pass either piece of legislation.\n  The bill I am introducing today with Senator Moynihan is \nsubstantively identical to H.R. 4856, with only minor technical changes \nnecessary because of the passage of time. This bill contains over 150 \nprovisions temporarily suspending or reducing the applicable tariffs on \na wide variety of products, including chemicals used to make anti-HIV, \nanti-AIDS and anti-cancer drugs, pigments, paints, herbicides and \ninsecticides, certain machinery used in the production of textiles, and \nrocket engines.\n  In each instance, there was either no domestic production of the \nproduct in question or the domestic producers supported the measure. By \nsuspending or reducing the duties, we can enable U.S. firms that use \nthese products to produce goods in a more cost efficient manner, \nthereby helping create jobs for American workers and reducing costs for \nconsumers.\n  The bill also contains a number of technical corrections and other \nminor modifications to the trade laws that enjoyed broad support. One \nsuch measure would help facilitate Customs Service clearance of \nathletes that participate in world athletic events, such as the \nupcoming Women's World Cup. Another measure would correct outdated \nreferences in the trade laws.\n  For each of the provisions included in this bill, the House and \nSenate has solicited comments from the public and from the \nAdministration to ensure that there was no controversy or opposition. \nOnly those measures that were noncontroversial were included in the \nbill.\n  The Finance Committee is scheduled to hold a mark-up of this bill on \nFriday, January 22nd. I hope that both the House and Senate will move \nto approve this legislation soon.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 262\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to establish the \nPersonal Retirement Accounts Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the personal retirement accounts act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Personal \nRetirement Accounts Act of 1999. This legislation has a simple but \npowerful purpose--to establish personal retirement accounts for working \nAmericans. In my view, these accounts promise to give working Americans \nnot only a more secure retirement future but a new stake in the \nnation's economic growth. And, as I will describe, these accounts may \nprovide the model for future Social Security reform.\n  Just a few years ago personal retirement accounts were an exotic and \neven controversial concept. But no longer! Today, personal retirement \naccounts are a bipartisan, even mainstream, idea.\n  In 1997, a majority of a Clinton administration task force on Social \nSecurity endorsed the concept.\n  In the last Congress, two comprehensive Social Security reform \nproposals, one introduced by Senator Moynihan, the ranking Democrat on \nthe Finance Committee; the other by Senators Gregg and Breaux, had as a \ncentral element personal retirement accounts.\n  Mr. President, let me explain why retirement accounts find so much \nsupport--not only in Congress but among the American people. With even \nconservative investment, such accounts have the potential to provide \nAmericans with a substantial retirement nest egg. And an estate that \ncan be left to children and grandchildren.\n  Creating these accounts would also give the majority of Americans who \ndo not own any investment assets a new stake in America's economic \ngrowth--because that growth will be returned directly to their benefit. \nMore Americans will be the owners of capital--not just workers.\n  Creating these accounts may encourage Americans to save more. Today, \nAmericans save less than people in almost every other industrial \ncountry. But personal retirement accounts will demonstrate to all \nAmericans the magic of compound interest as even small savings grow \nsignificantly over time.\n  Lastly, creating these accounts will help Americans to better prepare \nfor retirement. According to the Congressional Research Service, 60 \npercent of Americans are not actively participating in a retirement \nprogram other than Social Security. A recent survey found that only \nabout 45 percent of working Americans have tried to calculate how much \nthey will need for retirement. It is my belief that retirement accounts \nwill prompt Americans--particularly Baby Boomers--to think more about \nretirement planning.\n  Mr. President, let me describe a few of the features of my bill. \nFirst, the program would run for 5 years, from 2000 to 2004, utilizing \nhalf the budget surplus projected by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Each year, working Americans who earned a minimum of four quarters of \nSocial Security coverage--$3,000 in 2000--would receive a deposit in \nhis or her account. About 128 million Americans would receive a deposit \nin 2000.\n  The formula for sharing the surplus among the accounts is \nprogressive. Each eligible individual would receive a minimum amount of \n$250 per year, plus an additional amount based on how much they paid in \npayroll taxes.\n  Over the life of the program, a minimum wage earner--someone earning \n$12,400 this year--would receive about $1,850. That amount is equal to \na 35-percent rebate of his or her payroll taxes.\n  An average wage earner--earning $27,600--would receive about $2,590--\nequal to a 22-percent rebate of payroll taxes. And an individual who \npaid the maximum Social Security tax would get $4,560, a 16-percent \nrebate of payroll taxes. These figures do not include any investment \nincome--or deductions for the costs of running the program.\n  Account holders would have three investment choices--prudent choices \nthat balance risk and return. The three choices are a ``stock index \nfund''--a mutual fund that reflects the overall performance of the \nstock market; a fund that invests in corporate bonds and other ``fixed \nincome'' securities; and a fund that invests in U.S. Treasury bonds.\n  However, my legislation also provides for a study of additional \ninvestment options--of other types of investment funds and investment \nmanagers.\n  An account holder would become eligible for benefits when he or she \nsigns up for Social Security. An individual could choose between an \nannuity or annual payments based on life expectancy.\n  The bill also provides a number of features to ensure the program is \nproperly run. First, the program would be neither ``on'' budget nor \n``off'' budget--instead, the program would be outside the Federal \nbudget. The money in the program could be used for no other purpose \nthan retirement benefits and the program's operating expenses.\n\n  Second, the program would be supervised by a new, independent \nPersonal Retirement Board, with members appointed by the President and \nCongressional leaders and subject to Senate confirmation. Board \nofficials would be fiduciaries, and required by law to act only in the \nbest financial interests of beneficiaries.\n  Lastly, the stock funds would be managed by private sector investment \nmanagers. To insulate companies represented in the stock funds from \npolitics, no Board official or other government employee and would be \neligible to vote company proxies--only the investment managers.\n  Mr. President, the design of this personal retirement accounts plan \nfollows a proven model--the Federal Thrift Savings Plan. Back in 1983, \nwhen I was Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, the \nretirement program for Federal employees needed to be revamped. One of \nthe new elements we added was the Federal Thrift Savings Plan--a \ndefined contribution employee benefit plan--that has been a great \nsuccess.\n  Many Americans will undoubtedly ask, ``What size nest egg might grow \nin my personal account?'' According to an analysis done by Social \nSecurity's actuaries, someone earning the minimum wage would have an \naccount worth about $2,145 in 2004, assuming a 7.5 percent interest \nrate. For the average wage earner, the account would be worth about \n$2,990, and for the individual paying the maximum Social Security tax, \nabout $5,250.\n  Of course, over the long-term, accounts can grow significantly. For \nthe minimum wage earner after 40 years--in 2039, his or her account \nwould be worth about $27,000. The average wage earner would have \n$38,000; and the person paying the maximum payroll tax, $66,000.\n  Mr. President, some might ask, ``Why start with personal retirement \naccounts, rather than comprehensive Social Security reform?'' Indeed, \nmy bill will not affect the current Social Security program. Personal \nretirement accounts are an exciting concept, but still a big job, \nrequiring careful work by the Finance Committee.\n  Personal retirement accounts also enjoy broad support, unlike many \nother Social Security reform proposals. So let's get these accounts up \nand running, proven and tested, while Congress considers carefully \nprotecting and preserving Social Security for the long term.\n  Mr. President, in closing, let me add that personal retirement \naccounts have another big promise. Such accounts--if later made a part \nof Social Security or even as a permanent supplemental program--may \nhelp restore the confidence of the American people in this important \nnational program. Polls show that Social Security is among the most \npopular government programs, deservedly so. But many Americans--\nparticularly young Americans--seem to have lost confidence in Social \nSecurity. They believe that there will be no benefits for them when \nthey retire. Personal retirement accounts will provide the \naccountability and assurances that Americans are asking for.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a careful look at my bill, and I \ninvite members to co-sponsor it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n\n[[Page S792]]\n\n  S. 264. A bill to increase the Federal medical assistance percentage \nfor Hawaii to 59.8 percent; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n      hawaii federal medical assistance percentage adjustment act\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation I \nauthored during the 105th Congress that would adjust the Federal \nMedical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rate for Hawaii to reflect more \nfairly the state's ability to bear its share of Medicaid payments.\n  The federal share of Medicaid payments varies depending on each \nstate's ability to pay--wealthier states bear a larger share of the \ncost of the program, and thus have lower FMAP rates. Per capita income \nis used as the measure of state wealth. Because per capita income in \nHawaii is quite high, the state's FMAP rate is at the lowest level--50 \npercent. Hawaii is one of only a dozen states whose FMAP rate is at the \n50 percent level. My bill would increase Hawaii's FMAP rate from 50 \npercent to 59.8 percent.\n  Because of our geographic location and other factors, the cost of \nliving in Hawaii greatly exceeds the cost of living on the mainland. \nPer capita income is a poor measure of a state's ability to bear the \ncost of Medicaid services. An excellent analysis of this issue appears \nin the 21st edition of The Federal Budget and the States, a joint study \nconducted by the Taubman Center for State and Local Government at \nHarvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government and the \noffice of U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. According to the study, \nif per capita income is measured in real terms, Hawaii ranks 47th at \n$19,755 compared to the national average of $24,231. This sheds a \ntotally different light on the state's financial status.\n  The cost of living in Honolulu is 83 percent higher than the average \nof the metropolitan areas tracked by the U.S. Census Bureau, based on \n1995 data. Recent studies have shown that for the state as a whole, the \ncost of living is more than one-third higher than the rest of the U.S. \nIn fact, Hawaii's Cost of Living Index ranks it as the highest in the \ncountry. Some government programs take the high cost of living in \nHawaii into account and funding is adjusted accordingly. These include \nMedicare prospective payment rates, food stamp allocations, school \nlunch programs, housing insurance limits, and military living expenses.\n  These examples reflect the recognition that the higher cost of living \nin noncontiguous states should be taken into account in fashioning \ngovernment policies. It is time for similar recognition of this factor \nin gauging Hawaii's ability to support its health care programs. My \ncolleagues may recall that the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included a \nprovision increasing Alaska's FMAP rate to 59.8 percent. Setting a \nhigher match rate would still leave Hawaii with a lower FMAP rate than \na majority of the states, but would more accurately reflect Hawaii's \nability to pay its fair share of the costs of the Medicaid program.\n  Despite the high cost of living, the Harvard-Moynihan study finds \nthat Hawaii also has one of the highest poverty rates in the nation. \nThe State's 16.9 percent poverty rate is eighth in the country, \ncompared to the national average of 14.7 percent. These higher costs \nare reflected in state government expenditures and state taxation. \nThus, on a per capita basis, state revenue and expenditures are far \nhigher in Hawaii and Alaska, than in the 48 mainland states. The higher \nexpenditure levels are necessary to assure an adequate level of public \nservices which are more costly to provide in these states.\n  Of the top ten states with the highest poverty rates in the country, \nthe Harvard-Moynihan study finds that only three others have an FMAP \nrate between 50-60 percent. The other six states have FMAP rates of 65 \npercent and higher. Even more astonishing is that of the top ten states \nwith the lowest real per capita income, only Hawaii has a 50 percent \nFMAP rate.\n  To bring equity to this situation, Hawaii has sought an increase in \nits FMAP rate over the past several years. Just as we did for Alaska in \n1997, Hawaii deserves equitable treatment. This change is long \nwarranted. The same factors justifying an increase for Alaska apply to \nHawaii. Recognition of this point was made by House and Senate \nconferees to the Balanced Budget Act. The conferees noted that poverty \nguidelines for Alaska and Hawaii are different than those for the rest \nof the nation, yet there is no variation from the national calculation \nin the FMAP. The conferees correctly noted that comparable adjustments \nare generally made for Alaska and Hawaii.\n  The case for an FMAP increase is especially compelling in Hawaii, \nwhich has a proud history of providing essential health services in an \ninnovative and cost-effective manner. That commitment is not easy to \nfulfill. Unlike most states, Hawaii's Aid to Families with Dependent \nChildren/Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (AFDC/TANF) caseloads \nhave risen significantly in recent years. Since TANF block grants are \nbased on historical spending levels, the increased demand has placed \nextreme pressure on state resources.\n  Hawaii has sought to maintain a social safety net while striving for \nmore efficient delivery of government services. The most striking \nexample is the QUEST medical assistance program, which operates under a \nfederal waiver. QUEST has brought managed care and broader coverage to \nthe state's otherwise uninsured populations. At the same time, Hawaii \nis the only state whose employers guarantee health care coverage to \nevery full-time employee, a further example of Hawaii's commitment to a \nstrong social support system.\n  There is a particularly strong need for a more suitable FMAP rate for \nHawaii at this time. The state has not participated in the robust \neconomic growth that has benefitted most of the rest of the nation. \nHawaii's unemployment rate is above the national average and state tax \nrevenues have fallen short of projected estimates. The need to fund 50 \npercent of the cost of the Medicaid program puts an increasing strain \non the state's resources.\n  For all of these reasons, the FMAP rates for Hawaii should be \nadjusted to reflect more equitably the state's ability to support the \nMedicaid program. This will assure that the special problem of the \nnoncontiguous states is dealt with in a principled manner.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support an upward adjustment in \nHawaii's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 264\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today, Senator Olympia Snowe and I are \nintroducing a bill to guarantee that the decision of how long a patient \nreceives care in the hospital is left to the attending physician. Our \nlegislation would require health insurance plans to cover the length of \nhospital stay for any procedure or illness as determined by the \nattending physician, in consultation with the patient, to be medically \nappropriate.\n  The bill is endorsed by the American Medical Association, the \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S793]]\n\nCollege of Surgeons, the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, the American Academy of Neurology, and the American \nPsychological Association.\n  Only a physician taking care of the patient, who understands the \npatient's history, medical condition and needs, should make the \ndecision as to how much hospital care a person needs. Physicians are \ntrained to evaluate all the unique needs and problems of each \nindividual patient. Every patient's condition varies and the course of \ntheir illness also varies. Some patients are fragile or weak. Others do \nnot respond well to general anesthesia. Complications arise. Each \npatient is a unique individual with varying degrees of health.\n  The American Medical Association, concerned that pre-determined \nlength of stay criteria are ``moving away from scientific, patient-\nfocused principles of care,'' resulting in ``quicker and sicker'' \ndischarges and poor patient outcomes, has developed patient-based \ndischarge criteria. These criteria include considerations such as the \npatient's physiological, psychological, social and functional needs. \nThe AMA criteria say: ``Patients should not be discharged from the \nhospital when their disease or symptoms cannot be adequately treated or \nmonitored in the discharge setting.''\n  Lengths of stay should not be determined by insurance company clerks, \nactuaries or non-medical personnel. It is the attending physician, not \na physician or other representative of an insurance company, that \nshould decide when to admit and discharge someone.\n  A number of physicians and other health care providers have expressed \nto me their great frustration with the current health care climate, in \nwhich they feel they spend too much of their time trying to justify \ntheir decisions on medical necessity to insurance companies.\n  For example, Donna Damico, a nurse in a Maryland psychiatric unit of \na hospital, told National Public Radio on October 1, 1997: ``I spend my \ndays watching the care on my unit be directed by faceless people from \ninsurance companies on the other end of the phone. My hospital employs \na full-time nurse whose entire job is to talk to insurance reviewers * \n* * The reviewer's background can range anywhere from high school \ngraduate to nurse, social worker or even actual physicians.''\n  In 1996, we addressed the problem of ``drive-through'' baby \ndeliveries because insurance plans would only pay for one day of \nhospital car for childbirth. This was fraught with problems like \njaundiced babies that had to be rehospitalized and mothers who \ndeveloped problems which only worsened because they were sent home \ndespite physicians' view that a mother's and baby's stability are not \nusually reached until the third post-partum day.\n  We have also been told of so-called ``drive-through'' mastectomies. \nSome HMO's have made mastectomy an outpatient procedure. Women who have \nhad a radical mastectomy at 7:30 a.m. have been out on the street at \n4:30 that afternoon, dizzy and weak, unable to cope with drainage tubes \nand disfigurement. Senator Snowe and I are introducing a separate bill \nto address this.\n  A California pediatrician told me of a child with very bad asthma. \nThe insurance plan authorized 3 days in the hospital; the doctor wanted \n4-5 days. He told us about a baby with infant botulism (poisoning), a \nbaby with a toxin that had spread from the intestine to the nervous \nsystem so that the child could not breathe. The doctor thought a 10-14 \nday hospital stay was medically necessary for the baby; the insurance \nplan insisted on one week.\n  A California neurologist told us about a seven-year-old girl with an \near infection who went to the doctor feverish. When her illness \ndeveloped into pneumonia, she was admitted to the hospital. After two \ndays she was sent home, but she then returned to the hospital three \ntimes because her insurance plan only covered a certain number of days. \nThe third time she returned she had meningitis, which can be life \nthreatening. The doctor said that if this girl had stayed in the \nhospital the first time for five to seven days, the antibiotics would \nhave killed the infection, and the meningitis would never have \ndeveloped.\n\n  A 27-year-old man from central California had a heart transplant and \nwas forced out of the hospital after 4 days because his HMO would not \npay for more days. He died.\n  Nurses in St. Luke's Hospital, San Francisco, say that women are \nbeing sent home after only two nights after a hysterectomy and two \nnights for a Caesarean section delivery, both of which are major \nabdominal surgeries, even though physicians think the women are not \nready to go home.\n  Lisa Breakey, a San Jose speech pathologist, came to my office and \ntold us that she is providing home health for stroke patients she used \nto see in the hospital. She sees patients in their homes who have tubes \nin their stomach for feeding and tracheotomy tubes in their throats for \nbreathing. These trach tubes have an inflated balloon or cuff which a \nfamily member must deflate and inflate by using a needle. Family \nmembers are supposed to suction the patient's mouth and throat before \nthey deflate the cuff. Families, she stressed, are providing intensive \ncare, for which they are unprepared and untrained. Bedrooms have become \nhospital rooms.\n  Another California physician told us about a patient who needed total \nhip replacement because her hip had failed. The doctor believed a \nseven-day stay was warranted; the plan would only authorize five.\n  Rep. Greg Ganske, a physician serving in the House, told the story of \na six-year-old child who nearly drowned. The child was put on a \nventilator and it appeared that he would not live. The hospital got a \ncall from the insurance company, asking if the doctor had considered \nsending the boy home because home ventilation is cheaper.\n  These cases can be summarized in the comments of a Chico, California, \nmaternity ward nurse: ``People's treatment depends on the type of \ninsurance they have rather than what's best for them.''\n  As I have mentioned, premature discharges can increase readmissions \nand medical complications.\n  On March 23, 1998, American Medical News (according to Dr. David \nPhillips) reported that the ``shift toward outpatient treatment \nactually has come at quite a high price * * * an increased loss of \nlives.'' This University of California study found that medication \nerrors are 3 times higher among outpatients than inpatients and medical \npersonnel in outpatient care provide limited oversight of medications' \nside effects.\n  Ms. Damico, the nurse interviewed on NPR, said, ``Patients return to \nus in acute states because their insurance will no longer pay the same \namount for their outpatient treatment * * * [They] deteriorate to the \npoint of suicidal thoughts or attempts and need to return to the \nhospital.'' She cited the example of a suicidal woman whose plan denied \na hospital admission requested by her physician. After the doctor told \nher of the denial, she took twenty 50-milligram tabs of Benadryl, was \nthen admitted, and the plan then had to pay for hospital care, an \nambulance and emergency room fees.\n  So not only do premature discharges compromise health, they also \nultimately cost the insurer more.\n  Physicians say they have to fight almost daily with insurance \ncompanies to give patients the hospital care they need and to justify \ntheir decisions about patient care.\n  An American Medical Association review of a managed care contract \n(Aetna US Healthcare) found that the contract gives ``the company the \nunilateral authority to change material terms of the contract and to \nmake determinations of medical necessity * * * without regard to \nphysician determinations or scientific or clinical protocols. * * *,'' \naccording to the January 19, 1998 American Medical News.\n  A study by the American Academy of Neurology found that the \nguidelines (Milliman and Robertson) used by many insurance companies on \nlength of stay are ``extraordinarily short in comparison to a large \nNational Library of Medicine database * * * And that [the guidelines] \ndo not relate to anything resembling the average hospital patient or \nattending physician * * *.'' The neurologists found that these \nguidelines were ``statistically developed,'' and not scientifically \nsound or clinically relevant.\n\n  A study in the April 1997 Bulletin of the American College of \nSurgeons\n\n[[Page S794]]\n\nfound that surgeons stated that the appropriate length of stay for an \nappendectomy is zero to five days, while insurance industry guidelines \nset a specific coverage limit of one day.\n  The arbitrary limits set by HMO's and insurance plans are resulting \nin unintended consequences. Some 7 in 10 physicians said that in \ndealing with managed care plans, they have exaggerated the severity of \na patient's condition to ``prevent him or her from being sent home from \na hospital prematurely.'' Dr. David Schriger, at UCLA Medical Center in \nLos Angeles, said that he routinely has patients such as a frail, \nelderly woman with the flu, who is not in imminent danger but could \nencounter serious problems if she is sent home during the night. He \ntold the Washington Post, ``At this point I have to figure out a way to \nput her in the hospital. . . . And typically, I'll come up with a \nreason acceptable to the insurer,'' and orders a blood test and chest \nx-ray to justify admission.\n  The Post article also cited Kaiser Permanente's Texas division, which \n``warned doctors in urgent care centers not to tell patients they \nrequired hospitalization,'' as one Kaiser administrator recalled. ``We \nbasically said [to] the UCC doctors, `If you value your job, you won't \nsay anything about hospitalization. All you'll say is, I think you need \nfurther evaluation. . . .' ''\n  Ms. Damico, the psychiatric nurse interviewed on NPR said, ``Our \nutilization review nurse gives all of us, including the doctors, good \nadvice on how to chart so that our patients' care will be covered. . . \n. We all conspire quietly to make certain the charts look and sound bad \nenough.''\n  On August 2, 1998, calling it the ``brave new world of managed \ncare,'' the San Jose Mercury News reported, ``to cut costs HMOs are \nshifting the burden of caring for the sick from their staff and \nprovider networks to patients themselves and their often ill-prepared \nfamily members,'' by reducing hospital stays. ``Patients who used to be \nin the hospital for a week after a hip replacement now stay only three \ndays; patients who had coronary artery bypass graft surgery are pushed \nout after four or five. Doctors are routinely performing operations in \noutpatient surgery centers, clinics or their offices, which were once \ndone in the hospital.'' This article cited, as examples, mastectomies, \nknee surgery, parts of bone marrow transplants, and cancer \nchemotherapies.\n  The American College of Surgeons said it all when this prestigious \norganization wrote: ``We believe very strongly that any health care \nsystem or plan that removes the surgeon and the patient from the \nmedical decision-making process only undermines the quality of that \npatient's care and his or her health and well-being. . . . specific, \nsingle numbers [of days] cannot and should not be used to represent a \nlength of stay for a given procedure.'' (April 24, 1997) ACS on March 5 \nwrote, ``We believe very strongly that any health care system or plan \nthat removes the surgeon and the patient from the medical decision \nmaking process only undermines the quality of that patient's care and \nhis or her health and well being.''\n  The American Medical Association wrote on May 20, 1998, ``We are \ngratified that this bill would promote the fundamental concept, which \nthe AMA has always endorsed, that medical decisions should be made by \npatients and their physicians, rather than by insurers or legislators.  \n. . . We appreciate your initiative and ongoing efforts to protect \npatients by ensuring that physicians may identify medically appropriate \nlengths of stay, unfettered by third party payers.''\n  The American Psychological Association, on March 4, 1998 wrote me, \n``We are pleased to support this legislation, which will require all \nhealth plans to follow the best judgment of the patient and attending \nprovider when determining length of stay for inpatient treatment.''\n  New treatments, particularly less invasive treatments, have shortened \nmany hospital stays, but so also has pressure from insurers. Business \nand Health magazine reported in ``The State of Health Care in America \n1998'' that ``HMOs and capitated point-of-service plans'' were \nassociated with the lowest inpatient stays. Other studies reveal that \nin areas with high HMO competition, health care utilization is lower \nfor the entire population.'' This study shows that for patients with \ntraditional fee-for-service insurance, the average length of stay in \n1995 was 4.9 days. For HMOs, it was 4.2 days. California Health Care \nAssociation data show that in my state, the average length of stay has \ndeclined from 5.70 days in 1986 to 4.45 in 1995. A study in the spring \n1996 issue of Health Affairs concluded that the number of inpatient \ndays per thousand residents is lower and has declined faster in \nCalifornia than the national average. The average length of stay in \nCalifornia in 1996 was 5.3 days, while nationally it was 6.4 days. For \nexample, a woman getting a mastectomy in New York will stay in the \nhospital an average of 5.78 days, but a mastectomy patient in \nCalifornia is likely to stay 2.98 days. (Inquiry, winter 1997-1998).\n  Americans are disenchanted with the health insurance system in this \ncountry, as HMO hassles mount and physicians get effectively overruled \nby insurance companies. Arbitrary insurance company rules cannot \naddress the subtleties of medical care. Three out of every four \nAmericans are worried about their health care coverage and half say \nthey are worried that doctors are basing treatment decisions strictly \non what insurance plans will pay for.\n  This bill is one step toward returning medical decision-making to \nthose medical professionals trained to make medical decisions.\n\n\n           summary of the hospital length of stay act of 1998\n\n  Requires plans to cover hospital lengths of stay for all illnesses \nand conditions as determined by the physician, in consultation with the \npatient, to be medically appropriate.\n  Prohibits plans from requiring providers (physicians) to obtain a \nplan's prior authorization for a hospital length of stay.\n  Prohibits plans from denying eligibility or renewal for the purpose \nof avoiding these requirements.\n  Prohibits plans from penalizing or otherwise reducing or limiting \nreimbursement of the attending physician because the physician provided \ncare in accordance with the requirements of the bill.\n  Prohibits plans from providing monetary or other incentives to induce \na physician to provide care inconsistent with these requirements.\n  Includes language clarifying that--\n  Nothing in the bill requires individuals to stay in the hospital for \na fixed period of time for any procedure;\n  Plans may require copayments but copayments for a hospital stay \ndetermined by the physician cannot exceed copayments for any preceding \nportion of the stay.\n  Does not pre-empt state laws that provide greater protection.\n  Applies to private insurance plans, Medicare, Medicaid, Medigap, \nfederal employees' plans, Children's Health Insurance Plan, the Indian \nHealth Service\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 265\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing three bills to \nstop the contamination of California's drinking water by the gasoline \nadditive MTBE.\n  First, I am introducing a bill to allow California to apply its own \nclean or reformulated gasoline rules as long as emissions reductions \nare equivalent or greater. California's rules are stricter than the \nfederal rules and thus meet the air quality requirements of the federal \nClean Air Act. This bill is the companion to H.R. 11 introduced by \nRepresentative Bilbray on January 6, 1998.\n  MTBE or methyl tertiary butyl either is added to gasoline by some \nrefiners in response to federal requirements that areas with the most \nserious air pollution problems use what is called ``reformulated \ngasoline,'' a type of cleaner-burning gasoline. The federal law \nrequires that this gasoline contain 2 percent by weight oxygenate. MTBE \nhas been the oxygenate of choice by some refiners.\n  The major source of MTBE in groundwater appears to be leaking \nunderground storage tanks. In surface water, it is recreational \ngasoline-powered boating and personal watercraft, according to the \nCalifornia Environmental Protection Agency.\n  The second bill requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to \nmake petroleum releases into drinking water the highest priority in the \nfederal underground storage tank cleanup program. This bill is needed \nbecause underground storage tanks are the major source of MTBE into \ndrinking water and federal law does not give EPA specific guidance on \ncleanup priorities.\n  The third bill will move from 2006 to 2001 full implementation of \nEPA's current watercraft engine exhaust emissions requirements. The \nCalifornia Air Resources Board on December 10, 1998, adopted watercraft \nengine regulations in effect making the federal EPA rules effective in \n2001, so this bill will make the deadline in the federal requirements \nconsistent with California's deadlines. In addition, the bill will \nrequire an emissions label on these engines consistent with \nCalifornia's requirements so the consumer can make an informed \npurchasing choice. This bill is needed because watercraft engines have \nremained essentially unchanged since the 1930s and up to 30 percent of \nthe gas that goes into the motor goes into water unburned.\n\n  These three bills represent three steps toward getting MRBE out of \nCalifornia's drinking water.\n\n\n                Bill 1: The California Clean Gas Formula\n\n  The Feinstein-Bilbray bill would provide that if a state's \nreformulated gasoline rules achieve equal or greater emissions \nreductions than federal regulations, a state's rules will take \nprecedence. The bill would apply only to states which have received \nwaivers under Section 209(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act. California is the \nonly state currently eligible for this waiver, a waiver allowing \nCalifornia to set its own fuel standards. The other 49 states do not \nset their own fuel specifications.\n  This bill would exempt California from overlapping federal oxygenate \nrequirements and give gasoline manufacturers the flexibility to reduce \nor even eliminate the use of MTBE, while not reducing our air quality.\n  In 1994, the CARB adopted a ``predictive model,'' which is a \nperformance based program that allows refiners to use innovative fuel \nformulations to meet clean air requirements. The predictive model \nprovides twice the clean air benefits required by the federal \ngovernment. With this model, refiners can make cleaner burning gasoline \nwith one percent oxygen or even no oxygen at all. The federal two \npercent oxygenate requirement limits this kind of innovation. In fact, \nTosco and Shell are already making MTBE-free gasoline.\n  In addition, Chevron has said:\n\n       MTBE is the best oxygenate of choice for blending CBG \n     (clean burning gasoline) in California refineries. . . . \n     However, consistent with our desire to reduce or eliminate \n     MTBE from cleaner burning gas (CBG), we want the flexibility \n     to be able to make prudent use of any oxygenate--MTBE, \n     ethanol, or the use of no oxygenate--while meeting the \n     emissions performance standards of reformulated gasolines. If \n     the government allows this flexibility, Chevron would likely \n     use more ethanol than now to efficiently provide cleaning \n     burning gasoline.\n\n  The legislation allows that companies who serve California's gasoline \nneeds to continue to adopt innovative formulas for cleaner burning \ngasoline without contaminating the water.\n  The University of California study, released in November, recommended \nphasing our MTBE and concluded that oil companies can make cleaner-\nburning gasoline that meets federal air standards without MTBE.\n\n\n               the problem: drinking water contamination\n\n  Contamination of California's drinking water by MTBE is growing \nalmost daily. A December 14, 1998 San Francisco Chronicle headline \ncalls MTBE a ``Ticking Bomb.'' The University of California study says, \n``If MTBE continues to be used at current levels and more sources \nbecome contaminated, the potential for regional degradation of water \nresources, especially groundwater basins, will increase. Severity of \nwater shortages during drought years will be exacerbated.''\n  In higher concentrations, MTBE smells like turpentine and it tastes \nlike paint thinner. Relatively low levels of MTBE can simply make \ndrinking water simply undrinkable.\n  MTBE is a highly soluble organic compound which moves quickly through \nsoil and gravel. It therefore poses a more rapid threat to water \nsupplies than other constituents of gasoline when leaks occur. MTBE is \neasily traced, but is very difficult and expensive to cleanup. The \nAssociation of California Water Agencies estimates that it would cost \nas much as $1 million per well to install treatment technology to \nremove MTBE from drinking water. Without these funds, the only option \nis to shut down wells.\n  MTBE use has escalated from 12,000 barrels a day in 1980 to about \n100,000 barrels today, according to CARB. EPA says that about 30 \npercent of the nation's gasoline is reformulated gas and MTBE is used \nin about 84 percent of reformulated gasoline. Two-thirds of \nCalifornia's gasoline is subject to the federal oxygenate requirement. \nThis growth in use of MTBE is directly attributable to the requirements \nof the Federal Clean Air Act.\n\n\n                        contamination widespread\n\n  A June 12, 1998 Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory study \nconcluded that MTBE is a ``frequent and widespread contaminant'' in \ngroundwater throughout California and does not degrade significantly \nonce it is there. This study found that groundwater has been \ncontaminated at over 10,000 shallow monitoring sites. The Livermore\n\n[[Page S798]]\n\nstudy says that ``MTBE has the potential to impact regional groundwater \nresources and may present a cumulative contamination hazard.''\n  Californians are more dependent on groundwater as a source of \ndrinking water than most Americans. According to the U.S. Geological \nSurvey, 69 percent of California's population relies on groundwater as \ntheir source of drinking water, while for the U.S. population at large, \n53 percent of the population relies on groundwater.\n  Similarly, the Association of California Water Agencies reports that \nMTBE has impacted over 10,000 sites.\n  MTBE has been detected in drinking water supplies in a number of \ncities, including Santa Monica, Riverside, Anaheim, Los Angeles, San \nFrancisco, Sebastopol, Manteca, and San Diego. MTBE has also been \ndetected in numerous California reservoirs, including Lake Shasta in \nRedding, San Pablo and Cherry reservoirs in the Bay Area, and Coyote \nand Anderson reservoirs in Santa Clara.\n  Santa Monica lost 75 percent of its groundwater supply; the South \nLake Tahoe Public Utility District has lost over one-third of drinking \nwater wells. Drinking water wells in Santa Clara Valley (Great Oaks \nWater Company) and Sacramento (Fruitridge Vista Water Company) have \nbeen shut down because of MTBE contamination.\n  In addition, MTBE has been detected in the following surface water \nreservoirs: Lake Perris (Metropolitan Water District of Southern \nCalifornia), Anderson Reservoir (Santa Clara Valley Water District), \nCanyon Lake (Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District), Pardee \nReservoir and San Pablo Reservoir (East Bay Municipal Utility \nDistrict), Lake Berryessa (Solano County Water Agency).\n  The largest contamination occurred in the city of Santa Monica, which \nlost 75% of its groundwater supply as a result of MTBE leaking out of \nshallow gas tanks beneath the surface; MTBE has been discovered in \npublicly owned wells approximately 100 feet from City Council Chamber \nin South Lake Tahoe; In Glennvile, California, near Bakersfield, MTBE \nlevels have been detected in groundwater as high as 190,000 parts per \nbillion--dramatically exceeding the California Department of Health \nadvisory of 35 parts per billion; and\n\n\n                            dangers of mtbe\n\n  The United States EPA has indicated that ``MTBE is an animal \ncarcinogen and has a human carcinogenic hazard potential.''\n  Studies to assess hazards to animals have found that MTBE is \ncarcinogenic in rodents in high doses. MTBE has been linked to leukemia \nand lymphomas in female rats and an increase in benign testicular \ntumors in male rats. Studies of inhalation exposure in rats have also \nshown increased incidence of kidney, testicular, and liver tumors. \nInhalation exposure has also resulted in adverse effect on developing \nmouse fetuses.\n  The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services and the Centers \nfor Disease Control monitored concentrations of MTBE in the air and in \nthe blood of humans in 1992 and 1993. Blood levels of MTBE were \nanalyzed in gasoline station and car-repair workers and commuters. \nPeople with higher blood levels of MTBE were significantly more likely \nto report more headaches, eye irritation, nausea, dizziness, burning of \nthe nose and throat, coughing, disorientation and vomiting, compared \nwith those who had lower blood levels. From these studies, EPA \nconcluded, ``MTBE can pose a hazard of non-cancer effects to humans at \nhigh doses. The data do not support confident quantitative estimations \nor risk at low exposure.''\n\n\n     california's regulations can achieve what federal law intends\n\n  The federal gasoline oxygenate requirement went into effect in \nDecember 1994, affecting areas where the air quality is the worst. \nToday, reformulated gasoline is required by federal law in the \nfollowing areas of California:\n  Year-round: Oxygenates are required to be used in the South Coast Air \nBasin (the counties of Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernadino, Orange, \nVentura) and the Sacramento metropolitan area (which includes all of \nSacramento County and portions of Yolo, Placer and Eldorado County).\n  Wintertime: Oxygenates are required to be added to gasoline in the \nSouthern California Air Basin (the entire counties of Los Angeles, \nRiverside, San Bernardino, Orange, and Ventura), Imperial County, \nFresno and Lake Tahoe.\n  While federal Clean Air Act regulations were being promulgated, the \nCalifornia Air Resources Board developed more stringent air standards, \nusing a ``predictive model.''\n  The Clean Air Act has no doubt helped reduce emissions throughout the \nUnited States, but the federal requirements have imposed limitations on \nthe level of flexibility that U.S. EPA can grant to California. The \noverlapping applicability of both the federal and state reformulated \ngasoline rules has actually prohibited gasoline manufacturers from \nresponding as effectively as possible to unforseen problems with their \nproduct. This bill addresses exactly this type of situation.\n  This legislation rewards California for its unique and effective \napproach in solving its own air quality problems by permitting it an \nexemption from federal oxygenate requirements as long as tough \nenvironmental standards are enforced. This bill does not weaken the \nClean Air Act, but instead is a step in the right direction, towards \nsound environmental policy. It is a narrowly-targeted bill designed to \nmake our drinking water clean to drink. With this bill, California is \nonce again taking the initiative to lead the way in ensuring the \nprotection of the air we breath, and the water we drink.\n  By allowing the companies that supply our state's gasoline to use \ngood science and sound environmental policy, we can achieve the goals \nset forth by the Clean Air Act, without sacrificing California's clean \nwater.\n\n\n                  california, a leader in air cleanup\n\n  California's efforts to improve air quality predate similar federal \nefforts and have achieved marked success in reducing emissions, \nresulting in the cleanest air Californians have seen in decades.\n  Since the introduction of California Cleaner Burning Gasoline \nprogram, there has been a 300 ton per day decrease in ozone forming \ningredients found in the air. This is the emission reduction equivalent \nof taking 3.5 million automobiles off the road. California reformulated \ngasoline reduces smog forming emissions from vehicles by 15 percent.\n  The state has also seen a marked decrease in first stage smog alerts, \nduring which residents with respiratory ailments are encouraged to stay \nindoors.\n  John Dunlap, former Chairman of California's Air Board, who supports \nthis legislation, has said:\n\n       . . . our program has proven (to have) a significant effect \n     on California's air quality. Following the introduction of \n     California's gasoline program in the spring of 1996, \n     monitored levels of ozone . . . were reduced by 10 percent in \n     Northern California, and by 18 percent in the Los Angeles \n     area. Benzene levels (have decreased) by more than 50 \n     percent.\n\n\n                      this bill should be enacted\n\n  There are several reasons to enact this bill:\n  1. Studies confirm need to eliminate MTBE.\n  The June 11, 1998 Lawrence Livermore study found MTBE at 10,000 sites \nand said it is ``a frequent and widespread contaminant in shallow \ngroundwater throughout California.''\n  A five-volume University of California November 12, 1998 study \nconcluded that MTBE provides ``no significant air quality benefit'' and \nthat if its use is continued, ``the potential for regional degradation \nof water resources, especially groundwater, will increase.'' The \nlandmark UC study recommended that MTBE use be phased out and that \nrefiners be given the flexibility of the state's clean gas regulations.\n  2. MTBE is not needed. California can meet federal clean air \nstandards by using our own state clean gas regulations.\n  The California Air Resources Board has testified that we can have \nequivalent or greater reductions in emissions and improve air quality \nusing California's regulations. These standards are more stringent than \nthe federal requirements, but offer gasoline refiners more flexibility.\n  3. MTBE in drinking water poses health risks.\n  MTBE is an animal carcinogen and a potential human carcinogen. It \ntastes bad. It smells bad. It may have other harmful human health \neffects.\n  4. The dangers of MTBE were not considered when Congress last amended \nthe Clear Air Act in 1990.\n\n[[Page S799]]\n\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, during Congress's \nconsideration of the Clean Air Act Amendments, which became law in \n1990, there was no discussion of the possible adverse impacts of MTBE \nas a gasoline additive. Likewise, CARB has said that when they were \nconsidering our state's reformulated gasoline regulations, ``the \nconcern over the use of oxygenates was not raised as an issue.''\n  5. California needs water.\n  California cannot afford to lose any more of its drinking water. \nAccording to the Association of California Water Agencies, by the year \n2020, California will be 4 million to 6 million acre-feet short of \nwater each year without additional facilities and water management \nstrategies.\n  5. Congress has long recognized that California is a unique case.\n  California's efforts to improve air quality predate similar federal \nefforts. We have our own clean gas program and U.S. EPA has given the \nstate a waiver under section 209(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act to develop \nour own program.\n\n\n                           widespread support\n\n  I am appending at the end of my statement a list of California local \ngovernments, water districts, air districts, statewide and other \norganizations that support my MTBE bill.\n\n\n                bill 2: stopping underground tank leaks\n\n  My second bill will make threats to drinking water the highest \npriority in the federal underground tank cleanup program at EPA.\n  In 1986, Congress created a Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) \nTrust Fund, funded by a one-tenth of one cent tax on all petroleum \nproducts. These funds are available to enforce cleanup requirements; to \nconduct cleanups where there is no financially viable responsible party \nor where a responsible party fails to correct; to take corrective \naction in emergencies; and to bring actions against parties who fail to \ncomply. There is approximately $1.5 billion currently in the fund.\n  Under current law, section 9003(h)(3) of the Solid Waste Disposal \nAct, EPA is required to give priority in corrective actions to \npetroleum releases from tanks which pose ``the greatest threat to human \nhealth and the environment,'' a provision that I support. My bill would \nadd simple clarifying language that in essence says that threats to \ndrinking water are the most serious threats and should receive priority \nattention.\n  Leaking underground gasoline storage tank systems are the major \nsource of MTBE into drinking water. The June 11, 1998 Lawrence \nLivermore Laboratory study that examined 236 tanks in 24 California \ncounties found MTBE at 78 percent of these sites. These scientists said \nthat a minimum estimate of the number of MTBE-impacted tank sites in my \nstate is over 10,000. Federal law requires tanks to have protections \nagainst spills, overfills, and tank corrosion by December 22, 1998. \nTank owners have had ten years to do this. EPA has estimated that half \nthe nation's 600,000 tanks and 52 percent of California's 61,000 \ncomplied by the December 22 deadline.\n\n  Clearly, stopping these leaks is a big part of the solution of \nstopping the release of MTBE. Making threats to drinking water a top \ncleanup priority makes sense since clean drinking water is fundamental \nto human health.\n\n\n                       bill 3: motorcraft engines\n\n  My third bill addresses a third source of MTBE into drinking water--\nwatercraft engines. The Association of California Water Agencies says \nthat MTBE in surface water reservoirs comes largely from recreational \nwatercraft.\n  In October 1996, U.S. EPA published regulations, starting in model \nyear 1998, requiring stricter emissions controls on personal watercraft \nengines to be fully implemented by 2006. On December 10, 1998, the \nCalifornia Air Resources Board adopted regulations very similar to \nEPA's in substance, but accelerating their effective date to 2001, five \nyears earlier. In addition, California added two more ``tiers'' of \nemissions reductions that go beyond U.S. EPA's, reducing emissions by \n20 percent more in 2004 and 65 percent more in 2008. Under the federal \nrequirements, there would be a complete fleet turnover by 2050; in \nCalifornia, there would be a complete fleet turnover in 2024, 26 years \nearlier.\n  The federal and the California rules apply to (1) spark-ignition \noutboard marine and (2) personal watercraft engines, such as \nmotorboats, jet skis and wave runners, beginning in model year 2001.\n  Outboard engines: In 1990, there were 373,200 gasoline-powered \noutboard engines in California. California sales of outboard engines \nrepresented ten percent of the U.S. market in 1997.\n  Personal watercraft: California sales of these engines were 12 \npercent of the 176,000 sales in the U.S. in 1995, numbers which have no \ndoubt grown significantly. Personal watercraft like jet skis have \nincreased by 240 percent since 1990 and these numbers are expected to \ndouble by 2020.\n  We need to curb emissions from these marine engines because (1) \nunlike automobiles which exhaust into the air, all marine engines \nexhaust directly into the water, and (2) 20 to 30 percent of the gas \nthat goes in, comes out unburned. According to CARB, these engines \n``discharge an unburned fuel/oil mixture at levels approaching 20 to 30 \npercent of the fuel/oil mixture consumed. This unregulated discharge of \nfuel and oil threatens degradation of high quality waters . . .'' CARB \nsays that two hours of exhaust emissions from a jet ski is equivalent \nto the emission created by driving a 1998 automobile 130,000 miles. \nSome areas are considering banning jet skis and gas-powered boats.\n  My bill does two things: (1) It would make the EPA's existing \nregulations effective in 2001, instead of 2006, consistent with \nCalifornia's regulations. (2) It would direct EPA to make one addition \nto their current regulation, an engine labeling requirement, consistent \nwith California's labeling requirement, designed to inform consumers of \nthe relative emissions level of new engines.\n  Because these engines put MTBE and other constituents of gasoline \ninto surface waters, I believe we need to accelerate the national rules \nto discourage people from ``engine shopping'' from state to state and \nbringing ``dirty'' engines into California. Because my state's \nrelatively mild weather encourages boating, our air board concluded \nthat we need more stringent standards than the national standards. Up \nto 30 percent of gasoline in these engines comes out unburned. In other \nwords, of 10 gallons per hour used, about two and one half gallons of \nfuel goes into the water unburned in one hour. This has to stop.\n  The November 1998 University of California study recognizes the \nemissions of MTBE into surface waters from watercraft and says that \ntechnologies are available that will ``significantly reduce MTBE \nloading,'' that the older carbureted two-stroke engines release much \nlarger amounts of MTBE and other gasoline constituents than the fuel-\ninjected engines or the four-stroke engines.\n  Millions of Californians should not have to drink water contaminated \nwith MTBE. I believe we must take strong steps to end this \ncontamination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

                    S. Con. Res. 2\n\n       Whereas the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia \n     are undergoing an historic process of democratic and free \n     market transformation after emerging from decades of brutal \n     Soviet occupation;\n       Whereas each of the Baltic states has conducted peaceful \n     transfers of political power--in Lithuania since 1990 and in \n     Latvia and Estonia since 1991;\n       Whereas each of the Baltic states has been exemplary and \n     consistent in its respect for human rights and civil \n     liberties;\n       Whereas the governments of the Baltic states have made \n     consistent progress toward establishing civilian control of \n     their militaries through active participation in the \n     Partnership for Peace program and North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) peace support operations;\n       Whereas Lithuania is participating in the NATO-led \n     multinational military force in the Republic of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina (commonly referred to as ``SFOR'') and is \n     consistently increasing its defense budget allocations with \n     the goal of allocating at least 2 percent of its GDP for \n     defense by 2001;\n       Whereas each of the Baltic states has clearly demonstrated \n     its ability to operate with the military forces of NATO \n     nations and under NATO standards;\n       Whereas former Secretary of Defense Perry stipulated five \n     generalized standards for entrance into NATO: support for \n     democracy, including toleration of ethnic diversity and \n     respect for human rights; building a free market economy; \n     civilian control of the military; promotion of good \n     neighborly relations; and development of military \n     interoperability with NATO; and\n       Whereas each of the Baltic states has satisfied these \n     standards for entrance into NATO: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are to be commended for \n     their progress toward political and economic liberty and \n     meeting the guidelines for prospective members of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) set out in chapter 5 of \n     the September 1995 Study on NATO Enlargement;\n       (2) Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia would make an \n     outstanding contribution toward furthering the goals of NATO \n     should they become members;\n       (3) extension of full NATO membership to the Baltic states \n     would contribute to stability, freedom, and peace in the \n     Baltic region and Europe as a whole; and\n       (4) with complete satisfaction of NATO guidelines and \n     criteria for membership, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia \n     should be invited to become full members of NATO.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this past Saturday, January 16th, marked \nthe one-year anniversary of the signing of the Baltic Charter.\n  I attended that historic ceremony at the White House and our efforts \nthat day were important not only to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia but \nto the U.S. as well. This is an issue dear to me; my mother came to \nthis country from Lithuania in 1911 and I've visited this country and \nthe Baltic region several times.\n  Now Mr. President, the Baltic Charter solidified the international \nrelationship between the U.S. and the Baltic nations by defining the \npolitical, economic, and security relations between our countries. It \naffirmed a\n\n[[Page S801]]\n\nshared commitment to promoting harmonious and equitable relations among \nindividuals belonging to diverse ethnic and religious groups. It also \nstressed the promotion of close cooperative relationships throughout \nthe Baltic region, on such issues as economics, trade, the environment, \nand transnational problems like the bilateral relations between the \nBaltics and its neighboring states.\n  President Clinton welcomed the Baltic nations' efforts to improve \nrelations with Russia. The four presidents involved discussed \ndevelopments in Northeastern Europe, and President Clinton pledged more \nU.S. involvement in that region's development and cooperation with its \nneighbors.\n  The Baltic Charter does not commit the Baltic states to NATO \nmembership. I believe these nations would be included in NATO, but they \nwill have to meet the same criteria and standards expected of other \nstates that wish to join NATO.\n  A year ago I noted that this charter would bring the U.S. and the \nBaltic nations closer than ever before. And, Mr. President, I'm happy \nto report that the United States has made good on its promise to these \nnations and I hope we'll do everything we can to strengthen these great \nnew democracies and reaffirm their desire to become full members of the \nEuropean Union and NATO.\n  For over 50 years, we have recognized the sovereignty of the \nrepublics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.

Res. 27\n\n       Whereas the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission \n     on Human Rights in Geneva, Switzerland, provides a forum for \n     discussing human rights and expressing international support \n     for improved human rights performance;\n       Whereas according to the United States Department of State \n     and international human rights organizations, the Government \n     of the People's Republic of China continues to commit \n     widespread and well-documented human rights abuses, in \n     violation of internationally-accepted norms, stemming from \n     the authorities' intolerance of dissent, fear of unrest, and \n     the absence or inadequacy of laws protecting basic freedoms;\n       Whereas China is bound by the Universal Declaration of the \n     Human Rights and recently signed the International Covenant \n     on Civil and Political Rights, but has yet to take the \n     necessary steps to make the covenant legally binding;\n       Whereas the Administration decided not to sponsor a \n     resolution criticizing China at the U.N. Human Rights \n     Commission in 1998 in consideration of Chinese commitments to \n     sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \n     and based on a belief that progress on human rights in China \n     could be achieved through other means;\n       Whereas the Chinese authorities have recently escalated \n     efforts to extinguish expressions of protest or criticism, \n     and detained scores of citizens associated with attempts to \n     organize a legal democratic opposition, as well as religious \n     leaders, writers, and others who petitioned the authorities \n     to release those arbitrarily arrested; and\n       Whereas these recent crackdowns underscore that the Chinese \n     government has not retreated from its longstanding pattern of \n     human rights abuses, despite expectations from two summit \n     meetings between President Clinton and President Jiang, in \n     which assurances of improvements in China's human rights \n     record were made: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that at the \n     54th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in \n     Geneva, the United States should introduce and make all \n     efforts necessary to pass a resolution criticizing the \n     People's Republic of China for its human rights abuses in \n     China and Tibet.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today, I am submitting legislation to \nurge the President to sponsor a resolution condemning China's human \nrights record at the next session of the U.N. Commission on Human \nRights this March and to begin immediately contacting other governments \nto urge them to cosponsor such a resolution.\n  When President Clinton formally delinked trade and human rights in \n1994, he pledged, on the record, that the U.S. would ``step up its \nefforts, in cooperation with other states, to insist that the United \nNations Human Rights Commission pass a resolution dealing with the \nserious human rights abuses in China.'' While the U.S. has claimed an \nintention at least to speak out on human rights, the substance of U.S.-\nChina relations--trade, military contacts, high level summits--go \nforward while Chinese leaders continue to crackdown on every last \ndissident in a country of over one billion people.\n  The Chinese government continues to commit widespread abuses, and \nsince\n\n[[Page S802]]\n\nthe President's visit in June, has taken actions that flagrantly \nviolate the commitments it has made to respect internationally \nrecognized human rights. Recently, it sentenced three of China's most \nprominent pro-democracy advocates, Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai, and Chin \nYougmin, to a combined prison term of thirty-five years. These \ndisgraceful arrests were part of a crackdown by the government on \nefforts to form the country's first opposition political party. \nFurther, a businessman in Shanghai, Lin Hai, is now being tried for \nproviding E-mail addresses to a prodemocracy internet magazine in the \nUnited States. Another democracy activist, Zhang Shanguang, was \nconvicted and sentenced to ten years in prison for giving Radio Free \nAsia information about protests by farmers in Hunan province. These \nevents are occurring against a backdrop of growing repression, such as \nthe adoption of strict new regulations on the formation of non-\ngovernmental political and social organizations, and the imposition of \ntough new regulations on film directors, computer software developers, \nartists and the press if they ``endanger social order'' or attempt to \n``overthrow state power''.\n  The arrested dissidents and their courageous supporters deserve our \nfull backing, and the Administration's, in their historic struggle to \nbring democracy to China. At the June summit in Beijing, President \nClinton engaged in a spirited debate on human rights with President \nJiang Zemin. In light of this brutal, recent crackdown, I urge the \nAdministration to bring a resolution at Geneva in March and to register \nits continuing deep concern on two issues President Clinton raised with \nPresident Jiang at the summit--the absence of freedom of expression and \nassociation, and the use of arbitrary detention in China. Past \nexperience has demonstrated that, when the United States has applied \nsustained pressure, the Chinese authorities have responded in ways that \nsignal their willingness to engage on the issue of human rights. This \npressure needs to be exercised now. By sponsoring a resolution at the \nU.N. Human Rights Commission, the United States will demonstrate its \ncommitment to securing China's adherence to international human rights \nstandards..\n  On October 5, 1998, China signed the International Covenant on Civil \nand Political Rights, but it has yet to take the necessary steps to \nmake it legally binding. The Administration agreed early in 1998 not to \nsponsor a resolution criticizing China at the U.N. Human Rights \nCommission in consideration of Chinese commitments on human rights, \nincluding the signing of this important covenant. Yet, the recent acts \nof intimidation and detention underscore that the Chinese government \nhas not retreated from its longstanding pattern of serious human rights \nabuses.\n  It is time for the United States to provide the leadership which the \npeople of China depend on. We must take action to submit a resolution \non China in Geneva and build international support for its passage. The \nU.N. Human Rights Commission is the only international body which \noversees the human rights conditions of all states. Even though the \nresolution may not pass, simply the debate of human rights in China and \nTibet at the Commission will make an important difference.\n  I have had the great honor of knowing and becoming friends with Wei \nJingsheng this past year. Mr. Wei is a Chinese dissident who has spent \nmost of his life in Chinese prisons for his pro-democratic political \nwritings. In an article published shortly after his release, Mr. Wei \nstated, ``Democracy and freedom are among the loftiest ideals of \nhumanity, and they are the most sacred rights of mankind. Those who \nalready enjoy democracy, liberty and human rights, in particular, \nshould not allow their own personal happiness to numb them into \nforgetting that many others who are still struggling against tyranny, \nslavery, and poverty, and all of those who are suffering from \nunimaginable forms of oppression, exploitation and massacres.''\n  Mr. President, the United States must not take its freedom for \ngranted. As Americans, we must take action and sponsor and lead the \ninternational effort to condemn the human rights situation in China and \nTibet. I hope that my colleagues will join me in passing this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/20/senate-section/article/S801-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I am pleased to sponsor the Tax Cuts \nfor All Americans Act with Senator Rod Grams, Senator Lott, the \ndistinguished Majority Leader, and other Members.\n  Let me begin by saying that this Congress holds the promise of being \nthe most productive in recent memory because we have the opportunity to \nbuild on some notable successes. In just the past few years we reformed \nthe IRS, provided tax relief, voted to ratify NATO enlargement, \nexpanded health care for children, and created new opportunities for \nAmericans to save--all while balancing the budget and strengthening \nMedicare.\n  Our agenda for the next two years must be to build on these \nsuccesses. Accomplishing this will include tax reform, shoring up \nSocial Security, and promoting economic opportunity for individuals and \nfamilies.\n  It is wrong that in an era of every-increasing budget surpluses \nAmericans are being taxed more than ever before. It is wrong that 20.5% \nof our GDP is going into federal coffers--the highest since World War \nII--that our families are finding it increasingly difficult to send \ntheir children to school, and to become self-reliant in retirement.\n  This Congress can do something about that. We will do something about \nit. With this legislation we offer Americans a ten percent across-the-\nboard tax cut--a broad-based tax cut--one that will put money where it \nbelongs, in the hands of those who earn it. The budget surplus will \nallow this. It allows us to do this and to shore up Social Security at \nthe same time. Washington demonstrated last year that unless the \nsurplus is given back to the taxpayer the government will spend it.\n  The Tax Cuts for All Americans Act is the right and necessary thing \nto do. The broad-based tax cut in this package is the simplest, \nfairest, and--I believe--most productive way to give the money back to \nthe taxpayer and to see that the economic growth our nation is enjoying \ncontinues well into the future. Broad-based tax cuts will also be the \nbest way to return hard-earned money to the taxpayer without increasing \nIRS intrusion into the lives of Americans.\n  Beyond this legislation, in this Congress we will also address the \nAlternative Minimum Tax--a set of rules in the code that has grown out \nof control. The AMT was originally intended to ensure that wealthy \ntaxpayers were\n\n[[Page S803]]\n\nnot able to use loopholes and shelters to arrive at a zero tax \nliability. Unfortunately, due to the fact that the AMT was not indexed \nit has turned into a debilitating liability with the code affecting \nmillions of middle-income taxpayers. Something must be done.\n  These proposals are all about one thing: increasing personal and \nfamily financial security--helping Americans meet their needs today and \nprepare for their needs tomorrow. I intend to push this agenda by going \nbeyond a broad-based tax cut and creating incentives to promote and \nstrengthen pensions and personal retirement accounts. I have proposed a \nplan to increase IRA contributions to $5,000 a year, and to allow up to \n$2,000 a year to be placed into education savings accounts.\n  I will also introduce legislation to dedicate a portion of the ever-\nincreasing budget surplus to creating Personal Retirement Accounts for \nevery worker--giving individuals at all income levels an opportunity to \nown a piece of America's economic future.\n  This is the most important agenda we can have as we look to a new \nmillennium--a millennium that I believe will be bright and prosperous, \none that will hold great promise for all Americans if we stay focused, \nwork cooperatively, and put the interests of hard-working taxpaying \nfamilies before the interests of a big-spending, over-bearing \ngovernment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/20/senate-section/article/S802-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO BENJAMIN H. HARDY, JR.\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nBenjamin H. Hardy, Jr., an outstanding Georgian whose insight and \ncourage helped shape the course for U.S. foreign policy for decades and \npaved the way for the people of many nations to improve their lives.\n  On January 20th, 1949, precisely fifty years ago today, President \nHarry Truman gave his inaugural address to the nation and, in doing so, \nspelled out his four point plan for U.S. foreign policy. The first \nthree points of the plan were consistent with President Truman's \nprevious policies in support of the United Nations, the Marshall Plan \nand our NATO allies. The fourth point of the plan, however, was a \n``bold new program'' to provide technical assistance to developing \nnations which subsequently became known as ``Point Four.'' The idea for \nthe new assistance program was developed by Mr. Hardy, who, at the \ntime, was serving as a public affairs officer in the Department of \nState. Mr. Hardy had seen the rewards of technical assistance while \nworking in Brazil and knew that this type of assistance was the key to \nunleashing the potential of so many developing countries.\n  According to various accounts, Mr. Hardy risked his career to bring \nhis brilliant proposal to light and, ultimately, assisted in drafting \nthe foreign policy portion of President Truman's address. Responding to \na White House request for new initiatives in foreign affairs, Mr. Hardy \nproduced his plan. However, his plan was not received favorably by the \nupper levels of the State Department and was sent back for ``further \nreview''--virtually killing the idea. Refusing to give up, Mr. Hardy \nbypassed the normal channels of bureaucratic red tape and policy review \nand went directly to a contact inside the White House. There, Mr. \nHardy's development plan was greeted much more favorably and soon made \nits way to President Truman's desk and, later, into the President's \nState of the Union address.\n  Point Four received widespread acclaim and, soon after Truman's \naddress, Congress created the Technical Cooperation Administration \nwithin the Department of State. Mr. Hardy went on to serve as chief of \npublic affairs and chairman of the Administration's policy planning \ncommittee. On December 23rd of 1951 Mr. Hardy was killed in a plane \ncrash along with the director of the Technical Cooperation \nAdministration, Dr. Henry Bennet. Soon, the Technical Cooperation \nAdministration was transformed into the agencies responsible for \nforeign aid but the Point Four idea, remains vibrant today. It survives \nin the U.S. Agency for International Development, the agency which \nworks to develop, train, educate, and strengthen democracy in the most \nneedy countries across the globe.\n  Were it not for the determination of Mr. Benjamin Hardy, these \nagencies, and their successes, may never have been realized. Benjamin \nHardy is a wonderful example of one person making a difference in the \nworld and I am honored today to recognize the indelible mark this \ndistinguished Georgian has left upon the history of this nation and the \npeople of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/20/senate-section/article/S803-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S803-S804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AIR TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Air \nTransportation Improvement Act. This bill would provide a two-year \nauthorization for the programs of the Federal Aviation Administration \n(FAA), including the Airport Improvement Program (AIP). As Senator \nMcCain has noted, this bill is almost exactly the same as S. 2279, \nwhich the Senate passed last September by a vote of 92 to one. The only \ndifferences are technical in nature.\n  I would like to commend Senator McCain for moving quickly to deal \nwith FAA reauthorization in a timely manner. If no action is taken, the \nAIP will expire on March 31, 1999, and airports will not receive much \nneeded federal grants that would allow them to continue to operate both \nsafely and efficiently. The Air Transportation Improvement Act would \nestablish contract authority for the program. Without this authority in \nplace, the FAA cannot distribute airport grants, regardless of whether \nan AIP appropriation is in place. A lapse in the AIP is unacceptable, \nand I will work tirelessly to ensure that this does not occur.\n  Mr. President, this bill reaffirms our commitment that the United \nStates should continue to have the safest and most efficient air \ntransportation system in the world. Although the role of Congress is \nvital, the FAA has the immediate responsibility for managing the \nnational air transportation system. In very broad terms, the FAA is \ndirectly responsible for ensuring the safety, security, and efficiency \nof civil aviation, and for overseeing the development of a national \nairports system.\n  One critical activity being performed by the FAA is modernization of \nthe air traffic control (ATC) system. This process has been ongoing for \n15 years, and will continue for many years into the future. During my \ntenure as Chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, I have learned that \nthe modernization program is at a critical juncture. We can no longer \nallow the program to continue the ``stops and starts'' of the past. \nImprovements must get on track, or the growing demand for air services \ncombined with outdated equipment will soon bring gridlock and serious \nconcerns about safety.\n  I am encouraged that the FAA is working with industry to put the ATC \nmodernization program on track and develop a plan to deliver equipment, \non time and on budget, that will ensure increased safety and efficiency \nfor all Americans. This bill will help ensure that these very important \nefforts continue. The FAA must spare no effort over the next few years \nto modernize the ATC system, as airlines will also be spending a great \ndeal of money to purchase and install the components needed in their \naircraft to use these new systems. All of this needs to be done right, \nand done now, to ensure continued safety and efficiency in the aviation \nindustry.\n  Another matter requiring immediate attention is the FAA's progress in \ndealing with the Year 2000 problem. This issue has far reaching safety \nand economic implications, and has already been the subject of many \nhearings in Congress. It is imperative that the FAA makes the most out \nof limited time and resources, and Congress must ensure that this is a \ntop priority. The public is aware of the Year 2000 problem and must be \nreassured beyond any doubt that it will be possible to fly and, most \nimportantly, to fly in complete safety, on January 1, 2000.\n\n  As I already mentioned, this bill contains numerous provisions \ndesigned to improve competition and service in the airline industry. \nThe inclusion of these measures in the bill does not in any way mean \nthat airline deregulation has been unsuccessful. The overall benefits \nof airline deregulation are clear: fares are down significantly and \nservice options have increased.\n  Many of the benefits of deregulation can be attributed to the entry \nof new airlines into the marketplace. The low\n\n[[Page S804]]\n\nfare carriers have increased competition, and have enabled more people \nto fly than ever before. Air traffic has grown as a result, and all \npredictions are that it will continue to grow steadily over the next \nseveral years.\n  In spite of the success of deregulation, many believe that \ncompetition can be improved. The competition provisions in the Air \nTransportation Improvement Act would ease some of the federally-imposed \nbarriers that remain in the deregulated environment. These barriers \ninclude the slot controls at four major airports and the perimeter rule \nat Reagan National Airport.\n  Although this legislation is a positive step forward for our national \naviation system, one of my main priorities, which is not included in \nthe Air Transportation Improvement Act, will be to push for an increase \nin the Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) cap. We must address the \nwidening infrastructure gap that threatens to hamstring our national \naviation system. The independent National Civil Aviation Review \nCommission and the GAO also estimate that there is a backlog in airport \nimprovements of approximately $3 billion per year. To ensure that our \ninfrastructure deficit can be met, we must look for innovative \nsolutions such as a PFC increase which allow local control and \nresponsibly for improving our national aviation system.\n  I look forward to working with Senators McCain, Hollings, and \nRockefeller to ensure that our common goals of providing a safe and \nsecure aviation system for both commercial airlines and the general \naviation community as well as providing adequate resources for the FAA \nto carry out this task are met.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/20/senate-section/article/S803-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNITION OF BERNICE BARLOW\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

Mrs. \nBarlow is leaving her position as president of the Saginaw branch of \nthe NAACP after thirty years.\n  As president of the Saginaw NAACP, Bernice Barlow has been a powerful \nadvocate for equality and civil rights. Although her tireless efforts \non behalf of the NAACP are admirable in their own right, Mrs. Barlow \nhas not confined her community service to the NAACP. She has also \nserved with distinction in leadership roles with organizations like the \nSaginaw Education Association, the Tri-County Fair Housing Association \nand the Saginaw County Mental Health Board.\n  Despite her retirement from the presidency of the Saginaw NAACP, \nBernice Barlow will continue her service to the people of Saginaw. Her \nhusband, Charles, and her four children will surely be pleased to have \nmore of her time, but I have no doubt that they will support her \ncontinuing efforts to ensure that equality and justice are recognized \nas the birthrights of every citizen.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that my colleagues will join me in \ncongratulating Bernice Barlow as she steps down from her position as \npresident of the Saginaw NAACP, and in thanking her for her \nlongstanding commitment to the people of the city of Saginaw.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/20/senate-section/article/S804-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S804-S808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FOREIGN TRAVEL OF SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, during the winter recess, I had \nthe opportunity to travel from Dec. 12 through Dec. 31, 1998, to 13 \ncountries in Europe, the Mideast and the Gulf. I flew over with \nPresident Clinton on Air Force One, spent the first several days in \nIsrael essentially working with the President's schedule, and then \npursued my own agenda when he returned to Washington. I believe it is \nworthwhile to share with my colleagues some of my impressions from that \ntrip, which I am placing in the Congressional Record on Jan. 19, 1999, \nthe first day for statements in the 106th Congress.\n\n\n                                 ISRAEL\n\n  From December 12 through December 15, I traveled with President \nClinton to the Middle East to encourage the advancement of the Israeli-\nPalestinian peace process in the wake of the accords reached in October \nat Wye Plantation. Although somewhat overshadowed by the pending \nimpeachment process, the President's trip was useful, I believe, in \napplying pressure to both sides to abide by their commitments toward \nfurther progress.\n\n\n                                 SYRIA\n\n  When President Clinton returned to Washington, I proceeded to \nDamascus, Syria, where I met with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, to \nexamine the possibility of progress on the Israeli-Syrian track of the \nMideast peace process. While I believe that progress between Israel and \nthe Palestinians could be made with the resumption of a dialogue \nbetween Israel and Syria, the pending Israeli elections have rendered \nthe prospect for that dialogue unlikely in the short run.\n  The big news while I talked with President Assad was the increasing \ntension between the United States and Iraq over the U.N. inspection of \nIraq's weapons program. Because Syria shares a long border and cultural \nheritage--though certainly no great friendship--with Iraq, even the \nthreat of military conflict between the U.S. and Baghdad produces \nimmediate and tangible emotions among many Syrians.\n  That afternoon in December, the situation in Iraq seemed grave: the \nU.N. team had evacuated the country, and chief inspector Richard Butler \nwas preparing to address the U.N. Security Council in an emergency \nsession. I did not know that a strike was imminent, but President Assad \nand I speculated during our meeting on news reports concerning what the \nimmediate future might hold.\n  Past midnight in Damascus, CNN carried live footage of anti-aircraft \nfire and air-raid sirens in Baghdad, only a few hundred miles away. The \nPresident's remarks from the Oval Office followed shortly thereafter, \nand, after a short night's rest, I was asked to comment on the bombing \nto an expectant Syrian press corps.\n  I told the press the same thing that I told President Assad in the \nprevious day's meeting: I had written the President on November 12 \nurging him not to order the use of U.S. force against Iraq without \nfirst obtaining Congressional authorization as required by the United \nStates Constitution. I believe that a missile strike is an act of war, \nand only the Congress of the United States under our Constitution has \nthe authority to declare war.\n  Had the President taken the matter to the Congress, as President Bush \ndid in 1991, I would have supported it. I believe that Saddam Hussein \nis a menace to the region and to the world. I believe it is true that \nhe is developing weapons of mass destruction, and that he has \ndemonstrated a willingness to employ chemical weapons for the most \ndestructive and terrible purposes. Clearly, some forceful international \naction has to be taken.\n  I said I did not believe the President acted because of the pending \nimpeachment vote. I indicated that, in my opinion, the President acted \nbecause he had put Saddam Hussein on notice in the past, and Ramadan \nwas coming, as the President explained the previous evening. I said \nthat I believe the House of Representatives was right in delaying the \nvote for a couple of days while we commenced a military strike on Iraq.\n  Constitutional requirements aside, there is a practical benefit to \nseeking Congressional approval for acts of war. When a President has \nthe backing of Congress confirmed by way of a recorded vote, his hand \nis immediately strengthened in the eyes of the world. Absent that \nimprimatur of support, America's enemies or would-be enemies are left \nto poke and carp at the propriety and the purpose of the military \naction. And the attendant Congressional debate helps to sharpen the \naims and follow-on goals of any action. Winning Congress' approval \nrequires a President to spell out exactly what he hopes to accomplish \nthrough military force, and it forces him to keep those goals within \nthe bounds of reality.\n  A recorded vote on military authorization is healthy for the \nCongress, as well. It puts Senators and Congressmen on the spot, up-or-\ndown, on a matter of pivotal importance in national policy: deciding \nwhether the goals of a military action justify the price in the blood \nand sweat of our troops. It is simply too easy for Congressional \ncritics to bob and weave around taking a position on a given military \naction. If a particular campaign takes a difficult\n\n[[Page S805]]\n\nturn, critics emerge from the woodwork. If, on the other hand, our \ntroops achieve dramatic, unforseen successes, prior Congressional \ncritics of the action take to the floor in lavish praise.\n  Insisting on proper Congressional debate and authorization on future \nmilitary acts would end this charade, while fulfilling a fundamental \ntenet of our Constitution: ``The Congress . . . shall have power to \ndeclare war . . .''\n\n\n                                 EGYPT\n\n  Following the press conference, I departed Syria for Cairo, Egypt, to \nmeet with President Hosni Mubarak. President Mubarak and I have met \nnumerous times since his ascent to power following the assassination of \nPresident Anwar Sadat in 1981. Needless to say, our discussion this \ntime centered around the U.S. military strike on Iraq. I made the same \npoints about Congressional authorization for the use of force, and it \nwas clear from the initial Egyptian reaction to the strike that our \nmotives would have been clarified, and our hand strengthened, had the \nPresident sought and received the backing of Congress before attacking. \nFollowing my hour-long discussion with President Mubarak, I addressed \nthe Egyptian press corps on the same points at the Presidential palace.\n\n\n                               MACEDONIA\n\n  I then departed Egypt for Skopje, Macedonia. Upon arrival, I met with \nAmbassador Christopher R. Hill to discuss the situation in Kosovo and \nother issues affecting Bosnian regional stability.\n  Skopje is a beautiful, small city surrounded on all sides by \nmountains. The city was leveled almost completely by a post-WWII \nearthquake, as a result of which very little of the original Macedonian \narchitecture remains. In place of the earlier buildings stand poured-\nconcrete, Soviet-style structures that fail to reflect the rich \nheritage of the Macedonian people.\n  Formerly a sub-entity of Yugoslavia, Macedonia won its independence \nin the breakup of the former Soviet-bloc country that followed the end \nof the cold war. Macedonians are clearly hardworking people, and it is \nprobably no surprise that the tiny republic's economy reportedly is \ndoing better than that of most other Yugoslavian republics save \nSlovenia.\n\n  Ambassador Hill and I met that afternoon with the country's newly-\ninstalled 33-year-old Prime Minister, Ljubco Giorgievski. The youthful \nMr. Giorgievski is obviously proud of the emergence of Macedonia as a \nstable entity in a clearly unstable region. Mindful of the threat that \nSerbia has posed to Bosnia and Kosovo, he is particularly anxious for \nhis country to develop friendly, close alliances with NATO, the \nEuropean Community, and the United States.\n  That evening, I met with Ambassador William Walker, the U.N. head of \nthe OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission. Ambassador Walker described in \ndetail the instability of the region, and his unease about the lack of \na protective detail or even airlift assets for his U.N. mission there. \nHe described the situation in Kosovo as very different from Bosnia: \nKosovo is a small-scale guerilla war, with no front lines, and with \nboth Serbs and Albanians fighting for public opinion in the region. \nAmbassador Walker said his chief frustration is the absence of a \npolitical settlement for the U.N. to implement in Kosovo, such as the \none that was forged in Bosnia. Without such an agreement, he said, \nproviding real stability to the region will remain extremely \nproblematic, as the U.N. will not be able to move forward on training \nlocal authorities and local police forces to provide security to the \nregion.\n\n\n                              NETHERLANDS\n\n  The next morning, I proceeded to the Netherlands, where I held a \nworking lunch with Ambassador Cynthia P. Schneider and three members of \nthe Dutch Parliament who served as experts in their different parties \non Middle East issues. A consensus emerged that the international \ncommunity needs to work to replace Saddam Hussein as the leader of \nIraq, but no one could point to a realistic way for the international \ncommunity to get that done.\n  We also discussed the benefits to the United States' opening up a \ndialogue with Iran in the future. Interestingly, one of the Members of \nParliament present, Geert Wilders, had traveled to Iran, and expressed \nfrustration that the absence of a real dialogue between the United \nStates and Iran meant that Russia is having a disproportionate \ninfluence on the government, especially by way of providing \ntechnological expertise for the development of weapons of mass \ndestruction. That said, Mr. Wilders expressed the clear difficulty in \ndeveloping a productive dialogue with a government that hold such \nirresponsible positions on regional and international security.\n  I then proceeded to the International Criminal Tribunal for the \nFormer Yugoslavia, where I met with Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour and \nPresident Judge Gabrielle McDonald. In contrast to my previous visits \nto the tribunal, Justice Arbour expressed a reasonable degree of \nsatisfaction with the Tribunal's U.N. funding, up by $23 million from \nlast year's level of $70 million. Not surprisingly, Justice Arbour \nviews this manifold increase as a real endorsement of the Tribunal's \nwork in bringing justice to the victims of atrocities in Bosnia. In \nparticular, she described the success of the prosecutors' exhumation of \nmass grave sites in Bosnia as part of their search for evidence to \nsupport present trials and further indictments. Justice Arbour \nexpressed her aim of indicting and prosecuting a handful of ``top'' \nofficials in the Bosnian conflict through the prosecution of lower-\nlevel criminals at present.\n  Judge Gabrielle McDonald, a former U.S. District Court Judge in \nHouston, indicated a similar satisfaction with the work of the \ntribunal, but, for her part, feels somewhat understaffed in her \nchambers, particularly as the prosecutors and bring more cases to \ntrial. Also, Judge McDonald, as the Tribunal's Chief Judge, would like \nto publicize the court's work as a way both of letting victims know \njustice is being served, and of assuring those under indictment that \nthey will receive a truly fair trial in The Hague, should they \nsurrender themselves to the court.\n  As I left the Tribunal, the U.S. Embassy in The Hague was overrun by \nanti-war activists protesting the U.S. military strike against Iraq.\n\n\n                                ENGLAND\n\n  During a stopover in London, I met with the country team headed by \nDeputy Chief of Mission Robert Bradtke, to discuss further fallout from \nthe bombing. The evening of my arrival, the House of Representatives \nvoted out two Articles of Impeachment on President Clinton. The next \nevening, I appeared on a live broadcast of CBS's Face the Nation from \nthe network's London studio. The show came the day after the House \nvoted to impeach President Clinton, and I discussed procedures and \ncontext for the impending Senate trial.\n\n\n                    BELGIUM/NORTH ATLANTIC ASSEMBLY\n\n  Operation Desert Fox, the US and British missile strikes on Iraq \nwhich ran four days during my travels, spurred anti-American \ndemonstrations, attacks on US embassies and flag-burnings throughout \nEurope and the Mideast, including many of the nations to which I \ntraveled. We had to switch hotels in Brussels upon arrival on Sunday, \nDec. 20, because the American-owned Sheraton hotel where we had planned \nto stay was the site of a demonstration by some 200 Arabs, who seized \nand burned the hotel's American flag, and a bomb threat that forced the \nevacuation of the entire hotel. There had also been a demonstration \nduring the day at the hotel where we did stay, but there was no more \ntrouble that night.\n  Upon arrival Sunday evening Dec. 20 in Brussels, I met with U.S. \nAmbassador to NATO Alexander Vershbow for an informal briefing. On \nMonday morning at NATO headquarters, I met formally with the ambassador \nand 11 members of the U.S. team. We discussed ways of activating NATO \nagainst Iraq, and I expressed my concern that the recent bombings of \nIraq were a strictly US-British operation, with no help from any of our \nother allies. Our team suggested that it takes too long to line up \nother nations and gives too much warning to Saddam. I rejected that \nproposition, given that we had signaled our intentions against Iraq \nafter our near-strike in November.\n  We also discussed the Russian threat to Western Europe, stemming from \nRussian instability, and our efforts in Bosnia and Kosovo. As for NATO \nand United Nations missions, I commented that many Americans abhor the \nidea of\n\n[[Page S806]]\n\nputting US troops under a foreign commander. I told our team about the \nprotests I hear on the subject regularly at my open-house town meetings \nthroughout Pennsylvania. Some of our team argued that, ultimately, all \nNATO troops are under an American supreme commander, even if they \nhappen to also be under a European divisional commander.\n  I met next with the German Ambassador to NATO, Joachim Bitterlich, \nwho had served previously as former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's \nnational security adviser. Ambassador Bitterlich began by assuring me \nthat the US-British strike against Iraq was the right thing to do. I \ntook up the questions of Iraq, Iran and the Middle East with Ambassador \nBitterlich, and we agreed that expanded dialog should be part of any \nstrategy. Like many other policy setters, Ambassador Bitterlich said he \nstruggling to find any leverage over Saddam Hussein.\n  I met next with Gen. Klaus Nauman, Chairman of the NATO Military \nCommittee. Gen. Nauman likened Saddam Hussein and his oppressive regime \nto the Nazis, under whom Gen. Nauman had spent his early childhood. \nSuch a repressive terrorist regime makes it very difficult to foster \nopposition forces from within, the General warned. As for Russia, Gen. \nNauman agreed that western nations would be well advised to spend money \nto destroy Russia's nuclear and chemical weapons stockpile, as the \nUnited States and Germany have. But he cautioned that we must make sure \nthe money goes for the purpose intended, and is not diverted, as past \nfunds have been.\n\n\n                                 GREECE\n\n  We left Brussels early Monday morning and traveled most of the day, \narriving in Athens late in the afternoon. I met with Ambassador R. \nNicholas Burns. We discussed a variety of subjects, ranging from Greek-\nTurkish tension to the situations in Crete and Cyprus to local reaction \nto the Iraq bombings.\n\n\n                                BAHRAIN\n\n  We left Athens early Tuesday morning, Dec. 22, and traveled to \nBahrain. At a refueling stop at the Cairo airport, I met with two \nmembers of our country team to discuss recent intelligence about anti-\nAmerican attacks in the region stemming from Operation Desert Fox. They \nbriefed me on a mob attack on the U.S. ambassador's residence in \nDamascus, in which the residence was destroyed and our ambassador's \nwife was holed up in a steel-walled safe haven closet until Marines \narrived to rescue her. Arriving late in the afternoon in Manama, \nBahrain, I was met at the airport by Ambassador Johnny Young and Vice \nAdmiral Charles ``William'' Moore and members of their teams. Admiral \nMoore, Commander of the Fifth Fleet, was in charge of much of the U.S. \neffort in Operation Desert Fox.\n  At the US Embassy, Admiral Moore and several of his senior officers \nbriefed me on details of Operation Desert Fox. The operation, as \nAdmiral Moore summarized it, was a success in that our forces executed \ntheir objectives with zero allied casualties.\n  I met next with 13 area chiefs of UNSCOM, the United Nations program \nto check Iraq's weapons of mass destruction through inspections and \ndestruction of materiel. The UNSCOM chiefs, mostly in their 30s, came \nprimarily from the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Britain. \nThey looked shell-shocked, and as though they had not slept in weeks. \nAs I told them at the outset, the world owes them a debt of gratitude \nfor the job they have done and for the risks they have taken.\n  UNSCOM's numbers have dwindled from a high of 186 inspectors to 112. \nForty-seven of the inspectors had moved their base to Bahrain after \nevacuating from Iraq hours before the bombing. We discussed their \nassessments of Iraq's biological, chemical and nuclear weapons \nprograms, the various delivery systems Iraq was developing or had \nbuilt, and the difficulties in conducting inspections and in tracking \nweapons components and chemical precursors. They told me, for example, \nthat they had found biological agents in far greater quantities than \ncould be justified by legitimate uses. The UNSCOM chiefs all said they \nwere ``keen'' to return to Iraq and continue their work, though that \nprospect remains in doubt.\n\n\n                                  OMAN\n\n  Early Wednesday morning, Dec. 23, we flew to Oman. Upon arrival in \nthe capital city of Muscat, we drove for a meeting with Sheik Abdullah \nbin Ali Al-Qatabi, President of the Majlis As-Shura, or elected lower \nhouse of the national council. For the first 40 minutes, the Sheikh \ndeflected my questions about threats to the region and the world by \nIraq and Iran, reducing the meeting to small talk and an exchange of \nviews on civics and bicameral legislatures. Then, when we took \nphotographs and stood to leave, the Sheik could contain himself no \nlonger and told me what was really on his mind, for nearly an hour as \nwe stood at the center of his office.\n  The Sheik said Iraq did not pose the grave threat I suggested, \narguing that Saddam Hussein had not used weapons of mass destruction \nduring the Persian Gulf War and probably would not again. Further, he \nargued, our operations would not eliminate Saddam Hussein, but would \nonly hurt the Iraqi people, who depend on the infrastructure we \ndestroy, and inflame passions throughout the region against the United \nStates.\n  The Sheik was concerned that we had embarrassed the Sultan and the \ngovernment of Oman through publicity about the use of Omani bases by \nU.S. aircraft during Operation Desert Fox. He used the word \n``embarrassment'' four times, noting that such embarrassment made it \nmore difficult for Omani leaders to pursue their genuine desires to \ncontinue warm relations with the United States. Oman was not \nembarrassed about the use of its bases for allied planes during \nOperation Desert Storm in 1991 because of Iraq's aggression against \nKuwait, he said.\n  The Sheikh told me that he was being unusually frank out of \nfriendship, and I assured him I appreciated his candor. I addressed his \nconcerns, telling him that collateral damage to civilians is inevitable \nin any military strike, and that we minimized civilian casualties \nduring Operation Desert Fox and very much regretted any losses.\n  I met next with U.S. Ambassador Frances Cook and members of her team. \nAmbassador Cook warned that anti-American opinion had been growing in \nOman. Two demonstrations were held at the university, she noted; the \nonly two in the school's 10-year history. From this visit and previous \ncontacts, I believe Ambassador Cook has done an outstanding job.\n  I then met with Oman's Minister of Information, Abdulaziz Al-Rawwas, \nfor what would prove another long and direct conversation. Minister Al-\nRawwas also did not consider Iraq or Iran threats to the region, and \nalso criticized our military efforts against Iraq as ineffective. He \npressed me to consider an overture to Iran to warm US relations with \nthat nation, such as dropping embargoes or allowing a planned Caspian \noil pipeline to pass through Iran on a southern route to the Persian \nGulf, rather than through a western route through southern Europe to \nthe Black Sea, which the U.S. currently favors. I assured him I would \nstudy the matter.\n  Our party arrived at the Muscat airport shortly after 6 am the next \nmorning, Thursday, to fly to Islamabad for a scheduled meeting with \nPakistan's Prime Minister and for other meetings in Pakistan and India. \nI had wanted to discuss the nuclear stand-off in the region, and \ndisarmament measures. But fog and smoke over most of the subcontinent \nmade air travel impossible, for us and for all other commercial and \nofficial traffic into and out of the subcontinent. We had no better \nluck on Friday morning. We then tried to adjust our schedule, but were \nunable to get necessary clearances and make flight and meeting \narrangements on Friday, Dec. 25, which was both Christmas Day and the \nfirst Friday of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. We wound up staying \nin Oman until Saturday morning, Dec. 26, at which point we departed for \nAmman, Jordan.\n\n\n                                 JORDAN\n\n  Days before I arrived in Amman, Jordanian Parliamentarians, in a \nhighly unusual move, surprised the Monarchy by convening a conference \nof Arab Parliamentarians on six days notice, to discuss the US-British \nmissile strikes on Iraq. Parliamentarians from 15 of the 16 countries \nin the Arab League dispatched representatives to Amman.\n\n[[Page S807]]\n\n Only Kuwait declined to attend. President Assad reportedly ordered the \nSyrian Speaker to attend personally.\n  After arriving in Amman, I met with Jordan's Foreign Minister, Abdul \nIllah Al Khatib, for an hour. Minister Khatib, whom I had met several \ntimes over the years both in Washington and Jordan, lamented the \nfailure so far to implement the Wye River peace accord between Israel \nand the Palestinian Authority. Both sides, we agreed, were torn by \nfactionalism. On the Israeli side, Prime Minister Netanyahu was mired \nin struggles with hard-liners and fighting to keep his job, while on \nthe Palestinian side, Abu Mazen, the second-ranking official, had his \nhouse stoned for his efforts to effect the peace accord, leaving him \nreportedly so shaken that he wanted nothing more to do with the peace \nprocess. In the face of such factionalism, Al Khatib said, the parties \nand the process needed leadership from the United States.\n\n  Jordan's other pressing foreign policy problem, Al Khatib said, was \nIraq. He noted that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, which sparked the \nPersian Gulf War, sent 400,000 Kuwaiti refugees to Jordan, swelling \nJordan's population by 10 percent and buffeting Jordan's economy as it \ntries to house and absorb the new residents. The foreign minister said \nwe should have a permanent monitoring system for Iraq's weapons \nefforts. In the evening, we met with Crown Prince El Hassan bin Talal, \nheir to the throne and brother of King Hussein, who was at the Mayo \nClinic in Minnesota undergoing cancer therapy, and several of his \nministers. The Crown Prince had been briefed on my meeting with the \nForeign Minister, and we proceeded directly to discussing policy.\n  The next morning, Sunday, Dec. 27, I met with our embassy team for a \nbriefing. Based on what they told me, I grew even more concerned that \nwe had so badly misread regional public opinion in launching our \nstrikes against Iraq.\n  Before leaving Washington, I had raised that specific question with \nan Administration Cabinet officer. He had replied the administration \nhad no day-after plan; but that was not a reason not to launch the \nstrikes. Disagreeing sharply, I said it was.\n  Our policy makers apparently based their assurances to the American \npublic of Arab support on regional leaders who, eager for US aid, told \nthem what they thought the Americans wanted to hear. No longer can the \nUnited States talk only to government officials to gauge their nation's \nreaction. Nor can we count on Arab national leaders to suppress public \nreaction against our ill-planned acts.\n  In Amman, our experts told me that despite general ennui with Saddam \nHussein, Jordanian public opinion about our missile strikes was very \nstrongly pro-Saddam, a feeling exacerbated by the US failure to \narticulate a post-strike plan. After my discussion with our embassy \nteam, I met Sunday morning with Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez \nTarawneh, who expressed the same criticisms of our recent strikes \nagainst Iraq. ``We don't know what the military strike did,'' the Prime \nMinister said. ``It seems he is better off.'' Our timing was poor, he \nsaid, just before the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and following what \nhe perceived as Israel putting the Wye River accord ``in the deep \nfreeze.''\n  As for Iraqi opposition to Saddam, the Prime Minister said, it is \nthere, but it is fictionalized and lacks any acceptable leader. ``It is \na complicated matter, and every military strike makes it more \ncomplicated,'' he said.\n  When the Jordanian Prime Minister apologized for the Amman \nParliamentarians' conference, I surprised him by expressing my view \nthat it was a healthy sign to see Jordan's Parliamentarians expressing \nan independent view from the Jordanian government, even if it \nconflicted with US policy.\n  ``We have to do a much better job in the United States of taking into \naccount what the public reaction will be,'' I conceded.\n  When I asked the Prime Minister to explain the Jordanian people's \nsupport for Iraq and Saddam, he said, ``The people here do support \nSaddam. Jordanians do not believe in dictatorship. They are aware of \nthe fact that this is a brutal regime. But this does not negate the \nfact that the Iraqis are our brothers.''\n\n\n                             IZMIR, TURKEY\n\n  From Amman, we flew to Izmir, Turkey, a city of 4 million that serves \nas headquarters for a NATO charged with ensuring the security and \nterritory of NATO's southern and eastern flank. I spent much of the day \nSunday with Maj. Gen. Reginal Clemmons, Commanding General of the U.S. \nArmy Element of the Allied Land Forces-Southeastern Europe, members of \nGen. Clemmons's staff, and U.S. Air Force officers from the 425th Air \nBase Squadron, based in downtown Izmir.\n  Over the course of several hours, we discussed Greek-Turkish tension, \nrecently inflamed by plans to bring Russian-made S-300 missiles to the \nGreek island of Crete, and still hot over joint control of Cyprus; \nplans to create a Kurdish state in northern Iraq; a potential Caspian \noil pipeline through Turkey; and realities of working with foreign \nmilitary officers. Gen. Clemmons serves as deputy commander of the \nIzmir-based NATO post, under a four-star Turkish general.\n\n\n                                GEORGIA\n\n  Before dawn Tuesday morning, we took off for Tbilisi, the capital of \nGeorgia, one of the 15 former Soviet Republics. Rugged, mountainous and \nhistorically worn-torn, Georgia is famous as the home of former Soviet \nleader Joseph Stalin. Georgia endured several years of civil war \nrecently, from the Soviet breakup until 1995. President Eduard \nShevardnadze, the former Soviet Foreign Minister, survived two \nassassination attempts, and has led the effort to ally Georgia with the \nWest and to foster democracy and a market economy. Georgia has been \nlooking primarily to the United States for help.\n  I met first with U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Yalowitz and his team at the \nembassy for a full briefing on the nation of 5 million. We discussed \nGeorgia's struggle toward democracy and a market economy, frustrated by \ncorruption, civil war, and failure to collect taxes; Georgia's struggle \nwith Russia, which seeks to control its former republic and thwart its \nefforts toward independence; Georgia's reliance on U.S. aid, which was \n$85 million this year, compared to the nation's $100 million budget; \nand advantages and disadvantages of running the Caspian oil pipeline \nthrough Georgia to the Black Sea.\n  I then met for an hour with President Shevardnadze. The President \nlooked more somber than he had when I last saw him in Washington, but \nhe still seemed vigorous and intense at not quite 71. Mr. Shevardnadze \nis largely responsible for the progress Georgia has made toward \ndemocratization and a market economy since the Soviet Union crumbled in \n1991, but he was the first to say much more work remains to be done. \nNation building was put off until 1995, after Georgia's post-Soviet \ncivil war ended, he noted.\n  Russian instability poses perhaps the greatest threat to the region, \nShevardnadze said. He brushed off my concern that an expanded NATO \nwould give Russian hard-liners an excuse to seize control, saying \nextremists did not have an adequate base from which to take over. But \nPresident Shevardnadze said he did have a major concern: ``The West \nfailed to notice the Soviet Union's disintegration; the West was caught \nunaware,'' he said. ``Make sure the formation of a new Soviet Union \ndoes not catch you similarly unaware.''\n  In Russia, Shevardnadze warned, people of all political stripes \nsupport restoring the Soviet Union. He did not see a reunited Soviet \nUnion as a benign force. ``Gorbachev had a different vision; a vision \nof a democratic Soviet Union,'' Shevardnadze said. ``But that was an \nillusion--or a delusion.'' If democracy were an option, he said, the \nformer Soviet republics would opt for independence.\n\n  On the question of terrorism, Shevardnadze said the United States \nshould pressure Russia to stop selling arms to rogue nations such as \nIran, saying we should have leverage over Russia, considering the $18 \nbillion we give them. Shevardnadze, not surprisingly, argued that the \nCaspian oil pipeline should run through Georgia and Turkey. The \npipeline, by all accounts, offers a major strategic and economic plum \nfor any nation through which it runs.\n  We met next with Georgia's Minister of State, the equivalent of the \nPrime Minister, Vazha Lordkipanidze. We discussed Georgia's economic \nreform efforts, including privatization, banking,\n\n[[Page S808]]\n\nliberalization of prices, decentralization of management; and the \nsmuggling, shoddy tax collection and Russian meddling that have \nfrustrated these economic reforms. Lordkipanidze also did not believe \nNATO expansion would provoke and strengthen Russian hard-liners, saying \nextremists would find another pretext if NATO did not expand. The West \nmust foster democracy in Russia and in other former Soviet republics, \nhe urged.\n  Our final meeting in Tbilisi was with Parliamentary Chairman, or \nSpeaker, Zhurab Zhvania, who had just turned 35, and a 31-year-old \nParliamentarian who had studied law at Columbia University. The \nParliamentarians' English was fluent, and they were both very \nimpressive, and encouraging for their nation's long-term prospects. We \ncovered the same sweep of issues that I had discussed with President \nShevardnadze and with the Prime Minister, and they offered similar \nviews. They spoke passionately about Georgia's Constitution, the only \nEastern national charter patterned on the U.S. Constitution; and about \nthe nation's judicial reform, including competitive exams monitored by \nCalifornia Bar examiners that cleared out nearly all the previous \npolitical appointees. We differed on the death penalty, which I believe \nis a deterrent to crime, but which Georgia has abolished, the Speaker \nsaid, as a matter of moral philosophy.\n\n\n                             ANKARA, TURKEY\n\n  From Tbilisi we flew to Ankara, the capital of Turkey, arriving \nTuesday evening, Dec. 29. We met the next morning with U.S. Ambassador \nMark Parris, a former foreign affairs adviser to President Clinton, and \nhis team for an hour briefing on the political landscape. Turkey's \ngovernment is fractionalized, and the Turkish military commands the \nmost popular support, which Parris considered a mixed blessing. The \nmilitary is honest and conservative, cracking down on threats to the \nsecular state, Parris said, but the military also cracks down on free \nspeech that advocates proscribed positions. National elections and \nelections in Turkey's three major cities, Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir, \nare all scheduled for April 1999.\n  I was particularly impressed that Turkey had succeeded in getting \nSyria to evict terrorist camps based near Syria's Turkish border that \npreyed on Turks. The Kurdish PKK movement, seeking a separate Kurdish \nstate, has killed an estimated 30,000 Turks since the Soviet grip began \nto loosen around 1989. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was specifically \nevicted from Syria.\n  In my discussions with Parris and his team, we focused on the Caspian \noil pipeline, beginning with the proposition that the Turks have come \naround to the American way of thinking: That the pipeline ought to run \neast-west to the Black Sea, through Turkey and Georgia, not south to \nthe Persian Gulf through unstable and potentially hostile areas such as \nIran. An east-west pipeline would tie central Asia to the West, and \navoid giving Iran strategic leverage, the strategy holds.\n  I also remained impressed by Turkey's strong ties to Israel. The two \nnations conduct joint military exercises, trade and joint ventures on \nsuch items as insurance, leather goods and software. The collaboration \nbegan as a Turkish effort to win points with the United States, which \nwas being pressed by Greek and other anti-Turkish lobbies. But the \nTurkish-Israeli collaboration soon warmed into a genuine symbiotic \nrelationship apart from US politics, Parris said.\n  We met next with Ambassador Faruk Logoglu of the Turkish Ministry of \nForeign Affairs. Logoglu had spent 13 years in the United States, \nattending college at Brandeis and graduate school at Princeton, \nteaching at Middlebury and serving at the United Nations before taking \nhis post at the Turkish Foreign Ministry in 1971. Pressing for the \neast-west pipeline, Logoglu said, ``The pipeline is an umbilical cord \ntying countries to the West.''\n  My final meeting in Turkey was with President Suleyman Demirel. The \nPresident received us in a grand, wood-trimmed chamber in the \nPresidential palace, finished with red carpet and chandeliers. \nPresident Demirel spoke softly in perfect English.\n  I complimented the President on his warm relations with Israel, \ndespite its risks of angering nations hostile to Israel. He replied \nthat the Turkish-Israeli friendship had indeed angered some nations at \nTurkey. At an Islamic conference in Iran, the President said, he stood \nand said Turkey was a sovereign nation and could do whatever was \nnecessary to pursue its interests. There was no response from \nrepresentatives of the 55 nations present, he said.\n  As to Saddam Hussein, President Demirel said he had known him for \nabout 24 years, but it was a ``puzzle'' as to how to deal with him. The \nUnited States should enlist allies in its efforts to influence Saddam, \nhe urged.\n  I asked the President if he would accept an invitation to meet at the \nOval Office with his Greek counterpart, with whom he does not talk, \njust as President Clinton had brought together Palestinian Chairman \nYasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. I had no \nauthority to call such a meeting, I noted, but stressed the power of \nthe U.S. Presidency. The President replied that Cypriots, both Greek \nand Turkish, should come to an agreement first, but he did not discount \nthe possibility of an Oval Office meeting.\n\n\n                             NAPLES, ITALY\n\n  From Ankara we flew to Naples, where I met with Lt. Gen. Jack Nix, in \ncharge of the Army NATO troops, while we refueled. We spent most of our \nhalf hour discussing Bosnia. Gen. Nix cautioned that we can only reduce \nour troops so far; that we must maintain a baseline to allow both \nmobility and the ability to rescue other troops.\n  From Naples we flew to London, where we arrived in the evening, \nstayed overnight at an airport hotel, and flew back to the United \nStates the next day. Our visits were facilitated and generally made \npleasant by the assistance and cooperation of U.S. embassies in the \nvarious countries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/20/senate-section/article/S804-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF DR.

The Journal of the proceedings of the trial are \napproved to date.\n  Pursuant to the provisions of Senate Resolution 16, counsel for the \nPresident have 21 hours 45 minutes remaining to make the presentation \nof their case. The Senate will now hear you.\n  The Chair recognizes Mr. Counsel Craig.\n  Mr. Counsel CRAIG. Mr. Chief Justice, ladies and gentlemen of the \nSenate, distinguished managers from the House, good afternoon. My name \nis Greg Craig and I am special counsel to the President. I am here \ntoday on behalf of President Clinton. I am here to argue that he is not \nguilty of the allegations of grand jury perjury set forth in article I.\n  I welcome this opportunity to speak for President Clinton. He has a \nstrong and compelling case, one that is based on the facts in the \nrecord, on the law, and on the Constitution. But first and foremost, \nthe President's defense is based on the grand jury transcript itself. I \nurge you to read that transcript and watch the videotape. You will see \nthis President make painful, difficult admissions, beginning with his \nacknowledgment of an improper and wrongful relationship with Monica \nLewinsky.\n  You will see that the President was truthful. And after reading, \nseeing, hearing, and studying the evidence for yourselves, not relying \non what someone else says it is, not relying on someone else's \ndescription, characterization, or paraphrase of the President's \ntestimony, we believe that you will conclude that what the President \ndid and said in the grand jury was not unlawful, and that you must not \nremove him from office.\n  I plan to divide my presentation into three parts:\n  First, to tell you how really bad this article is, legally, \nstructurally, and constitutionally, and to argue that it falls well \nbelow the most basic, minimal standards and should not be used to \nimpeach and remove this President or any President from office; second, \nto address the various allegations directly; and third, to give you a \nfew larger thoughts in response to some of the arguments from last \nweek.\n  At the conclusion you will have had much more than 100 percent of \nyour minimum daily requirements for lawyering, for which I apologize.\n  Article I accuses the President of having given perjurious, false, \nand misleading testimony to the grand jury concerning one or more of \nfour different subject areas:\n  First, when he testified about the nature and details of the \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky;\n  Second, when he testified about his testimony in the Jones \ndeposition;\n  Third, when he testified about what happened during the Jones \ndeposition when the President's lawyer, Robert Bennett, made certain \nrepresentations about Monica Lewinsky's affidavit;\n  And, fourth, when he testified about alleged efforts to influence the \ntestimony of witnesses and impede the discovery of evidence.\n  It is noteworthy that the second and third subject areas are attempts \nto revisit the President's deposition testimony in the Jones case. \nThere was an article that was proposed alleging that the President also \ncommitted perjury in the Jones case in the Jones deposition. That \narticle was rejected by the House of Representatives, and there were \nvery many good reasons for the House to take that action. Those \nallegations have been dismissed, and you must not allow the managers to \nrevive them. Last week they tried to do that. The managers mixed up and \nmerged two sets of issues--allegations of perjury in the grand jury and \nallegations of perjury in the Jones case. These are very different \nmatters. And I think the result was confusing and also unfair to the \nPresident.\n  You will notice that the third and the fourth subject areas \ncorrespond to, coincide, and overlap with many of the allegations of \nobstruction of justice in article II. This represents a kind of double \ncharging that you might be familiar with if you have either been a \nprosecutor or a defense lawyer. One is, the defendant is charged with \nthe core offense; second, the defendant is charged with denying the \ncore offense under oath. This gives the managers two bites at the \napple, and it is a dubious prosecutorial practice that is frowned upon \nby most courts.\n  The upshot, though, of this with respect to subparts 3 and 4 of this \nfirst article is that if you conclude, as I trust you will, that the \nevidence that the President engaged in obstruction of justice is \ninsufficient to support that charge, it would follow logically that the \nPresident's denial that he engaged in any such activity would be \nrespected, and he would be acquitted on the perjury charge. Simply put, \nif the President didn't obstruct justice, he didn't commit perjury when \nhe denied it.\n  But the most striking thing about article I is what it does not say. \nIt alleges the perjury generally. But it does not allege a single \nperjurious statement specifically. The majority drafted the article in \nthis way despite pleas from other members of the committee and from \ncounsel for the President that the article take care to be precise when \nit makes its allegations. Such specificity, as many of you know, is the \nstandard practice of Federal prosecutors all across America. And that \nis the practice recommended by the Department of Justice in the manual \ndistributed to the U.S. attorneys who enforce the criminal code in \nFederal courts throughout the Nation.\n  Take a look at the standard form. It is exhibit 5 in the exhibits \nthat we handed to you. This is given to Federal prosecutors. This is \nthe model that they are told to use to allege perjury in a criminal \nindictment in Federal court. There is a very simple reason why \nprosecutors identify the specific quotation that is alleged to be \nperjury, and why it is included in a perjury indictment. If they don't \nquote the specific statement that is alleged to be perjurious, courts \nwill dismiss the indictment, concluding that the charge of perjury is \ntoo vague and that the defendant is not able to determine what \nprecisely he is being charged with.\n\n  The requirement that a defendant be given adequate notice of what he \nis\n\n[[Page S811]]\n\ncharged with carries constitutional dimensions, and the failure to \nprovide that notice violates due process of law. This is something that \napplies to all criminal defendant offenses when they are charged. And \nyou can understand why that kind of notice is required. Imagine a \nrobbery indictment that failed to indicate who or what was robbed and \nwhat property was stolen. How could you possibly defend against the \ncharge that you just stole something but you don't know what it is and \nit is nothing specific? Imagine a murder indictment without identifying \na victim.\n  But this requirement is even more stringent for perjury prosecution. \nDescription, paraphrase, or summary of testimony that is alleged to be \nperjurious are not acceptable. The quotation must be there, or the \ndefinition should be so close that there can be no doubt as to what is \nintended. In the past, when the House returned articles of impeachment \nalleging perjury with respect to Federal judges, you will see that the \nHouse has followed this practice. And if you go back to American \nhistory and review the articles that allege perjury and that have been \nproved by the House and the Senate, you will find that the statements \nthat are alleged to be perjurious are specifically identified in the \narticle.\n  Let me read from article I from the resolution of impeachment against \nJudge Walter Nixon. ``The false or misleading statement was in \nsubstance that the Forest County District Attorney never discussed this \ncase with Judge Nixon.'' There is no doubt about that. That is very \nclear. From the Alcee Hastings articles of impeachment, the false \nstatement was, in substance, that Judge Hastings and William Borders \nnever made any agreement to solicit a bribe from defendants in United \nStates v. Romano, a case tried before Judge Hastings.\n  Why is it that in this case--surely the most serious perjury trial in \nAmerican history--the House decided that specific allegations just \naren't necessary? The failure of the House to be specific in its charge \nof perjury in fact violated the President's right to due process and \nfundamental fairness. And, as you will see as I go through the \nprocedural history of these allegations, it puts us and the President \nat a significant disadvantage when we try to respond to the allegations \nthat are now set forth in this article.\n  But there is yet another reason why this vagueness and lack of \nspecificity is so very dangerous, and it raises a constitutional \nquestion that only this body can resolve.\n  Article I, section 2, clause 5, of the Constitution states, ``The \nHouse of Representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment''--\n``the sole power of impeachment.''\n  By failing to be specific in this article as to what it is precisely \nthat the President said that should cause him to be removed from \noffice, the House has effectively and unconstitutionally ceded its \nauthority under this provision of the Constitution to the managers, who \nare not authorized to exercise that authority. By bringing general \ncharges in this article, the House Judiciary Committee, and then the \nHouse of Representatives generally, gave enormous discretion, power, \nand authority to the floor managers and their lawyers to decide what \nprecisely the President was going to be charged with. They didn't have \nthat authority under the Constitution. Only the House of \nRepresentatives has that authority. They have been allowed to pick and \nto choose what allegations will be leveled against the President of the \nUnited States.\n\n  It would be extremely dangerous to the integrity of the process if \nthe House leveled such general charges against the President, creating \n``empty vessels,'' to use Mr. Ruff's term, to be filled by lawyers and \nfloor managers. And this article, I think, will take on more importance \nas we take a closer look at the charges themselves and we see what kind \nof ``witches' brew''--to use Mr. Ruff again--what kind of content was \npoured into these vessels, and find out where they came from and why \nand when.\n  I would like to talk about how these charges have been a moving \ntarget for us throughout this entire process. On September 9, when \nKenneth Starr submitted his referral to the House of Representatives, \nhe claimed that there was substantial and credible information to \nsuggest that the President committed perjury in the grand jury on three \nseparate occasions. To his credit, the Starr referral was moderately \nspecific. We could understand what they were talking about in those \nallegations.\n  On October 5, when House majority counsel David Schippers first made \nhis representation to the House Judiciary Committee, he discarded two \nof Mr. Starr's theories and invented a new one of his own. And he \nincluded only two counts in his presentation alleging perjury in the \ngrand jury. Those two counts were unbelievably broad and included no \nspecifics whatsoever.\n  On November 19, Mr. Starr appeared before the House Judiciary \nCommittee and gave a 2-hour opening statement. In that statement he \ndelivered one or two sentences on the subject of grand jury perjury.\n  Then, on December 9, when the committee majority released its four \nproposed articles of impeachment, the article that alleged perjury in \nthe grand jury, which is the one we have before us today, failed to \ntell us or the American people what words the President actually used \nthat should cause the Congress to remove him from office.\n  As you know, these proposed articles were released just as Mr. Ruff \nand the President's defense were being completed. In fact, it may have \nbeen 2 or 3 minutes before he completed his final argument before the \ncommittee. So we had no advance notice and no chance to discuss these \narticles, to respond to them, or in any way to react. In truth, I must \nsay that because of the vagueness of the articles that were ultimately \nreturned, had we been given such advance notice, it would not have made \nmuch difference because, simply put, there is a stunning lack of \nspecificity in article I.\n  So where do we look for guidance? How do we know what to defend \nagainst in this case? After the Judiciary Committee had completed its \ndeliberations, after the Members had voted to send four articles of \nimpeachment to the full House, the majority issued its report on \nDecember 16th, only 3 days before the House took its final vote. It was \nnever debated by, let alone approved by, the House of Representatives, \nand thus this report has no formal standing in these proceedings. But \nuntil the managers filed their trial brief and made their presentations \njust last week, the majority report, written by Mr. Schippers and his \nstaff, was our only place to go to look for guidance as to what those \nfour subparts of this first article really meant.\n  Now, when it comes to perjury before the grand jury, the majority \nreport argued that the President had not made two, not three, but a \nwhole host of perjurious statements before the grand jury, some \nstatements that were not contained in the Starr referral and had never \nbeen identified, charged, discussed, or debated by the Members during \nthe impeachment inquiry.\n  For example, the majority report alleged that the prepared statement \nthat the President made and delivered to the grand jury at the start of \nhis testimony admitting his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was \n``perjurious, false, and misleading,'' an astonishing allegation that \nwent far beyond anything that Kenneth Starr had claimed, and a claim \nthat no member of the Judiciary Committee had ever made in the course \nof the committee's deliberations.\n  Obviously, we had no opportunity whatsoever to respond to this \nallegation before the committee or before the House; the allegation was \nnever debated or discussed by members of the committee, nor was it \ndiscussed during the debate in the Chamber of the House.\n  The majority report also alleged that the President committed perjury \nin the grand jury when he testified that his ``goal in the [Jones] \ndeposition was to be truthful,'' and when he said that he believed he \nhad managed to complete his testimony in that deposition ``without \nviolating the law.''\n  Again, this allegation was brand new to us, never before made by \nStarr, not included in the Schippers closing argument, never mentioned \nby Chairman Hyde or by anyone else in the committee, never addressed by \nthe President's counsel, never debated by members of the committee, \nnever discussed on the floor.\n  The majority report made many other new allegations of the same kind\n\n[[Page S812]]\n\nand pedigree--all new, undiscussed, untested. They had not come, ladies \nand gentlemen of the Senate, these allegations did not come from \nStarr's referral, nor did they come from any evidence that had been \ngathered in the course of the impeachment inquiry, nor had they ever \nbeen unveiled during the impeachment inquiry to allow the President's \ncounsel to respond, or the members of the Judiciary Committee to debate \nthem. To our knowledge, many of these allegations were never discussed \nor debated by the members of the committee. And if you read the closing \narguments of the members of the House Judiciary Committee, you will \nsearch in vain for any specific reference to any of these new \nallegations, the terms of which are the subject of article I.\n\n  Then we found ourselves in the Senate, our only guide being the \narticles themselves, which, as you know, are general, and the majority \nreport, which has no formal standing but which was filled with \nallegations and theories, had never been discussed much less adopted.\n  As the trial in the Senate began--just 3 days before the managers \nwere scheduled to open their case, on January 11th--the House managers \nfiled their trial brief. We discovered that the allegations of grand \njury perjury against the President were still changing, still \nexpanding, still increasing in number.\n  The trial brief made eight proffers, incredibly presented ``merely as \nexamples'' that still in general terms describe instances where the \nPresident allegedly provided ``perjurious, false, and misleading \ntestimony'' to the grand jury.\n  But, we were warned, these proffers were only ``salient examples'' of \ngrand jury perjury. The House managers said, ``The [examples set forth \nin the trial brief] are merely highlights of the grand jury perjury. \nThere are numerous additional examples.'' And when we heard Mr. Manager \nRogan's presentation, we realized that the trial brief was absolutely \nright; Mr. Rogan unveiled allegations that had not been included even \nin the trial brief.\n  The uncertainty, fluidity, the vagueness of the charges in this case \nand the unwillingness of the prosecutors ever to specify and be bound \nby the statements that are at issue has been an aspect of this process \nthat, I submit, has been profoundly unfair to this President. It is \nalso unconstitutional, from the arguments I gave you.\n  The articles had come to include specific allegations of grand jury \nperjury that did not come from the Starr referral and that never would \nhave been approved by the House had the House been required to review \nthem.\n  There is one other element of unfairness that Mr. Ruff referred to. \nEven as the House managers have consistently tried to stretch the scope \nof article I to cover allegations never considered by the House, they \nhave tried to twist the scope of article I to cover allegations \nspecifically rejected by the House.\n  Now, let me be clear here. I am not charging the managers with going \nbeyond the record of the case. These new allegations come from the \nrecord in the case. They are not beyond the record. They are in the \nrecord. But the Starr referral did not find it suitable to make these \nallegations, and they were not made in a timely way before the House \nJudiciary Committee and, I would submit, in a timely way before the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I go back to this second element of unfairness that has to do with \nthe Jones article. When that Jones article was rejected, we would argue \nthat rejection should have been recognized for what it was, a clear \ninstruction from the House of Representatives not to argue that the \nPresident should be impeached and removed because of his testimony in \nthe Jones deposition. But the managers have sought to merge the Jones \ntestimony with the grand jury testimony, to confuse these two events, \nto blend and blur them together.\n  The Senate must understand that these two events were different in \nevery way. In the President's testimony in the Jones case, the \nPresident was evasive, misleading, incomplete in his answers, and, as I \nsaid to the House Judiciary Committee, maddening. But in the Federal \ngrand jury, President Clinton was forthright and forthcoming. He told \nthe truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth for 4 long hours, \nand the American people saw that testimony and they know that President \nClinton, when he appeared before the grand jury, did not deny a sexual \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky--he admitted to one.\n  They know that he did not deny that he was alone with Ms. Lewinsky; \nhe repeatedly acknowledged that he had been alone with her on many \noccasions.\n  The managers argued that the Jones testimony is relevant because, \nthey say, the President perjured himself when he told the grand jury \nthat his testimony in the Jones case was truthful, and it wasn't, say \nthe managers. That characterization of the President's testimony, they \nsay, is simply not accurate. What he said was, ``My goal in this \ndeposition was to be truthful but not particularly helpful . . . I was \ndetermined to walk through the minefield of this deposition without \nviolating the law, and I believe I did.'' These are opinions. He is \ncharacterizing his state of mind.\n  The House managers, on the basis of this testimony, must not be \nallowed to do what the House of Representatives told them they could \nnot do, which is to argue about the President's testimony in the Jones \ncase. Even if you believe that the President crossed the line in his \nJones deposition, you cannot conclude that he should be removed for it.\n  He was not impeached for it. This case is about the grand jury and \nthe grand jury alone.\n  Now, in fact, the vagueness and uncertainty as to the specific \nallegations of perjury, whether in the grand jury or in the Paula Jones \ndeposition, have created enormous confusion in the public about the \nPresident's conduct and about his testimony. This confusion, I think, \nhas done enormous damage to the President, because out of this \nconfusion has emerged a wholly inaccurate conventional wisdom about \nwhat President Clinton said when he testified in the grand jury. And \nthat conventional wisdom is based on certain common \nmischaracterizations of the President's testimony.\n  Last December 8, I gave an opening statement in the President's \ndefense before the committee. And when it came time for me to talk \nabout the charges of perjury, I urged the members of the committee to \nopen their minds, and because of widespread misinformation about the \nfacts, to focus on the record. I make the same plea to you again today. \nKeep an open mind and look at the real record. Read the transcript. \nWatch the videotape. Do not rely upon anyone else's version.\n  We speak from some disappointing experience on this issue. Over and \nover again, inaccurate descriptions of the President's grand jury \ntestimony have been launched into the public debate--sometimes \ninnocently, sometimes negligently. But the result has been the same. \nThe President's critics have created a conventional wisdom about the \nPresident's grand jury that is based on myth and not reality. There has \nbeen a merging of the President's testimony in the Jones deposition \nwith that of his testimony in the grand jury, and this dynamic has been \nunfair to the President.\n  We are at No. 6 with the exhibits. Let me just cite a few examples. \nThere are many more available, but they are from people and sources \nthat are familiar with the case and close to the evidence, and some \ncoming from the presentations of just last week.\n  At the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry conducted by the \nJudiciary Committee, the final arguments before the votes were taken in \nfront of the committee, Congressman McCollum stated:\n\n       The President gave sworn testimony in the Jones case in \n     which he swore he could not recall being alone with Monica \n     Lewinsky and that he had not had sexual relations with her.\n       He repeated those assertions a few months later to the \n     grand jury, and the evidence shows he lied about both.\n\n  That is not an accurate characterization of the President's testimony \nbefore the grand jury. In the majority report, written by the majority \ncounsel, the author stated repeatedly that President Clinton testified \nbefore the grand jury that he did not have sexual relations with Ms. \nLewinsky. Members of the Senate, those descriptions of the President's \ngrand jury testimony are\n\n[[Page S813]]\n\nabsolutely false. When he appeared before the grand jury, the President \nadmitted--he did not deny--an inappropriate, intimate, wrongful, \npersonal relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. When he made this admission \nthere was no doubt in anyone's mind what he meant. It meant, and the \nwhole world knew that it meant that the President of the United States \nhad engaged in some form of sexual activity or sexual contact with Ms. \nLewinsky.\n  In his appearance on a national news program on CNN television, this \nis another example: Over the New Year's weekend Mr. Manager Graham was \nasked for the most glaring example of the President's alleged perjury \nbefore the grand jury. And he said:\n\n       I think when the President said he wasn't alone with her, \n     he lied.\n\n  That characterization of the President's grand jury testimony is not \ntrue. There can be absolutely no doubt that during his grand jury \ntestimony, the President acknowledged--he did not deny, he repeatedly \nacknowledged--that he had been, on certain occasions, alone with Ms. \nLewinsky. He acknowledged that fact in the opening sentence of his \nprepared statement to the grand jury. Let me read it. Let me read you \nthe first words in the President's opening statement to the grand jury:\n\n       When I was alone with Ms. Lewinsky on certain occasions in \n     early 1996, and once in early 1997, I engaged in conduct that \n     was wrong.\n\n  ``When I was alone with Ms. Lewinsky,'' that is what the President of \nthe United States said. That is what the transcript says. And no amount \nof eloquence or lawyerly skill from the managers can change that fact. \nFacts are stubborn.\n  He also engaged in a lengthy colloquy with the prosecutors about how \nmany times he thought he had been alone with Ms. Lewinsky. And there \ncan be no doubt in anyone's mind that he answered that he had been \nalone with Ms. Lewinsky on frequent occasions. He was asked, and he \nanswered, and he said yes, and he made clear what he meant. He went on \nto say:\n\n       I did what people do when they do the wrong thing. I tried \n     to do it where nobody else was looking at it. I'd have to be \n     an exhibitionist, not to have tried to exclude everyone else.\n\n  These are not the words of someone who is trying to hide the fact of \nhis relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. And it is difficult to understand \nhow reading these words, as well as the long and detailed testimony in \nfront of the grand jury, how one can think or contend that the \nPresident repeated or ratified in his deposition before the grand jury \nabout not ever being alone.\n\n  In the managers' trial brief issued just 3 days before they made \ntheir presentation to the statement, the brief makes the following \nstatement. This is mischaracterization No. 4.\n\n       [The President] falsely testified that he answered \n     questions truthfully at his deposition concerning, among \n     other subjects, whether he had been alone with Ms. Lewinsky.\n\n  Members of the Senate, as I just outlined in connection with Manager \nGraham's statement, this characterization of the President's grand jury \ntestimony is misleading. The lawyers for the Office of the Independent \nCounsel asked many questions and engaged in extensive colloquy with the \nPresident about being alone with Ms. Lewinsky. But they never asked him \nto explain, affirm, defend, or justify his testimony about that same \ntopic in the Jones deposition. And he did not do so.\n  Members of the Senate, if justice is to be done, these misstatements \nand mischaracterizations must not be allowed to stand and must not be \nallowed to influence your judgment as you look at the evidence. So, \nplease look at the real record. It is the record of the President's \ntestimony, not the Jones deposition--his testimony before the grand \njury that should be the Senate's sole concern.\n  Now, it is timely, I think, to talk a little bit about legalisms and \ntechnicalities and hairsplitting because those who have engaged in this \nprocess over the past months in this enterprise of defending the \nPresident have also been the subject of much criticism. The majority \ncounsel accused us of ``legal hairsplitting, prevarication and \ndissembling,'' and urged the Members of the Senate and the House to pay \nno attention to the ``obfuscations and legalistic pyrotechnics of the \nPresident's defenders.'' And during his presentation just last week on \nJanuary 15, Congressman McCollum implored you ``not to get hung up on \nsome of the absurd and contorted explanations of the President and his \nattorneys.''\n  To the extent that we have relied on overly legal or technical \narguments to defend the President from his attackers, we apologize to \nhim, to you, and to the American public. We do the President no earthly \ngood if, in the course of defending him, we offend both the judges, the \njurors, and the American public. And Mr. Ruff had it just right when he \nexpressed his concern to the members of the Judiciary Committee that \nour irresistible urge to practice our profession should not get in the \nway of securing a just result in this very grave proceeding for this \nvery specific client.\n  But, when an individual--any individual--is accused of committing a \ncrime such as perjury, the prosecutors must be put to their full proof. \nEvery element of the crime must be proven. And if a criminal standard \nis going to be used here it must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  Now, the managers have taken it upon themselves directly and \naggressively to accuse this President of criminal activity. They say \nthat this criminal activity is at the heart of the effort to remove him \nfrom office. As Congressman McCollum said to you last week:\n\n       The first thing you have to determine is whether or not the \n     President committed crimes. If he didn't obstruct justice or \n     witness tamper or commit perjury, no one believes [no one \n     believes] he should be removed from office.\n\n  Allegations of legal crimes invite, indeed they call out for legal \ndefenses. And you will not be surprised to learn that in defending the \nPresident of the United States, we intend and we will use all the legal \ndefenses that are available to us, as they would be available to any \nother citizen of this country.\n  Teddy Roosevelt, quoted earlier in this proceeding, said it best: \n``No man is above the law and no man is below the law either.'' In \nfact, the mere act of alleging perjury, as those of you in this body \nknow who have tried perjury cases, the mere act of alleging perjury \ninvites precisely the kind of hairsplitting everyone seems to deplore. \nIf it is the will of the Congress to change the crime of perjury, to \nmodify it, to eliminate certain judicially created defenses to that \noffense, so be it. But the crime of perjury has developed the way it \nhas for some very good reasons, and it has a long and distinguished \npedigree.\n  Its essential elements are well and clearly established, and Manager \nChabot's presentation was clear on those points, although you will not \nbe surprised to learn that I disagree with his conclusions. Courts have \nconcluded that no one should be convicted of perjury without \ndemonstrating that the testimony in question was, in fact, false; that \nthe person testifying knew it to be false; and that the testimony \ninvolved an issue that is material to the case, one that could \ninfluence the outcome of the matter one way or another.\n\n  In addition, courts and prosecutors are in general agreement that \nprosecutions for perjury should not be brought on the basis of an oath \nagainst an oath. The Supreme Court has spoken on this issue, holding \nthat a conviction for perjury ``ought not to rest entirely upon an oath \nagainst an oath.''\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, when we presented our case to the \nJudiciary Committee last December, we invited five experienced \nprosecutors to examine the record of this case and to give us their \nviews as to whether they would bring charges of perjury and obstruction \nof justice against the President based on that record. These five \nattorneys are five of the best, the most experienced, the most tested \nprosecutors the country has ever seen. Three served as high officials \nin Republican Departments of Justice; two served during Democratic \nadministrations. All were in agreement that no responsible prosecutor \nwould bring this case against President Clinton.\n  I would like to run the tape recordings of testimony from two of the \nindividuals who testified, Tom Sullivan, former U.S. attorney from the \nNorthern District of Illinois, as he describes\n\n[[Page S814]]\n\nthe law of perjury, and Richard Davis, an experienced trial lawyer with \nprosecutorial experience in the Department of Justice and the \nDepartment of the Treasury.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n       Mr. Sullivan. . . . The law of perjury can be particularly \n     arcane, including the requirements that the government prove \n     beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew his \n     testimony to be false at the time he or she testified, that \n     the alleged false testimony was material, and that any \n     ambiguity or uncertainty about what the question or answer \n     meant must be construed in favor of the defendant.\n       Both perjury and obstruction of justice are what are known \n     as specific intent crimes, putting a heavy burden on the \n     prosecutor to establish the defendant's state of mind. \n     Furthermore, because perjury and obstruction charges often \n     arise from private dealings with few observers, the courts \n     have required either two witnesses who testified directly to \n     the facts establishing the crime, or, if only one witness \n     testifies to the facts constituting the alleged perjury, that \n     there be substantial corroborating proof to establish guilt. \n     Responsible prosecutors do not bring these charges lightly.\n\n  The next testimony you will hear is from Richard Davis, who is Acting \nDeputy Attorney General--excuse me, he was assistant from the Southern \nDistrict of New York, task force leader for a Watergate special \nprosecution force and Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Enforcement \nand Operations from 1977 to 1981.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Mr. Davis. . . . In the context of perjury prosecutions, \n     there are some specific considerations which are present when \n     deciding whether such a case can be won. First, it is \n     virtually unheard of to bring a perjury prosecution based \n     solely on the conflicting testimony of two people. The \n     inherent problems in bringing such a case are compounded to \n     the extent that any credibility issues exist as to the \n     government's sole witness.\n       Second, questions and answers are often imprecise. \n     Questions sometimes are vague, or used too narrowly to define \n     terms, and interrogators frequently ask compound or \n     inarticulate questions, and fail to follow up imprecise \n     answerers. Witnesses often meander through an answer, \n     wandering around a question, but never really answering it. \n     In a perjury case, where the precise language of a question \n     and answer are so relevant, this makes perjury prosecutions \n     difficult, because the prosecutor must establish that the \n     witness understood the question, intended to give a false, \n     not simply an evasive answer, and in fact did so. The problem \n     of establishing such intentional falsity is compounded, in \n     civil cases, by the reality that lawyers routinely counsel \n     their clients to answer only the question asked, not to \n     volunteer, and not to help out an inarticulate questioner.\n\n  Legalistic though some of these legal defenses may be, these are the \nrespectable and respected, acceptable and expected defenses available \nto anyone charged with this kind of a crime. So to accuse us of using \nlegalisms to defend the President when he is being accused of perjury \nis only to accuse us of defending the President. We plead guilty to \nthat charge, and the truth is that an attorney who failed to raise \nthese defenses might well be guilty of malpractice.\n  But putting the legal defenses aside, it is not a legalistic issue to \npoint out that the President did not say much of what he is accused of \nhaving said. It is not legalistic to point out that a witness did not \nsay what some rely on her testimony to establish. And it is not too \nlegalistic to point out that a President of the United States should \nnot be convicted of perjury and removed from office over an argument, a \ndispute about what is and what is not the commonly accepted meaning of \nwords in his testimony.\n  I would like to make one additional point about the Office of the \nIndependent Counsel and the Starr prosecutors. They, as you know, have \nhad a long and difficult relationship with the White House. It has been \nintense, adverse, frequently hostile. They were the ones who conducted \nthe interrogation of the President before the grand jury. These \nattorneys from the Office of Independent Counsel were identified by Mr. \nStarr as being experienced and seasoned and professional.\n  In the referral that they sent over to the House of Representatives, \nthey make three allegations of grand jury perjury, and the managers, \nbased on my analysis of Mr. Rogan's speech, appear to have adopted two \nof those allegations.\n  What is most remarkable is the fact that the managers make many, many \nallegations of grand jury perjury that the Independent Counsel declined \nto make, that were not included in the referral.\n  Think about it for a moment. The lawyers working for the Office of \nthe Independent Counsel, they were in charge of this investigation. \nThey were the ones who called the President. They were the ones running \nthe grand jury. It was their grand jury. They conducted the questioning \nof the President. They picked the topics. They asked the follow-up \nquestions.\n  You should remember one additional fact. Their standard for making a \nreferral is presumably much lower than the standard you would expect \nfrom the managers in making a case for the removal of the President in \nan article of impeachment. The Independent Counsel Act calls upon the \nIndependent Counsel to make a referral when there is credible and \nsubstantial information of potential impeachable offenses.\n  They looked at the record, the same record that the managers had, and \nthey did make a referral and they did send recommendations to the House \nof Representatives.\n  But these lawyers, Mr. Starr and his fellow prosecutors, did not see \nfit to allege most of the charges that we are discussing today. It is \nfair for us to assume that the Office of Independent Counsel considered \nand declined to make the very allegations of perjury that the House \nmanagers presented to you last week. Apparently, the managers believe \nthat Ken Starr and his prosecutors have been simply too soft on the \nPresident.\n  This should cause the Members of the Senate some concern and some \nadditional reason to give very careful scrutiny to these charges. When \nyou do, you will find the following: The allegations are frequently \ntrivial, almost always technical, often immaterial and always \ninsubstantial. Certainly not a good or justifiable basis for removing \nany President from office.\n  Finally, as we go through the allegations and the evidence that I \nwill be discussing, please ask yourself, What witness do I want to hear \nabout this issue? Will live witnesses really make a difference in the \nway that I think about this? Are they necessary for this case and this \narticle to be understood and resolved?\n  Subpart 1 has to do with testimony about the nature and details of \nthe relationship with Monica Lewinsky. And, once again, because article \nI does not identify with any specificity what the President said in the \ngrand jury that is allegedly perjurious, the House managers have been \nfree to include whatever specific allegations they--not the House of \nRepresentatives--have seen fit to level against the President.\n  And we have been left to guess--so this is my guesswork--we have been \nleft to guess what the specific allegations are. And we have done so. \nAnd we have tried to identify the precise testimony at issue based on \nthe managers' trial brief and on Mr. Manager Rogan's presentation.\n  Now, as you will see in these allegations of subpart 1, it is the \nmanagers who resort to legalisms, who use convoluted definitions and \nword games to attack the President. It is the managers who employ \ntechnicalities and legal mumbo jumbo, who distort the true meaning of \nwords and phrases in an effort to convict the President. And we are the \nones who must cry ``Foul.'' We are the ones who must point out what the \nmanagers are trying to do here. They seek to convict the President and \nremove him from office for perjury before a grand jury by transforming \nwholly innocent statements about immaterial issues into what are \nalleged to be ``perjurious, false and misleading'' testimony.\n  I begin with what is identified in the majority report as ``direct \nlies.'' First, the managers claim that the President perjured himself \nbefore the grand jury, that he told a direct lie and should be removed \nfrom office because in his prepared statement he acknowledged having \ninappropriate contact with Ms. Lewinsky on ``certain occasions.'' This \nwas a ``direct lie,'' say the managers, because, according to Ms. \nLewinsky, between November 15, 1995, and December 28, 1997, they were \nalone at least 20 times and had, she says, 11 sexual encounters. To use \nthe words ``on certain occasions'' in this context is, according to the \nmanagers, ``perjurious, false and misleading.''\n  Now, this particular chart was not included in Mr. Starr's referral, \nand it was not debated by the members of the\n\n[[Page S815]]\n\nJudiciary Committee in the House of Representatives.\n  The managers also say that the President lied to the grand jury and \nshould be removed from office because the President acknowledged that \n``on occasion'' he had telephone conversations that included sexual \nbanter--this is also in the prepared statement--when the managers say \nthe President and Ms. Lewinsky had 17 such telephone conversations over \na 2-year period of time. To use the words ``on occasion'' in this \ncontext, it is, according to the managers, a ``direct lie'' to the \ngrand jury for which the President should be removed from office. Now, \nthis charge was not included in Mr. Starr's referral. It was not \ndebated by the members of the House Judiciary Committee. And it was not \ndebated on the floor of the House.\n  In responding to these two charges, it may make some sense to begin \nwith the dictionary definition of ``occasional'' to satisfy ourselves \nthat the President's statement is, in fact, a more than reasonable and \nactually an accurate use of that word under the circumstances.\n  Now, there are 774 days in the time span between November 1995 and \nDecember 1997. I submit that it is not a distortion, it is not \ndishonest to describe their activity, which Ms. Lewinsky claims \noccurred on 11 different days--from our examination of her testimony, \nwe can only locate 10, but she says 11--as having occurred ``on certain \noccasions.'' Look at the calendar.\n  Now, that phrase, ``on certain occasions,'' carries no inference of \nfrequency or numerosity. Sort of means it happened every now and then. \nAnd the same could be said for the use of the words ``on occasion'' \nwhen they were talking about telephone conversations to describe 17 \ntelephone conversations that included explicit sexual language.\n  Now, as you consider the second allegation having to do with the \nphone calls, you might also read the grand jury testimony of Ms. \nLewinsky herself on August 20, 1998, at page 1111. There a grand juror \nasks her, how much of the time, and how often--when she was on the \nphone with the President--did they engage in these kinds of graphic \nconversations. Ms. Lewinsky answered, ``Not always. On a few \noccasions.'' The managers are trying to remove the President from \noffice when he used the words ``on occasions,'' when Ms. Lewinsky \ndescribed that frequency or that event precisely the same way.\n  There is simply no way that the President's use of the words ``on \ncertain occasions'' or ``on occasion'' can be used as an effort to \nmislead or deceive the members of the grand jury or to conceal \nanything. There is simply no way that a reasonable person can look at \nthis testimony and conclude--or agree with the managers--that it is a \n``direct lie.'' What message do the managers send to America and to the \nrest of the world when they include these kinds of allegations as \nreasons to remove this President from office?\n\n  It is hard to take the charges seriously when in each case they boil \ndown to arguments of semantics. Does anyone here really believe that \nMembers of the House of Representatives would have voted to approve \nthese allegations as the basis for impeaching and removing this \nPresident if they had been given the chance with specific, identified \nperjurious testimony in a proposed article of impeachment? But here we \nare in the well of the Senate defending the President of the United \nStates against allegations that the managers believe and have seriously \nargued should cause the President to be removed from office and even \nprosecuted and convicted in a criminal court.\n  The President is also accused of lying before the grand jury--and the \nmanagers have asked you to convict him and remove him from office--\nbecause, in the prepared statement that he read to the grand jury in \nAugust, he acknowledged that he engaged in inappropriate conduct with \nMs. Lewinsky ``on certain occasions in early 1996 and once in 1997.'' \nThe managers call this a ``direct lie'' because the President did not \nmention 1995. And in their Trial Memorandum they write: ``Notice [the \nPresident] did not mention 1995. There was a reason: On three \n`occasions' in 1995, Ms. Lewinsky said she engaged in sexual contact \nwith the President.''\n  Now, this was one allegation that the Office of the Independent \nCounsel did include in its referral to the House. And this charge was, \nin fact, discussed and debated by the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee when they conducted their impeachment inquiry. Let me show \nyou what two members of that committee--now managers for the House in \nthis trial--thought about this particular charge of perjury when \nCongressman Barney Frank ridiculed it during the debate.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Hyde--we are missing an \nexhibit here; I think it is No. 10--said, ``It doesn't strike me as a--\nas a terribly serious count.'' Congressman Canady, in his closing \nargument in the final stage of that proceeding, said, ``I freely \nacknowledge that reasonable people can disagree about the weight of the \nevidence on certain of the charges. For example, I think there is doubt \nabout the allegations that the President willfully lied concerning the \ndate his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky began.''\n  This allegation involves an utterly meaningless disparity in \ntestimony about dates that are of absolutely no consequence whatsoever. \nThe most likely explanation here is that there was an honest difference \nin recollection. There is no dispute about the critical facts that Ms. \nLewinsky was young, very young, too young, when she got involved with \nPresident Clinton. But her age didn't change between November 1995 and \nJanuary 1996. Her birthday is in July. She was 22 years old in November \nand 22 years old in January, despite the fact that every manager \npersists in stating, erroneously--not perjuriously, erroneously--that \nshe was 21 years old when she first became involved with the President. \nNothing of any importance in the case took place between December 1995 \nand January 1996. She was an intern in the early stage of that period, \nand she became a Government employee. So it did not change the \nrelationship that she had with the President. It modified her title. \nAny dispute over this immaterial issue is silly.\n  It is unreasonable to argue, as we heard from the House managers last \nweek, that if you believe Ms. Lewinsky and disbelieve the President on \nthis issue as to which date was the date that they began the \nrelationship and had the inappropriate contact, that you must convict \nthe President and remove him from office.\n  I confess, I find myself in agreement with Congressman Hyde when he \nsays this allegation is not serious, not ``terribly serious.'' And I \nagree with Congressman Canady when he suggests ``there is'' room for \n``doubt'' as to whether the President had any real reason or motive to \nlie about these things.\n  I truly wonder if the House of Representatives, had it been \nidentified as a specific statement for them to consider, would have \nmade and included this allegation in the articles of impeachment aimed \nat removing President Clinton from office.\n  Is this conflict in testimony really such a serious issue that, if \nyou find the President is mistaken, he should be removed from office? \nAnd is it important enough to require the testimony of live witnesses? \nIs it material of anything of interest to the grand jury at the time \nthis testimony was given? I don't think so.\n  Now, between the time of the vote in the House and the time that the \nmanagers filed their trial brief, the managers came up with another \nallegation of perjury and put it into the mix. They argue that this \nelement of the President's grand jury testimony should also cause him \nto be removed from office. This allegation involves the President's \nstatement that there was some period of friendship with Ms. Lewinsky \nthat led to inappropriate contact. But it is immaterial, unimportant, \nand fundamentally frivolous as an allegation. And it was not, needless \nto say, included in the Starr referral. I am sure the attorneys in the \nOffice of Independent Counsel knew about this statement and chose not \nto include it. It was never discussed by the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee during the impeachment inquiry. We never heard about it, \nnever saw it, never had a chance to deal with it. It was never \nmentioned on the floor of the House of Representatives.\n  According to my examination--which may be flawed--my thinking is that \nit made its first appearance in the matter\n\n[[Page S816]]\n\nonly after the House of Representatives voted on the articles of \nimpeachment when the managers filed their trial brief. Does anyone \nreally believe that the House of Representatives would have voted to \napprove this allegation as a basis for convicting and removing this \nPresident from office?\n  Then the managers turn to what, in the majority report, they call \n``the heart of the perjury''; that is, the President's grand jury \ntestimony that his encounters with Ms. Lewinsky did not constitute \n``sexual relations'' as defined by the Jones lawyers in the Jones \ndeposition.\n  Before dealing with this allegation, however, it is important to \nunderstand that in the course of his testimony the President was \nrequired to deploy two different definitions of ``sexual relations.'' \nOne was his own and the other was the definition supplied to him by the \nJones lawyers and modified by Judge Susan Webber Wright during his \ndeposition.\n  First, if you turn to exhibit No. 11, you will find the President's \ndefinition, his own personal definition, as reported to the grand jury.\n  Next, let me direct your attention to the transcript of the telephone \nconversation between Monica Lewinsky--I am talking here about exhibit \n12--Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp, where Ms. Lewinsky explained her \ndefinition of ``sexual relations.'' This conversation occurred, \nincidentally, many weeks before Ms. Lewinsky executed her affidavit for \nthe Jones case.\n\n  Finally, look at the dictionaries and read their definitions. You can \nsee that in exhibit 13.\n  By the way, exhibit 12, which includes Ms. Lewinsky's definition, is \nconfirmed by other parts of the record where she talks to other \nindividuals, FBI agents. She refers to this understanding and this \ndefinition in her proffer. So it is not just the one telephone \nconversation to establish what Monica Lewinsky says she thought at that \ntime the definition was.\n  Although some might think that the President's definition is unduly \nlimited and that both of them are splitting hairs, there is some \nreasonable basis and there is reputable authority to support their \nview. It seems clear that Ms. Lewinsky could think, and probably did \nthink and reassure herself at the time she wrote and executed her \naffidavit, that the affidavit she submitted in the Jones case was, in \nfact, accurate. And thus, knowing Ms. Lewinsky's view of that situation \nand sharing her definition, the President could reasonably say, \n``Absolutely, yes,'' when Mr. Bennett asked the President if Ms. \nLewinsky's affidavit stating she had never had sexual relations with \nthe President was true.\n  How can you accept the argument of the House managers that the \nPresident should be removed from office because his definition, which \nis the dictionary definition, does not comport with theirs?\n  We are going to play the videotape. We are going to talk about the \ndefinition that was the second definition that was given to the \nPresident in the Jones deposition, which is also the subject of grand \njury testimony, and we are going to play 14 minutes of that videotape \nat the beginning of the President's appearance, or at the time he was \nfirst handed the definition and sits at the table.\n  This may be a good time to take a break because it will be a 14-\nminute span of time.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that we take a \n10-minute recess at this time. I urge the Senators to relax a moment \nbut come right back to the Chamber so we can proceed.\n  There being no objection, at 2:06 p.m., the Senate recessed until \n2:24 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate will come to order.\n  The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I believe we will be proceeding with Mr. \nCounsel Craig's video perhaps, or do you have something before that?\n  Mr. Counsel CRAIG. I have a little bit of production.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Counsel Craig.\n  Mr. Counsel CRAIG. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Exhibit No. 14 in your collection of exhibits is the definition that \nthe President was handed when he went into his deposition testimony--to \ngive his deposition testimony. There are two or three things I would \nlike to say about this exhibit before we go to the videotape.\n  The first is this: Many of the President's critics have accused the \nPresident of himself coming up with this tortured and convoluted \ndefinition so that he could get away with denying having sex with Ms. \nLewinsky; that he was the one that came up with a bizarre and surreal \ndefinition that would give him some plausible deniability and allow him \nto conceal his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky from the Jones lawyers. \nBut in truth this definition was not his idea, not his work product, \nnot his own definition. And it is unfair and inaccurate to saddle him \nwith inventing such a silly and truncated definition, and the event \nthat flows from that.\n  My second point is this: The mere fact that the lawyers in Jones felt \nthe need to use a definition for sexual relations is, by itself, \nstanding alone, evidence to support the notion that at least they \nrecognized that the precise meaning of the term can and does differ \nfrom person to person. It is precisely then, when there is some \nuncertainty or ambiguity about the meaning and common usage of words, \nthat lawyers turn to create a definition in an effort to have clarity, \nuniformity and common understanding. And the very fact that the lawyers \nin Jones seem to think that a definition was needed means that without \nsuch a definition there is no commonly accepted, no universally agreed \nupon meaning of this phrase. And what is or is not included within the \nambit of that definition becomes an argument and nothing more--\ncertainly not perjury.\n  The third point to remember before we watch the President as he first \nsees this piece of paper is this:\n  To understand what is going on in the President's mind at the time he \ntestified about this definition during the Jones deposition, you must \nlook at what was deleted as well as looking at that part of the \ndefinition that was left behind.\n  You will see that in the third paragraph of the definition there is \nthe description which, in fact, more closely approximates what went on \nbetween Ms. Lewinsky and the President within the first paragraph. And \nthis part of the definition was deleted by the judge.\n  There is an additional point. On the tape you will hear the \nPresident's lawyer, Mr. Bennett--and Mr. Ruff referred to this \nyesterday--urging the Jones lawyers to abandon this definition, to \nleave it behind, and ask direct questions of the President as to what \nhe did. The record would certainly have been clearer for all of us if \nhe had followed Mr. Bennett's advice. And there is another voice that \nyou will hear in addition to Mr. Bennett--Mr. Fisher, who was the Jones \nlawyer, the judge, Judge Wright, and the voice of the lawyer of the \nPresident's codefendant in the case of Danny Ferguson.\n  Let me just briefly tell you what to look for. The President first \nsaw this definition when he entered the room and sat down to testify--\nnot before. You will see him as he sits there and he is handed a piece \nof paper with the definition typed on it. Neither he nor his lawyer had \never seen that definition before. He was then required to sit down to \nstudy it, and to understand it.\n  And if you look at the next exhibit, this is what he says about what \nhe thought and did later in the grand jury. I think this is the \ndefinition, exhibit No. 15. You will watch him as he says this.\n\n       I might also note that when I was given this and began to \n     ask questions about it, I actually circled number one. This \n     is my circle here. I remember doing that so I could focus \n     only on those two lines, which is what I did.\n\n  This was the actual deposition exhibit with his circle around No. 1.\n  Let us remember finally what his testimony is about his intentions in \nthis deposition. ``My goal is to be truthful, but I didn't want to help \nthem.''\n  Let's watch what happened.\n  [Text of videotape presentation:]\n\n       A. Good morning.\n       Q. My name is Jim Fisher, sir, and I'm an attorney from \n     Dallas, Texas, and I represent\n\n[[Page S817]]\n\n     the Plaintiff, Paula Jones, in this case. Do you understand \n     who I am and who I'm representing today?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. And do you understand, sir, that your answers to my \n     questions today are testimony that is being given under oath?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. And your testimony is subject to the penalty of perjury; \n     do you understand that, sir?\n       A. I do.\n       Q. Sir, I'd like to hand you what has been marked \n     Deposition Exhibit 1. So that the record is clear today, and \n     that we know that we are communicating, this is a definition \n     of a term that will be used in the course of my questioning, \n     and the term is ``sexual relations.'' I will inform the Cour \n     that the wording of this definition is patterned after \n     Federal Rule of Evidence 413. Would you please take whatever \n     time you need to read this definition because when I use the \n     term ``sexual relations,'' this is what I mean today.\n       Mr. Bennett. Is there a copy for the Court?\n       Mr. Fisher. Would you pass that, please?\n       Mr. Bennett. Your Honor, as an introductory matter, I think \n     this could really lead to confusion, and I think it's \n     important that the record be clear. For example, it says, the \n     last line, ``contact means intentional touching, directly or \n     through clothing,'' I mean just for example, one could have a \n     completely innocent shake of the hand, and I don't want this \n     record to reflect--I think we're here today for Counsel for \n     the Plaintiff to ask the President what he knows about \n     various things, what he did, what he didn't do, but I, I have \n     a real problem with this definition which means all things to \n     all people in this particular context, Your Honor.\n       Mr. Bristow. Your Honor, I think the wording of that is \n     extremely erroneous. What this, what the deposing attorney \n     should be looking at is exactly what occurred, and he can ask \n     the witness to describe as exactly as possible what occurred, \n     but to use this as an antecedent to his questions, it would \n     put him in a position, if the President admitted shaking \n     hands with someone, then under this truncate deposition--or \n     definition, he could say or somehow construe that to mean \n     that that involves some sort of sexual relations, and I \n     think it's very unfair. Frankly I think it's a political \n     trick, and I've told you before how I feel about the \n     political character of what this lawsuit is about.\n       Mr. Fisher. Your Honor, may I respond?\n       Judge Wright. You may.\n       Mr. Fisher. The purpose of this is to avoid everything that \n     they have expressed concern about. It is to allow us to be \n     discreet and to make the record crystal clear. There is \n     absolutely no way that this could ever be construed to \n     include a shaking of the hand.\n       Mr. Bennett. Well, Mr. Fisher, let me refer you to \n     paragraph two. It says ``contact between any part of the \n     person's body or an object and the genitals or anus of \n     another person.''\n       What if the President patted me and said I had to lose ten \n     pounds off my bottom? I--you could be arguing that I had \n     sexual relations with him. Your Honor, this is going to lead \n     to confusion. Why don't they ask the President what he did, \n     what he didn't do, and then we can argue in Court later about \n     what it means.\n       Judge Wright. All right, let me make a ruling on this. It \n     appears that this really is not the definition of contact \n     under Rule 413 because Rule 413 deals with nonconsensual \n     contact. This definition would encompass contact that is \n     consensual, and of course the Court has ruled that some \n     consensual contact is relevant in this case, and so let the \n     record reflect that the Court disagrees with counsel that \n     this is not, about it being the definition under Rule 413. \n     It's not. It is more in keeping with, however, the Court's \n     previous rules, but I certainly agree with the President's \n     Counsel that this, the definition number two is too \n     encompassing, it's too broad, and so is definition number \n     three. Definition number one encompasses intent, and so that \n     would be, but numbers two and three is just, are just too \n     broad.\n       Mr. Fisher. All right, Your Honor.\n       Judge Wright. And number one is not too broad, however, so \n     I'll let you use that definition as long as we understand \n     that that's not Rule 413, it's just the rule that would apply \n     in this case to intentional sexual contact.\n       Mr. Fisher. Yes, Your Honor, and had I been allowed to \n     develop this further, everyone would have seen that \n     Deposition Exhibit 2 is actually the definition of sexual \n     assault or offensive sexual assault, which is the term in \n     Rule 413.\n       Mr. Bennett. Your Honor, I object to this record being \n     filled with these kinds of things. This is going to leak. Why \n     don't they ask--they have got the President of the United \n     States in this room for several hours. Why don't they ask him \n     questions about what happened or didn't happen?\n       Judge Wright. I will permit him to refer to definition \n     number one, which encompasses knowing and intentional sexual \n     contact for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual \n     desire. I'll permit that. Go ahead.\n       Q. All right, Mr. President, in light of the Court's \n     ruling, you may consider subparts two and three of Deposition \n     Exhibit 1 to be stricken, and so when in my questions I use \n     the term ``sexual relations,'' sir, I'm talking only about \n     part one in the definition of the body. Do you understand \n     that, sir?\n       A. I do.\n       Q. I'm now handing you what has been marked Deposition \n     Exhibit 2. Please take whatever time you need to read \n     Deposition Exhibit 2.\n       Mr. Bennett. Your Honor, again, what I am very worried \n     about, Your Honor, is first of all, this, this, this appears \n     to be a--I mean what I don't want to do is have him being \n     asked questions and then we don't, we're all ships passing in \n     the night. They're thinking of one thing, he's thinking of \n     another. Are we talking criminal assault? I mean this is not \n     what a deposition is for, Your Honor. He can ask the \n     President, what did you do? He can ask him specifically in \n     certain instances what he did, and isn't that what this \n     deposition is for? It's not to sort of lay a trap for him, \n     and I'm going to object, to the President answering and \n     having to remember what's on this whole sheet of paper, and I \n     just don't think it's fair. It's going to lend to confusion.\n       Judge Wright. All right, do you agree with Mr. Bennett?\n       Mr. Bristow. I had one other point to add Your Honor.\n       Judge Wright. All right.\n       Mr. Bristow. This is almost like in a typical automobile \n     accident where the plaintiff's counsel wants to ask the \n     defendant were you negligent. That's not factual.\n       Judge Wright. Mr. Fisher, do you have a----\n       Mr. Fisher. Yes, Your Honor. What I'm trying to do is avoid \n     having to ask the President a number of very salacious \n     questions and to make this as discreet as possible. This \n     definition, I think the Court will find, is taken directly \n     from Rule 413 which I believe President Clinton signed into \n     law, with the exception that I have narrowed subpart one to a \n     particular section, which would be covered by Rule 413, and I \n     have that section here to give the President so that there is \n     no question what is intended. This will eliminate confusion, \n     not cause it.\n       Mr. Bennett. Your honor, I have no objection where the \n     appropriate predicates are made for them to ask the President \n     , did you know X, yes or no, what happened, what did you do, \n     what didn't you do. We are--acknowledge that some \n     embarrassing questions will be asked, but then we will know \n     what we're talking about, but I do not want my client \n     answering questions not understanding exactly what these \n     folks are talking about.\n       Now, Your Honor, I told you that the President has a \n     meeting at four o'clock, and we've already wasted twenty \n     minutes, and Mr. Fisher has yet to ask his first factual \n     question.\n       Judge Wright. Well, I'm prepared to rule, and I will not \n     permit this definition to be understood. Quite frankly \n     there's several reasons. One is that the Court heretofore has \n     not proceeded using these definitions. We have used, we've \n     made numerous rulings or the Court has made numerous rulings \n     in this case without specific reference to these definitions, \n     and so if you want to know the truth, I don't know them very \n     well. I would find it difficult to make rulings, and Mr. \n     Bennett has made clear that he acknowledges that embarrassing \n     questions will be asked, and if this is in fact an effort on, \n     on the part of Plaintiff's Counsel to avoid using sexual \n     terms and avoid going into great detail about what might or \n     might not have occurred, then there's no need to worry about \n     that, you may go into the detail.\n       Mr. Bennett. If the predicates are met, have no objection \n     to the detail.\n       Mr. Fisher. Thank you, Your Honor.\n       Judge Wright. It's just going to make it very difficult for \n     me to rule, if you want to know the truth, and I'm not sure \n     Mr. Clinton knows all these definitions, anyway.\n\n  Did you hear that last statement from the judge? ``I'm not sure Mr. \nClinton knows all these definitions, anyway.''\n  Now, before the grand jury the President discussed at some length and \nin great detail his interpretation of the definition that he was asked \nto apply during that deposition--the definition that he was asked to \napply. And he gave lengthy and sustained answers. And when you read the \ngrand jury testimony, as I urge you to do, you will see that they are \nconsistent and they are logical and there is reason behind his \nconclusion that his activities with Ms. Lewinsky simply did not fall \nwithin that definition.\n  There is no mystery, no deception, no lying, no effort to conceal his \nview. His view is there for all to see. It is also reported from these \nlimited excerpts from the grand jury testimony. It is a plain statement \nof his understanding. And to argue that the President, when he conveyed \nhis understanding of that definition, doesn't really believe his \nargument, and to contend that he is committing perjury when he told the \ngrand jury that he genuinely believed his interpretation of the \ndefinition--that is just speculation about what is in his mind and it \nis not the stuff or fuel of a perjury prosecution.\n  Now, I would like to return very briefly to the group of experienced \nprosecutors who gave their opinion about the President's testimony \nbefore the grand jury on this issue. They said that the President's \ninterpretation was a reasonable one under the circumstances, but the \nmanagers claim\n\n[[Page S818]]\n\nthat the President's explanation of the Jones definition, his \ninterpretation, his understanding, and his argument with the lawyers \nfrom the Office of Independent Counsel, are the heart of the perjury.\n  Let's hear what the prosecutors said about this and read the \ntranscript of their testimony when they testified before the House \nJudiciary Committee. And first we will listen to Tom Sullivan.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Mr. Sullivan. Thank you very much, Mr. Hyde. It's clear to \n     me that the president's interpretation is a reasonable one, \n     especially because the words which seem to describe oral \n     sex--the words which seem to describe directly oral sex were \n     stricken from the definition by the judge. In a perjury \n     prosecution, the government must prove beyond a reasonable \n     doubt, that the defendant knew when he gave the testimony, he \n     was telling a falsehood. The lying must be knowing and \n     deliberate. It is not perjury for a witness to evade or \n     obfuscate or answer nonresponsively. The evidence simply does \n     not support the conclusion that the president knowingly \n     committed perjury, and the case is so doubtful and weak that \n     a responsible prosecutor would not present it to the grand \n     jury.\n\n  We have one more excerpt from his testimony.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Mr. Sullivan. . . . In perjury cases, you must prove that \n     the person who made the statement made a knowingly false \n     statement. Now, where I think the defect in this prosecution \n     is, among others--and I don't think it would be brought, \n     because it's ancillary to a civil deposition--is to establish \n     that the president knew what he said was false. When he \n     testified in his grand jury testimony, he explained what his \n     mental process was in the Jones deposition, and he said the \n     two definitions that would describe oral sex had been deleted \n     by the trial judge from the definition of sexual relations \n     and I understood the definition to mean sleeping with \n     somebody. I don't want to get to particular here.\n       Rep. Lofgren. Thank you.\n       Mr. Sullivan. But that is where this case, in my opinion, \n     wouldn't go forward even if you found an errant prosecutor \n     who would want to prosecute somebody for being a peripheral \n     witness in a civil case that had been settled. That's my \n     answer to that.\n\n  The managers place great emphasis and weight on the conflict in the \ntestimony between President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky over some specific \nintimate details related to their activity. There is a variance between \nthe President's testimony and Ms. Lewinsky's testimony about the \ndetails of what they did. What do they disagree about? Not about \nwhether the President and Ms. Lewinsky had a wrongful relationship--the \nPresident admitted that before the grand jury. Not about whether the \nPresident and Ms. Lewinsky were alone together--the President admitted \nthat before the grand jury. Not about whether, when they were alone \ntogether, their relationship included inappropriate, intimate contact--\nthe President admitted that before the grand jury. Not about whether \nthey engaged in telephone conversations that included sexual banter--\nthe President admitted that before the grand jury. Not about whether \nthe President and Ms. Lewinsky wanted to keep their wrongful \nrelationship a secret--the President admitted that before the grand \njury.\n  The difference in their testimony about their relationship is limited \nto some very specific, very intimate details. And this is the heart of \nthe entire matter, this disparity in their testimony. The true nub of \nthe managers' allegation that the President committed perjury is that \nhe described some of the contact one way and she describes it another.\n  Not surprisingly, the managers choose to believe Ms. Lewinsky's \ndescription of these events. And so, even in the absence of any \nevidence to the contrary, other than Ms. Lewinsky's own recollection of \nthese events, the managers have concluded that the President lied under \noath about the details of his sexual activity, that he somehow \nshortchanged the grand jury, and should be removed from office.\n  The possibility that the question of whether the President of the \nUnited States should be removed from his office--the fact that that \nmight hinge on whether you believe him or her on this issue is a \nstaggering thought. Ordinarily when dealing with disparity in testimony \nsuch as this, prosecutors will have nothing to do with it. Only two \npeople were there. And, in truth, the real importance of the disparity \nin their testimony is questionable. Not all disparities or \ndiscrepancies in testimony are necessarily appropriate subjects for \nperjury prosecutions.\n  According to those experienced prosecutors who testified before the \nJudiciary Committee, there are two more points to be made about this. \nFirst, this is a classic oath on oath--he says, she says--swearing \nmatch, that, under ordinary custom and practice at the Department of \nJustice, never would be prosecuted without substantial corroborative \nproof. Such proof, say these experienced prosecutors, does not consist \nof testimony of friends and associates of Ms. Lewinsky who tell the FBI \nthat Ms. Lewinsky contemporaneously told them about the activity, if it \nwas going on. But the managers claim that these contemporaneous \nstatements corroborate Ms. Lewinsky's testimony.\n  That claim is specious. Statements that Ms. Lewinsky makes to other \npeople are not viewed as independent corroborative evidence. They come \nfrom the same source. They come from Ms. Lewinsky, as the source that \ngave that testimony to the grand jury. And no court and no prosecutor \nwould accept the notion that such statements, standing alone, satisfy \nthe requirement of substantial corroborative proof when there is a \nswearing match.\n  Now, let's see what the experienced prosecutors have to say about \nthis issue and that claim.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Rep. Wexler. . . . What is the false statement?\n       Mr. Sullivan. Well, if you--it could be one of two. It \n     could be when he denied having sexual relations and I've \n     already addressed that, because he said, ``I was defining the \n     term as the judge told me to define it and as I understood \n     it,'' which I think is a reasonable explanation. The other is \n     whether or not he touched her--touched her breast or some \n     other part of her body, not through her clothing, but \n     directly. And he says, ``I didn't,'' and she said, ``I (sic) \n     did,'' so it's who-shot-John. It's, it's, you know, it's a \n     one on one. The corroborative evidence that the prosecutor \n     would have to have there, which is required in a perjury \n     case--you can't do it one on one, and no good prosecutor \n     would bring a case with, you know, I say black, you say \n     white--would be the fact that they were together alone and \n     she performed oral sex on him. I think that is not sufficient \n     under the circumstances of this case to demonstrate that \n     there was any other touching by the president and therefore \n     he committed this--you know, he violated this--and committed \n     perjury.\n\n  Now the testimony from Richard Davis on this same point, and then we \nwill move to subpart 2.\n  (The text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Mr. Davis. * * * I will now turn to the issue of whether, \n     from the perspective of a prosecutor, there exists a \n     prosecutable case for perjury in front of the grand jury. The \n     answer to me is clearly no. The president acknowledged to the \n     grand jury the existence of an improper intimate relationship \n     with Monica Lewinsky, but argued with the prosecutors \n     questioning him, that his acknowledged conduct was not a \n     sexual relationship as he understood the definition of that \n     term being used in the Jones deposition. Engaging in such a \n     debate, whether wise or unwise politically, simply does not \n     form the basis for a perjury prosecution. Indeed, in the end, \n     the entire basis for a grand jury perjury prosecution comes \n     down to Monica Lewinsky's assertion that there was a \n     reciprocal nature to their relationship, and that the \n     president touched her private parts with the intent to arouse \n     or gratify her, and the president's denial that he did so. \n     Putting aside whether this is the type of difference of \n     testimony which should justify an impeachment of a president, \n     I do not believe that a case involving this kind of conflict \n     between two witnesses would be brought by a prosecutor, since \n     it would not be won at trial.\n       A prosecutor would understand the problem created by the \n     fact that both individuals had an incentive to lie--the \n     president to avoid acknowledging a false statement at his \n     civil deposition, and Miss Lewinsky to avoid the demeaning \n     nature of providing wholly unreciprocated sex. Indeed, this \n     incentive existed when Miss Lewinsky described the \n     relationship to the confidantes described in the independent \n     counsel's referral. Equally as important, however, Mr. Starr \n     has himself questioned the veracity of one witness, Miss \n     Lewinsky, by questioning her testimony that his office \n     suggested she tape record Ms. Currie, Mr. Jordan, and \n     potentially the president. And in any trial, the independent \n     counsel would also be arguing that other key points in Miss \n     Lewinsky's testimony are false, including where she \n     explicitly rejects the notion that she was asked to lie and \n     that assistance in her job search was an inducement for her \n     to do so.\n\n  The conclusion is clear: To make this case in any courtroom would be \nvery difficult for a prosecutor. They point out that it is difficult, \nif not impossible, to put on a successful prosecution if the chief \nwitness is deemed by the prosecutors to be unreliable on some issues, \nbut presented as totally truthful on others.\n\n[[Page S819]]\n\n  Now let's move to subpart 2, and it is exhibit No. 18. The \nallegations of perjury here have to do with testimony that he gave at \nthe grand jury about his deposition in the Jones case. And I begin by \nrepeating a point that I made a little earlier, that the House of \nRepresentatives did not vote to approve the article that alleged that \nPresident Clinton committed perjury during his deposition in the Jones \ncase. As I said before, there was good reason for that.\n  What are the reasons? There are many reasons. The President's \ntestimony in the Jones deposition involved his relationship with a \nwitness who was ancillary to the core issues of the Jones case. She was \na witness in the case. She wasn't the plaintiff in the case, and she \nwas ancillary to the core issues in the case, someone whose testimony \nwas thereafter held to be unnecessary and perhaps inadmissible by Judge \nSusan Webber Wright, someone whose truthful testimony would have been, \nin any event, of marginal relevance since her relationship with the \nPresident was entirely consensual. And, as you know, this was a case \nthat ultimately was found to have no legal or factual merit. It was \ndismissed by the judge, and it is now being settled by the parties.\n  Moreover, the President was caught by surprise in that deposition and \nasked questions about matters that the Jones lawyers already knew the \nanswers to. As you heard yesterday, the Jones lawyers had been briefed \nthe night before by Linda Tripp. So they were asking questions of \nPresident Clinton in the course of this deposition about the \nrelationship to which they already had the answers. That kind of ambush \nis profoundly unfair, and it is one reason that Congressman Graham said \nthat he voted against this article in committee--the surprise. He was \nthe only Republican to do so. He was the only Republican to vote \nagainst any article, and the decision of the House to follow \nCongressman Graham's leadership and to reject this article showed great \nwisdom and judgment.\n  But apparently that is not to be the end of the matter when it comes \nto allegations of perjury in the Jones deposition. In subpart 2 of \narticle I, the managers seek to reintroduce the issue of the \nPresident's testimony in the case by alleging that when the President \ntestified before the grand jury, he testified falsely when he said that \nhe tried to testify truthfully in the Jones deposition. Congressman \nRogan, Mr. Manager Rogan has claimed that the President's answers \nratified and reaffirmed and put into issue all of his answers in the \nJones deposition when he testified that he believed he did not violate \nthe law in the Jones deposition.\n  ``This is perjurious testimony,'' said Manager Rogan, ``because the \nrecord is clear''--I am quoting--that he did not testify truthfully in \nthe deposition, and by that bootstrapping mechanism, we are now in a \nlitigation about whether every single statement that the President made \nin the Jones deposition was or was not truthful to determine whether or \nnot the President's testimony that he was truthful is or is not \ntruthful.\n  But, in fact, President Clinton did not ratify, he did not reaffirm \nhis Jones testimony when he testified before the grand jury, and you \nwill see that when you read the transcript of his testimony. Quite the \ncontrary is true. If you look at that transcript carefully, you will \nfind that without admitting wrongdoing, the President elaborated, he \nmodified, he amended and he clarified his testimony in Jones. And when \nMr. Schippers made his closing argument to the House Judiciary \nCommittee, I think he used the truthfulness, on one occasion, of the \nPresident's testimony before the grand jury to support his argument \nthat the President lied in Jones.\n\n  But actually the specific wording of subpart 2 gives us no specific \ninformation and is not illuminating, and we turn to the managers' trial \nbrief to ascertain precisely what the argument is. There the managers \nallege that the President falsely testified that he answered questions \ntruthfully at his deposition concerning, among other things, whether he \nhad been alone with Ms. Lewinsky. I begin by saying, again, this \nallegation was not included in the Starr referral. Why? Because it is \nbased on a total misconception of the President's grand jury testimony.\n  As I referred to earlier, this is exhibit No. 7, I believe, and it \nshows you some evidence--this is not the complete evidence of his \ntestimony about being alone. The prosecutors asked the President many \nquestions about being alone with Ms. Lewinsky, but they never asked him \nabout the Jones testimony. They asked him about whether he was alone; \nhe never was asked about the Jones testimony:\n  ``When I was alone with Ms. Lewinsky on certain occasions,'' it says \nright there--``When I was alone. . .''\n\n       Let me ask you, Mr. President, you indicate in your \n     statement that you were alone with Ms. Lewinsky. Is that \n     right?\n       Yes, sir.\n       How many times were you alone with Ms. Lewinsky?\n       Let me begin with the correct answer. I don't know for \n     sure. But if you would like me to give an educated guess, I \n     will do that. . . .\n\n  And then you will see over two or three pages of testimony he tries \nto recall times and incidents when he was alone with Ms. Lewinsky.\n  And so the prosecutor says, ``So if I could summarize your testimony, \napproximately 5 times you saw her before she left the White House, \napproximately 9 times after she left the employment?'' ``I know there \nwere several times in '97,'' the President said. ``I would think that \nwould sound about right.''\n  This is not a man denying that he was alone with Ms. Lewinsky, but he \nwas not asked about his testimony on that topic when he testified in \nthe Jones case.\n  Now, the managers further allege that the President's testimony \nbefore the grand jury that he testified truthfully at his deposition \nwas a lie. In fact, his testimony there that they quote as being false \nwas this: ``My goal in this deposition was to be truthful but not \nparticularly helpful.'' ``My goal in this deposition to be truthful,'' \nthey say, is false. ``I was determined to walk through the minefield of \nthis deposition without violating the law, and I believe I did.'' His \nstatement that ``I believe I did,'' they say, means that everything \nthat he said in the Jones deposition was true. The President's \nstatement that he set a goal and believes--believes--he has met it is, \naccording to the managers, perjurious for which he should be removed \nfrom office.\n  And it is through this device that the managers seek to achieve, by \nindirection, what they were specifically forbidden to do by the direct \nvote of the House of Representatives, by claiming that the President's \nassertions in the grand jury were false when he described his state of \nmind--``I believed,'' ``I tried,'' ``I was determined,'' ``my goal \nwas''--that he believed the managers seek to put out all of the \nPresident's evasive and misleading testimony in the Jones deposition in \nissue. That effort, I submit, should be rejected.\n  Let me cite one rather painful example in support of the President's \ntestimony that he, in fact, tried to answer accurately when he \ntestified in the grand jury. He was asked whether or not he ever had \nsexual relations with Gennifer Flowers, and he answered, ``Yes,'' that \nhe had, under the definition of sexual relations being used in the \nJones case. He later said that he would rather have taken a whipping in \npublic than to acknowledge that relation because he knew it would be \nleaked to the public, which it was.\n  Now, if he didn't care about telling the truth in that deposition, if \nhe went into that deposition with the intention of denying anything and \neverything that was embarrassing, if he really had decided in his own \nmind that whatever the Jones lawyers asked him, he was not going to be \ntruthful about it, he never would have testified the way he did about \nGennifer Flowers.\n  Now, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, the President does not \nclaim--and he never was asked in front of the grand jury, and he never \nasserts in front of the grand jury--that all his testimony in the Jones \ndeposition was truthful. His statement was that he tried to be \naccurate, that his goal was to be truthful, but that statement is not a \nbroad reaffirmation of the accuracy of all his testimony, despite the \nHouse managers' desire to characterize it as such. Those were accurate \ndescriptions of the President's state of mind at the time he testified.\n  The real issue here is not the truth of the underlying statements \nmade by the\n\n[[Page S820]]\n\nPresident in the Jones deposition but the President's explanation of \nthose statements, whether his description of his efforts to walk this \nfine line that he gave to the grand jury was accurate. Whether you \nagree or disagree with the President's view that he was or was not \nsuccessful in his undertaking not to break the law and to be lawful, \nthat argument is an argument. And it is not a secret argument. He has \nthat out there open for everybody to see. That argument is hardly a \nproper subject for a perjury claim. And his simple restatement of his \nlegal position to the members of the grand jury is hardly the stuff of \na perjury prosecution.\n\n  Actually, if you look at the President's grand jury testimony, you \nwill see that he provided much more complete, much more accurate, much \nmore reliable testimony about many of the topics covered in Jones. And \nthe notion that he reaffirmed, confirmed, or ratified his Jones \ntestimony is just unsupported by the evidence.\n  It would be astonishing to think that the Senate would conclude that \nthe President should be removed from office because in the grand jury \nhe gave voice to a legal opinion and stated his own personal belief \nthat his testimony in the Jones deposition did not break the law.\n  I submit to you that if that was the case, the Office of the \nIndependent Counsel would have included that in the referral, and they \ndid not. In fact, let me just say right now none of the rest of the \nallegations that we are going to be discussing in the article that we \nare talking about today are included in the Starr referral. The rest \nare entirely the product of the managers.\n  Subpart 3, which is the exhibit No. 19. This has to do with the \nPresident's testimony about statements he allowed his attorney to make \nto a Federal judge in the Jones case. And you saw the tape of that \ntestimony last week.\n  According to the trial memorandum, the President remained silent \nduring the Jones deposition at a time when his counsel, Mr. Bennett, \nmade false and misleading representations to the court about Ms. \nLewinsky's affidavit. Pointing to the Lewinsky affidavit, Bennett \nstated that Ms. Lewinsky had filed an affidavit ``saying that there is \nabsolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form with \nPresident Clinton.'' And when asked by the Independent Counsel about \nthis moments before the grand jury, the President testified that he \nhadn't paid much attention, that he was thinking about his testimony. \nAnd he says this four or five times. This is not just once; he says \nthis four or five times. He is emphatic that he didn't pay attention \nand the words went by him.\n  Now, in support of their claim that the President lied when he said \nhe was not paying attention, the House managers point to the videotape \nrecord of the President's testimony which shows, they argue, that the \nPresident was ``looking directly at Mr. Bennett, [and] paying close \nattention to his argument to Judge Wright.''\n  This allegation, not included in the Starr Report, is even more \ncurious than the previous one because it is based on a novel legal \ntheory which jeopardizes all lawyers in this building, which is that a \nclient has an enforceable obligation to correct his attorney's alleged \nmisstatements. And if he doesn't make those corrections, he--the \nclient--will be held liable to charges of perjury and obstruction of \njustice.\n  The charge is that the President misled the grand jury when he said \nthat he was not paying attention. While the videotape shows that the \nPresident was looking in Bennett's direction, there is nothing that can \nbe read in his face or in his body language to show that he is \nlistening to, understanding, or affirming Mr. Bennett's statement--no \nnod of the head, no movement at all, no comment, nothing.\n  What happens is this: Mr. Bennett makes his comment and is \ninterrupted by the judge. She says, ``No, just a minute, let me make my \nruling,'' before Mr. Bennett has a chance to complete his argument. And \nafter interrupting Mr. Bennett, the judge makes a lengthy observation, \nfollowed by an intensive exchange between all counsel and the judge. \nThe moment is fleeting. It goes by very, very quickly.\n  The moment occurs not at the beginning of the deposition, but well \ninto it, after President Clinton has in fact been subjected to \nquestions about Monica Lewinsky. Mr. Clinton, as you know, has been \nsurprised by the direction the case has taken and the fact that the \nexclusive focus of these questions is on Lewinsky. He did not know this \nwas coming. He did not expect it. As he put it in his grand jury \ntestimony, ``I had no way of knowing that they would ask me all these \ndetailed questions. I did the best I could to answer them.''\n\n  At that moment, because the questions had focused on Ms. Lewinsky--to \nthe exclusion of everything and everybody else, including the Jones \ncase--questions about the Jones case didn't occur until much, much \nlater and near the end of the deposition. The President must have \nrealized that the Jones attorneys probably knew about his relationship \nwith Monica Lewinsky. He obviously had not taken any steps to prepare \nto answer questions about that relationship and he was clearly caught \noff guard.\n  It is not farfetched to think at that moment his mind was flooded \nwith thoughts about how to get through the deposition. It is not \nimplausible to think at that moment the President was preoccupied, \nwatching his lawyer do his job, and not listening carefully and not \ntracking word by word the substance of the exchange.\n  Those of you who have practiced law and have represented individuals \nunder stress at depositions know that this can happen. Is it really \nreasonable to think that you can tell beyond a reasonable doubt what is \ngoing on in the President's mind by looking at the videotape? And if \nyou can and you are convinced he has heard, does he have any obligation \nto say anything? If he doesn't, then this case, this allegation, \namounts to nothing.\n  It is hard to believe that the House managers--if it did, I think the \nStarr people would have brought it--it is hard to believe that the \nHouse managers believe that the Senate should conclude that the \nPresident committed perjury and should be removed from his office on \nthe basis of his silence, his failure to speak.\n  Now, there is a second allegation associated with this incident, one \nthat Congressman Rogan asserted in his presentation, but is not \ndiscussed in the trial memorandum. This has to do with the President's \nnow famous testimony about Mr. Bennett's statement about Ms. Lewinsky's \naffidavit. It depends upon what the meaning of ``is'' is. Let's talk \nabout that just a minute.\n  While raising questions about the good faith of the Jones attorney in \nasking questions about Ms. Lewinsky--this is in the Jones deposition--\nwhile raising questions about the good faith of the Jones attorneys and \nasking questions about Ms. Lewinsky and not knowing if these same \nlawyers actually know the answers to the questions, Mr. Bennett said, \nreferring to the Jones lawyers, ``Counsel is fully aware that [Ms. \nLewinsky] has filed an affidavit . . . saying that there is absolutely \nno sex.'' ``There is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape \nor form with President Clinton.''\n  Now, during his grand jury testimony, the independent counsel reads \nthat statement to the President. He gets President Clinton to agree \nthat the statement was made by the President's attorney in front of \nJudge Wright. And here is what the independent counsel says to \nPresident Clinton in the grand jury after reading Mr. Bennett's words:\n\n       That statement is a completely false statement. Whether or \n     not Mr. Bennett knew of your relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, \n     the statement that there is ``no sex of any kind, manner \n     shape or form with President Clinton'' was an utterly false \n     statement.\n\n  And he asks the President, ``Is that correct?'' At that point, \npausing just a moment for reflection, President Clinton gives his \nopinion and explains that opinion.\n  To understand the President's argument, you must know first that \nthere has been no inappropriate contact with Ms. Lewinsky at the time \nof that deposition for, according to his recollection, almost a year; \naccording to hers, 10 months. So it is not in dispute at that moment in \ntime and for previous months there has been. And there is no sexual \nrelationship currently, even though there had been one in 1995, 1996, \nand in the early part of 1997, some months back.\n  Now, the President makes a political mistake here and gives in to his \ninstinct to play his own lawyer, to be his\n\n[[Page S821]]\n\nown advocate. You may find it frustrating, you may find it irritating, \nwhen you watch him do this, but he is not committing perjury; he is \ncommitting the offense of nit-picking and arguing with the prosecutors. \nHe is arguing a point, and so he says that whether Mr. Bennett's \nstatement is false depends on what the meaning of ``is'' is. Mr. \nBennett's statement is true if ``is\" means an ongoing relationship, but \nMr. Bennett's statement is false if ``is'' means at any time ever in \ntime.\n  Now the President's answer to Mr. Bennett's question and the \nstatements that follow it amount to an annoying argument over the \ninterpretation of what Mr. Bennett said, focused on the tense of the \nverb. And the President is being his own lawyer. The grounds he has \nargued are fully stated, fully explained. There is no mystery. He is \nnot concealing anything. Making this argument is not perjury.\n  There is one final point to make about this incident because, again, \nI think there was a mischaracterization of what the President actually \nsaid in the grand jury. He didn't say that at the time Mr. Bennett made \nthat statement in the Jones deposition, he caught the word ``is'' and \nrecognized, ``Ah-ha, I've got an exit. That makes it accurate.'' Quite \nto the contrary. He is clear in front of the grand jury when he says \nthat he didn't even notice this issue until he was reviewing the \ntranscript in preparation for his grand jury testimony. He is clear in \npointing out the argument that he is making is one that he just \ndiscovered.\n\n  Let me quote from that portion of his testimony which appears on \npages 512 and 513 which make it clear that he wasn't ever claiming that \nhe spotted that verb tense at the time in the Jones deposition and his \nsilence or his answer was based on spotting the verb tense then. This \nis something he discovered, noticed, and, as a lawyer, argued in the \ngrand jury. ``I never even focused on that''--meaning that issue of a \nverb tense--``until I read it in this transcript in preparation for \nthis testimony * * * '' ``I wasn't trying to give you a cute answer \nthat I obviously wasn't involved in anything improper in the \ndeposition. I was trying to tell you generally speaking in the present \ntense if someone said that, that would be true. But I don't know what \nMr. Bennett had in mind. I don't know.''\n  Now, the President was open and honest and obvious in what he was \narguing, and that is precisely what he was doing on this occasion. He \nwas arguing a point that, as a technical matter, Bennett's statement \ncould be read as being accurate.\n  I point out again that this particular allegation was not included in \nMr. Starr's referral. An argument that is identified as an argument, \nthe grounds of which are clear to all, is not the basis for a perjury \nprosecution.\n  Subpart 4 of this article has to do with false and misleading \ntestimony about the President's efforts, allegedly, to influence \nwitnesses and to impede discovery in Jones. Now, as I have said before, \nat the beginning of my presentation, the fourth category of allegedly \nperjurious, false, and misleading grand jury testimony overlaps with \narticle II of allegations of obstruction of justice.\n  I will say right now that Cheryl Mills will be appearing here when I \nhave completed and David Kendall tomorrow to present the arguments on \narticle II, why the President should not be found guilty and is not \nguilty of the allegations of obstruction of justice in article II.\n  According to the managers' trial brief, making this argument that he \nalso perjured himself about these matters, they claim these lies are \nthe most troubling as the President used them in an attempt to conceal \nhis criminal actions. One begins with a self-evident proposition--at \nleast, to us--that the President did not obstruct justice, and we hope \nyou agree with us by the end of the day tomorrow when we explain the \nevidence. But his explanation, if that is so, of what he did or didn't \ndo to the grand jury were always truthful. Put another way, if the \nPresident didn't obstruct justice, he also didn't commit perjury when \nhe denied it.\n  According to the managers, the general language of this provision of \nsubpart 4 is supposed to include a wide range of allegations, so we \nhave some subparts of the subpart. But none of these allegations, let \nme say, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, none of these was included \nor thought sufficiently credible to be included in the OIC referral, \nnor were these allegations included in Mr. Schippers' initial \npresentation to the Judiciary Committee. They are nothing more than an \neffort to inflate the number of perjury allegations by converting every \nanswer that the President gave to the grand jury about the subject \nmatter of article II into a new count of perjury, the double billing, \nif you will. All of these allegations are more properly part of our \ndefense on the obstruction of justice allegation. But I will try to \nrespond briefly to the allegation of perjury, his testimony about \nMonica Lewinsky's false affidavit. This grows out of the President's \nconversation with Ms. Lewinsky, allegedly, on December 17, in which he \nis said to have corruptly encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to execute a sworn \naffidavit that he knew to be perjurious, false, and misleading.\n\n  In that famous late-night telephone conversation, Ms. Lewinsky asked \nthe President what she could do if she were subpoenaed in the Jones \ncase. According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President responded, ``Well, maybe \nyou can sign an affidavit.'' That is what Ms. Lewinsky's recollection \nis.\n  Now, in the grand jury, the President was repeatedly questioned about \nthis conversation and he repeatedly answered emphatically. This is \nanother example where it is not once or twice, it is three or four \ntimes. He truly thought he said that she could have sworn out an honest \naffidavit. The managers claim that when he said that--that he thought \nthat she could swear out an honest affidavit--the President perjured \nhimself.\n  Now, the President's testimony in the grand jury on this point is not \nin any way cautious or qualified. He makes similar statements on four \ndifferent occasions during that testimony, concluding with this tape:\n\n       I have already told you that I felt strongly that she could \n     issue--that she could execute an affidavit that would be \n     factually truthful, that might get her out of having to \n     testify. And did I hope she would be able to get out of \n     testifying on the affidavit? Absolutely. Did I want her to \n     execute a false affidavit? No, I did not.\n\n  Now, the heart of the managers' argument is that there was no way \nthat an honest affidavit can achieve what the President and Ms. \nLewinsky both wanted to have achieved, which was to avoid her having to \ntestify. And so the managers claim the President's statement that he \nthought she could make out an honest affidavit and avoid testifying in \nthe Jones case about her relationship with the President is perjury.\n  Once again, the managers claim that the President is guilty of \nperjury because he is testifying falsely about his state of mind. It \nwasn't true, they argued, that he really thought she could make out and \nsign and execute an honest affidavit; he could not have thought that; \nhe wanted and expected her to lie in that affidavit, and that is why he \nsuggested, ``Well, you can always file an affidavit.''\n  Now, Ms. Lewinsky's inappropriate contact with the President was \nconsensual. An affidavit being sought in a case involving allegations \nof sexual harassment that says there was no harassment, no effort to \nimpose unwanted sexual overtures, would have been an affidavit that Ms. \nLewinsky could honestly execute--an affidavit stating that she had \nnever been on the receiving end of any unwanted sexual overtures from \nthe President and that she had never been harassed.\n  Second, both Ms. Lewinsky and the President had a definition of \n``sexual relations'' that would have allowed Ms. Lewinsky, in her own \nmind, honestly and accurately, in their view, to swear an affidavit \nthat she had never had sexual relations--meaning what she meant in the \nexhibits we distributed--with the President. She would have thought \nthat was a factual and accurate affidavit, and so would the President \nat that time.\n  Third, it is clear that Ms. Lewinsky understood that it was not \nnecessary to volunteer information in an affidavit, but, on the \ncontrary, she would try to give only that small but true portion of the \nwhole story. She talks about this at some length in her telephone \nconversation with Linda Tripp. In her words, the goal of an affidavit \nis to be as benign as possible, to avoid being deposed. She is her own \noperator; she knows what she is doing.\n\n[[Page S822]]\n\n  Please recognize what the managers are trying to do here. In article \nII, they accuse the President of obstructing justice by suggesting that \nMs. Lewinsky should file an affidavit, knowing full well that the \naffidavit would have to be false. And when the President, under oath in \nthe grand jury, denies that he believed that the affidavit would have \nto be false, they accuse him of perjury.\n  The two allegations are inextricably intermingled, and if you \nconclude, as you should, that there is no evidence to support the \nunderlying allegation, that the underlying offense is based on nothing \nbut pure conjecture, you will conclude that the perjury charge is \nnothing more than an attempt to get two bites at the same apple.\n  The second element is the President's testimony about the gifts. The \nmanagers' trial brief says that the President committed perjury when he \ntestified that he told Ms. Lewinsky that if the Jones lawyers requested \nthe gifts that he had given to her, she should provide them. \nAtypically, the brief quotes the President's precise language which is \nat issue in this particular allegation:\n\n       And I told her that if they asked her for gifts, she would \n     have to give them whatever she had. That's what the law was.\n\n  This testimony, the managers claim, is false. They say he never said \nthat, and that when he said it in the grand jury, he is guilty of \nperjury.\n  Now, the only evidence offered to support the allegation that the \nPresident testified falsely before the grand jury on this topic is, A, \nthat Ms. Lewinsky raised a question with the President as to what she \nshould do with the gifts. You have heard a lot of testimony about that, \nwhich only establishes one thing--that the topic came up. That is \ntotally consistent with the President's testimony and has no bearing \nwhatsoever on whether the President did or did not say what he claims \nto have said.\n  The second piece of evidence is that Ms. Currie ended up picking up \nthe gifts and taking them home with her, which, no matter how you might \ntry to spin that, simply cannot be construed as evidence showing that \nthe President perjured himself when he told the grand jury that he had \ngiven this advice to Ms. Lewinsky. ``Tinkers to Evers to Chance.''\n  This allegation is all conjecture and there is no evidence. It is \nreally astonishing that the managers would seriously include it in \ntheir case. Kenneth Starr did not, and it was not discussed or debated \nby the House Judiciary Committee.\n  The majority's report makes another entirely different allegation \nabout this matter. There, the House Republicans cite the President's \ndenial--this is a denial, not an affirmation. The first has to do with \ntestimony in front of the grand jury that he said something to Monica \nLewinsky. The second has to do with a denial that he ever instructed \nMs. Currie to pick up the gifts. From the transcript of the President's \ngrand jury testimony, I quote:\n\n       Question: After you gave Monica Lewinsky the gifts on \n     December 28, did you speak with your secretary, Ms. Currie, \n     and ask her to pick up a box of gifts that were some \n     compilation of gifts that Ms. Lewinsky would have----\n       Answer: No, sir, I didn't do that.\n       Question: --to give to Ms. Currie?\n       Answer: I did not do that.\n\n  According to the majority's report, this testimony was perjurious, \nfalse, and misleading. The problem is, this allegation is similar to \nthe problem with the previous one, only greater. In the first \nallegation, there is no one who testified that the President did not \nsay what he testified under oath he said, and in this allegation there \nis no one who testified that the President said what he testified under \noath he did not say.\n  In other words, the House managers offer you this argument: Nobody \nsays the President made this statement; we just think he did; so we are \ncharging him with perjury for denying it, and you should remove him \nfrom office, despite the absence of evidence.\n  Again, this was not included in the Starr referral, and we wonder how \nthis kind of an allegation can seriously be brought against the \nPresident of the United States.\n  The President's testimony about his January 18 conversation with Ms. \nCurrie. The President's meeting and conversation with Betty Currie on \nSunday, January 18, is an essential element in the allegation of \nobstruction as set forth in article II, and you will learn more about \nthat from Cheryl Mills today. Because the Office of Independent Counsel \nspent so much time on this matter during President Clinton's grand jury \ntestimony, they examined the President on this topic on four separate \noccasions during that 4-hour session--it was inevitable that the \nManagers would find some way, some how to include his testimony about \nthis matter in Article I. Just parenthetically, this too is an \nallegation that the Office of Independent Counsel did not see fit to \nmake in its Referral to the House.\n\n  And so, once again, we begin with a question: What is it precisely \nthat the President said that is at the heart of this allegation of \nperjury. In his presentation last Thursday, Congressman Rogan quoted \nlengthy passages from a number of President Clinton's answers on the \nsubject but failed to identify anything specific. Finally Congressman \nRogan said this:\n\n       When [the President] testified he was only making \n     statements to Ms. Currie to ascertain what the facts were, \n     trying to ascertain what Betty's perception was, this \n     statement was false, and it was perjurious. We know it was \n     perjury because the president called Ms. Currie into the \n     White House the day after his deposition to tell her--not to \n     ask her, to tell her--that he was never alone with Monica \n     Lewinsky. To tell her that Ms. Currie could always hear or \n     see them, and to tell her that he never touched Monica \n     Lewinsky. These were false statements, and he knew that the \n     statements were false at the time he made them to Betty \n     Currie.\n\n  But that is not true; the President clearly asked her questions as \nwell as made declarative statements.\n  I confess to some confusion about what perjury Congressman Rogan is \nreally alleging here.\n  It seems to me that he has moved from the world of perjury in article \nI to the world of obstruction, which is Cheryl and David's article two.\n  The trial brief is more specific. They claim that the testimony was \nfalse when the President went in and said that he was ``trying to \nrefresh [his] memory about what the facts were;'' when he said that he \nwanted to ``know what Betty's memory was about what she heard;'' and \nwhen he said he was ``trying to get as much information as he could.'' \nThe purpose of the meeting and the conversation, according to the Trial \nBrief, was to influence Betty Currie's testimony, not to gather \ninformation.\n\n  In truth, the President gave a number of different reasons to the \ngrand jury for seeking out Betty Currie and talking to her about Monica \nLewinsky, and it is totally plausible to conclude that the last thing \non the President's mind at that particular moment was Betty Currie's \npotential role as a witness in a federal court.\n  More simply, the facts are that in making this particular allegation, \nthe managers have come up with two, three, or four different statements \nby the President that they claim are perjurious which makes it a total \ndistortion of the President's answer. There were many questions, and \nmany answers, and then the reasons he gave for seeking out Betty \nCurrie. Kenneth Starr made no such claim in his referral.\n  Finally, the President's testimony about allegations that he \ninfluenced his aides; to influence; that he lied to his aide--let me \nget it right. The allegation is that when the President testified in \nfront of the grand jury and denied that he misled his aides or told \nthem false things, that it was ``perjurious, false and misleading \ntestimony'' because he was really trying to use them to obstruct \njustice and influence the grand jury. The President testified in much \ngreater detail on this topic about the details about his conversation \nwith his aides than the managers suggest. And he never said that he \nonly told them ``true things.''\n  In fact, if you look at that testimony--and I urge you to do so; it \nis another topic that will take up some time--the President \nacknowledged that he misled an aide and he apologized for it. And he \ntestified that actually he couldn't remember much of what he told his \naide. He never challenged or denied what John Podesta said that he told \nhim. He told the grand jury. He told them. And he never challenged \nSidney Blumenthal's version of what he said to Mr. Blumenthal. There is \nabsolutely no evidence to suggest that\n\n[[Page S823]]\n\nthe President intended to deceive the grand jury on this matter because \nhe never denied saying what they said he told them about his \nrelationship. And that is what he told them. It was not just true \nthings. He told them inaccurate things. He did not give the testimony \nthat Congressman Rogan claims that he gave. He did not say that he did \nnot mislead his aides. He said that he had, in fact, misled his aide. \nHe does say that he tried to tell true things, but he does not conceal \nthe nature of the true things he is talking about.\n  So you can make up your own mind whether you agree with his \ncharacterization that there are true things. He described them for all \nto see and understand. For example, he says that he told his aides, ``I \nnever had sex with her,'' as it was defined in his mind. You may \ndisagree with his characterization of what he told them as being a true \nthing, but he certainly doesn't conceal the basis of his belief that it \nis true. He also said that he was not involved with Ms. Lewinsky in any \nsexual way. And he explains by use of the present tense he thought that \nwas a true thing.\n  But the materiality of this alleged perjury is really a mystery. That \nthe President misled his aide is not an issue. That his aides became \nwitnesses before the grand jury and that the President knew they would \nprobably be called, it is simply not in dispute. Nor does the President \ndispute the testimony of Podesta and Blumenthal. The only issue here is \nwhether the President, when he discussed Monica Lewinsky with these \naides, was seeking to influence the grand jury's proceedings by giving \nhis aides false information. This is not a perjury challenge. This is a \nsubject to be dealt with in the context of article II and obstruction \nof justice.\n  What does it all add up to? Mr. Ruff had it right. Beneath the \nsurface of this article, this first article, there is really a witches' \nbrew of allegations pulled from all corners of Bill Clinton's grand \njury testimony. He has alleged to have lied to the grand jury when he \nused innocent words to tell about his improper contacts with Ms. \nLewinsky. Truly, these are frivolous allegations. He has alleged to \nhave lied about the date his improper activity with Ms. Lewinsky began, \nand whether it was preceded by any period of friendship. These, too, \nare frivolous allegations. The President didn't claim he said, but even \nif he did, the allegations are of no import. He has alleged to have \nlied when he explained his understanding of the Jones definition and \ntestified that his genuine belief was that the definition did not \ninclude the activity that he and Ms. Lewinsky had engaged in.\n\n  Experienced prosecutors say that his interpretation was reasonable. \nHe has alleged to have lied about the intimate details of his activity \nwith Ms. Lewinsky. She says one thing; he says another. This is \nprecisely the kind of oath against oath swearing match that is never \nprosecuted in the real world. Given the President's overall testimony \nbefore the grand jury, of what real significance is this disagreement? \nHe is accused of ratifying his every sentence in the Jones deposition. \nAnd by saying that his goal was to be truthful, he is said to have \nlied. But no one should be charged with perjury for asserting innocence \nor proclaiming that he was trying to be truthful, particularly when all \nthe evidence supports his claim.\n  And finally, he is accused of lying about a variety of actions aimed \nat concealing his improper and embarrassing relationship with Ms. \nLewinsky when each one of those actions was motivated by nothing more \nthan his desire to protect himself and his family from embarrassment, \nif not destruction.\n  Think just for a moment and ask yourself whether these allegations \nabout this testimony is really an effort to vindicate the rule of law, \nor is it something else? Ask yourself what coming generations will \nthink about these charges. If you convict and remove President Clinton \non the basis of these allegations, no President of the United States \nwill ever be safe from impeachment again--and it will happen--and \npeople will look back at us, and they will say we should have stopped \nit then before it was too late. Don't let this happen to our country.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to respond to one specific argument \nthat we heard last week. One of the arguments most frequently employed \nto urge the President's removal is that in the United States of America \nno one is above the law; that if the Senate does not take action \nagainst the President and convict him and remove him from office, we \nwill not be keeping faith with that principle.\n  Members of the Senate, I could not disagree more with that \nformulation of this issue. The principle that ``No one is above the \nlaw'' is sacred. The idea that the wealthy or the powerful or the \nfamous should receive preferential treatment under the law--treatment \nthat is different from that accorded to the poor and the weak--is \nanathema to everything that is great and good and special about the \nUnited States. It is anathema to our values and to our national ideals.\n  I agree with Mr. Hyde. Our fathers and grandfathers--going back to \nthe American Revolution--fought and died to defend the principle of \n``equal justice under law.'' This principle is not only at the core of \nAnglo-Saxon jurisprudence, it is part of the very foundation of our \ncivic society.\n  But the framers, in their genius, did not design or intend the \nawesome power of impeachment and removal for the purpose of vindicating \nthe rule of law. They believed that the power of impeachment and \nremoval should be used for a different purpose--to protect the body \npolitic, to protect the Government itself from a President whose \nconduct was so abusive as to constitute an assault on, a threat to the \nentire system.\n  We are all rereading the Constitution. We are all looking at the \nFederalist Papers again. And when we do that, we realize that the \nframers of the Constitution considered the question of what to do when \nthe highest officials of Government, the President or the Vice \nPresident, are charged with misconduct. And back then they made an \nimportant distinction that we should recognize and respect today \nbetween conduct in official capacity and conduct in private capacity. \nThey created two different ways of dealing with these two very \ndifferent kinds of conduct. Impeachment was to protect the country from \nabuse of official power by an out-of-control President or by someone \nwho was so abusive and assaultive on the system of Government that he \nhad to be removed to protect the Government.\n  The criminal justice system was to vindicate the rule of law, and the \nclearest indication that one is not meant to be a substitute for the \nother can be found in article I, section 3, clause 7 of the \nConstitution:\n\n       Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further \n     than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and \n     enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United \n     States: but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable \n     and subject to indictment, trial, judgment, and punishment, \n     according to Law.\n\n  If the President's conduct in his official capacity is so grave as to \nbe a serious assault upon the system of Government, so serious as to \nsubvert our constitutional order, so serious as to require the Nation \nto be protected from the damage that he would do if he were to continue \nin office, the remedy is impeachment and removal by a political \nprocess.\n  If, however, the President's conduct does not implicate the office or \nthe powers of the Presidency, the remedy is a legal process involving \nprosecution, conviction, and punishment in the courts. In this fashion \nthe principle is vindicated that ``no man is above the law,'' for in \nthe criminal justice system the President will be treated like any \nother citizen and accountable to the rule of law.\n  The great scholar and justice, James Wilson, said it best when he \nwrote:\n\n       Far from being above the laws, [the President] is amenable \n     to them in his private character as a citizen, and in his \n     public character by impeachment.\n\n  And more recently, just last November, Senator Specter made the same \npoint with equal eloquence when he proposed:\n\n       . . . abandoning Impeachment and, after the President \n     leaves office, holding him accountable in the same way any \n     other person would be; through indictment and prosecution for \n     any Federal crimes established by the evidence.\n\n  President Clinton should not be above the law, he is not above the \nlaw, and he will not be above the law. As Senator Specter rightly \nstated, the\n\n[[Page S824]]\n\ncriminal justice system stands ready to perform that function and to \nhold the President accountable at some later date. And like any other \ncitizen, William Jefferson Clinton can be prosecuted for any crimes he \nis alleged to have committed throughout his term of office.\n\n  It would be a profound mistake with lasting consequences for the \nMembers of this body, in the throes of a highly charged impeachment \ntrial, to conclude that only the Senate rather than the criminal \njustice system should be the chosen instrument of the Constitution to \nfulfill that principle. It is not up to the Senate to remove the \nPresident from office for private conduct that does not involve abuse \nof Presidential power and does not seriously disrupt the President's \ncapacity to function as Chief Executive of the United States. And it \nwould be folly to think that to vindicate the rule of law in the United \nStates the Senate is obliged to reverse a national election and remove \na President from office before the completion of his term. If there is \nsufficient evidence to warrant a criminal prosecution, this President, \nwhen he returns to private life, can be indicted, prosecuted, and tried \nand, if convicted, punished like any other citizen.\n  I end by making a point that should never be far from our thoughts as \nwe continue through this trial. There is no moment in our national \npublic life more sacred than the ritual of casting one's vote in a \nPresidential election. It is amazing, almost miraculous, that so \npowerful and transforming an event can occur so quietly in a great and \npopulous nation. The act is invisible to outside eyes. On one \ndesignated day, millions of Americans go to their local polling \nplaces--to schools, firehouses, police stations, and municipal \nbuildings throughout the Nation--to cast their vote for President. It \nis a moment of high purpose, the only political act that we perform \ntogether as a nation.\n  And so it is that we believe, short of a declaration of war, there is \nnothing more serious for our elected representatives to contemplate \nthan, through the process of impeachment, to undo the results of a \nnational election and to remove the man chosen by the American people \nto be their President.\n  Over the past week, we have heard many speeches about the \nConstitution and the rule of law and the many sacrifices that the \nAmerican people have made throughout their history to defend their \nrights and their freedoms. Surely, among the most important of those \nrights and freedoms is the right--freely, fairly, and openly--to cast \none's vote in a Presidential election and have the results of that \nelection respected and obeyed.\n  Can anyone imagine anything more damaging to the Constitution of the \nUnited States than for a Presidential election to be reversed for \nconduct that the vast majority of the American people does not believe \nwarrants the President's removal from office?\n  In the entire history of the United States, we have never been at \nthis juncture before. We have never come so close to the final act of \nremoving an elected President than we are at this moment in time.\n  William Jefferson Clinton was elected freely, fairly, and openly by \nthe American people to be President. We dare not reverse that decision \nwithout good and just cause. And we dare not take that step unless the \npeople who spoke agree that such drastic action is justified. The \ndamage to our political discourse for years, decades, would be terrible \nto contemplate.\n  In the course of this impeachment process, we have also devoted a \ngood deal of time and attention to a discussion of precedents that \ninvolve the impeachment and removal of Federal judges. For the \nPresident, we have argued that when it comes to applying constitutional \nstandards for impeachment, judges are different. We think that the \nConstitution implicitly recognizes that distinction.\n  I would like to change the focus for a moment and look at the way we \nthink the legislative branch of our Government also recognizes that \ndistinction. History shows, I think, that it has been easier for \nCongress to impeach and remove a Federal judge from office than to \ndischarge a Member of the House or Senate, and maybe that is as it \nshould be. When confronted with misconduct by one of its Members, \nCongress has rarely been willing to negate the popular will as \nexpressed in congressional elections. In truth, the Congress has, for \nthe most part, simply declined to take that step.\n  Perhaps rightly so, because of the greater deference paid to elected, \nas opposed to appointed, officials or judges. Perhaps because \nPresidents and Senators and Representatives are periodically elected to \ndefined terms, as opposed to life terms, the Congress has chosen to \nrely upon the public to work its will through the electoral system. \nThat deference is warranted, I submit, and it should be a factor in \nyour deliberations.\n  In 210 years of history and throughout 105 Congresses, only 4 Members \nof the House have ever been expelled by that body. As for the Senate, \n15 Senators--the first in 1797, the remaining 14 during the Civil War.\n  My point is a simple one. Because of the sanctity of elections and \nthe regularity of elections, and because of the heavy burden that must \nbe carried before reversing the will of the people, decisions to remove \nelected officeholders have been and should be, at least in some degree, \nbased on factors that are different than the ones used for judges \nappointed for life and who serve for good behavior. By its own conduct \nthroughout its own history, Congress seems to agree with this point.\n  I come from the State of Vermont, and if you have been to Vermont, \nyou know that wherever you go across that State, from the smallest \nsquares in the smallest towns to the larger parks, and what we like to \nthink of as our cities, you come across monuments celebrating the \nAmerican Union. One of the things that Vermont children learn first is \nthat we were and are the 14th State of the Union and that our forebears \nfought to create this Nation and to preserve it.\n  So we in our history have shown that there are two things that we \ncare about: We care about our American Union and we care about equal \nrights for all citizens under the law. And one of the rights that is \nmost precious to every American is the right to choose our leaders in \nfree elections. That right, the equal right to vote with confidence \nthat the outcome will be respected, is fundamental to our values, to \nour national unity and identity.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, you must do your duty as you see \nit, as you see the law and facts and the evidence. But, truly, these \narticles do not justify the nullification of the American people's free \nchoice in a national election. I appeal to you, do not turn your back \non those millions of Americans who cast their votes in the belief that \nthey, and they alone, decide who will lead this country as President. \nDo not throw our politics into the darkness of endless recrimination. \nDo not inject a poison of bitter partisanship into the body politic \nwhich, like a virus, can move through our national bloodstream for \nyears to come with results none can know or calculate.\n  Do not let this case and these charges, as flawed and as unfair as \nthey are, destroy a fundamental underpinning of American democracy, the \nright of the people, and no one else, to select the President of the \nUnited States.\n  William Jefferson Clinton is not guilty of obstruction of justice. He \nis not guilty of perjury. He must not be removed.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that we recess \nthe proceedings now. We will begin promptly at 5 minutes after 4.\n  There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:53 p.m., recessed until \n4:07 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I believe we are ready to \nresume with the presentation of Counsel Cheryl Mills.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Ms. Counsel Mills.\n  Ms. Counsel MILLS. Mr. Chief Justice, managers from the House of \nRepresentatives, Members of the Senate, good afternoon. My name is \nCheryl Mills, and I am deputy counsel to the President. I am honored to \nbe here today on behalf of the President to address you.\n\n[[Page S825]]\n\n  Today, incidentally, marks my 6-year anniversary in the White House. \nI am very proud to have had the opportunity to serve our country and \nthis President.\n  It is a particular honor for me to stand on the Senate floor today. I \nam an Army brat. My father served in the Army for 27 years. I grew up \nin the military world, where opportunity was a reality and not just a \nslogan. The very fact that the daughter of an Army officer from \nRichmond, VA, the very fact that I can represent the President of the \nUnited States on the floor of the Senate of the United States, is \npowerful proof that the American dream lives.\n  I am going to take some time to address two of the allegations of \nobstruction of justice against President Clinton in article II: First, \nthe allegation related to the box of gifts that Ms. Lewinsky asked Ms. \nCurrie to hold for her; second, the allegation related to the \nPresident's conversation with Ms. Currie after his deposition in the \nJones case. Tomorrow my colleague, Mr. Kendall, will address the \nremaining allegations of obstruction of justice.\n\n  Over the course of the House managers' presentation last week, I \nconfess I was struck by how often they referred to the significance of \nthe rule of law. House Manager Sensenbrenner, for example, quoted \nPresident Theodore Roosevelt stating, ``No man is above the law and no \nman is below it . . . .'' As a lawyer, as an American, and as an \nAfrican American, it is a principle in which I believe to the very core \nof my being. It is what many have struggled and died for, the right to \nbe equal before the law without regard to race or gender or ethnicity, \ndisability, privilege, or station in life. The rule of law applies to \nthe weak and the strong, the rich and the poor, the powerful and the \npowerless.\n  If you love the rule of law, you must love it in all of its \napplications. You cannot only love it when it provides the verdict you \nseek. You must love it when the verdict goes against you as well. We \ncannot uphold the rule of law only when it is consistent with our \nbeliefs. We must uphold it even when it protects behavior that we don't \nlike or is unattractive or is not admirable or that might even be \nhurtful. And we cannot say we love the rule of law but dismiss \narguments that appeal to the rule of law as legalisms or legal \nhairsplitting.\n  I say all of this because not only the facts but the law of \nobstruction of justice protects the President. It does not condemn him. \nAnd the managers cannot deny the President the protection that is \nprovided by the law and still insist that they are acting to uphold the \nlaw. His conduct, while clearly not attractive, or admirable, is not \ncriminal. That is the rule of law in this case.\n  So as my colleagues and I discuss obstruction of justice against the \nPresident, we ask only that the rule of law be applied equally, \nneutrally, fairly, not emotionally or personally or politically. If it \nis applied equally, the rule of law exonerates Bill Clinton.\n  That said, I want to begin where Manager Hutchinson left off this \nweekend during a television program. The evidence does not support \nconviction of the President on any of the allegations of obstruction of \njustice. On the record now before the Senate, and that which was before \nthe House, Manager Hutchinson said, ``I don't think you could obtain a \nconviction or that I could fairly ask for a conviction.'' We agree. We \nagree. There are good reasons for Manager Hutchinson's judgment. And \nthe most important, the evidence in the record and the law on the \nbooks, does not support the conclusion that the President obstructed \njustice.\n  Now, I know that Manager McCollum begged you in his presentation to \nnot pay attention to details when the President's case was put forward. \nHe went so far as to implore you not to get hung up on some of the \ndetails when the President and his attorneys try to explain this \nstuff--``The big picture is what you need to keep in mind, not the \ncompartmentalization.'' Manager McCollum was telling you, in effect, \nnot to pay attention to the evidence that exonerates the President--\n``Don't pay attention to the details that take this case out of the \nrealm of activities that are prohibited by the law.''\n  But the rule of law depends upon the details because it depends upon \nthe facts and it depends upon the fairness of the persons called to \njudge the facts. I want to walk through the big picture and I want to \nwalk through the facts.\n  I first want to discuss the real story, and then I want to focus on \nall those inconvenient details, or what Manager Buyer called those \nstubborn facts that didn't fit the big picture that the House managers \nwant you to see.\n  Manager Barr suggested the fit between the facts and the law against \nthe President in this case is as precise as the finely tuned mechanism \nof a Swiss watch. But when you put the facts together, they don't quite \nmake out a Swiss watch; in fact, they might not even make good sausage.\n  So what is the big picture? The big picture is this: The President \nhad a relationship with a young woman. His conduct was inappropriate. \nBut it was not obstruction of justice. During the course of their \nrelationship, the President and the young woman pledged not to talk \nabout it with others. That is not obstruction of justice. The President \nended their relationship before anyone knew about it. He ended it not \nbecause he thought it would place him in legal jeopardy; he ended it \nbecause he knew it was wrong. That is not obstruction of justice.\n  The President hoped that no one would find out about his \nindiscretion, about his lapse in judgment. That is not obstruction of \njustice, either. One day, however, long after he had ended the \nrelationship, he was asked about it in an unrelated lawsuit, a lawsuit \nwhose intent, at least as proclaimed by those who were pursuing it, was \nto politically damage him. That was their publicly announced goal. So \nhe knew, the President knew that his secret would soon be exposed. And \nhe was right.\n  It was revealed for public consumption, written large all over the \nworld against his best efforts to have ended the relationship and to \nhave put right what he had done wrong. That is the real big picture. \nThat is the truth. And that is not obstruction of justice.\n  So let's talk about the allegation of obstruction of justice, about \nthe box of gifts that Ms. Currie received from Ms. Lewinsky. I want to \nbegin by telling you another true story, the real story of the now \nfamous gifts.\n  It takes place on December 28, 1997. On that day the President gave \nMs. Lewinsky holiday gifts. During her visit with the President, Ms. \nLewinsky has said that she raised the subpoena that she had received \nfrom the Jones lawyers on the 19th and asked him, what should she do \nabout the gifts. The President has said he told her, whenever it was \nthat they discussed it, that she would have to give over whatever she \nhad. He was not concerned about the gifts because he gives so many \ngifts to so many people. Unbeknownst to the President, however, Ms. \nLewinsky had been worrying about what to do with the gifts ever since \nshe got the subpoena. She was concerned that the Jones lawyers might \neven search her apartment so she wanted to get the gifts out of her \nhome.\n  After Ms. Lewinsky's visit with the President, Ms. Currie walked her \nfrom the building. Then or later, either in person or on the phone, Ms. \nLewinsky told Ms. Currie that she had a box of gifts that the President \nhad given her that she wanted Ms. Currie to hold because people were \nasking questions. In the course of that conversation, they discussed \nother things as well. Ms. Currie agreed to hold the box of gifts. After \ntheir discussion, Ms. Lewinsky packed up some but not all of the gifts \nthat the President had given her over time. She kept out presents of \nparticular sentimental value as well as virtually all of the gifts he \nhad given her that very day on the 28th.\n  Ms. Currie went by Ms. Lewinsky's home after leaving work, picked up \nthe box that had a note on it that said, ``Do not throw away,'' and she \ntook it home. Ms. Currie did not raise Ms. Lewinsky's request with the \nPresident because she saw herself as doing a favor for a friend. Ms. \nCurrie had no idea the gifts were under subpoena.\n  So Ms. Lewinsky's request hardly struck her as criminal.\n  This story that I just told you is obviously very different from the \nstory presented by the House managers. How can I tell such a story that \nis so at odds with that which has been presented by the House managers? \nThe answer lies in the selective reading of the record\n\n[[Page S826]]\n\nby the House managers. But theirs is not the only version of the facts \nthat needs to be told. So what details did they downplay or discard or \ndisregard in their presentation to create allegations of obstruction of \njustice?\n  To be fair, the House managers acknowledged up front that their case \nis largely circumstantial. They are right. Let's walk through the House \nmanagers' presentation of the key events which they gave to you last \nweek. Let's look at exhibit 1 which is in the packet that has been \nhanded out to you.\n  First key fact: On December 19, Monica Lewinsky was served with a \nsubpoena in the Paula Jones case. The subpoena required that she \ntestify at that deposition in January 1998 and also to produce each and \nevery gift given to her by President Clinton.\n  Second event: On December 28, Ms. Lewinsky and the President met in \nthe Oval Office to exchange Christmas gifts, at which time they \ndiscussed the fact that the lawyers in the Jones case had subpoenaed \nall of the President's gifts.\n  Third key fact: During the conversation on the 28th, Ms. Lewinsky \nasked the question whether she should put away outside her home or give \nto someone--maybe Betty--the gifts. At that time, according to Ms. \nLewinsky, the President responded, ``Let me think about it.''\n  Fourth fact they presented to you. That answer led to action. Later \nthat day, Ms. Lewinsky got a call at 3:32 p.m. from Ms. Currie who \nsaid, ``I understand you have something to give me or that the \nPresident has said you have something for me.'' It was the President \nwho initiated the retrieval of the gifts and the concealment of the \nevidence.\n  Fifth event they presented: Without asking any questions, Ms. Currie \npicked up the box of gifts from Ms. Lewinsky, drove to her home, and \nplaced the box under her bed.\n  That is what the House managers told you last week. Now, let's go \nthrough their story piece by piece. On December 19, Monica Lewinsky was \nserved with a subpoena in the Jones case. The subpoena required her to \ntestify at a deposition in January 1998, and also to produce each and \nevery gift given to her by the President. This statement is factually \naccurate. It does not, however, convey the entire state of affairs. Ms. \nLewinsky told the FBI that when she got the subpoena she wanted the \ngifts out of her apartment. Why? Because she suspected that lawyers for \nJones would break into her apartment looking for gifts. She was also \nconcerned that the Jones people might tap her phone. Therefore, she \nwanted to put the gifts out of reach of the Jones lawyers, out of harms \nway. The managers entirely disregarded Ms. Lewinsky's own independent \nmotivations for wanting to move the gifts.\n  Let's continue. On December 28, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky and the President \nmet in the Oval Office to exchange Christmas gifts, at which time they \ndiscussed the fact that the lawyers in the Jones case had subpoenaed \nall of the gifts from the President to Ms. Lewinsky. During \nconversation on December 28, Ms. Lewinsky asked the President whether \nshe should put away the gifts out of her house some place, or give them \nto someone, maybe Betty. At that time, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the \nPresident said, ``Let me think about it.''\n\n  The House managers have consistently described the December 28 \nmeeting exactly this way, as did the majority counsel for the House \nJudiciary, as did the Office of Independent Counsel. It has been said \nso often that it has become conventional wisdom. But it is not the \nwhole truth. It is not the full record. Ms. Lewinsky actually gave 10 \nrenditions of her conversation with the President. All of them have \nbeen outlined in our chart. Invariably, the one most cited is the one \nleast favorable to the President. But even in that version, the one \nthat is least favorable to the President, no one claims he ordered, \nsuggested, or even hinted that anyone obstruct justice. At most, the \nPresident says, ``Let me think about it.'' That is not obstruction of \njustice.\n  But what about the nine other versions? Some of the other versions \nwhich I have never heard offered by the House managers, versions that \nmaybe you, too, have never heard, are the ones that put the lie to the \nobstruction of justice elevation.\n  Let's look at exhibit 2 which is in your material. You may have never \nheard, for example, this version of their conversation. This is Ms. \nLewinsky speaking.\n\n       It was December 28th and I was there to get my Christmas \n     gifts from him . . . and we spent maybe about 5 minutes or \n     so, not very long, talking about the case. And I said to him, \n     ``Well, do you think'' . . . and I don't think I said get rid \n     of, but I said, ``Do you think I should put away or maybe \n     give to Betty or give someone the gifts?'' And he--I don't \n     remember his response. It was something like, ``I don't \n     know,'' or ``hmm'' or there was really no response.\n\n  You also may not have heard this version. This is a juror speaking, a \ngrand juror speaking to Ms. Lewinsky.\n\n       The Juror: Now, did you bring up Betty's name or did the \n     President bring up Betty's name?\n\n  And this is at the meeting on the 28th.\n\n       Ms. Lewinsky: I think I brought it up. The President \n     wouldn't have brought up Betty's name because he really \n     didn't--he really didn't discuss it . . . .\n\n  And you probably have not heard this version.\n\n       Lewinsky advised that Clinton was sitting in a rocking \n     chair in the study. Lewinsky asked Clinton what she should do \n     with the gifts Clinton had given her and he either did not \n     respond or responded ``I don't know''. Lewinsky is not sure \n     exactly what was said, but she is certain that whatever \n     Clinton said, she had no clear image in her mind of what to \n     do next.\n\n  Why haven't we heard these versions? Because they weaken an already \nfragile circumstantial case. If Ms. Lewinsky says that the President \ndoesn't respond at all, then there is absolutely no evidence for the \nHouse managers' obstruction of justice theory, even under their version \nof events. So these versions get disregarded to ensure that the House \nmanagers' big picture doesn't get cluttered by all those details. It is \nthose facts, those stubborn facts, that just don't fit.\n  But the most significant detail the managers disregard because it \ndoesn't fit is the President's testimony. The President testified that \nhe told Ms. Lewinsky that she had to give the Jones lawyers whatever \ngifts she had. Why? As the House managers predicted we would ask, \nbecause it is a question that begs to be asked, why would the President \ngive Ms. Lewinsky gifts if he wanted her to give them right back? The \nonly real explanation is he truly was, as he testified, unconcerned \nabout the gifts. The House managers want you to believe that this gift \ngiving was a show of confidence; that he knew Ms. Lewinsky would \nconceal them. But then why, under their theory, ask Ms. Currie to go \npick them up? Why not know that Ms. Lewinsky is just going to conceal \nthem? Better still, why not just show her the gifts and tell her to \ncome by after the subpoena date has passed?\n  It simply doesn't make sense. The President's actions entirely \nundermine the House managers' theory of obstruction of justice.\n  But let's continue with their version of events. That answer, the \n``Let-me-think-about-it'' answer, that answer led to action. Later that \nday, Ms. Lewinsky got a call at 3:32 p.m. from Ms. Currie who said, ``I \nunderstand you have something to give me or the President said you have \nsomething to give me.'' It was the President who initiated the \nretrieval of the gifts and the concealment of the evidence.\n  Here is where the House managers have dramatically shortchanged the \ntruth because the whole truth demands that Ms. Currie's testimony be \npresented fairly.\n  In telling their story, the managers do concede that there is a \nconflict in the testimony between Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Currie, but they \nstrive mightily to get you to disregard Ms. Currie's testimony by \ntelling you that her memory on the issue of how she came to pick up the \ngifts was ``fuzzy''--fuzzy. In particular, Manager Hutchinson told you:\n\n       I will concede there is a conflict in the testimony on this \n     point with Ms. Currie. Ms. Currie, in her grand jury \n     testimony, had a fuzzy memory, a little different \n     recollection. She testified that, the best she can remember, \n     Ms. Lewinsky called her, but when she was asked further, she \n     said that maybe Ms. Lewinsky's memory is better than hers on \n     that issue. That is what the House managers want to you \n     believe about Ms. Currie. That is not playing fair by Ms. \n     Currie. It is not playing fair by the facts. Why? Because Ms. \n     Currie was asked about who initiated the gift pick-up five \n     times. Her answer each time\n\n[[Page S827]]\n\n     was unequivocal--5 times. From the first FBI interview just \n     days after the story broke in the media, to her last grand \n     jury appearance, Ms. Currie repeatedly and unwaveringly \n     testified that it was Ms. Lewinsky who contacted her about \n     the gifts.\n\n  Her memory on this issue is clear. What does she say? Let's look at \nexhibit 3, the first time she is asked:\n\n       Lewinsky called Currie and advised she had returned all \n     gifts Clinton had given to Lewinsky, as there was talk going \n     around about the gifts.\n\n  The second time:\n\n       Monica said she was getting concerned and she wanted to \n     give me the stuff the President had given her, or give me a \n     box of stuff. It was a box stuff.\n\n  Third time, and this was a prosecutor asking Ms. Currie the question:\n\n       Just tell us for a moment how this issue first arose, and \n     what you did about it, and what Ms. Lewinsky told you.\n       Ms. Currie: The best I remember, it first arose with \n     conversation. I don't know if it was over the phone or in \n     person; I don't know. She asked me if I would pick up a box. \n     She said Isikoff had been inquiring about the gifts.\n\n  The fourth time:\n\n       The best I remember, she said she wanted me to hold these \n     gifts--hold this--I'm sure she said gifts, a box of gifts--I \n     don't remember--because people were asking questions, and I \n     said fine.\n\n  The fifth time:\n\n       The best I remember is, Monica called me and asked me if \n     she can give me some gifts, if I would pick up some gifts for \n     her.\n\n  The last time, the fifth time, when a grand juror completely \nmisstated Ms. Currie's testimony regarding how the gift exchange was \ninitiated by suggesting that the President had directed her to pick up \nthe gifts, Ms. Currie was quick to correct the juror:\n\n       Question. Ms. Currie, I want to come back for a second to \n     the box of gifts and how they came to be in your possession. \n     As I recall your earlier testimony the other day, you \n     testified that the President asked you to telephone Ms. \n     Lewinsky, is that correct?\n       Answer. Pardon? The President asked me to telephone Ms. \n     Lewinsky?\n       Juror. Is that correct?\n       Ms. Currie. About?\n       Juror. About the box of gifts. I am trying to recall and \n     understand exactly how the box of gifts came to be in your \n     possession.\n       Ms. Currie. I don't recall the President asking me to call \n     about a box of gifts.\n       Juror. How did you come to be in possession of the box of \n     gifts?\n       Ms. Currie. The best I remember, Ms. Lewinsky called me and \n     asked me if she can give me the gifts--if I would pick up \n     some gifts for her.\n\n  The record reflects that Ms. Currie's testimony on this issue was \nclear--five times--every time she was asked.\n  What, then, are the managers talking about when they say that Ms. \nCurrie concedes that Ms. Lewinsky might have a better memory than \nherself on this issue? They are talking about something a little \ndifferent; that was whether she, Ms. Currie, had told the President \nthat she had picked up the box of gifts from Ms. Lewinsky. Let's put it \nin context. After being asked the same question for the fourth time and \nreiterating for the fourth time that Ms. Lewinsky contacted her about \nthe gifts, the prosecutor asked Ms. Currie:\n\n       Well, what if Ms. Lewinsky said that Ms. Currie spoke to \n     the President about receiving the gifts from Ms. Lewinsky?\n\n  Ms. Currie responds:\n\n       Then she may remember better than I. I don't remember.\n\n  Not once did Ms. Currie equivocate on the central fact Ms. Lewinsky \nasked her to retrieve the gifts. The President testified, consistent \nwith Ms. Currie's testimony, that he never asked Ms. Currie to retrieve \nthe gifts from Ms. Lewinsky. So why is Ms. Currie's testimony distorted \nand discounted by the House managers?\n\n  They are asking you to make one of the most awesome decisions the \nConstitution contemplates. They owe you, they owe the President, they \nowe the Constitution, and they owe Betty Currie an accurate \npresentation of the facts.\n  But what about that supposedly corroborating cell phone call from \nBetty Currie to Monica Lewinsky on December 28? The managers \nhighlighted this call, which they claim is the call in which Ms. Currie \ntold Ms. Lewinsky that she understood she had something for her, the \ngifts. This, they say, is the linchpin that closes the deal on their \nversion of the facts.\n  What the managers downplay, as Mr. Ruff discussed yesterday, is the \nfact that this call to arrange the pickup of the gifts comes after the \ntime Ms. Lewinsky repeatedly testified that the gifts were picked up by \nMs. Currie. In citing the cell phone record as corroboration, they also \ndisregard Ms. Currie's testimony that she picked up the gifts leaving \nfrom work on her way home; that would have been from Washington to \nArlington. That is inconsistent with the call from Arlington.\n  Most significantly, the managers purposely avoided telling you about \nthe length of the call. As Mr. Ruff pointed out yesterday, the call is \nfor 1 minute, or less. According to Ms. Lewinsky's own testimony, when \nshe spoke to Ms. Currie to arrange the gift pickup, they talked about \nother matters, as well as the box. They had a conversation. That is a \nlot of talk: I have a box. When can you come pick it up? Where do you \nwant me to meet you? And other chitchat. That is a lot of talk for a \ncall that lasts 1 minute, or less. It is all but inconceivable that all \nthis took place in the call. Since Ms. Currie placed a call to Ms. \nLewinsky, though, the House managers want you to believe that.\n  What next? The House managers told you, without asking any questions, \nMs. Currie picked up the box of gifts from Ms. Lewinsky, drove to her \nhome, which, incidentally, is inconsistent with their theory because \nshe is going in the wrong direction. She is supposed to be going to the \nhospital--if she picked up the gifts, on their theory--and she placed \nthe box under her bed. Then they posit this question: Why would Ms. \nCurrie pick up the gifts from Ms. Lewinsky? Why on earth would she do \nsuch a thing? Their answer: She must have been ordered to pick up the \ngifts by the President. They conclude, without any testimonial report, \nthat there would be no reason for Betty Currie, out of the blue, to \nretrieve the gifts, unless instructed to do so by the President. Why \nelse would she do it?\n  Well, the record before you offers the answer. As Ms. Currie told the \nFBI during her first interview in January of 1998, Ms. Lewinsky was a \nfriend. She had been helpful and supportive when she was dealing with \nsome very painful personal tragedies. Ms. Currie enjoyed what she saw \nas a motherly relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. They would often talk \nabout each other's families, about their own activities, and other \nchitchat. Why does she agree to hold the box of gifts for Ms. Lewinsky? \nBecause she is a friend. And that is not obstruction of justice.\n  Now, think about the story as I told it to you, and about the \ndifferent story the managers presented. Ms. Lewinsky was concerned \nabout the gifts after receiving a subpoena from the Jones lawyers. She \nwas worried they might search her apartment and she wanted to get the \ngifts out of her home. She met with the President, and what does he do? \nHe gives her more gifts--more gifts.\n  When she asked what to do about the gifts, at most she says, ``Let me \nthink about it.'' Those are the words that Lewinsky has acknowledged on \nseveral occasions, that he may have said nothing.\n  Ms. Lewinsky is still concerned about the gifts. She decides to put \nthem away, keeping the gifts that have sentimental value, and giving to \nher lawyer the gifts she thinks the Jones lawyers are looking for, and \ngiving to Ms. Currie those items that she really would like back but \nthat she can live without. She tells Ms. Currie that she has some gifts \nfrom the President that she wants her to hold because there is talk \ngoing around about the gifts. Ms. Currie picks them up after work on \nher way home.\n  This story is consistent with the President's lack of concern about \nthe gifts. The managers have tried to deflect the inexplicable \ncontradiction created by their own theory. They want you to believe the \nPresident would really give Ms. Lewinsky gifts only to take them back \non the very same day. Of course he wouldn't. No one would.\n  The only explanation they can conjure is torture: The President gave \nher gifts which he intended to take back that same afternoon to show \nhis confidence that she would conceal the relationship. The facts \nclearly do not support their version of events. To believe the \nmanagers' version of events, you must not only disbelieve the \nPresident, you must also disbelieve Ms. Currie.\n  Ms. Currie has said that the President did not ask her to pick up the\n\n[[Page S828]]\n\ngifts. Ms. Currie has said that Ms. Lewinsky asked her to pick up the \ngifts. The managers have downplayed Ms. Currie's credibility in this \nincident. They have urged you to think of her as acting as ``a loyal \nsecretary to the President.''\n  Of course she is loyal. But it is, may I say, an insult to Betty \nCurrie and to millions of other loyal Americans to suggest that loyalty \nbreeds despondency. If Ms. Currie was despondent, why would she have \ntold the counsel about the conversation between the President and her \nthat the managers have recounted as being so damaging? Why would she \nhave said anything at all about that conversation? Why? Because she is \nhonest. And loyalty and honesty are not mutually exclusive. Betty \nCurrie is a loyal person, and Betty Currie is an honest person.\n  These are the facts. That is not obstruction of justice.\n  I believe I can best sum up by using the words of Manager Buyer who \nquoted President John Adams. ``Facts are stubborn things. Whatever may \nbe our issues, or inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they \ncannot alter the state of the facts and the evidence.''\n  Those stubborn facts. Manager Buyer went on to say, ``I believe John \nAdams was right.'' Facts and evidence. Facts are stubborn things. You \ncan color the facts, like calling Ms. Currie's memory fuzzy. You can \nshade the facts by not telling you the length of that supposed \ncorroborating phone call. You can misrepresent the facts by giving only \n1 of 10 versions of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony about the President's \nresponse to her question about the gifts. You can hide the facts, like \nnot telling you of Ms. Lewinsky's personal motivation for wanting the \ngifts. But the truthful facts are stubborn; they won't go away. Like \nthe telltale heart, they keep pounding. And they keep coming. They \nwon't go away. Those stubborn, stubborn facts. They show that this was \nnot obstruction of justice.\n  I now will talk about the President's conversation with Ms. Currie on \nJanuary 18. It is not difficult to understand these events if you have \nlived a life in which you are the subject of extraordinary media \nattention and extraordinary media scrutiny. Most American lives are not \nlike that. Our jobs and our personal lives are not usually the subject \nfor daily media consumption. As Senators, you obviously know well what \nthat life is like.\n  On January 18, the President talked to Ms. Currie about the Jones \ndeposition and in particular about his surprise at some of the \nquestions the Jones lawyers had asked about Ms. Lewinsky. In the course \nof their conversation, the President asked Ms. Currie a series of \nquestions and made some statements about his relationship with Ms. \nLewinsky, all of which seemed to seek her concurrence, or reaction, or \nher input.\n  The managers' theory is that the President, by his comments, \ncorruptly tried to influence Ms. Currie's potential testimony in the \nJones case in violation of the obstruction of justice law. They \nacknowledge that the President knew nothing about the independent \ncounsel's investigation. So they have focused on the Jones case as the \nplace to lodge their obstruction of justice allegation. Ms. Currie was \nnot scheduled to be a witness in that case. And, as you will see, the \nPresident had other things on his mind.\n  Before I go into the facts surrounding these conversations, I want to \nfirst focus briefly on the law, as the managers did in their \npresentation. There are two relevant obstruction of justice statutes: \n18 U.S.C., 1503, which is the general obstruction of justice statute; \nand 18 U.S.C. 1512, the more specific statute which prohibits witness \ntampering.\n  There are differences between these two statutes, but for our purpose \ntheir essential elements are similar. Both require the Government to \nprove that the person being accused, one, acted knowingly; two, with \nspecific intent; three, to corruptly affect and influence, in 1503, and \ncorruptly persuade, in 1512, either the due administration of justice, \nunder 1503, or the testimony of a person in an official proceeding, \nunder 1512, to try to persuade the testimony of a person in an official \nproceeding. For conviction, each and every element must be proven \nbeyond a reasonable doubt. If the prosecution fails to prove even one \nelement, the jury is obliged to acquit. In this case, none of the \nelements is present.\n\n  First, a little more about the law. You have to do more than make \nfalse statements to someone who might or might not testify in a \njudicial proceeding to obstruct justice. In United States v. Aguilar, \nan opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist and quoted by the House managers, \nthe Supreme Court addressed the Government's requirement and showed \nthat the defendant knew his actions were likely to affect a judicial \nproceeding. There, the U.S. district court judge was accused and \nconvicted of lying to an FBI agent about a conversation with another \njudge and about what he said about his knowledge of some wiretapping. \nThe Supreme Court reversed the conviction under 1502, the general \nobstruction of justice statute, holding that the facts were \ninsufficient to make the case. They said in this material:\n\n       We do not believe that uttering false statements to an \n     investigative agent--and that seems to be all that was proved \n     here--who might or might not testify before a grand jury is \n     sufficient to make out a violation of the catch-all provision \n     of 1503.  . . . But what use will be made of false testimony \n     given to an investigative agent who has not been subpoenaed \n     or otherwise directed to appear before the grand jury is far \n     more speculative. We think it cannot be said to have the \n     ``natural and probable effect'' of interfering with the due \n     administration of justice.\n\n  In responding to the defendant's criticism of the Court's holding, \nMr. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote, under the defense theory:\n\n       A man could be found guilty of violating 1503 if he knew of \n     a pending investigation and lied to his wife about his \n     whereabouts at the time of the crime, thinking that an FBI \n     agent might interview her and that she might in turn be \n     influencing her statements to that agent about her husband's \n     false accounts of where he was.\n\n  The intent to obstruct justice is indeed present, but the man's \nculpability is a good deal less clear from the statute than we would \nusually require in order to impose criminal liability.\n  So I want to begin by focusing on the ``corruptly persuade'' elements \nof witness tampering. What does it mean to corruptly persuade? The term \nis vague, and the legislative history on the specific point is not very \nclear. We do know it means more than harassing, which is described as \nbadgering or pestering conduct, since 1512 makes intentional harassment \na misdemeanor a lesser offense of ``corruptly persuade,'' which is a \nfelony. The U.S. Attorneys' Manual gives some guidance. A prosecution \nunder 1512 would require the Government to prove beyond a reasonable \ndoubt, one, an effort to threaten, force or intimidate another person \nand; two, an intent to influence the person's testimony. Thus, \n``corruptly persuade'' for career prosecutors requires some element of \nthreat or intimidation or pressure.\n  Keeping that overview in mind, let's look at the facts. On January \n17, 1998, the President called Ms. Currie after his deposition and \nasked her to meet with him the following day. On January 18, the \nPresident and Ms. Currie met, and the President told her about some of \nthose surprising questions he had been asked in his deposition about \nMs. Lewinsky. In the course of their conversation, according to Ms. \nCurrie, the President posed a series of questions and made statements \nincluding: You were always there when she was there, right? We were \nnever really alone. You could see and hear everything. Monica came on \nto me, and I never touched her, right? And she wanted to have sex with \nme, and I can't do that.\n  Our analysis of this issue could stop here. There is no case for \nobstruction of justice. Why? There is no evidence whatsoever of any \nkind of threat or intimidation. And as we discussed, the U.S. \nAttorneys' Manual indicates that without a threat or intimidation, \nthere is no corrupt influence. Without corrupt influence, there is no \nobstruction of justice. But the evidence reveals much more. Not only \ndoes the record lack any evidence of threat or intimidation, the record \nspecifically contains Ms. Currie's undisputed testimony which \nexonerates the President of this charge. This is Ms. Currie's testimony \nand is the fourth exhibit in the materials.\n  Question to Ms. Currie:\n\n       Now, back again to the four statements that you testified \n     the President made to you\n\n[[Page S829]]\n\n     that were presented as statements, did you feel you were \n     pressured when he told you those statements?\n       None whatsoever.\n       Question: What did you think, or what was going through \n     your mind about what he was doing?\n\n  Ms. Currie:\n\n       At the time I felt that he was--I want to use the word \n     shocked or surprised that this was an issue, and he was just \n     talking.\n       Question: That was your impression, that he wanted you to \n     say--because he would end each of the statements with \n     ``Right?,'' with a question.\n\n  Ms. Currie:\n\n       I do not remember that he wanted me to say ``Right.'' He \n     would say, ``Right?'' and I could have said, ``Wrong.''\n       Question: But he would end each of these questions with a \n     ``Right?'' and you could either say whether it was true or \n     not true.\n       Correct.\n       Did you feel any pressure to agree with your boss?\n       None.\n\n  The evidence on this issue is clear. There was no effort to \nintimidate or pressure Ms. Currie, and she testified that she did not \nfeel pressured. Betty Currie's testimony unequivocally establishes that \nthe managers' case lacks any element of threat or intimidation. There \nis no evidence, direct or circumstantial, that refutes this testimony. \nThis is not obstruction of justice.\n  But let's not stop there. Let's look at the intent element of the \nobstruction of justice laws--in other words, whether the President had \nthe intent to influence Ms. Currie's supposed testimony, or potential \ntestimony.\n  In an attempt to satisfy this element of the law, the managers \noverreached in their presentation to create the appearance that the \nPresident had the necessary specific intent. They argue that, based \nupon the way he answered the questions in the Jones deposition, he \npurposely referred to Ms. Currie in the hopes that the Jones lawyers \nwould call her as a corroborating witness. Therefore, according to \ntheir theory, he had the specific intent.\n  The facts belie their overreaching. The House managers suggested to \nyou that the President increased the likelihood that Ms. Currie would \nbe called as a witness by challenging the plaintiff's attorney to \nquestion Ms. Currie. A review of the transcript, however, shows that \nthe President's few references to Ms. Currie were neither forced nor \nneedlessly interposed. They were natural, appropriate; they were \nresponsive. Indeed, the only occasion when he suggested the Jones \nlawyers speak to Ms. Currie is when they asked if it was typical for \nMs. Currie to be in the White House after midnight. He understandably \nsaid, ``You have to ask her.'' Hardly a challenge. It is a reasonable \nresponse to an inquiry about someone else's activities.\n  The managers' conjecture about the President's state of mind, \nhowever, fails on an even more basic level. If you believe the \nmanagers' theory, if you believe that the President went to great \nlengths to hide his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, then why on Earth \nwould he want Ms. Currie to be a witness in the Jones case? If there \nwas one person who knew the extent of his contact with Ms. Lewinsky, it \nwas Ms. Currie. While she did not know the nature of his relationship \nwith Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie did know and would have testified to Ms. \nLewinsky's visits in 1997, the notes and messages that Ms. Lewinsky \nsent the President, the gifts that Ms. Lewinsky sent the President, and \nthe President's support of the efforts to get Ms. Lewinsky a job. With \njust that information, it would have only been a matter of time before \nthe Jones lawyers discovered the relationship--not that they needed Ms. \nCurrie's testimony; they didn't need it for any of this. Ms. Tripp was \nalready on the December 5, 1997, witness list, and she was already \nscheduled for a deposition.\n  So why would the President want her to testify? The answer is simple. \nHe didn't. The President was not thinking about Ms. Currie becoming a \nwitness in the Jones case. Indeed, she is the last person the President \nwould have wanted the Jones lawyers to question. And even if the Jones \nlawyers had wanted to question Ms. Currie, it is highly unlikely they \nwould have been allowed to do so, given the posture of the case at that \ntime.\n  Judge Wright ordered the parties in August of 1997 to exchange names \nand addresses of all witnesses no later than December 5, 1997. Ms. \nCurrie was not on their final witness list. Moreover, the cutoff date \nfor all discovery was January 30. By the time the President's \ndeposition was over, it was really too late to call Ms. Currie as a \nwitness.\n  Finally, you need to remember that in the context of the Jones case \nMs. Currie was, at best, a peripheral witness on a collateral matter \nthat the court ultimately determined was not essential to the core \nissues in the case. She had only knowledge of a small aspect of a much \nlarger case--all the more reason not to view her as a potential \nwitness.\n  The President was not thinking about Ms. Currie becoming a witness in \nthe Jones case. So what was the President thinking? The President \nexplained to the grand jury why he spoke to Ms. Currie after the \ndeposition. It had nothing to do with Ms. Currie being a potential \nwitness. That was not his concern. The President was concerned that his \nsecret was going to be exposed and the media would relentlessly inquire \nuntil the entire story and every shameful detail was public. The \nPresident's concern was heightened by an Internet report that morning \nthat he spoke to Betty which alluded to Ms. Lewinsky and to Ms. Currie \nand to issues that the Jones lawyers had raised. The President was \nunderstandably concerned about media inquiries, a concern everyone who \nlives and serves in the public eye likely can understand.\n  In trying to prepare for what he saw as the inevitable media \nattention, he talked to Ms. Currie to see what her perceptions were and \nwhat she recalled. He talked to her to see what she knew.\n  Remember, some of the questions that the Jones lawyer asked the \nPresident were so off base. For example, they asked him about visits \nfrom Ms. Lewinsky between midnight and 6 a.m. where Ms. Currie \nsupposedly cleared her in. The President wanted to know whether or not \nMs. Currie agreed with this perception or whether she had a different \nview, whether she agreed that Ms. Lewinsky was cleared in when he was \npresent or had there been other occasions that he didn't know about. He \nalso wanted to assess Ms. Currie's perception of the relationship. He \nknew the first person who would be questioned about media accounts, \nparticularly given that she was in the Internet report, was going to be \nMs. Currie.\n  The House managers did the President a disservice in suggesting in \nthe end that his five pages of testimony about why he spoke to Ms. \nCurrie ultimately amounts to a four-word sound bite to refresh his \nrecollection. He obviously said a lot more.\n  Why did they say that? Because they needed to establish intent, and \nthe testimony and the facts do not show intent. That is the truth. That \nis all of the facts.\n  The President's intent was never to obstruct justice in the Jones \ncase. It was to manage a looming media firestorm, which he correctly \nforesaw. As the President told the grand jury, ``I was trying to get \nthe facts and trying to think of the best defense we could construct in \nthe face of what I thought was going to be a media onslaught.''\n  He was thinking about the media. That is the big picture. That is not \nobstruction of justice.\n  In the end, of course, you must make your own judgments about whether \nthe managers have made a case for convicting the President of \nobstructing justice on either of these allegations. We believe they \nhave not, because the facts, those stubborn facts, don't support the \nallegations. Neither does the rule of law. We are not alone in that \nconclusion.\n  We want to share with you some of the remarks from a bipartisan panel \nof prosecutors who spoke to the House Judiciary panel, some of which \nyou saw earlier with Mr. Craig. I have taken a very brief clip of their \ntestimony that dealt with allegations of obstruction of justice against \nthe President for, as you will see, then Representative and now Senator \nSchumer focused in on one of the two allegations that I address today.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n       Mr. Sullivan. Mrs. Currie testified that she did not feel \n     that the president came and asked her some questions in a \n     leading fashion--``Was this right? Is this right? Is this \n     right?''--after his deposition was taken in the Jones case. \n     And she testified that she did not feel pressured to agree \n     with him and that she believed his statements were correct--\n     --\n\n[[Page S830]]\n\n       Rep. Schumer. Correct, right.\n       Mr. Sullivan [continuing]. And agreed with him. He--the \n     quote is, ``He would say, `Right,' and I could have said, \n     `Wrong,' '' Now that is not a case for obstruction of \n     justice. It is very common for lawyers, before the witness \n     gets on the stand, to say, ``Now you're going to say this, \n     you're going to say this, you're going to say this.''\n       Rep. Schumer. Right.\n       Mr. Sullivan. Now it doesn't make a difference if you've \n     got two participants to an event and you try to nail it down, \n     so to say.\n       Rep. Schumer. Do all of you agree with that, with the \n     Currie--the Currie----\n       Mr. Weld. Yeah.\n       Rep. Schumer. And on the other two, the Lewinsky parts of \n     this, is there----\n       Mr. Davis. I think to some----\n       Rep. Schumer. I mean, I don't even understand how they \n     could--how Starr could think that he would have a case, not \n     with the president of the United States, but with anybody \n     here, when it seems so natural and so obvious that there \n     would be an overriding desire not to have this public and to \n     have everybody--have the two of them coordinate their \n     stories--that is, the president and Miss Lewinsky--if there \n     were not the faintest scintilla of any legal proceeding \n     coming about. It just strikes me as an overwhelming stretch. \n     Am I wrong to characterize it that way? You gentlemen all \n     have greater experience than I do.\n       Mr. Davis. I think you're right. And also, the problem a \n     prosecutor would face would be that in these cases, there is \n     relationship between these people unrelated to the existence \n     of the Paula Jones case--the relationship. And that's the \n     motivation----\n       Rep. Schumer. Correct.\n       And Mr. Weld, do you disagree with--do you agree with that?\n       Rep. Sensenbrenner. The gentleman's time--the gentleman's \n     time----\n       Rep. Schumer. Could I just ask Mr. Weld for a yes or no----\n       Rep. Sensenbrenner. I'm sorry, Mr. Schumer. Mr. Schumer----\n       Rep. Schumer [continuing]. For a yes or no answer to that?\n       Can you answer that yes or no, Governor?\n       Mr. Weld. I think it's a little thin, Mr. Congressman.\n       Rep. Schumer. Thank you.\n       Mr. Noble. Again, it's a specific-intent crime, and the \n     question is, what was the President thinking when he said \n     this? We can look at his words and try and analyze his words. \n     But Ms. Currie says that she didn't believe he was trying to \n     influence her and that if she'd said something different from \n     him, if she believed something different from him, she would \n     have felt free to say it. So for that reason, I believe, you \n     just don't have the specific intent necessary to prove \n     obstruction of justice with regard to the comment that you \n     just asked me.\n  Manager Hutchinson is keeping very good company. He, like the other \nprosecutors, does not believe the record before you establishes \nobstruction of justice. We agree.\n  Before I close, I do want to take a moment to address a theme that \nthe House managers sounded throughout their presentation last week--\ncivil rights. They suggested that by not removing the President from \noffice, the entire house of civil rights might well fall. While \nacknowledging that the President is a good advocate for civil rights, \nthey suggested that they had grave concerns because of the President's \nconduct in the Paula Jones case.\n  Some managers suggested that we all should be concerned should the \nSenate fail to convict the President, because it would send a message \nthat our civil rights laws and our sexual harassment laws are \nunimportant.\n  I can't let their comments go unchallenged. I speak as but one woman, \nbut I know I speak for others as well. I know I speak for the \nPresident.\n  Bill Clinton's grandfather owned a store. His store catered primarily \nto African Americans. Apparently, his grandfather was one of only four \nwhite people in town who would do business with African Americans. He \ntaught his grandson that the African Americans who came into his store \nwere good people and they worked hard and they deserved a better deal \nin life.\n  The President has taken his grandfather's teachings to heart, and he \nhas worked every day to give all of us a better deal, an equal deal.\n  I am not worried about the future of civil rights. I am not worried \nbecause Ms. Jones had her day in court and Judge Wright determined that \nall of the matters we are discussing here today were not material to \nher case and ultimately decided that Ms. Jones, based on the facts and \nthe law in that case, did not have a case against the President.\n  I am not worried, because we have had imperfect leaders in the past \nand will have imperfect leaders in the future, but their imperfections \ndid not roll back, nor did they stop, the march for civil rights and \nequal opportunity for all of our citizens.\n  Thomas Jefferson, Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, John F. \nKennedy, Martin Luther King, Jr.--we revere these men. We should. But \nthey were not perfect men. They made human errors, but they struggled \nto do humanity good. I am not worried about civil rights because this \nPresident's record on civil rights, on women's rights, on all of our \nrights is unimpeachable.\n\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, you have an enormous decision to \nmake. And in truth, there is little more I can do to lighten that \nburden. But I can do this: I can assure you that your decision to \nfollow the facts and the law and the Constitution and acquit this \nPresident will not shake the foundation of the house of civil rights. \nThe house of civil rights is strong because its foundation is strong.\n  And with all due respect, the foundation of the house of civil rights \nwas never at the core of the Jones case. It was never at the heart of \nthe Jones case. The foundation of the house of civil rights is in the \nvoices of all the great civil rights leaders and the soul of every \nperson who heard them. It is in the hands of every person who folded a \nleaflet for change. And it is in the courage of every person who \nchanged. It is here in the Senate where men and women of courage and \nconviction stood for progress, where Senators--some of them still in \nthis chamber; some of them who lost their careers--looked to the \nConstitution, listened to their conscience, and then did the right \nthing.\n  The foundation of the house of civil rights is in all of us who \ngathered up our will to raise it up and keep on building. I stand here \nbefore you today because others before me decided to take a stand, or \nas one of my law professors so eloquently says, ``because someone \nclaimed my opportunities for me, by fighting for my right to have the \neducation I have, by fighting for my right to seek the employment I \nchoose, by fighting for my right to be a lawyer,'' by sitting in and \ncarrying signs and walking on long marches, riding freedom rides and \nputting their bodies on the line for civil rights.\n  I stand here before you today because America decided that the way \nthings were was not how they were going to be. We, the people, decided \nthat we all deserved a better deal. I stand here before you today \nbecause President Bill Clinton believed I could stand here for him.\n  Your decision whether to remove President Clinton from office, based \non the articles of impeachment, I know, will be based on the law and \nthe facts and the Constitution. It would be wrong to convict him on \nthis record. You should acquit him on this record. And you must not let \nimagined harms to the house of civil rights persuade you otherwise. The \nPresident did not obstruct justice. The President did not commit \nperjury. The President must not be removed from office.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE.
