I very seriously doubt there will be votes early this \nday.\n  I suggest to my friends on the minority side, and I think it should \nhave some resonance on the majority side, it is very likely we will be \ndoing things here tomorrow. Remember, we have, among other things, a \n24-hour CR and we have some of the most important measures we have had \nto deal with this entire Congress; that is, this $250 billion tax bill, \nplus Commerce-State-Justice, which is about $40 billion. A vast \nmajority of the issues have not been debated on the Senate floor. These \nare ``first impression'' for most of us.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are beginning debate this morning on \nwhat is ostensibly the conference report of the Small Business \nCommittee of which I have the pleasure to serve as the ranking member. \nObviously, nobody has any illusions that what the debate on the floor \nof the Senate today is about is small business issues. This is the so-\ncalled tax bill that has been attached to the Small Business conference \nreport. But let me say a word, if I may, about the process by which how \nthis package was made a part of the Small Business Reauthorization Act \nof 2000.\n  Despite being named a conferee, and despite the inclusion of \nprovisions that are important to small business, and despite the fact \nthat this conference report contains the work of the Small Business \nCommittee and which I devoted a considerable amount of time effort and \nenergy to negotiating, I will be voting against the overall conference \nreport before us today.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Massachusetts \nwill yield for a question at the beginning?\n  Mr. KERRY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KERREY. There are an awful lot of people wondering where is the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee. We are going to be taking up a tax bill and a Medicare/\nMedicaid bill. Why don't we see Chairman Roth and ranking member \nMoynihan down here managing this bill? Why is it a Small Business \nCommittee that has the responsibility for a piece of legislation \ndealing with targeted tax credits and Medicare relief?\n  Mr. KERRY. My good friend from Nebraska asked a very important \nquestion. Let me, in defense of the Senator from New York, say that \nSenator Moynihan will be here soon. By agreement, he is going to be \ncomanaging this report because of the tax provisions in this bill.\n  Mr. KERREY. This is a Small Business piece of legislation. This bill \nreferences small business. This is not a Finance Committee bill. The \nanswer is, it is not a Finance Committee bill.\n  Didn't the majority do the legislative equivalent of stealth molasses \nhere? Didn't they take another piece of legislation, hollow it out, and \nstuff in it targeted tax cuts that their Presidential candidate has \nbeen opposing for the last 90 days, criticizing the Vice President, \nsaying Washington, DC, should not decide, we should not be deciding in \nWashington, DC, who gets a tax cut? That is what I have been hearing \nover and over.\n  I ask my friend from Massachusetts, first of all, is it correct that \nthey stuffed a tax bill and they have stuffed a health care bill inside \nof some other bill that they hollowed out, that has not gone through \nthe normal process, and that the tax provision itself seems to violate \nwhat their Presidential candidate wants to do? Basically, it seems to \nme what our friends on the other side of the aisle are saying is Vice \nPresident Gore is right; Governor Bush is wrong.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my colleague from Nebraska, he is absolutely \ncorrect. That is exactly what has happened. That is exactly the state \nof affairs. In point of fact, let me say as a matter of courtesy, in \nterms of the process of the Senate, as ranking member of the Small \nBusiness Committee, I was never called, never asked, never even \npresented this conference report for signature, never even told as a \nmatter of courtesy what would go into this package and happen to the \nhard work of the Small Business Committee. It was simply done in the \ndead of night and presented to us, fait accompli, to the Congress.\n  I think all of us have the right to ask, as Senators, what kind of \ncourtesy is this we are being afforded as a matter of just collegial \nrelations within the Senate. I think this process shows a fundamental \ndisrespect for this institution, for the constitutional process and \nmembers of the Senate.\n  But, let me say to my colleague from Nebraska, here is what has been \nstuffed in this bill, to use the term by which he has appropriately \ndescribed it. This is a small business bill. But, without any hearings, \nwithout any appropriate bipartisan decision, this bill is brought to \nthe floor of the Senate today with H.R. 5538, as it was introduced, the \nMinimum Wage Act; H.R. 5542, as it was introduced, the Taxpayer Relief \nAct, which goes to the issue of the tax cuts; H.R. 5543, the Medicare, \nMedicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act, entirely \noutside the purview of the Small Business Committee; it comes with H.R. \n5544, the Pain Relief Promotion Act, an entirely controversial and, as \nwe will discuss through the course of this day, potentially very \ndangerous and damaging measure with respect to the delivery of quality \nmedical care in this country; and, H.R. 5545, the Small Business \nReauthorization Act, which was already mentioned.\n\n  The Senator from Nebraska is absolutely correct about the impact, the \nsubstance, and the process here.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will be delighted to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is interesting to hear the discussion \nof the process. Apparently there was no conference; there were no \nconferees. This was a small business authorization bill that was laying \ndormant, which they used as a large carcass to stuff a whole range of \nbills in the middle of and throw it then on the floor of the Senate.\n  I am curious; if the Senator from Massachusetts had been accorded the \nopportunity, as would normally have been the case, of being a conferee \nand being a part of deliberations, I assume first we would not have \nmost of these provisions in a small business bill, but if we had, for \nexample, would a conferee coming from Massachusetts been concerned \nabout the massive quantity of money that would go to HMOs in response \nto this balanced budget fix? Would there not have been an aggressive \ndebate saying you cannot do that in the dead of night, take bags of \nmoney and give it to HMOs that are not deserving, when, in fact, small \nhospitals, inner-city hospitals, and others who are desperately in need \nof these resources do not get it? Would there not have been aggressive \ndebate on that, and probably the disinfectant of sunlight would have \ngiven us the opportunity to dump many of these provisions?\n  Mr. KERRY. I say to my colleague from the State of North Dakota, he \nis again absolutely correct, in that the only portion of this bill \ndiscussed amongst the conferees was the Small\n\n[[Page S11195]]\n\nBusiness Reauthorization Act. I was never consulted as to what \nadditional measures were included. And, in many respects, it is even \nworse than he has described. As I said, there was a conference on which \nwe worked hard with respect to small business legislation itself, but \nthat conference is not even properly reflected in the small business \nbill that has been brought here because this is a changed small \nbusiness bill. It is not completely the Reauthorization package that we \nhad conferenced. It has been changed without the courtesy of involving \nthose of us on this side of the aisle, obviously without the debate \nthat would have had the impact the Senator from North Dakota cites.\n  I have here the letter from the President of the United States in \nwhich he promises this report will be vetoed. I know the leadership on \nthe other side of the aisle has read this and notwithstanding that the \nPresident has promised that this will be vetoed and notwithstanding the \nfact that the President is making it very clear to the American people \nand to our colleagues why it will be vetoed, they, nevertheless, have \nseen fit to simply bring this to the floor and, so to speak, stuff it \nthrough the Senate. Why? To create a political issue or perhaps simply \nto be stubborn and try to set up the President for some possible \npolitical gain.\n  This is precisely what George Bush himself has been talking about: \npartisanship, bickering, the very kind of thing that supposedly he says \nhe could control here and on which he has been campaigning. He was \nasked to make one phone call to stop this and he will not even make \nthat phone call. Here we are debating, and people are wondering why we \nare here. Why debate this measure just so it can be vetoed. Why not \nbring up the Patients' Bill of Rights, or provide a prescription drug \nbenefit for seniors under Medicare instead of wasting time?\n  I will share what President Clinton said before this catchall package \ncame to the floor, before we had to be put into this position of voting \nagainst it. I am reading from the President's letter of October 26. I \nask unanimous consent that the entire letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  The White House,\n\n\n                                Office of the Press Secretary,\n\n                                                 October 26, 2000.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Leader:) Thank you for your \n     letter yesterday responding to my proposed consensus tax \n     package. As I said yesterday, I believe we all have a \n     responsibility to make every possible effort to come together \n     on a bipartisan agreement on tax relief and Medicare/Medicaid \n     that will maintain fiscal discipline and serve the interests \n     of all the American people. That is why I put forward a good \n     faith offer yesterday that sought to reflect our differing \n     priorities in a balanced manner. I was disappointed, however, \n     that, without any consultation with me or Congressional \n     Democrats, you chose to put forward a partisan legislative \n     package that ignores our key concerns on school construction, \n     health care, and pensions policy. If this current tax and \n     Medicare/Medicaid package is presented to me, I will have no \n     choice but to veto it.\n       While we have already reached substantial agreement in \n     important areas, such as replacement of the Foreign Sales \n     Corporations regime, your legislation has substantial flaws \n     in several key areas.\n       As I stated yesterday, I believe it is absolutely essential \n     that we do as much as possible to meet America's need for \n     safe and modern schools. It is estimated that there may be as \n     much as a $125 billion dollar financing gap in meeting the \n     school construction and modernization needs of our children.\n       The bipartisan Rangel-Johnson proposal to finance $25 \n     billion in bonds to construct and modernize 6,000 schools is, \n     quite frankly, the very least we should do, given the \n     magnitude of this problem and its importance to America's \n     future. Unfortunately, your proposal falls far short of the \n     mark. We should not sacrifice thousands of modernized schools \n     to pay for inefficient tax incentives that help only a few. \n     For example, the arbitrage provision encourages delay in \n     urgently needed school construction and would \n     disproportionately help wealthy school districts.\n       On health care, my offer sought to lay a path to common \n     ground by coupling both of our priorities on health and long-\n     term care. Unfortunately, your health care proposal \n     completely ignores our proposal to cover millions of \n     uninsured, working Americans. Instead you put forward a \n     series of tax cuts that, particularly when standing alone, \n     would be inequitable, inefficient, and even potentially \n     counterproductive health care policy. For example, while our \n     FamilyCare proposal would expand coverage to 4 million \n     uninsured parents at a cost of slightly over $3,000 per \n     person, your proposal would provide additional coverage to \n     one-seventh the people at six times the cost per person. \n     Moreover, your proposal would give the least assistance to \n     moderate-income families that need help the most, while even \n     raising concerns that those with employer-based coverage \n     today could lose their insurance.\n       Similarly, on long-term care, I offered to embrace your \n     proposed deduction for long-term care insurance in exchange \n     for inclusion of my proposal to give families, who are \n     burdened today by long-term care needs, a $3,000 tax credit. \n     Unfortunately, your legislation ignores the bipartisan \n     package I suggested and instead would provide half the \n     benefits of my proposal for financially pressed families \n     trying to provide long-term care for elderly and sick family \n     members. Surely we can agree on this bipartisan compromise \n     that has already been endorsed by a broad array of members of \n     Congress, advocates for seniors and people with disabilities, \n     and insurers. Similarly, I am perplexed that we cannot agree \n     to include the bipartisan credit for vaccine research and \n     purchases that is essential to save lives and advance public \n     health.\n       I also am disappointed that you have made virtually no \n     attempt to address the concerns my Administration has \n     expressed to you about the pension provisions of your bill. \n     By dropping the progressive savings incentives from the \n     Senate Finance Committee bill, you have failed to address the \n     lack of pension coverage for over 70 million people. \n     Moreover, employers may have new incentives to drop pension \n     coverage for some of the low- and moderate-income workers \n     lucky enough to have pension plans today.\n       Finally, I remain deeply concerned that your Medicare and \n     Medicaid refinement proposal continues to fail to attach \n     accountability provisions to excessive payment increases to \n     health maintenance organizations (HMOs) while rejecting \n     critical investments in beneficiaries and vulnerable health \n     care providers. Specifically, you insist on an unjustifiable \n     spending increase for HMOs at the same time as you exclude \n     bipartisan policies such as health insurance options for \n     children with disabilities, legal immigrant pregnant women \n     and children, and enrolling uninsured children in schools, as \n     well as needed payment increases to hospitals, academic \n     health centers, home health agencies, and other vulnerable \n     providers. Congress should not go home without responding to \n     the urgent health needs of our seniors, people with \n     disabilities, and children and the health care providers who \n     serve them.\n       A far better path than the current one is for Congressional \n     Republicans, Democrats, and my Administration to come \n     together in a bipartisan process to find common ground on \n     both tax relief and Medicare/Medicaid refinements.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William J. Clinton.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the President said:\n\n       While we have already reached substantial agreement in \n     important areas, such as replacement of the Foreign Sales \n     Corporation regime, your legislation--\n\n  He is writing to the House and Senate Republican leaders--\n\n       your legislation has substantial flaws in key areas. As I \n     stated yesterday--\n\n  This is the President of the United States saying this--\n\n       I believe it is absolutely essential that we do as much as \n     possible to meet America's need for safe and modern schools. \n     It is estimated that there may be as much as a $125 billion \n     financing gap in meeting the school construction and \n     modernization needs of our children. The bipartisan Rangel-\n     Johnson proposal to finance $25 billion in bonds to construct \n     and modernize 6,000 schools is, quite frankly, the very least \n     we should do, given the magnitude of this problem and its \n     importance to America's future. Unfortunately, your proposal \n     falls far short of the mark.\n\n  So yesterday, and in prior discussions for weeks, the President made \nit very clear this falls short; this will not be sufficient; he will \nveto it. Nevertheless, we are here.\n  The President goes on to say:\n\n       We should not sacrifice thousands of modernized schools to \n     pay for inefficient tax incentives that help only a few. For \n     example, the arbitrage provision encourages delay in urgently \n     needed school construction and would disproportionately help \n     wealthy school districts.\n\n  Health care is perhaps one of the most important components of this \nbill. The Senator from Nebraska raised this same point--we are talking \nabout the health care system of the country. It has been an enormously \ndivisive and complicated issue within the Finance Committee. Suddenly, \nin the dead of night, it is just snatched out, a proposal is sent to \nthe floor as part of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000 and \npeople are surprised that the President may decide he is going to veto \nit and that those of us on this side of the aisle might have objections \nto that piece of legislation coming to the floor in this manner.\n  Nobody should be surprised about our concerns under these unusual \ncircumstances.\n\n[[Page S11196]]\n\n  This is what the President says:\n\n       On health care, my offer sought to lay a path to common \n     ground by coupling both of our priorities on health and long-\n     term care.\n\n  In other words, the President sought to find the common ground. The \nPresident sought compromise. The President sought to try to address the \nneeds of both Republicans and Democrats on health and long-term care.\n  He writes:\n\n       Unfortunately, your health care proposal completely ignores \n     our proposal to cover millions of uninsured, working \n     Americans. Instead, you put forward a series of tax cuts \n     that, particularly, when standing alone, would be \n     inequitable, inefficient, and even potentially \n     counterproductive to health care policy.\n\n  The reason they would be counterproductive to health care policy is \nbecause the Republican proposal gives tax cuts to people who already \nhave health care, who already have a high level of income, who are \nalready covered by employers, and what you do by doing that is provide \nan incentive for employers to turn to them and say: We do not need to \ncover you anymore; you can go out and get your own health care because \nyou are getting a tax cut--while it leaves millions of Americans who \nare uninsured without any insurance options whatsoever. That is so \npatently counterproductive, as well as patently unfair, that it begs \nour coming to the floor of the Senate to stand with the President \nand suggest this ought to be vetoed.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield for another \nquestion?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will be delighted to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. KERREY. One of the Presidential debates was in Massachusetts. I \nknow the distinguished Senator attended it. I suspect he watched the \nother Presidential debates. One of the most important dividing lines \nbetween the two candidates is that the Governor from Texas has been \nsaying Washington, DC should not decide who gets a tax cut and who does \nnot. The Vice President has been saying--not only for fiscal reasons \nbut also for reasons of fairness--that is precisely what we should do. \nWe should decide who is going to get a tax cut and target those tax \ncuts rather than having across-the-board tax cuts predominantly for the \nwealthiest Americans.\n  It seems to me what the Republican leadership in the House and the \nSenate are saying that the Vice President is right; we should target \ntaxes and tax cuts. I wonder if the Senator from Massachusetts sees it \nthat way.\n  Mr. KERRY. I say to my colleague from Nebraska, he is again \nperceptive in seeing the extraordinary contradiction in the actions \ntaken by the majority party, the Republicans in Congress, compared to \nwhat their own nominee for President is suggesting is the appropriate \nway to proceed. Indeed, the very criticism leveled by George Bush \nagainst Al Gore that he is, in fact, trying to target appropriately--\nappropriately, I underline ``appropriately''--is really critical \nbecause what the Republicans are doing here is targeting, which is \nprecisely what their candidate has criticized, but they are targeting \ninappropriately. They are targeting, once again, to reward those \nalready most rewarded. They are targeting to reward those who already \nhave health care. They are targeting in a way that ignores the concern \nof the President and most of us here, which is: How do you provide \ncoverage to those people who are without coverage or having the \ngreatest difficulty in providing for their health care with HMOs that \nare cutting them out.\n  Mr. KERREY. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. KERRY. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. KERREY. Essentially, the argument is over. Our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle are agreeing with us; their Presidential \ncandidate is wrong; we should target tax cuts.\n  Then you move on to the next question, which is, Who is going to get \nthe tax cut? What standards do we apply to make that decision? Would \nthe Senator from Massachusetts agree that it seems one of the missing \nquestions that was not asked was--it doesn't seem to me it was asked. \nNone of our colleagues from the other side of the aisle are here. I \nlook forward to asking them. I don't know who was in the room when this \nwas written. But whoever was in the room from the other side of the \naisle, there were no Democrats there. Does it appear to the Senator \nthat anybody in that room asked the question: Is this fair, given the \nneeds of this country? Is this package fair? Did they seem to apply a \nstandard or a test of fairness as they made their decision?\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me answer the Senator from Nebraska by saying, in the \n16 years I have been in the Senate--in the debates we had in 1986 on \ntax simplification--in almost every single tax proposal we have worked \non in those years, I have never heard the word ``fairness'' come from \nthat side of the aisle. I have never heard them suggest that the plan \nthey are offering America is based on a fundamental notion of what is \nfair for all Americans.\n  Mr. KERREY. I wonder if the Senator----\n  Mr. KERRY. I will say this to my colleague. If you look at the \ndistribution here to the HMOs, and if you look at what happens to \ncommunity hospitals, to home health care delivery, to the nursing \nhomes, to those people who are part of a community and stay in a \ncommunity, and who are not there for profit, versus what they have done \nto provide the lion's share of funding to those who work for profit but \nat the same time have cut off 400,000 senior citizens from getting \nhealth care, it is an extraordinary imbalance on its face.\n  Mr. KERREY. Will the Senator yield for one additional question?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will yield.\n  Mr. KERREY. And then I will wait to speak further after the Senator \nfinishes his opening remarks.\n  In this morning's New York Times, there is an article describing the \nTexas Governor's speech in Pennsylvania yesterday. He does know how to \nturn a phrase. It is very good language. But I wonder if the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts sees a conflict in what the Governor of Texas is \nsaying that he wants to do and what is in this bill.\n  Let me read what he said:\n\n       In my administration, we will ask not only what is legal \n     but also what is right, not just what the lawyers allow but \n     what the public deserves.\n\n  He went on and said:\n\n       In my administration, we will make it clear there is the \n     controlling legal authority of conscience.\n\n  Does my friend from Massachusetts think this process and this \nproposal meets the test that the Governor of Texas set yesterday in \nPennsylvania?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague, the question he \nraises should not be treated by my colleagues as simply political \nposturing or somehow a statement that suggests that there is simply a \npoint to be scored here.\n  In the years I have been here, I have never seen the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd--who I think most people in the \nSenate would agree is really the custodian of the institution--he is \nthe Senator who has written the most, thought the most, and perhaps \nstood the strongest for the rights and prerogatives of Senators, and \nthe rights and prerogatives of this institution.\n\n  What the Senator from Nebraska is raising in his question really goes \nto the core of the conscience, if you will, of the Senate, of what is \nright, of what is the controlling legal authority for the Senate.\n  Is it appropriate to have a process that excludes and distorts and \ndiminishes the institution in the way this process has?\n  The distinguished minority leader is on the floor of the Senate. I \nsaw him as angry yesterday and as visibly upset as I think any of us in \nour caucus have ever seen him because of his sense of this violation of \nprocess, of the ways in which the rights of individual Senators are \nbeing denied.\n  Now, people may not like a particular vote around here, and people \nmay not want to vote because they don't like the fact they have to \nstand by that vote, but the fact is, this legislation that comes to the \nfloor of the Senate today is a violation of our rights, of the sort of \nconscience, if you will, that the Senator is talking about, about doing \nwhat is right.\n  I will go on, if I may, to underscore----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Before the Senator moves on any further, I ask him if he \nwill yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERRY. I am delighted to yield to the Senator.\n\n[[Page S11197]]\n\n  (Mr. BROWNBACK assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from Massachusetts for coming down here \nand putting into words what so many of us are feeling--just this sense \nof unfairness, not only about the process, which he described so well, \ntaking what is supposed to be a Small Business bill, hollowing it out \nand stuffing it full of other issues, leaving out the people who are \nsupposed to be involved, but also the substance of what is actually in \nthis bill.\n  I want to probe him on one question. Is the Senator aware that tens \nof billions of dollars in this bill are going to the HMOs, and there is \nnot one string attached that the HMOs have to serve the senior citizens \nwho they kicked out of Medicare?\n  We are giving bags of money to one of the most unpopular businesses \nin America today because they do not treat people fairly, without one \nrequirement that they take these seniors home again and give them \nhealth care again.\n  I say to the Senator, you have seen it in your State and I have seen \nit in my State, where seniors were told: Join this HMO through \nMedicare. You won't have any copayments. You will be fine, only to wake \nup in the morning and be kicked out.\n  Could my colleague talk about the fairness or unfairness of that?\n  Mr. KERRY. May I say to my friend from California, she is one of the \nchampions in the Senate for that kind of fairness and for her \nsensitivity to the notion of what happens to our seniors. Obviously in \nCalifornia it is vital to have that kind of sensitivity.\n  Let me underscore what she just said, because not only do the tens of \nbillions of dollars go to the HMOs in a disproportionate share--one-\nthird in the first 5 years, 50 percent in the second 5 years--the \nSenator from South Dakota, the distinguished minority leader, led an \neffort in the Senate to try to secure $80 billion as the appropriate \nbalanced budget fix here, with a recognition that we would do away with \nthe 15-percent cut which has been mandated inappropriately by almost \neverybody's agreement.\n  What we are winding up with is $30 billion, which has now been \ndivided by the majority party completely inappropriately to one of the \ngreatest sources of the problem in the delivery of health care in the \ncountry.\n  What is absolutely extraordinary in this situation is that, as the \nSenator from California mentions, there is only one sort of minor \nrequirement here about what kind of behavior the HMOs might be held to.\n  All of us in the Senate have been fighting for months to try to get a \nPatients' Bill of Rights and establish a real set of principles and \nstandards by which people in the United States will know what they are \ngoing to get from HMOs, what they can expect from HMOs, and how they \nwill be treated by HMOs. But here we are with a great big grab bag \ngiveaway to the HMOs, without any of those standards being embraced \nhere.\n  If you want to talk about the conscience, and doing what is right, \nwhich is what the Senator from Nebraska talked about, here is an \nincredible example of the way in which they have sort of flagrantly \nchosen how to satisfy their constituencies, their sense of who ought to \nget something, and have left out completely the rights we have been \nfighting for that would have accrued-- the basic rights, a woman's \nright to know she can keep her own OB/GYN she has had for a number of \nyears, a person's right to go to an emergency room of their choice, a \nright to a second opinion. Think about that, to get a second opinion \nand not to have some HMO bureaucrat in a State that isn't even \nassociated with your particular health care problem not make the \ndecision but have your doctor make a decision. We can't even come to \nthe floor of the Senate and do that here. We have to give away money to \nthe folks who already have health care rather than taking care of the \npeople who are uninsured which could be done cheaper.\n\n  In fact, what the President says in his letter is really interesting. \nI will share this completely with my colleagues as we put it into the \nRecord.\n  The President said, before this came to the floor, before we were put \nin the predicament of having to vote against something that has a lot \nof good in it, many of us like components of what is in this bill. Many \nof us worked hard to get components of this bill. We are going to be \nforced to vote against it because of the fundamental unfairness. The \nPresident of the United States makes that very clear in his letter. I \nwill continue to read what the President says to both leaders:\n\n       Instead you put forward a series of tax cuts that, \n     particularly when standing alone, would be inequitable, \n     inefficient, and even potentially counterproductive to health \n     care policy. For example, while our FamilyCare proposal would \n     expand coverage to 4 million uninsured parents at a cost of \n     slightly over $3,000 per person, your proposal would provide \n     additional coverage to one-seventh the people at six times \n     the cost per person. Moreover, your proposal would give the \n     least assistance to moderate income families that need the \n     help the most, while even raising concerns that those with \n     employer-based coverage today could lose their insurance.\n       Similarly, on long-term care, I offered to embrace your \n     proposed deduction for long-term care insurance in exchange \n     for inclusion of my proposal to give families, who are \n     burdened today by long-term care needs, a $3,000 tax credit.\n\n  That sounds pretty bipartisan to me. The President said: I offered to \nembrace your proposed deduction if you would embrace my effort to give \nfamilies who have long-term care problems a $3,000 tax credit.\n  What happens? Rebuffed.\n  The President says:\n\n       Unfortunately, your legislation ignores the bipartisan \n     package I suggested and instead would provide half the \n     benefits of my proposal for financially pressed families \n     trying to provide long-term care for elderly and sick family \n     members. Surely we can agree on this bipartisan compromise \n     that has already been endorsed by a broad array of members of \n     Congress, advocates for seniors and people with disabilities \n     and insurers. Similarly, I am perplexed that we cannot agree \n     to include the bipartisan credit for vaccine research and \n     purchases that is essential to save lives and advance public \n     health.\n\n  Let me say a word about that, if I may, because I wrote that \nlegislation. We have been struggling in the Congress to get this \nconsidered. I wrote it with Senator Bill Frist. This is an effort to \ntry to guarantee that the great AIDS crisis will be properly addressed. \nMillions of people are dying in Africa, countless hundreds of thousands \nare affected here in our own country by this ravaging disease. \nUnfortunately, the pharmaceutical companies have no incentive because \npeople in those countries cannot afford to buy the drugs. It is much \nmore profitable to produce Viagra or any number of other drugs that are \nadvertised now--Claritin, whatever. There are a whole set of drugs that \nhave quick return and that make money. But poor countries cannot afford \nto buy these drugs.\n\n  We have already passed into legislation funding of some $500 million \nfor AIDS vaccine distribution across the world. The problem is that \nthere is no vaccine today, and there won't be a vaccine unless the \ncompanies have an incentive and a capacity to be able to develop it. It \nis not only AIDS, incidentally, it is also for tuberculosis, for \nmalaria. There are infectious diseases for which we could have further \nresearch in terms of vaccine development.\n  What we want to do is provide the companies with a tax credit and the \ncapacity to do that. It has broad bipartisan support. It is only $1.5 \nbillion over 10 years. But that is not even in here. That is ignored in \nhere. The President of the United States is suggesting it ought to be \nin here. They are perfectly prepared to take a huge percentage of the \n$30 billion and give it to the HMOs, but they are not prepared to \nprovide the $1.5 billion in an effort to provide incentives foe AIDS \nvaccine research.\n  The President also says:\n\n       I also am disappointed that you have made virtually no \n     attempt to address the concerns my Administration has \n     expressed to you about the pension provisions of your bill. \n     By dropping the progressive savings incentives from the \n     Senate Finance Committee bill, you have failed to address the \n     lack of pension coverage for over 70 million people. \n     Moreover, employers may have new incentives to drop pension \n     coverage for some of the low- and moderate-income workers \n     lucky enough to have pension plans today.\n       Finally, I remain deeply concerned that your Medicare and \n     Medicaid refinement proposal continues to fail to attach \n     accountability provisions to excessive payment increases to \n     health maintenance organizations (HMOs) while rejecting \n     critical investments in beneficiaries and vulnerable health \n     care providers. Specifically, you insist on an unjustified \n     spending increase for HMOs at the same time as you exclude \n     bipartisan policies\n\n[[Page S11198]]\n\n     such as health insurance options for children with \n     disabilities, legal immigrant pregnant women and children, \n     and enrolling uninsured children in schools, as well as \n     needed payment increases to hospitals, academic health \n     centers, home health agencies, and other vulnerable \n     providers. Congress should not go home without responding to \n     the urgent health needs of our seniors, people with \n     disabilities, and children and the health care providers who \n     serve them.\n\n  I read the newspapers today, and I saw a fairly typical sort of \nWashington response from someone on the other side of the aisle \nsuggesting that the President's veto of this bill was somehow going to \nprovide them with an upper hand in the last weeks of this election \ncycle. This is not about the last week of the election. This is about \nfundamental policy, which the President has described in this letter, \nwhich goes directly to the question of how this country is going to \nprovide for health care for our citizens. There are 44 million or so \nAmericans who have no health care whatsoever. What about them?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield for a moment?\n  Mr. KERRY. I am happy to yield to the distinguished leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank him and commend him for his powerful statement \nand the eloquence with which he has described our current circumstance.\n  I appreciate especially his interest in reading into the Record many \nof the concerns the President expressed in his letter to all of us \nyesterday. I also appreciate his contribution to the caucus as we have \nattempted to work through how we ought to respond to this very unusual \nset of circumstances. He is our ranking member on the Committee on \nSmall Business. He indicated to me yesterday that there was no \nconsultation prior to the time this conference report was brought to \nthe Senate. I ask the Senator from Massachusetts if he could elaborate \nfirst on what consultation, what degree of communication there was in \ncoming to the floor and in talking about this bill. To what extent was \nhis signature sought prior to the time we came to the floor?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will gladly respond to the distinguished \nleader's question. I went into this a little bit before he came. Let me \nrepeat: The distinguished Senator from Missouri and I worked hard on \nthe small business components of this. But there was no consultation \nwhatsoever, no phone call, no request for signature, no meeting, no \ndiscussion even about this bill being used, at least with this Senator, \nas the vehicle for these components being put in it. We were not in the \nroom. We didn't know where the room was. We weren't even asked whether \nor not this was something we might or might not object to or what the \nimpact might be on the bipartisan efforts that had taken place to have \na complete small business reauthorization bill.\n  Moreover, the bill that comes to the floor today is not even the same \nsmall business reauthorization that we worked on. It has been changed, \nagain, we had no consultation and no part.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask the Senator from Massachusetts this: Obviously, \nthere are many times when we are called upon to vote. But I have never \nheard of a time when the ranking member of a conference was denied even \naccess to the text of whatever it was he was conferencing on.\n  Let me ask the Senator from Massachusetts, has he now seen a copy of \nthe conference report?\n  Mr. KERRY. I have it right here, Mr. President. I tell the leader I \ndo now have a copy of it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Is it the Senator's understanding that the entire \nconference report is what we have in our hands--two pages?\n  Mr. KERRY. It is two pages with two signature pages, and the joint \nexplanatory statement of the committee--about five pages. I will show \nit to my colleague. I had no input on this explanatory statement and it \nis hard to explain, but it is just a small paragraph to describe the \nhundreds of pages mention on by reference in this report.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am really amazed and somewhat amused. \nAs you look at this so-called conference report, one could almost read \nit in less than a couple of minutes. I won't do that. But I find it \ninteresting, and I ask the Senator from Massachusetts if he could share \nhis observations with regard to the way this conference report was \nwritten. This is no conference report. This is nothing more than a list \nof references to other bills proclaiming it to be a conference report. \nThis says:\n\n       The provisions of the bills of the 106th Congress are \n     hereby enacted into law: H.R. 5538, H.R. 5542, H.R. 5543, \n     H.R. 5544, H.R. 5545.\n\n  So ends the conference report. That is the most remarkable thing. I \njust can't imagine that anybody would be willing to put their signature \nto a conference report which does nothing more than reference other \nbills. This is the conference report--or a representation of the \nconference report. This is what it should look like. What I hold in my \nhands is how thick the conference report should be. Yet as thick as \nthis is, they could not even get it right. We actually terminate the \nminimum wage in this conference report. I wonder whether the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts is aware of that and could respond to how that could \nhave happened.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say to the distinguished leader, I \nonly learned that this morning having had limited time to review it. \nWell, it either happened purposefully or by accident. Either way, that \nis not the intent of the Congress with respect to the minimum wage. I \nunderstand that it is a 6-month termination of the minimum wage, which \nI hope is by accident. But if it is, it represents the craziness and \nthe sloppiness of the way in which this has come to the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Well, as I say, I note in amusement, the Senator spent \nsome time talking about the President's veto letter, and I am amused in \npart because the Speaker has already addressed the veto letter and was \nasked yesterday if Republicans would be willing to rework the tax cut \nbill after a veto. He responded--I hope colleagues will listen--that \nany new legislation would have to go through committee, and anything \nelse would amount to half--I will call it ``half-baked'' legislation. \nHe has another term, but I don't think I want to dignify it this \nmorning.\n  Anything other than a committee process is half-baked, according to \nthe Speaker. Maybe that is how we leave out minimum wage \nreauthorization. Maybe that is how we leave out Democratic proposals, \nas the Senator from Nebraska had offered in the committee, along with \nothers, to make this more fair. Maybe that is how it happens. Maybe you \ndon't produce a bill this thick because you don't care about fairness; \nyou don't care about getting it right.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Massachusetts whether he would care to observe \nwhether he has had, in his experience as ranking member, a time when he \nhas ever seen legislation coming to the floor in this form, leaving out \nprovisions that literally nullify a law that has been standing now for \nalmost 70 years?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I voiced my concern about this to the \nleader yesterday and a number of times previously--that this is not the \nway to legislate. I think most of us understand that. I think it really \ncalls to question the sort of good-faith, bipartisan efforts our \nfriends often talk about. There is a simple matter of courtesy with \nwhich this institution and any institution essentially needs to run. I \ndon't like to say this, but I have to say that it just sort of runs \nroughshod over anybody's notions of decency that there isn't even a \nphone call, there isn't even a discussion. Is there a way to work this \nout? Can we sit down? Can we have a meeting? What is possible here? \nNone of those questions were asked--just an assumption that this is the \nway we are going to do it and we are going to proceed forward. I just \nthink it is destructive and unfortunate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask the Senator from Massachusetts whether he shares \nmy observation that it comes down to a question, as he said, of \nfairness. We are talking about whether or not this process is fair, \nwhether or not, with all of the talk of bipartisanship in the \nPresidential campaign, there is any element of fairness or \nbipartisanship in the way this process has unfolded; whether or not \nthere is fairness in a school construction proposal that leaves out \nover 90 percent of the school construction opportunity and need we have \nin this country; whether or not it is fair to provide more benefits to \nthe top 5 percent of all taxpayers than the bottom 80 percent as \nrepresented in this bill; whether or not it is fair to give a third of \nall the benefits we are\n\n[[Page S11199]]\n\nproviding in BBA back to the HMOs as ransom payments to stay in States \nthat they have already proclaimed they will not do. I ask the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts whether he doesn't agree that really the essence of \nthis argument, the essence of this debate is a question of fairness.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I believe the eloquent questions asked by \nthe Senator from South Dakota make their own answers. I think any \nAmerican dispassionately making a judgment about this process and \nlooking at this legislation and measuring its impact would come to the \nconclusion that the fundamental sense of fairness, that the \ndistinguished leader is talking about, is absent.\n  I am sure the distinguished majority leader, who is standing here, \nwill have his response, and I understand that. He is going to suggest, \nwait a minute, fairness is fairness. But here is a letter from the \nPresident of the United States. The President of the United States says \nif we do this, he is going to veto this. He has proven previously he is \nprepared to veto bills when he says he will.\n  It seems to me that if we are not looking for a political issue, if \nwe really want to legislate, we would sit down with the President of \nthe United States and say, OK, Mr. President, we are prepared to offer \nthis; let's have an agreement. But the President says that even his \noffer--I want to reemphasize this--even his offer was refused. The \nPresident says on long-term care:\n\n       I offered to embrace your proposed deduction for long-term \n     care in exchange for inclusion of my proposal to give \n     families who are burdened today by long-term care needs a \n     $3,000 tax credit.\n\n  Let me ask my colleagues this: Long-term care, I have become \nparticularly familiar with that over the course of the last year and a \nhalf. My father passed away last July and he had considerable care, as \nmy mother does today. It is expensive. We are fortunate that we can pay \nfor it. But it taught me firsthand what happens to those families who \ncan't and how extraordinarily expensive and difficult it is. We have \ndriven families out of hospital care and we have driven them out of \nnursing home care. We have increasingly, through the creation of the \ndrugs we have in this country, made it easier for people to be treated \nat home and be kept out of the hospital. But here we are denying people \nthe capacity to have a $3,000 tax credit for long-term care. Why? So \nyou can give more money back to the HMOs. Where is the fundamental \nsense of fairness? The President of the United States offered to the \nmajority party the chance to say let's compromise. And what happens? We \nget legislation coming to the floor that seeks to just stuff it to the \nPresident of the United States and stuff it to the rest of us here and \nstuff it to the American people.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a question, Mr. President?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am sitting here listening carefully to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, to my Democratic leader, and others. I realize why the \nSenator started out with the word ``fairness'' and why this bill is so \nunfair. I wish to just ask one question. I wonder if my friend has seen \nthe Washington Post analysis of this particular tax bill entitled \n``Businesses Poised To Benefit From Bills.''\n  I wanted to point out an irony and see if my friend doesn't agree, \nthe irony of calling this a small business bill; in other words, they \nhave hollowed out the small business bill. But let's look at what they \nhave done. And I will be very brief, but I think it is important. It \nsays, ``From the National Association of Broadcasters and defense \ncontractors to the racetrack industry, to tobacco companies, business \ninterests are poised to reap large benefits from the small print of \nRepublican-backed bills that were moving through Congress yesterday.''\n  Looking at several of the bills, it goes on to say--and again I will \nbe brief--``But those benefits pale''--those benefits pale--``in \ncomparison with the ones lavished on medical care providers,'' the \nHMOs. Those pale. So they gave to the tobacco industry; they gave to \nthe defense contractors; they gave to the broadcasters. We know how \nthey are all suffering. And those benefits pale in comparison with what \nthey gave to the HMOs. So when the Vice President is out there talking \nabout fairness and talking about fighting for people, this proves his \npoint. When Democrats are locked out of the room--and we know they \nwere--who walks away with the sacks of money but the HMOs that have \nbeen hurting our people.\n  So I think my friend has really laid out the case. And by the way, \nthe Post points out there are many other special interests hanging \naround these corridors. They are unhappy they were left out of the mix, \nand they are listed here--the lobbyists in their pinstripe suits \nstanding around here waiting to get in, waiting to get some of the \nbenefits.\n  So I just wonder at the irony of the situation. I notice my friend is \nnot wearing a pinstripe suit himself today. But the bottom line here is \ngiveaways to those who have, asking nothing in return, giveaways to \nthose who are hurting the senior citizens, kicking them out of the HMOs \nbecause they say Medicare doesn't pay enough. They get billions of \ndollars back. Nothing is really asked of them to walk away with those \nsacks of money. And all they are doing with the so-called small \nbusiness bill is giving breaks to big business. I say to my friend, he \nis right to be upset on this point.\n  Mr. KERRY. Well, I may say to the Senator from California--and I know \nthe majority leader is going to point this out to us--we have a rule \nhere, rule XXVIII, and I am confident he is going to talk about that \nand he is going to say, well, the Senate created a situation whereby \nthis rule was replaced by a precedent allowing an unfortunate process \nwhereby a piece of legislation like this ``can happen.'' That goes to \nwhat the Senator from Nebraska was talking about--the legal authority \nversus the sense of conscience and the question of what is right and \nwhat is wrong.\n  It also goes to the question of how one gets things done. I will \nreadily acknowledge that there is a ``precedent'' that allows last \nminute things to happen in the context of a conference. But the \nprecedent and the rectitude with which it might be legitimately used \ndoes nothing to wipe away the question of the sort of moral or \npolitical legitimacy within the context of this institution or our own \npolitics. When the President of the United States sends a letter and \nsays: Don't do this; I will veto it because it is fundamentally unfair, \nbut nevertheless people go ahead and proceed to do it anyway, that \nreally calls into question motive, purpose, outcome, and why we are \nhere today in this situation.\n\n  So I am going to readily acknowledge, sure, you can use some \ntechnicality of legitimacy to say it, but it is not legitimate in the \nlarger context of what we are trying to get done. It is not legitimate \nwhen measured against the judgment of most Americans about what is fair \nand right.\n  It is clear that we have a health care delivery system problem. We \nhave millions of Americans who have no insurance whatsoever. The \nPresident offered a way, a far less expensive way than that which has \nbeen exploited by the majority party, to provide care to those \ncitizens. In his letter--and I want to emphasize this--the President \nsays very clearly, ``Our family care proposal would expand coverage to \n4 million uninsured parents at a cost of slightly over $3,000 per \nperson. Your proposal''--this is the proposal of the majority side--\n``would provide additional coverage to one-seventh the people at six \ntimes the cost.'' One-seventh of the people at six times the cost.\n  That is what this fight is about. It is about uninsured people versus \npeople who are insured. It is about unintended consequences, or maybe \nvague results. If you give a health care tax credit to people who \nalready have coverage, you are giving an incentive to corporations that \nprovide that coverage to turn to them and say we don't need to provide \nyou with coverage anymore; you now have a handsome health care tax \ncredit from the Federal Government; go buy your own. And you wind up \nreducing the number of those who are covered, not in fact encouraging \nfurther coverage. So there is a complete reversal of policy in a sense \nhere, and I think it goes to the core of what this particular \nlegislation is about.\n  Now, I said earlier--and I want to complete the part of my statement\n\n[[Page S11200]]\n\nabout what is going in this bill and why I think we could find a common \nground. It seems to me there is a common ground that could be found. \nFirst of all, the small business provisions are good. We worked at \nthem, hard. I might also emphasize that the hard work is one of the \nreasons that they are good--and I congratulate the Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Bond, and his staff for this--we worked together in order \nto try to accommodate people. We accommodated the Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Wellstone, on one component, which was a very important \npart of expanding the reach of programs into low-income communities, \nand that was how we came to a consensus agreement of bipartisanship \nwithin our committee.\n  But, again, without my knowledge, without one Senate Democrat being \nthere, that entire provision was thrown and traded away in the middle \nof the night, in a room that I still do not know where it was, with \nthose people who met without even inviting us. The consensus that had \nbeen built for the small business bill was traded away in exchange for \nother items that are in this legislation. I say to my colleagues, \nrespectfully, that is not the way to build consensus. That is not the \nway to encourage the capacity to have agreement in the final results \nhere.\n  There are important provisions in this bill. Provisions which I \nworked to include and worked with other members to get included. There \nis a reauthorization of the National Women's Business Council at $1 \nmillion a year. That is important. We should be doing that together. It \nenhances the procurement opportunities for women-owned businesses. We \nbuilt an important consensus on that. We should be doing that together. \nIt reauthorizes the very small business concerns program. We worked \nhard for that. We should be doing that. It reauthorizes the Socially \nand Economically Disadvantaged Business Program, it extends the SBA's \ncosponsorship authority, and it has important provisions to increase \nveteran owned businesses. There were important changes to the Microloan \nProgram, which I included, specifically provisions that increased the \nmaximum loan amount from $25,000 to $35,000, and increasing the average \nloan size to $15,000. These are important provisions that we worked on \ntogether. Its not a perfect document, but it has the support of nearly \nall members, because we all had a stake in it and were a part of the \nprocess.\n\n  There are good things in this bill. I regret the fact that I am put \nin the unfortunate position of having this sort of nonlegislative \nprocess crowd in on the legislative process and take away our ability \nto promptly pass important legislation for small businesses in this \ncountry. I regret that the Wellstone provision that would have created \na 3-year $9 million pilot project to build the capacity of community \ndevelopment venture capital firms through research and training and \nmanagement assistance was stripped out without our knowledge or \nconsent. Again, without sort of our consent or participation \nwhatsoever.\n  But let me focus finally, if I may, on underscoring a couple of \naspects about the bipartisanship here. I introduced legislation earlier \nthis year, with my distinguished colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, \nto try to address the lack of adequate funding for one specific service \non which seniors depend, and that is home health care. We both shared a \nbelief--shared by almost all of our colleagues in the Senate--that the \ncrisis in home health care is becoming so glaring that we ought to be \nable to build a bipartisan consensus here to do something about it. And \nwe laid out a sense of how the Senate could do that.\n  Unfortunately, in this legislation, we see a reluctance to try to \nproperly address that home health care component, coupled with the \nnursing home care component--again, in favor of the HMOs themselves \nwhich have cut some 400,000 seniors from coverage in the course of the \nyear.\n  We laid out the picture for the Senate: Funding for home health care \nhas plummeted since enactment of the BBA of 1997. The original cuts in \nhome health care payments included in the BBA totaled $16 billion, but \nestimates now show that the industry will sustain a cut in Medicare \nreimbursement of more than 4 times that--$69 billion. According to CBO, \nMedicare spending on home health care dropped 45 percent in the last \ntwo fiscal years--from $17.5 billion in 1998 to $9.7 billion in 1999--\nfar beyond the original amount of savings sought by the BBA. The \ndraconian cuts in home health care services mirror the cuts in funding \nfor hospitals and nursing homes. These cuts have created a crisis in \nour country.\n  And many of us worked across the aisles to do something about it. But \nwe didn't have a seat at the table when the BBRA was put together.\n  And I ask you, has the Majority responded adequately to this crisis? \nHave they provided, in the BBRA, sufficient funds to strengthen our \nlocal hospitals, nursing homes and home health agencies. No, they have \nnot.\n  What, then, in spite of the obvious needs for remedies, what do the \nRepublicans, do with the $30 billion in funding that they provide in \nthe BBRA? Who benefits from this restoration of funding? Would you \nbelieve that the primary recipients of the increased Medicare funds are \nHMOs? That's right, the same HMOs who have dropped, this year alone, \n400,000 seniors from their health plans because they could not turn a \nprofit caring for the aged. The same HMOs that fight tooth-and-nail \nagainst adopting a Patient Bill of Rights which would ensure Americans \nhave basic rights to quality health care.\n  The $30 billion in Medicare this add-back package is too heavily \ntargeted at HMOs. Over the first 5 years, one-third of all of the \nrelief in this bill goes to HMOs; over the second 5 years one-half of \nthe relief goes to HMOs.\n  It is unconscionable to bolster Medicare funds for HMOs at the \nexpense of our community hospitals, nursing homes, and home health \nagencies--providers that do not pick-up and leave a community just \nbecause they are not making a profit. HMOs' treatment of seniors has \nbeen deplorable--having dropped 400,000 from their plans this year--and \nshould not be rewarded.\n  Yet that's all this bill does--and my hope is that after this bill is \nvetoed, when Congress returns, that we'll be able to do in home health \ncare relief what we should have been doing all along--providing a \nmeaningful lifeline to these home health care agencies which make such \ndifference in the lives of our seniors.\n  Vaccines for the New Millennium Act--Omitted from Final Tax Package.\n  I want to also talk about an issue that I have worked on for 2 years, \nin one of the best bipartisan efforts I have been a part of in my 16 \nyears here.\n  Democrats and Republicans have negotiated together for the past 2 \nyears to create a strong bipartisan bill to provide assistance with the \ndevelopment and purchase of vaccines for AIDS, tuberculosis, and \nmalaria.\n  I sat down with Bill Frist, with the distinguished Chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms, and with numerous colleagues \non the Democratic side who wanted to address a global crisis having an \nextraordinary impact particularly on sub-Saharan Africa.\n  The Administration was strongly supportive of our efforts--as were \nour colleagues in the House.\n  And yet the Vaccines for the New Millennium Act was dropped from this \nconference report.\n  Let me just share with you what our legislation would have done--\nlegislation dropped in favor of poison pill measures opposed by many \nmembers on both sides of the aisle:\n  We aimed to provide a 30 percent tax credit on R into vaccines \nagainst malaria, TB, AIDS and any other disease which kills more than \none million people per year. This provision expanded and targeted the \nexisting R tax credit.\n  It would also provide a tax credit on the sales of vaccines against \nmalaria, TB and AIDS. Vaccine manufacturers would receive a 100 percent \ncredit on the value of their sale of vaccine to qualified international \nhealth organizations, like UNICEF, for distribution to developing \ncountries.\n  Let me emphasize again why we believed it was so critical to act now. \nThere is great need for further vaccine research. Every year, malaria, \nTB and AIDS kill more than 7 million people. Preventive vaccines are \nour best hope to bring these destructive worldwide epidemics under \ncontrol. The NIH is conducting vital research at the basic science \nlevel, but private sector pharmaceutical companies have the lion's\n\n[[Page S11201]]\n\nshare of expertise in bringing vaccines to the market place. But the \nmarket fails in the case of vaccines against diseases which strike \nprimarily the developing world. This measure would have addressed this \nmarket failure by reducing the high cost of R as well as by creating \na market for the vaccines once they are developed. The American Public \nHealth Association, the Global Health Council, AIDS Action, the \nElizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy \nCoalition, the Alliance for Microbicide Development and the President's \nAdvisory on HIV/AIDS all support the measure.\n  And yet it is nowhere to be found in a tax package that found room \nfor all sorts of complicated tax cuts for those who need them the least \nin our society--while ignoring the needs of an entire continent \nteetering on the brink of being entirely wiped out.\n  Our politics can be better than this. We can address the real needs \nof a country in Medicare, in the health care crisis of our nation, in \nthe global pandemic of AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria--or we can play \npolitics.\n  This bill is headed for a veto. And it deserves it.\n  The American people deserve better than this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first, for the interest of all Senators, I \nknow they are wondering when a vote or votes will occur. It is \nanticipated that there will be at least a couple, maybe three or four \nvotes, within the next 2 or 3 hours. We are not certain exactly what \ntime that will occur, but I will try to get it started shortly so we \ncan get to the votes that are needed.\n  For instance, once again we are going to need to set up a process so \nwe can get a vote on the very important bankruptcy legislation. As a \nresult of trying to get on the tax bill yesterday, I had to set aside \nan action that had been taken earlier on the bankruptcy reform, and it \nis my intention still to try to file cloture on that to try to get that \nvery important legislation addressed before the Senate completes its \nwork.\n  Also, we would need to vote on the continuing resolution that would \ntake us over into tomorrow.\n  Also, we would possibly need to move to proceed to the D.C. \nappropriations conference report and the Commerce-State-Justice \nconference report. Within a few minutes we will try to get those \nstarted.\n  Mr. President, as to what has been said last night and this morning, \nit has been interesting. You know, the American people understand this \nis a political season and that tempers get a little short, people get a \nlittle desperate in their actions, and I think that begins at the White \nHouse with the President. I have tried to communicate with the \nPresident, but it is not always easy. He was in New York City the night \nbefore last. He was playing golf yesterday afternoon. He did return the \ncall I made to him yesterday afternoon, even though I placed the call \nthe day before to talk about some of this. But he has written this \nletter threatening a veto.\n  So much of this is complaints about procedure, complaints about \n``inside baseball,'' complaints about what may not be in the bill. Let \nme say to the American people some very important things they need to \nhear. Let's not get into all the brush of the way we do business around \nhere. Let's talk about the result.\n  First of all, some people may be surprised to learn--some people may \nnot even like it--but 80 percent to 90 percent of this bill has been \nrequested by the President of the United States. He wants these things, \nand they have been negotiated with the administration. There have been \nnegotiations between the House and Senate. Once again, that is \nprocedure. But let me assure the American people there are a lot of \nthings in here that he wanted that I don't particularly like. Let me \nalso say there are some things that were taken out at his specific \nrequest.\n  When you get down and analyze his complaints, it is because he \ndoesn't think we did quite enough to suit him on this school bond \nconstruction tax credit. There are a lot of people over here who do not \nthink that what we have done should be in this bill. But there was an \neffort made to accommodate a lot of different thinking. But he is not \nopposed to what is in here necessarily; he just wants more.\n\n  On the Medicare adjustments, lots of people have had input on that. \nThe House of Representatives had an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote on \nthat subject. I don't know exactly what it was, but probably 300 or \nmore for the Medicare adjustments. The Finance Committee reported it \nout, I believe it was 19-0. I will clarify for the record these exact \nvotes. So there has been an awful lot of bipartisanship.\n  But let's not get all wrapped up in that. Let's look at what is in \nthe bill. Let's look at what is in the bill that is overwhelmingly \ngood, that everybody is for, and we are reduced to complaining about \nhow it got here.\n  Once again, It's the old saying we are going to defeat the good--no, \nwe are going to defeat the excellent because we do not like the \nprocedure or because it is not perfect or everything that the President \nwants. We are a coequal branch. He should not expect, and he will not \nget, 100 percent of what he wants. No President will--none. But we \nworked with him. When you get 80 or 90 percent of what you want, then \nmost people say that is pretty good. He sits over there or in \nCalifornia or New York and says: Give me everything.\n  Let me talk to the American people about what is good about this \nbill. Let's not get into the politics and the procedure and all that is \nhappening. Let us just go down the list and let's talk a little bit \nabout what is included.\n  Who among us is opposed to the IRA and pension reform provisions in \nthis bill? Who thinks we should not raise IRA contributions up to \n$5,000 per year?\n  Who thinks we should not increase contribution limits for 401(k)s, \n403(b)s and 457 plans from $10,000 to $15,000? And, by the way, with a \nlot of bipartisan requests, another $5,000 I believe is available for \npeople over 50 for these 401(k) and other plans. There are some 50 \nmodifications in this bill with regard to IRAs and pensions. We want to \nencourage people to save, don't we? Who is opposed to this?\n  By the way, unfortunately, it has limits. This is really targeted at \nmiddle-income and low-income people to encourage savings. The chairman \nof the Finance Committee has become the hero of the IRA proposals, the \nRoth IRA. Here again, we take one more small step to give people a \nlittle opportunity to save for their needs, for their children, without \nthe Government saying: Oh, we will tell you how you may do that and we \nwill limit it. So I think there are pretty good provisions in there.\n  There is small business tax relief for the one group left in America \nthat may save us, the small business men and women, those young \nentrepreneurs, men and women and minorities who take a chance, people \nwho start the little restaurant, as the Senator from Nebraska did. He \nwent out there; he found out about the restaurant business--it is \ntough. You have to get people hired. You have insurance costs. You have \ncrime. You have management problems. You have food spoilage. It is \nendless. Bless their hearts.\n  So we do a little something for small business men and women. I do \nnot apologize for that. My only complaint is we do not do enough. The \nridiculousness of the request from the administration that we take out \na provision that would have eliminated the .02 percent Federal \nunemployment tax surtax--it doesn't take out the FUTA tax, just the so-\ncalled surtax that was temporary, just stuck it on the small business \nmen and women to boost this fund which I understand now has $22 billion \nin it.\n  So we had a proposal to take off that little .02. That is something \nthat will actually help the small business man and woman who is working \non the margins, barely making it, a little extra they can keep that is \nnot needed in this $22 billion trust fund.\n  Then the tip credit. The President threatened to veto this bill over \nthe tip credit issue. He is wrong. The Senator from Nebraska knows that \nwas a mistake. These are people who never had another job, couldn't get \nanother job. This is a little help for the people who are working on \ntips. My Lord, we are taxing tips. If you work hard and you get a \nbonus, you pay extra. If you work hard, you do a really good job, and \nyou get a little extra tip, you pay a little extra. The whole concept \nis ridiculous. \n\n[[Page S11202]]\n\nBut in an effort to accommodate that, in a conversation I had with the \nPresident himself, we took out the FUTA and the tip credit. I apologize \nto small business men and women. I apologize to the workers out there \nbusing those tables. That was unfortunate, but it was taken out at the \nspecific request of the President of the United States.\n\n  I wanted those taxes taken out, but he would not let us do it. So in \nthis spirit of cooperation--there is so much rain and so many dark \nclouds here about how we do not have more cooperation. Next year, thank \ngoodness, we are going to have a different President. Hopefully, we \nwill have a better atmosphere around here. Maybe we can work together. \nI believe George W. Bush means that, believes it, and will reach out \nand try to bring us together. This is a classic case of where we tried \nto accommodate the President of the United States, and he writes this \nletter threatening his veto. He may veto it, but the American people \nare going to know who did what needed to be done and who vetoed it.\n  We do have this package of small business tax relief that has been \nnegotiated by Chairman Roth, Chairman Archer, a lot of input from \nDemocrats in the House and Senate, and the administration. It also \nincludes above-the-line deductions for health insurance for employees \nin small businesses. This is bad?\n  What about that restaurant owner who provides insurance for his \nsupervisory personnel, but he or she cannot provide it for all of their \nworkers because it would just eat up all the margin of profit he has? \nHere you can allow the employees to deduct the cost of their health \ninsurance. This is a good idea. This would help entry-level workers, \nminority workers, people who are carrying the load in this country get \na little break on health insurance. But, oh, no, ``We don't really like \nthat idea because it is above-the-line deductions''--once again, \nexplain that to the man and woman down there working in the trenches--\n``We ought to have a credit or something.'' This is good, and it would \nhelp people in that low-income area. By the way, we have been hearing \nall year long that we have to have a minimum wage increase. A minimum \nwage increase is in here: $1 over 2 years, raising it to $6.15. It is \nin there. Is the President against that?\n  Then also there is a provision in here called community renewal. This \nwould allow rural areas, poor areas to have a chance for economic \ndevelopment, to have a chance to recruit a little business. The \nMississippi Delta pops into my mind: poor people struggling to get a \nlittle infrastructure, improve their education, get a few jobs in the \narea.\n  Enterprise zones: There are 40 of those, 40 of the new community \nrenewals. This is a deal, by the way, asked for by the President and \nthe Speaker. I had reservations about a lot of the provisions, but we \nworked through that. This was negotiated with the administration \ninterminably for weeks and months. It is in here. Some people on my \nside think this is not a good idea, but I supported it.\n  The President made a deal with the Speaker; that is, President \nClinton, in case you do not quite understand, and Speaker Denny Hastert \nmade a deal they wanted to do it and, by the way, supported by J.C. \nWatts passionately. This is a way we can help rural and poor \ncommunities. Let's do this; let's do this. I have been in meetings when \nthere was an effort to kill this until J.C. Watts spoke up and \neverybody went silent. It is in here. Are you against that?\n\n  I have tried on this floor for weeks to move the foreign sales credit \nfix for WTO compliance. It came out of the Finance Committee \nunanimously. I have asked unanimous consent to move it. For some \nstrange reason, it has been objected to by the Democrats in the Senate. \nWhen you are in the leadership, you have to do some of these things, \nand Senator Reid had to object on behalf of somebody; he would not \nobject. It has been objected to.\n  What are we going to do here? On November 1, we will have a problem \nwith our European allies. I do not think they are doing very good, \nfrankly, complying with WTO, and they are not reacting to sanctions. I \nam not going to cry alligator tears over the Europeans and WTO, but \nthat provision is in this bill. Is the President going to veto that? \nThose are four broad categories and a lot of subcompartments about \nwhich I have talked.\n  The Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, has been very supportive of \nthis concept of encouraging adoption. We should encourage more adoption \nfor people who are not only wealthy but people in the lower and middle-\nincome area. This bill doubles the tax credit for adoption to $10,000, \nI believe is the number. Is that not good? No, no, that is good.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question on that?\n  Mr. LOTT. On that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Just on that provision.\n  Mr. LOTT. I did not ask anybody to yield on your side. You all talked \nfor about an hour. I will be glad to respond later because I know you \ncare about that and you want to make sure it is available to others.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I wanted to work on that. I told the President the other \nday: Mr. President, if there is something in here you don't \nparticularly like, we can change that maybe in the next bill. Mr. \nPresident, if there is something more you want, let's add it in the \nnext bill. This is not the be all to end all. This is not the end of \nthe world. This is a giant step for mankind though. And he is going to \nveto it because he does not get every last dot and tittle that he \nwants? I do not think that is defensible.\n  Let me go on down the list. For years, I have been an advocate under \npressure from the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, for farm savings \naccounts. The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee does not like \nthis sort of thing. He says it will never end. We have savings accounts \nfor education, for medical expenses, now for farms. My attitude is, why \nnot? I never met an incentive to encourage people to save for their own \nneeds I did not like, and to encourage farmers to save a little for the \nbad times because, more than anybody else, they know the good times \nwhen the crops are abundant, weather is good, prices are fine; they do \nfine. And then rain, sleet, snow, drought, locusts--they have to deal \nwith all of it. Allow them to save a little for the bad times. Is that \na bad idea? No, that is a good idea.\n  Deduction for computer donations to schools and libraries: Businesses \nand industries, big and small, are willing to give their 2- and 3-year-\nold computers to schools and libraries to help with programs such as \nPower Up. Let's power up these kids. Let's use these used computers to \nteach them to read and to become computer literate. The Senator from \nMichigan, Mr. Abraham, has been relentless in pushing for that. The \namazing thing to me is, why would anybody not be for that? This is \ngood. That is in this bill.\n\n  Deduction for long-term health insurance and long-term health \nexpenses: This is an interesting category. We have been worried \nlegitimately about the people who are worried about the long-term needs \nthey have with their health. We want to do something about it. We do it \nin this bill, but when I talked to the President: Gee, I really prefer \na credit as opposed to a deduction, but if you make the deduction high \nenough, maybe it will be OK.\n  When I talked to him yesterday, he said: Yes, you did go up higher. \nWe are going to nitpick a gnat to death. Should we have long-term \nhealth insurance deductions or not? We have an opportunity here. The \nPresident is going to veto it, flitter it away. I do not understand \nthat.\n  I have taken a lot of unkind commentary from my colleagues on this \nside of the aisle about the Amtrak bonds credit. The Senator from \nMassachusetts knows I have tried to be helpful to Amtrak. I believe in \nAmerica, if we are going to be a modern nation and lead the world, we \nneed a national rail passenger system. I think we need it, I think we \ncan have it, and I think it can be self-supportive. Maybe not. I think \nit can.\n  I supported Amtrak reform. I stood on this floor--the Senator \nremembers--and helped make that happen with some opposition. There were \npeople ready to pull the plug and say: Goodbye, adios, Amtrak. I do not \nthink that is wise.\n  I made a commitment, and I will keep it some day: If we have done \neverything we can to get Amtrak in the position of providing the \nservice, making ends meet and paying for themselves, if we can get that \ndone, great. If\n\n[[Page S11203]]\n\nwe cannot, at some point, we have to say Americans do not support a \nnational rail passenger system and we pull the plug.\n  I do not like tax credits, particularly. I prefer deductions. You can \nargue this is not good, and I have heard that argument from the Senator \nfrom Texas and others.\n  Again, Senator Roth from Delaware has made this one of his highest \npriorities and so has, by the way--once again, proving the \nbipartisanship of this legislation--the Senator from New York, Mr. \nMoynihan, the ranking member on the Finance Committee. People come to \nme and say: How in the world could you let that in there?\n\n  First of all, I am not a dictator. And secondly, how can anybody, any \nleadership person, tell the chairman of the Finance Committee and the \nranking member of the Finance Committee that they cannot have in this \nbill one of their highest priorities, the Amtrak issue? So it is in \nhere. Is that bad? No. I think it is pretty good.\n  We repealed the diesel barge tax. We have modes of transportation \nother than Amtrak that are kind of having a hard time--rail and barge. \nWe have here a 4.3-cent tax we dumped on them. We ought to take it off. \nWe ought to take it off of the automobile gasoline also.\n  We expanded the qualified zone academy bonds for school construction. \nThe President says he wants this. I think we are starting down a track \nthat is not going to be very healthy where we eventually build all \nschools in America with Federal funds. That is where we are headed. \nThat is where a lot of people want us to be. I do not think that is \ngood. I think that ought to be done at the local level.\n  I am willing to give them an incentive through bonds, where they have \nto pay the principal, and they get some consideration on the interest. \nI am willing to do that. But what some people want, once again, is they \nwant everything in school, in education, run from Washington. That is \nwhat really is at stake.\n  Once we start building schools, local schools, from Federal funds, \nlet me tell you, Mississippi will have the nicest, newest schools in \nall of America--all of America--because we have more poor people and \ngreater needs probably than anybody. But I do not think we should just \ntotally take over education.\n  I still trust parents, teachers, administrators, and students at the \nlocal level. I do not trust bureaucrats in Washington at the Department \nof Education or the IRS or anywhere else. So that is some of the good \nstuff in this bill.\n  Let me also point out--and I did not even get very much into the \nMedicare add-backs. Everything says we need them. What about hospitals? \nWhat about rural hospitals? What about home health care? What about \nhospice? What about managed care? What about the nursing homes? They \nneed some help. This bill provides that.\n  There has been a lot of bipartisan input on that. If I had my \ndruthers, I would mix it a little differently. I would put in more for \nhospitals and rural hospitals, a little less for probably some other \ncategories, but it is not just about Mississippi hospitals; it is about \nMassachusetts hospitals; it is about managed care facilities in New \nMexico; it is about nursing homes in Kentucky. You have to try to find \na blend. You also have to try to keep it from exploding totally out of \ncontrol because it could be $50 billion, $60 billion, $70 billion. I \nthink this bill is between $28 and $30 billion. It is enough to do what \nis needed. And it has the endorsement of many organizations.

Bill Thomas,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Health, House Ways and Means \n         Committee, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Thomas: On behalf of the 5,000 members \n     of the American Hospital Association (AHA), I am writing to \n     express our views regarding the ``Beneficiary Improvement and \n     Protection Act of 2000'' (BIPA). We believe this legislation \n     will take another step forward in addressing the unintended \n     consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA). \n     Consequently, as we approach the remaining hours of the \n     congressional session, we are urging Members to vote in favor \n     of this legislation, and have recommended that the President \n     not veto the legislation.\n       As we understand the provisions of the legislation, it \n     includes a number of provisions that provide much needed \n     relief to hospitals and health systems throughout the \n     country. Such provisions include: a full market basket \n     inflationary update in FY2001, and elimination of half of the \n     reduction in FY2002; temporary elimination of the reductions \n     in Medicaid DSH state allocations in FY2001 and 2002, and \n     allow the program to grow with inflation in those years; \n     increase the adjustment for Indirect Medical Education to \n     6.5% in 2001 and 6.375% in FY2002, and establish an 85% \n     national floor for Direct Graduate Medical Education \n     payments; equalize payments to rural hospitals under Medicare \n     DSH; increased flexibility for critical access, sole \n     community, and Medicare dependent hospitals; increased bad \n     debt payments from 55% to 70% for all beneficiaries; and a \n     full market basket update for outpatient hospital services.\n       The bill will also provide relief to home health agencies \n     and skilled nursing facilities. As our members operate \n     approximately one-third of the home health agencies and one \n     fourth of the skilled nursing facilities, relief in this area \n     is also vitally necessary, and is an important feature in the \n     bill. In addition, the bill includes important beneficiary \n     protections, particularly the execrated reduction in \n     beneficiary coinsurance for hospital outpatient services.\n       At the same time, we are disappointed that certain \n     provisions we have advocated, such a full market basket \n     increase in FY2002 for both inpatient and outpatient hospital \n     services, complete elimination of the impact of the BBA's \n     reductions in Medicaid DSH, and maintaining the IME \n     adjustment of 6.5% beyond FY2001, were not included. We are \n     also concerned that additional reductions in the hospital \n     inpatient market basket in 2003 were included in the bill. We \n     look forward to working with you in the next Congress to \n     achieve these additional changes.\n       Again, we appreciate your efforts to achieve additional BBA \n     relief this year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Rick Pollack,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. The list includes the Federation of American Hospitals, the \nNational Association of Community Health Centers, the National \nAssociation of Long Term Hospitals, the National Association of \nChildren's Hospitals, the National Association of\n\n[[Page S11204]]\n\nRural Health Clinics, the Mississippi Hospital Association--very \nimportant--the National Association for Home Care, the Alliance for \nQuality Nursing Home Care, the American Cancer Society, the Susan G. \nKomen Breast Cancer Foundation, the National Kidney Foundation, the \nJuvenile Diabetes Foundation, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, \nthe American Association of Blood Banks, and so on down the line.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question on that?\n  Is the Senator saying that every one of those groups were presented \nwith and have read the conference report and are supporting the \nconference report?\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand those associations are familiar with how this \nMedicare add-back provision would affect them, and they are supporting \nthis conference report.\n  Mr. KERRY. Just for clarification.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have a letter from the American Hospital Association--I \nbelieve that is correct; yes, here it is--\n\n       On behalf of 5,000 members of the American Hospital \n     Association, I am writing to express our views regarding the \n     ``Beneficiary Improvement and Protection Act of 2000.'' We \n     believe this legislation will take another step forward in \n     addressing the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget \n     Act of 1997. Consequently, as we approach the remaining hours \n     of the congressional session, we are urging Members to vote \n     in favor of this legislation, and have recommended that the \n     President not veto the legislation.\n\n  That is dated October 26, 2000, signed by Rick Pollack, executive \nvice president of the American Hospital Association.\n  So you do not like the mix. You think maybe there is too much going \nto managed care. But when you help hospitals and rural hospitals, there \nis a passthrough provision that adds to the managed care provision.\n  You do have people in the Senate and from all over the country who \nbelieve the Medicare+Choice is a very important provision. They worked \nvery hard in advancing their provisions--Democrats and Republicans.\n  So while it is not perfect--if we took that same $30 billion and gave \nit to a Senator from Wyoming, and then a Senator from Pennsylvania, \nthey would come up with a different mix--after a lot of work, this is \nclose to being fair to everybody. And again, it is not the end of the \nroad. There will be another opportunity to work on it further.\n  I know the Senator from Idaho had wanted me to yield, perhaps on the \nadoption credit, or any comments he would like to make.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes. I do appreciate the majority leader speaking to that.\n  I saw the Senator from California wishing to make a comment on it. I \ncochair the Adoption Caucus with Senator Landrieu. We worked together \nthis year to change the character of the adoption tax credit.\n  We did not get all we wanted--and I know the Senator has been out on \nthe floor speaking of concern about it--but we got a great deal. We \nwent from a $5,000 to a $10,000 tax credit for a normal adoption. But \nmost importantly, we focused our efforts this year on children of \nspecial needs, I say to our majority leader. And there we went from a \n$6,000 to a $12,000 tax credit, and we phased it in more rapidly than \nwe did the normal adoption.\n\n  But what is important here is the character of the adoptions. For \nchildren with special needs, oftentimes their costs up to adoption are \nless than normal children because the Government fronts a lot of that \ncost. To parents adopting children of special needs, it comes after the \nadoption. We tried to characterize this provision a little differently. \nAnd we will do that in the coming year.\n  No, we did not get all we wanted. But for any Senator to say it is \nnot good to double the adoption credit on children with special needs, \nand to phase it in faster than we are doing for the children of normal \nadoptions, somehow is really not understanding what we are \naccomplishing.\n  This Senate, in the last 5 years, has taken a quantum leap to allow \nAmericans to form families through adoption and to render tax credits. \nWe did not even recognize it a few years ago. People forming families \nthe normal way could write off the expenses of their pregnancy and the \nbirthing of children, but people spending $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 to \nadopt a child were on their own. We have said no to that.\n  Truly, for these children of special need, who are oftentimes almost \nunwanted, we have now said to loving and caring people, we are going to \ngive you a $12,000 tax credit, and we are going to accelerate it.\n  Come on, folks. We ought to be cheering about this for the formation \nof families through adoption. This is a major step in a loving and \ncaring direction.\n  No, Mary Landrieu and Larry Craig did not get everything they wanted, \nbut there is not a Senator on this floor who got everything they wanted \nthis year. But let me tell you, I am voting for this bill on that alone \nbecause it shows that this Senate cares about children and about \nfamilies who want to form through adoption.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I cannot yield. This is the time of the majority leader.\n  But I think it is important, Mr. Leader, to clarify that. Let's be \nproud of what we have done. It is a major and positive step for caring \nand loving families who want children through adoption.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know a lot of Senators would like to \nspeak. I also know we need to again have some votes here in a \nreasonable period of time. So I will try to get an agreement on how we \ncan get some further comments and then move to a vote. I know the \nSenator from California had wanted me to yield on that particular \npoint.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senator Landrieu and Senator Craig have worked so closely \ntogether. I am not an expert on that. I just saw Senator Landrieu \ndeeply disturbed and upset in her view that rather than helping the \npeople who adopt the most difficult situations, in other words, \nchildren who are disabled, children in foster care, we are going in the \nother direction.\n  I only want to say, in good will, that it looks as if the President \nwill veto this bill for the many reasons we talked about. I am not \ngoing to, believe me, go into that. But when he does that, maybe we can \ngo back and fix this problem so we can really celebrate passage.\n  I am only reflecting Senator Landrieu's distress that she feels that \nthe toughest cases here are not being helped. That is all I wanted to \nsay.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's comments on that. \nIt is something we should work on. We have made progress. It is a shame \nwe won't have it for the next 3 or 4 months. If the President insists \non vetoing this bill, then I guess we will come back next year and have \na chance to rework this whole area. I presume the tax bill next year, \nno matter who is elected President, will look different than this one. \nMaybe it would be better from my perspective, fairer overall, but \nprovisions such as that could be worked on next year. I just hate that \nthere are going to be adoptions that won't occur if the President \nvetoes this bill, that would occur if they had this additional credit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, the \nfollowing Senators be recognized for times allotted, and that I be \nrecognized immediately following those Senators: Senator Gramm of Texas \nfor up to 15 minutes and Senator Wyden of Oregon for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, all I am trying to do is to make sure that \nSenators who have been waiting to speak will have an opportunity, but \nalso we have a vote that we need to begin pretty soon. I would rather \nnot do that until Senators have had an opportunity.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the distinguished majority leader. I am happy to \nallow Senator Gramm to speak before me. I would have to have unanimous \nconsent that at the conclusion of Senator Gramm's remarks, I be \nrecognized next to speak, and that I be allowed to address several \nissues before there are any votes that go forward. I am concerned about \na number of issues. As the majority leader knows, I have dedicated my \nservice here to bipartisanship. I happen to agree with the \ndistinguished majority leader that no one\n\n[[Page S11205]]\n\never gets everything they want in a package. Senator Kerry showed that \nDemocrats are willing to bend over backward to be bipartisan in areas \nsuch as small business. But on a number of issues that concern this \nSenator, there has not been that level of bipartisanship. I am \ncompelled to object and will need to speak at some length this morning \non the several issues that are important to me.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will withhold a second, I think the way I \nhad asked for that consent is that he would be recognized immediately \nfollowing Senator Gramm. I was trying to ascertain how much time he \nmight need.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If the majority leader will yield further, I am going to \nneed the time that I intend to consume because one of the issues I am \ngoing to talk about is one of the most sensitive bioethical decisions \nof our time. It was stuffed into this legislation a little before \nmidnight, when a handful of conferees were meeting, and has never been \nconsidered on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's explanation. I \nyield to the Senator from Massachusetts for a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, with respect to the request, we would be \nhappy to try to cooperate in terms of order and allowing people to \nspeak. I am constrained on behalf of the minority leader not to agree \nat this point to some kind of limitation on time for our colleagues. If \nwe could perhaps agree to this: I did want a couple of moments as \nmanager to respond to the majority leader's comments. I will not take a \nlong time at all. I know the Senator from Texas has been here and wants \nto speak. I think it would be fair to perhaps establish an order. If \nthe Senator from Texas wants to live with the time, fine; I know the \nSenator from Oregon is not prepared to at this moment in time. We can \nat least establish an order.\n  Mr. LOTT. I wonder if we could do this: Maybe if the Senator from \nMassachusetts would like a couple minutes to respond, I think that is \nfair because he has some comments to respond to what I had to offer. \nThen we could go ahead and have a vote on an issue on which we need to \nproceed. Then when that is over or during that vote, we can work on an \norder to make sure everybody has a chance to be heard, the time that \nthey need to speak, and we can continue on, having had one vote \ndisposed of.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, again, on behalf of the minority leader, I \nwould be constrained to object.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I object.\n\n\n                       high speed rail investment\n\n Mr. HELMS. I commend the able Senator from Delaware (Mr. Roth) \nfor including the High Speed Rail Investment Act in this tax package. \nI'm glad he agress that we need to develop a national intercity \npassenger rail system.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) for his \nsupport for these provisions. Intercity passenger rail service is a key \nelement of our Nation's multi-model transportation system.\n  Mr. HELMS. As the Senator from Delaware knows, the Southeast High \nSpeed Rail Corridor, designated in title 23 U.S.C., Section 104(d)(2), \nis a vital part of the national transportation system. Within the \ncorridor the Charlotte-Greensboro-Raleigh segment plays a crucial and \nessential role in linking the Northeast Corridor with other corridors.\n  New modern world class stations in Raleigh and Charlotte as well as \nrail infrastructure investments linked to the Greensboro station will \nenhance the safety and efficiency of the system. It is my understanding \nthat station investments are directly eligible projects under the \nproposed legislation.\n  Mr. ROTH. You are correct. Station projects such as those you \ndescribed on the Charlotte-Greensboro-Raleigh line are important \nexamples of critical investments envisioned in this legislation.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chairman and commend him for his \nleadership.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I now withdraw the motion to proceed to S. \n2557.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The motion is withdrawn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11205-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 2000--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The report was printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nOctober 11, 2000.)\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask the minority, and I am sure Senator \nKerry is prepared to respond to this, if they are in a position to set \na vote on the pending bankruptcy conference report after an hour or two \nof debate. I yield the floor for a response to that question from the \nSenator from Massachusetts on behalf of the leadership.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, at this time I \nhave to object.\n\n[[Page S11206]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I certainly expected that. I know there are Senators who do \nobject to that. This is very important legislation which needs to be \nenacted into the law. I appreciate the procedural cooperation we have \nhad.\n  The bill has been debated for weeks, and many amendments have been \noffered on both sides. Minimum wage was offered, as a matter of fact, \nto this bill while it was pending on the Senate floor, but minimum wage \nnow is going to be put in the tax relief package we have been \ndiscussing.\n  The bankruptcy bill ultimately passed by a vote of 83-14, so I will \nfile cloture on this bill probably Sunday or Monday so we can get to a \ncloture vote and complete its action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11206-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NATIONAL ENERGY SECURITY OF 2000--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I also ask unanimous consent \nthat the vote occur on adoption of H.J. Res. 117 at 3:15 p.m. and \nparagraph 4 of rule XII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Therefore, the next vote will occur at 3:15 this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, for the information of Senators who are interested in \nthe schedule, it is expected that the vote at 3:15 p.m. will be the \nlast vote of the day. However, at this time, in view of the need for \ncontinuing resolutions, unless some different agreement can be worked \nout, we will be expected to have votes on Saturday and on Sunday with \ncontinuing resolutions.\n  Of course, there is serious work underway right now on the matters of \ndisagreement. I note Saturday is the sabbath for a number of our \ncolleagues and for observant Jews, and Sunday is my sabbath. I prefer \nwe get a CR that will take us to Monday while we continue to work, but \nwe have not been able to enter into that agreement yet. If necessary, \nwe will be here and voting on CRs on Saturday and on Sunday. It is my \nexpectation that vote will come late in the afternoon or early evening \non Saturday.\n  Also, again, Senator Stevens from the Appropriations Committee and \nthe appropriators are meeting right now on the final details of the \nLabor-HHS bill. There is also some discussion about how we can move \nsome of the problem issues out of the CSJ bill that has been reported \nout of conference and passed by the House. Corrections or changes, if \nagreed to, could be entered into the Labor-HHS bill.\n  I do want you to know the appropriators are busily working in their \nmagical way, and I am sure at sometime a cone of honey will be \nproduced, or maybe that is the wrong terminology to use, but they are \ngetting closer to agreements. I hope it is something that can be \nsigned, or I hope it is something I can vote for, too. Both of those \nare undetermined at this point. I know Senator Kerry wants to make \nfurther comments about an earlier issue. We now have 3 hours and 15 \nminutes to talk about the CR or other issues Senators wish.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will yield since I invoked the name of the distinguished \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Mr. STEVENS. My name came up as a magician. I am Aladdin. I rub the \nlamp.\n  Mr. LOTT. Very good. That is right, and I hope you will start rubbing \nit very fast.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am supposed to bring you out of the lamp.\n  Mr. LOTT. All right.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have to inform the Senate that if we \nfinish the Health and Human Services bill today--we are in good-faith \nnegotiations, and we expect to be quite late today--that bill could not \nbe finished in terms of its reading out and printing and being \navailable to both sides until Monday afternoon at the earliest.\n  I hope we can get some consideration from the administration and from \neveryone to understand that. We would have two sessions--one on \nSaturday and one on Sunday. Some people work on their sabbath and some \npeople do not. We have a staff who will be working, in spite of that, \naround the clock to read the legislation. There are some 40 pieces of \nlegislation, in addition to the bill itself, that will be in the Health \nand Human Services bill; at least that will be our recommendation.\n\n  I urge that somehow or another I be allowed to offer an amendment to \nthis continuing resolution and make it Tuesday night. I have told the \nWhite House and OMB that there is no way, even if we finish tonight, \nthat we can take it up tomorrow or take it up Sunday. We will not be \nable to take it up until Monday night. The White House should know \nthat, OMB should know that, and I hope the minority agrees with us.\n  We cannot vote on this bill, the major wrapup piece of legislation, \nuntil, at the earliest in the Senate, Tuesday. The House may be able to \nvote on it Monday night. To argue over a CR that takes us to tomorrow \nand to argue over one that takes us to Sunday and one that takes us to \nMonday, when there is nothing we can do about finishing up this \nCongress, is just demonstrating our inability to deal with reality.\n  I hope the leader will allow me some time today to offer a motion to \namend that CR and make it Tuesday. I have discussed it with the House, \nand they are in session. They can adopt it and send it to the \nPresident. Somehow or another, this idea we can only go day to day and \nwe can produce something tomorrow that we have not finished today, when \nwe have just one bill left which itself cannot be finished until Monday \nnight, I think is foolhardy. I am prepared to challenge the President \nand all of his people to come to reality.\n  The discussions are being held with his people. If we do not finish \nthem tonight, we will finish them tomorrow. If we do not finish them \nuntil tomorrow, it will be Tuesday morning before it is read out.\n  Maybe people do not understand what we do. Each side has a copy of \nthe final provisions. Each reads it through, and we call in the people \nfrom the committees involved to be sure the provisions are correct. \nThen we get together and our staffs read it together, and each makes \ncertain the other has not made any changes in it. And that will not be \nfinished. It will take at least 20 hours of reading to do that. It will \nnot be finished until Monday night.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Alaska, we do not \nquite know what the appropriators do. I am not sure we really want to. \nWe wish you the best because at least all of our schedules are in your \nhands, if not our lives. But I think what the Senator is saying is \neminently reasonable. I urge you to get Senator Byrd to discuss that \nwith the leadership on the other side, and if you talk with Senator \nReid, we will communicate with the administration and hopefully maybe \nby 3:15 p.m. we can take that reasonable action. I certainly would \nsupport it. But we have to get an agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I may respond, I am confident the leader \non our side wants to be as reasonable as possible. The issue on our \nside has been, as we said earlier, the level of progress, No. 1, and \nNo. 2, the question of inclusivity.\n  What the chairman just said suggests there is a lot more inclusivity, \nand I presume reasonable minds will prevail at an appropriate time. A \njudgment has to be made by the administration and the minority leader \nwith the level of progress. I am confident that will happen.\n  If I may continue, Mr. President, for a moment. Would it be \nappropriate at this point in time--Senator Wyden has been waiting for a \nlong time; I know the Senator from Texas has been waiting. I want to \nmake a few comments yielding myself time off our time for a brief \nmoment--I will be brief--at which point, may we have a unanimous \nconsent agreement?\n\n[[Page S11207]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I would ask----\n  Mr. KERRY. I will yield only for the purpose of asking a question.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized, Mr. President, to speak \nfor up to 30 minutes on the continuing resolution when Senator Kerry \nhas completed his comments.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, would the Senator agree that the Senator \nfrom Texas was, in fact, going to precede him?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, might I ask a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. I am willing to yield for a question, but I am trying to \nproceed here, if we can.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Would the Senator from Massachusetts yield for me to \nclarify this?\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield for the purpose of clarification only.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  I was prepared to allow Senator Gramm to speak because the two of us \nwere on the floor at the same time, to speak for 15 minutes, on the \nproviso that I could go next. I would then talk for up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I would modify the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Knowing the subject matter that my colleague from Oregon \nwishes to speak to, I would like to be recognized for 15 minutes, \nfollowing the Senator from Oregon, to respond.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have the right to object. There is a unanimous \nconsent request pending.\n  Mr. KERRY. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to have 20 minutes reserved for me when \nyou are finished--whoever is in the chain, whatever that is.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy, until 3:15, to work out time agreements so \npeople are not standing around. But the way it now appears, it is going \nto be a little unbalanced. We should rotate time wise, not necessarily \nwho is speaking but how much time. We want to work Senator Conrad into \nthis mix.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, could I suggest the following? And I think \nit will meet everybody's needs. At the conclusion of my brief remarks, \nthe Senator from Oregon be recognized, following him, Senator Nickles \nto be recognized, with the time to be selected by the managers for how \nmuch time they allocate, and subsequent to that, someone on our side, \nto be named, to be recognized, and then the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What about the Senator----\n  Mr. KERRY. Afterwards it would come back to this side, and then the \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BOND. Reserving the right to object, apparently there is a lot of \ndiscussion that needs to go on. We need to work out the time. Could we \nask--\n  Mr. KERRY. You control it.\n  Mr. BOND. I know, but could we ask the initial remarks of the Senator \nfrom Oregon and the Senator from Texas to be 15 minutes each, so then \nwe can work out a schedule? We know that we will then be able to \ndevelop the schedule so that all of the important things that people on \nboth sides of the aisle need to say before 3:15 can be said.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon has requested 30 \nminutes. I am prepared to yield him 30 minutes from our time. I think \nwe should each control our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. OK, if our understanding is that the Senator from Oregon \nreceives up to 30 minutes, if you would allocate me up to 30 minutes in \nresponse, and hopefully neither one of us will take that much time, and \nthen you can continue the division of time. Certainly it would be \nappropriate.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.\n  Where are we now with reference to whether the Senator from New \nMexico gets to speak?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico follows on the \nRepublican side after the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. REID. However, I say to Senator Domenici, it would be the \nDemocratic side's turn prior to you.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand. The only thing I am concerned about, if \nyou are going an hour equally divided--3:15 is the vote; isn't it?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President. I think this is not as complicated as we \nare making it. If I could try to simplify it, the unanimous consent \nrequest requires us to alternate to each side. We will go, immediately \nfollowing my comments, to the Senator from Oregon, and then back to the \nmajority side, Senator Nickles, and then back to our side to a person \nto be yet named, and then back to the Republican side to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, and then back to our side, which follows Senator \nGramm. And that is the order with the time to be determined by the \nmanagers on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wonder \nif the manager of the bill, as part of this, would use his efforts with \nreference to how much time each one gets so that at least those we have \nagreed to would be able to speak before 3:15. You can do that, I \nbelieve.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I believe the \nagreement is that between now and 3:15 the time is equally divided. So \nthat would roughly be 3 hours and 10 minutes. So that is an hour and 45 \nminutes for each side. With that understanding, each side has 1 hour 45 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nconsumed to this point not count as equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator putting off the 3:15 vote?\n  Mr. KERRY. No. But I was recognized and therefore I do not want this \nentire colloquy to come from my time. I am asking that the time \ncommence for division.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has to come from somebody's time.\n  Mr. KERRY. It comes equally divided from both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will be very brief. I simply want to respond very \nquickly to the comments made by the distinguished majority leader who \nappropriately cited many items within the legislation that we all ought \nto support. Indeed, that is precisely what I said in the course of my \ncomments. We do support a great deal of what is in the legislation.\n  But what the majority leader never did, in the course of his \ncomments, was address any of the issues we raised with respect to the \nhealth care system, the fundamental fairness, and the issues of \ncontention raised by the President of the United States.\n  He dismissed that rather quickly and cavalierly, suggesting that the \nPresident got a lot of what he wanted. Let me be very precise. Of 119 \nindividual tax provisions in this bill, 35 of them are from the \nPresident's budget; that is 30 percent of the provisions, not the 80 \npercent that the majority leader talked about. Mr. President, and of \nthe $240+ billion in tax cuts in this package, only $48 billion, or 20 \npercent of the total, is from the President's proposals.\n  No one should be misled by the comments of the majority leader to \nbelieve that this is somehow a fair division, and that the President, \nin offering to veto, is not vetoing it on substantive, clear, and \ndistinct differences of policy.\n  Secondly, the majority leader suggested that much was included in \nthis, and this is sort of mostly a bill that is somehow beneficial. \nWhat he neglected to address was the issue that we raised\n\n[[Page S11208]]\n\nabout how this bill came together and what is in it as a total.\n  As a total, it represents, in a sense, a consensus of what the \nmajority wanted to put in. But it was arrived at without discussion \nwith the minority, and so there are whole bills in here that raise very \nsignificant issues.\n  One of them is the issue to which the Senator from Oregon is going to \ntalk. I just want to take about 2 minutes to say something about it.\n  There is, in this tax bill, a whole piece of legislation called the \nPain Relief Promotion Act. My colleagues ought to listen to that title \nvery carefully: Pain Relief Promotion Act. That title is an \nextraordinary, almost cynical, play on words. It completely distorts \nthe notion of what happens in this legislation.\n  First of all, this Pain Relief Promotion Act completely preempts \nState law with respect to the definition of a legitimate medical \npurpose with respect to State medical regulations. The implications of \nthat with respect to this are to require the Drug Enforcement Agency's \nagents to determine whether a physician's prescription of a controlled \nsubstance for pain relief medication was intended to relieve pain or to \nassist in suicide. I hope my colleagues focus on that.\n  The Pain Relief Promotion Act is asking DEA agents to make a judgment \nof intent about what a doctor intended to do in prescribing a \nprescription drug to a patient who is terminally ill in a hospital.\n  Are we seriously going to go down that road and DEA agents to have \nthe potential to provide a 20-year prison sentence for a doctor for \nmaking a judgment about pain medication to an ill patient in a \nhospital? I find that extraordinary. Yet the majority leader tried to \nsuggest on the floor that this is just some innocuous conglomeration of \nlegislation that has no major impact on the lives of Americans, except \n80 percent of it is good and what the President wanted. That is a fight \nworth fighting on the floor of the Senate today.\n  I am not going to go into all the details. I just went through a long \nhospitalization issue with a parent. I know what that pain medication \nmeant for cancer. I know how difficult it was in the hospital to get \nthe proper pain medication, to have people comfortable with what was \nbeing dealt. If we suddenly layer that kind of legal structure over the \ndelivery of medical care in America, we are taking an extraordinary \nstep that at least ought to be properly debated on the floor of the \nSenate in the context of hearings, the process, and so forth.\n  A recent New England Journal of Medicine article said the following:\n\n       If the Pain Relief Promotion Act becomes law, it will \n     almost certainly discourage doctors from providing adequate \n     doses of medicine to relieve the symptoms of dying patients.\n\n  That does not belong in a tax bill, conglomerated in a room without \nthe consent of Democrats. That is why we are here. That is why we are \nfighting about this legislation.\n  My final comment is, with respect to the tax components of this, \nmajor components of fairness were stripped out of this bill. The \nmajority leader talked about how important it is to provide savings for \nAmericans. Yes, it is important. There is not one of us on this side of \nthe aisle who won't vote to encourage Americans to save money. There is \nnot one of us who does not support a 401(k) program. But when we are \nmaking a choice about how much money we can allocate to people based on \nthe overall amounts of money available and that choice was made by the \nRepublicans alone to encourage 401(k)s to the exclusion of middle- and \nlow-income Americans to be able to save, that is a fight worth \nfighting. That is a question of fundamental fairness.\n  The 401(k)s are terrific for lawyers and doctors and high-income \npeople, but the kind of Americans we were trying to reach--at the \n$30,000, $25,000, $20,000 income level--have a lot harder time gaining \nbenefit from a 401(k). What the President had in his proposals was a \ncredit that would have gone directly to those hard-working Americans. \nThat was stripped out. That is why we are here now raising these issues \nregarding this legislation. It is a question of fundamental fairness.\n  I regret that in all of his comments this morning, the majority \nleader did not address the fundamental issue of fairness that we are \nraising and over which the President has threatened a veto.\n  My absolute last comment: The President made clear that he would veto \nthis. So the majority leader comes to the floor and says, well, we will \ncome back, and we will work this out down the road.\n  Why? Why work it out down the road? Why not work it out now? Why not \nwork it out in the last month before we came to the floor knowing it \nwould be vetoed? If we can work out these other issues, if we weren't \nseeking a political advantage, we could certainly work that out.\n  People may not like the fact that the President of the United States \nis who he is and is of the party that he is, but he has the veto. We \nhave been through this since 1995, when the Government of the United \nStates was shut down for the first time in American history over this \nvery same challenge. And here we are again, in the year 2000, with the \nsame sort of sense of frustration over the fact that he has the veto \npen that brings us to this point of confrontation. The fact is, he does \nhave that pen. He has the constitutional right. He made it clear he \nwould do it. And the reasons he has chosen to do it are substantive and \nimportant to the American people. That is what this debate is about.\n  I thank my colleague for his courtesy. I yield such time, up to the \n30 minutes, as he might consume to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I thank the \nSenator from Massachusetts, both for his focus on bipartisanship with \nrespect to the overall package and for his very thoughtful comments \nabout the assisted suicide issue. I think he has summed it up very \nwell.\n  I feel bad that I had to object to consideration of the tax \nlegislation this morning. I will take just a minute or two to describe \nwhy and then go on to talk about the overall issue as it relates to \npain relief and what is in the tax bill.\n  I know it is an inconvenience to a number of Senators to have me talk \nabout this subject at length. This is an important time in the year for \ncolleagues. I regret the inconvenience. But I believe what is in the \ntax bill is going to cause so much pain and suffering to families all \nacross the country, that the interests of those families who are going \nto suffer if this tax bill as written becomes law have to come first.\n  First and foremost, I want the Senate to understand that before we \nare done, I am going to speak at length about exactly what the \nconsequences will be for families all across this country, who \nneedlessly are going to suffer great pain that could be averted, if the \nbill becomes law as written.\n  In addition, while the majority leadership in the Congress is \nattempting to throw Oregon's vote on assisted suicide into the trash \ncan, Oregonians are holding on to ballots such as this one. They are \nwondering if this ballot, this sacred vote, really counts.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Oregon yield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. In one moment.\n  I am obligated to speak for those Oregonians, each and every one of \nthem, over a million Oregon voters, because I want them to understand \nthat I am going to do everything in my power to make sure the ballot I \nhave in my hand and the ballots they are holding right now actually \ncount. The fact is, the senior Senator from Oklahoma has put into the \ntax bill legislation that would silence over a million Oregon voices. I \nam going to be here to make sure those voices are heard.\n  I yield to the Senator from Nevada. I thank him for his thoughtful \ncomments last night on this issue.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a question. This question comes from \nthe people of the State of Nevada. It is my understanding that if this \nprovision of this tax bill passes, a vote that was taken in the State \nof Oregon, open to everyone in the State of Oregon, would be basically \nrepealed by the Congress of the United States; is that true?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator is correct. In effect, it would be impossible \nto carry out the will of Oregon voters on a matter that has \nhistorically been left to the States.\n\n[[Page S11209]]\n\n  What is so striking--and I appreciate the Senator's question--is that \nwe constantly have colleagues come to the floor and talk about the \nimportance of States rights and the beauty of the 10th amendment. Then \nwhen they don't happen to agree with what a State is doing, I guess the \n10th amendment isn't so important anymore.\n  I appreciate the Senator's question.\n  Mr. REID. One more question I will ask the Senator from Oregon: Then \nthe people of Nevada, no matter how they feel about the substance of \nthe legislation that passed in the State of Oregon, should be warned by \nme and others that if this piece of legislation passes, if we pass a \nballot proposition or a law in the State of Nevada, it would be subject \nto repeal by the Congress. We in Nevada believe in States rights. We \nare part of the great western heritage.\n  Is it true that if this particular legislation passes, the people of \nthe State of Nevada should be aware of the fact that we could repeal \nsomething that they pass in the legislature or by ballot proposition?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator is absolutely right. People in Nevada should \nunderstand that what this legislation does is take away from all States \nwhat has historically been their prerogative, which is to determine \nappropriate medical practice. There is a great body of case law and a \nvariety of legal precedents that establish that right, and folks in \nNevada should understand that. I think it is also on point to note that \npeople in Maine are voting right now on this issue. I think it is open \nto some question as to what will be the effect of that Maine ballot \nmeasure right now if the tax legislation were to pass as written and, \nin effect, throw Oregon folk to the trash can, and it might do the same \nthing for people in Maine. I thank my colleague for his questions.\n  Mr. President, if the Senate was here today to vote on a stand-alone \nbill which would lead to unspeakable, avoidable suffering for hundreds \nof thousands of terminally ill citizens, there is no question in my \nmind that the Senate would not pass it. So what we have to ask is why \nhas the Senate leadership stuck into this tax bill, legislation that \nthe American Cancer Society and over 50 nationally recognized health \norganizations believe will cause unnecessary suffering for thousands of \nterminally ill citizens in each State in our country.\n  What is particularly ironic is that this legislation has not moved \nforward with any of the traditional procedures of the Senate. It has \nnever been reported out by a committee of jurisdiction. It has never \nbeen subject to amendment by the full Senate. There has never been a \nchance to debate it on the floor of the Senate. The fact is that this \nlegislation, which is one of the central bioethical questions in our \nsociety, was stuffed into the tax bill close to midnight the other \nnight, without overcoming even one of the traditional procedures the \nSenate follows.\n  Now, Senator Kerry noted the name of this bill. It is the so-called \n``Pain Relief Promotion Act.'' The fact of the matter is, this \nlegislation is really the ``Pain Promotion Act'' because it is going to \nhave a chilling effect on health care providers all across this country \nwho simply want to practice good pain management.\n  I know my friend from Colorado, who is in the Chair today, also \nrepresents a rural State. Let me tell you about the kind of concern I \nhave if the Nickles bill, as written, becomes law. Let us say you have \na physician in Colorado or in Iowa or another rural State who is \nopposed to assisted suicide--and I am opposed to assisted suicide; I \nhave joined colleagues here in voting to ban Federal funding of \nassisted suicide. But let's say a physician in Colorado, who is opposed \nto assisted suicide, wants to treat pain aggressively with a suffering \npatient. If they do, their intent, their mental calculus can later be \ndissected by law enforcement officials who, if they believe that anti-\nassisted suicide physician really had a different intent, can prosecute \nthat physician. And the medical providers involved would be subject to \na mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years, a fine that is upwards of a \nmillion dollars and they would lose their DEA registration.\n  The fact is that the undertreatment of pain today is a documented \npublic health crisis. There was just another survey published very \nrecently demonstrating that physicians and health care providers are \nreluctant to treat pain aggressively because they are very fearful of \nhaving their decisions second-guessed by law enforcement. There are a \nnumber of us--the American Cancer Society is one--who are opposed to \nassisted suicide. Yet the American Cancer Society has said that because \nof the chilling ramifications of pain management, it believes the \nNickles legislation included in the tax bill is going to hurt cancer \npatients nationwide.\n  The American Academy of Family Physicians is another major medical \ngroup opposed to assisted suicide and they oppose the Nickles \nlegislation; so is the American Nurses Association, the Oncology \nNursing Society, the Indiana State Hospice and Palliative Care \nAssociation, and the Texas Medical Association. In sum, there are more \nthan 50 respected health organizations that are opposed to physician-\nassisted suicide and also oppose the Nickles legislation included in \nthis tax bill.\n\n  If we do care about humane medical treatment--and I know that every \nSenator cares about the suffering of those who are vulnerable--I \nbelieve when you actually read what is in this tax bill and what \nSenator Nickles has been able to include, if you wish to join us in \nalleviating suffering and protecting the poor, elderly, and vulnerable, \nyou have to oppose the Nickles legislation because it hurts the very \npeople that our colleagues care about.\n  I want to raise a troublesome flag now with respect to this bill. To \nmy knowledge, not a single nursing organization in America supports the \nbill purporting to relieve pain for the dying--not one. But seven \nnursing organizations, including the American Nurses Association, \nNational Association of Hospice and Palliative Nurses, Pediatric \nOncology Nurses, and the American Society of Pain Management Nurses, \noppose the alleged pain relief bill included in this tax legislation.\n  Now, you know when a loved one is in a hospital, the physician may \nhave ultimate responsibility for the care, but the nurses are the ones \non the front lines coping with pain. Seven major nursing organizations, \nrepresenting those on the front lines, have come out against the \nNickles bill. So the question is, how could all of this happen? I think \nthe Senate may want to reflect on the procedures involved because I \nthink other Senators may find the same sort of absurd process applied \nin matters that are important to their States.\n  When Senator Nickles introduced the Pain Relief Promotion Act last \nyear, the bill was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions. That is because, for obvious reasons, the bill has \nenormous ramifications for pain and health care. The bill received a \nhearing in 1999. It wasn't acted on by the committee. Members on both \nsides of the aisle expressed concerns about the legislation's impact on \nend-of-life and pain care. Unfortunately, a House bill identical to \nthat legislation was passed by the House and was suddenly referred to \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, which didn't have jurisdiction on this \ncritical health issue. The Parliamentarian did something that I believe \nshowed great courage, and I commend him for it. He simply told the news \nmedia that a mistake had been made, that the Nickles legislation had \nbeen referred to the wrong committee.\n\n  I thought it was a very courageous, gutsy thing for the \nParliamentarian to do. It was the kind of unfortunate accident that can \nhappen.\n  The Judiciary Committee, as one might guess, had a chairman who was \nsympathetic to the Nickles legislation who pushed and pushed to mark it \nup before the American Cancer Society made it clear that the Nickles \nlegislation would hurt cancer patients. They got the bill out of the \nJudiciary Committee on a 10-8 vote.\n  Now you know that the bill is very controversial. That is why it is \ncoming to the floor of the Senate in the form it is. They could not get \nthe Senate to approve this legislation if the traditional procedure of \nthe Senate were followed.\n  In fact, since the Nickles legislation had been introduced with a \nhandful of Democrats who were supportive, several have now indicated \ntheir opposition largely for the reasons I have cited--that the Nickles \nlegislation would have a chilling effect on pain management.\n\n[[Page S11210]]\n\n  The reason this bill has been stuffed into the tax legislation is \nthat it cannot go forward on its own. There is too much controversy \nattached to it, too much uncertainty about its ramifications on pain \ncare for the dying for the leadership to bring it to the floor in the \nnormal way.\n  The fact is that the Senator from Oklahoma doesn't have the votes. At \none point, the supporters had 80 votes. It got out of the Judiciary \nCommittee 10-8.\n  I said last summer, let's follow the traditional rules of the Senate. \nAfter we had agreed to that, the distinguished Senator from New York, \nwho is very opposed to assisted suicide, saw how much damage this \nlegislation would do for the suffering and said he couldn't support the \nbill.\n  Senator Nickles saw that support was quickly moving away from him and \nthat he didn't have the votes to pass his legislation following the \ntraditional procedure of the Senate. To compensate for the lack of \nvotes and the inability to follow traditional procedures in the Senate, \nthe senior Senator from Oklahoma has chosen the least democratic method \nat his disposal to circumvent an honest debate and avoid even a couple \nof modest amendments.\n  What is striking is the senior Senator from Oklahoma has on various \noccasions apparently said we shouldn't have extraneous matters brought \nin that had not been considered separately in a conference report. But \nhe is allowing exactly this to be done with his bill.\n  The senior Senator from Oklahoma is betting that by stuffing his \nlegislation into this conference report, everybody is going to be so \nresigned to the outcome and so anxious to bring down the gavel and get \nhome that this body is just going to ignore its obligation to the \nscores and scores of families and suffering patients who are going to \nbe hurt by this legislation.\n  The senior Senator from Oklahoma may be right. I suppose that is the \nway it often works in the Senate. However, I am going to be asking my \ncolleagues--and will talk more about this subject when we get back on \nthe tax legislation--to step up to the suffering with so much on the \nline. I want them to know what is at stake.\n  If this legislation is approved, the friends of every Senator, loved \nones, and constituents are going to find it impossible to obtain \naggressive pain care in their communities. Patients unable to obtain \npain care are a fact of life right now, but at least we have some \nsolace in knowing that thousands of brave health professionals are \nwilling to risk their reputations and their careers to prescribe \ncontrolled substances to relieve suffering.\n  If the tax legislation goes forward without removing the Nickles \nbill, the undertreatment of pain, which is already a documented public \nhealth crisis, is going to get worse. Our loved ones--yours, mine--and \nindividuals in every community across this country are going to suffer \nthe consequences with this flawed legislation.\n\n  I hope that before we have a final vote on this issue, each and every \none of our colleagues will read the statement of the American Cancer \nSociety on this legislation. They are an organization that opposes \nassisted suicide, as I do. Yet here is what they say about the Nickles \nlegislation. This is the direct statement of the American Cancer \nSociety about the Nickles legislation. The American Cancer Society \nstates, and I quote:\n\n       Under the act, all physicians, and particularly physicians \n     who care for those with terminal illnesses, will be made \n     especially vulnerable to having their pain and symptom \n     management treatment decisions questioned by law enforcement \n     officials not qualified to judge medical decision-making. \n     This can result in unnecessary investigation and further \n     disincentive to aggressively treat pain.\n\n  That is the American Cancer Society describing how the Nickles \nlegislation will have a chilling effect on pain care.\n  I would like to offer a bit of a historical perspective. The \nnonprescription abuse of opioids and cocaine around the turn of the \ncentury and the growing sentiment that doctors at that time were one \ncomponent of the growing drug problem in America helped contribute to \nthe stigma associated with the use of opioids for pain.\n  According to a seminar on oncology and in an article by Dr. David \nWiseman, ``Doctors, Opioids, and the Law: The Effect of Controlled \nSubstances Regulation on Cancer Pain Management,'' when regulations \nwere enacted in 1914 to keep from treating drug addicts with opioids, \nthe stigma attached to those drugs continued to grow, and physicians \nacross the country became more reticent to prescribe those drugs \nbecause of their fear of criminal or licensing sanctions against their \npractice.\n  The undertreatment of pain is due to a variety of complex causes. \nThere certainly are a number of studies that show that the threat of \nlegal sanctions is one of the main roadblocks to humane pain control. \nAnd that is before the Nickles legislation in the Senate would direct \nto Drug Enforcement Administration to have law enforcement agents \nsecond-guessing the judgment of doctors.\n  One 1994 California survey showed that 69 percent of physicians cited \nthe potential for disciplinary action as a reason for prescribing \nopioids conservatively. One-third of the doctors went on to acknowledge \nthat their own patients may be suffering from untreated pain.\n  What we saw last week in Oregon was a brand new study that showed \nagain that physicians are fearful about aggressively treating pain for \nfear of legal prosecution. It confirmed the 1994 California survey.\n  For that reason, I am happy to yield to my friend and colleague.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend for bringing these \nissues to the floor of the Senate. I think this issue of pain abatement \nis a key issue.\n  I go even further than that in this debate because the issue of \nphysician-assisted suicide, which I do not support, is really not what \nI am afraid of in Senator Nickles' approach. But I just want to say to \nmy friend, thank you for bringing this issue forward. I watched a loved \none, who was as close to me as anyone could be, cry out in pain hour \nafter hour, saying: I don't want to live.\n\n  I wanted this person to live more than I can say. But I went to that \nphysician of this loving relative and I said: Please, please, do \neverything in your power to anesthetize this pain, to sop this pain. \nThis physician looked at me and he said: I will do everything that I \ncan.\n  I am so fearful that someone else, if this bill becomes law, will \nlook at me and say: Barbara, I know how much you love this individual, \nbut I can't do more than I am doing because I'm afraid I'm going to be \nhauled off to prison.\n  I don't want any family looking in the eyes of a physician, begging \nto put a loved one out of this type of misery and pain, being told that \ntheir hands are tied; they would love to help and they can't.\n  That is why what the Senator from Oregon is doing is so important and \nwhy I am so saddened that this bill, in the dead of night, that could \nlead to people writhing in pain, not being able to get the help they \nneed, was done in such a fashion where we really can't even give it the \nattention it deserves.\n  As my final point, would my friend tell me again, for the record, so \nthat everyone watching this debate can know, which organizations are \nopposing this Nickles provision for the reason that the Senator has \nstated--that it will lead to people suffering needlessly, and doctors \nbeing afraid to help them because they will be hauled off to jail.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate my colleague's questions. There are more than \n50 major health organizations. The American Cancer Society has stated \nwhy they feel this legislation would have a chilling effect on pain \nmanagement.\n  I want my colleague to know, because time is short, that Senator \nNickles, in offering this bill, says doctors don't have anything to \nworry about with respect to prosecution under the bill--that his \nlegislation says doctors can prescribe drugs which will hasten death if \ntheir intent is to treat the pain. So he is talking about ``intent.''\n  Our colleagues are right to be so concerned about who is going to \ndetermine the intent of the physician, who is just trying to help \nsomebody suffering and gives a suffering person critical relief and \ndignity as they face difficult hours at the end-of-life. The person who \nis going to decide ``intent'' is not another doctor, not a nurse, not a \nhealth professional, not anybody with medical\n\n[[Page S11211]]\n\ntraining, but law enforcement officials. A law enforcement official is \ngoing to determine that medical provider's' intent. Somebody with no \nmedical training is going to, in effect, have the authority to put \nmedical providers on trial; a trial that could cause a provider to lose \ntheir license, serve 20 years in prison, and face upwards of a $1 \nmillion fine.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. There are many who oppose assisted \nsuicide, who want to work in a bipartisan way to promote better pain \nmanagement and reduce the demand for assisted suicide.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator from Oklahoma is not allowing Members to do \nthat.\n  The Senator from California has made the key point. At the end of the \nday, I want it understood when the people of Oregon cast a ballot like \nthe one I have in my hand on a matter that has historically been left \nto the people of my State and to every State, I will do everything I \ncan on the floor of the Senate to protect that vote.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nequally divided between both sides.\n  Mr. BOND. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will keep talking if the Senator from \nMissouri objects. I am sure some of our colleagues have other concerns.\n  I will continue on this question of dissecting medical providers' \nintent, as the Nickles legislation does, a dissecting exercise that \nwill be done by law enforcement professionals rather than medical \nproviders.\n  Here is what the American Cancer Society had to say about determining \n``intent'' under the Nickles legislation. The American Cancer Society \nsays: Unfortunately, intent cannot be easily determined, particularly \nin the area of medicine, where effective dosage levels for patients may \ndeviate significantly from the norm. The question of deciding intent \nshould remain in the hands of those properly trained to make such \ndecisions--the medical community and State medical boards.\n  What the American Cancer Society is saying, as with these other 50 \norganizations, they are especially troubled that the Nickles \nlegislation is second-guessing the pain management practices of \nphysicians and providers all across the country. It is especially \ntroublesome because law enforcement officials, rather than health care \nprofessionals, are going to be the ones to assess the intent of a \nmedical provider. A medical providers' intentions under any calculus, \nas the American Cancer Society has noted, cannot be easily determined. \nTo allow law enforcement officials to have this enormous discretion, \nafter the fact, to challenge our medical providers, in my view, is \ngoing to significantly compound the undertreatment of pain in America.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I was told that the time of the Senator \nexpired and I was coming to claim my time to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired under the \nprevious order, and the Senator from Oklahoma is to be recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to let my colleague conclude his \nthought.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I hoped we could have worked it out. My \ntime has expired. As the Senator from Oklahoma knows, I have wanted a \nreal debate on this legislation for some time, so I am happy to have \nthe Senator hold forth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, one, I wish to respond to my colleague \nand my friend from Oregon. He is my friend. We happen to have a \ndisagreement on this issue. We have a difference of opinion, a rather \npronounced difference of opinion. I heard several things in his \nstatement that I want to correct. I almost don't know where to start.\n  First, let me touch on a couple of things on procedure. This is so \nwrong procedurally and should not be in this bill.\n  Again, he is my good friend, but he has known all along I would try \nto get this bill on the floor. Yes, it was put in the tax bill. I tried \nto put it in the appropriations bill. We ended up putting it in a tax \nbill. Is that the best way to legislate? No.\n  I might tell my colleagues and my friend from Oregon I tried about \nhalf a dozen different ways to pull the bill up, to have it be an \namendable state, to offer my colleague from Oregon or others a chance \nto have relevant amendments, and those offers were always rejected. So \nnow we have the bill before the Senate.\n  I might also mention, if one is complaining about this procedure, \nthen we shouldn't have any problem with the Commerce-State-Justice \nbecause the administration is trying to put an amnesty provision that \ndoesn't belong on the Commerce-State-Justice bill. It did not pass \neither the House or the Senate, and is totally extraneous to the \nconference.\n\n  Senator Byrd had one dealing with trade that was on an appropriations \nbill. It should not have been. It was inserted.\n  At least this bill did pass the House by over 100 votes. It did pass \nthe Judiciary Committee. It has had hearings. It has been marked up. It \nhas had 42 cosponsors--maybe my friend and colleague from Oregon has \nbeen able to convince one or two to get off. Senator Lieberman is still \na principal cosponsor, to my knowledge. He testified in favor of this \nlegislation, as have I. So this legislation is not new. It is not a \nsurprise.\n  My colleague from Oregon has sent several letters to all colleagues \nsaying what is wrong with the legislation. I have sent several letters \nto all of our colleagues saying he was incorrect. So everyone knows \nabout this bill and everyone knows at some point we are going to have a \ndebate on it. I hope it will be passed.\n  Let me touch on a couple of issues that were brought up. My colleague \nfrom Oregon said if this bill is passed it is going to tell a million \npeople in Oregon who voted for this on a ballot initiative, a \nreferendum, that their vote does not mean anything. I disagree with \nthat. This bill does not overturn Oregon's law. I want to be very clear \nabout this. This bill does not say anything about making Oregon's law \nnull and void. What this bill does is it deals with pain and pain \nmanagement. The bill does say: Oregon, you cannot overturn Federal law. \nIt doesn't say quite that. Federal law, the controlling law, is the \nControlled Substances Act. That is a Federal law. It passed in 1970. It \ncontrols very strong drugs, I tell my friend from New York. These are \ndeadly drugs. They are strong drugs. They are under Federal control. \nThey are not under State control; they are under Federal control. It is \na Federal Controlled Substances Act. The State of Oregon cannot pass a \nlaw that changes a Federal statute.\n  I make the analogy, Oklahoma might say let's legalize heroin. \nOklahomans might pass that in a referendum, but it doesn't make heroin \nlegal. It is still against the Federal law to use heroin. These are \nfederally controlled drugs. They are deadly if they are used in very \nlarge quantities, but they are also very helpful. They can help \nalleviate pain. Unfortunately, we have a real problem in pain. I heard \nmy colleague from California mention she knew a friend who was in \nenormous pain. We all have friends or families or have known people who \nare suffering and suffering greatly. I want to alleviate their pain. \nThat is one reason why this bill was created.\n  There were two reasons. We want to alleviate pain. That is why all \nthe pain management groups endorse this bill. I will go through a list. \nMy colleague from Oregon listed a few groups that endorsed his. We have \n10 times as many people, groups, physicians, you name it--hospice care, \npalliative care, the American Medical Association, that endorse this \nbill; pain management societies--you name it. I will have all that \nprinted in the Record. These groups, the hospice groups and others, \ntheir members worked their entire lives because they want to alleviate \npain. This bill will alleviate pain.\n\n[[Page S11212]]\n\n  This bill does two things. It says we can use these drugs. My \namending the Controlled Substances Act says we can use these very \nstrong drugs to alleviate pain. We put a safe harbor in to protect \nphysicians, making sure when they use these drugs to alleviate pain, if \nit causes someone's death there will be no problem. The bill also says \nthese drugs cannot be used for the purpose of assisted suicide.\n\n  Guess what. That has been the law of the land for 30 years. These \ndrugs were never allowed to be used for assisted suicide. The Drug \nEnforcement Administration--I will put a letter from Mr. Constantine \nwho says he reviewed it--the Controlled Substances Act says these drugs \ncan be used for legitimate medical purposes. In our bill, we state that \nincludes pain management, the alleviation of pain. We put that in \nspecifically so everyone will know: Use these drugs to alleviate pain. \nIt is now in the law. Mr. Constantine also said it is not construed to \nbe used for assisted suicide.\n  You say: Why do you need this bill?\n  You need this bill for two reason. One, we want to make sure \neverybody knows these drugs can be used to alleviate pain.\n  What about the Oregon law? My colleague from Oregon said this is \ngoing to outlaw the Oregon law and nullify a million voters who voted \nfor it. This is going to gut the bill.\n  Granted, they have had dozens of suicides that have been committed \nusing federally controlled drugs. Guess what. The law was always \ninterpreted before that these drugs cannot be used for assisted \nsuicide. They cannot be used to cause someone's death. They can be used \nto alleviate someone's pain, and we clarify that in our legislation. We \ngo further. We put in funds to educate people on pain management.\n  My colleague from Oregon and I happen to agree with this. There is a \nreal problem in pain management. There are a lot of people who are not \ndoing enough in pain management, for whatever reason. Maybe they have \nnot been educated. Maybe they are afraid of liability. Maybe they are \nafraid of doing too much and that might enhance someone's death. We \nsaid you can be very aggressive in pain management. What you cannot do \nis take federally controlled drugs and use them to kill somebody. These \ndrugs are controlled by the Federal Government. They can be used to \nalleviate pain. They cannot be used to kill somebody.\n  About the Oregon law, Oregon passes a law and says they are going to \nsay one can have assisted suicide. Fine. You cannot use Federal \ncontrolled drugs. These are federally controlled drugs. Oregon cannot \namend the Controlled Substances Act. They think they can. Now with the \nAttorney General's letter, maybe they think they can. It is really \nawkward. In 49 States, you cannot use federally controlled substances \nfor assisted suicide, but in Oregon you can.\n  So how did Oregon amend the Federal law, the Federal statute? Maybe \nOklahoma is going to amend the Federal law. They might not like the .08 \nwe just passed.\n  I heard my colleague say: What about States rights? I am a very \nstrong supporter of States rights but States cannot change Federal law. \nI am all for giving States the right to opt out. If we want to say the \nControlled Substances Act applies unless the States want to opt out, \nlet's pass it. We have not done that. If we want to have a different \nlaw to allow States to opt out, maybe it should be used against the \nFederal law against heroin or cocaine, and we want to have the State \nopt out on that? I don't think so. Oregon is saying let's have the \nState opt out on the Controlled Substances Act so we can use these \nsubstances for assisted suicide. Oregon cannot change the Federal law.\n  So it is not us, it is not the Federal Government now trying to \noverturn the Oregon law. Oregon, by referendum, thought they could \noverturn the Federal law. They cannot do it. They cannot do it.\n\n  Let's do what we can to alleviate pain. Let's take these very strong \ndrugs--morphine and others that if used in excess can be deadly--let's \nmake sure they are used to alleviate pain. Let's do it aggressively and \neducate people all across the country in pain management. So we do that \nas well.\n  Let me also knock down a couple of the arguments that my colleagues \nused. He said if we do this, it is going to have a chilling impact.\n  Far from it. I will tell my colleagues, the AMA and some other \ngroups, the hospice groups, said that a couple of years ago. We stated \nvery clearly in the Controlled Substances Act that these drugs can be \nused to alleviate pain. They said: We are afraid it will have a \nchilling impact so we put in language to guarantee, to give physicians \nsafe harbors, to do all kinds of things in the legislation to encourage \nusing the drugs for pain management but not assisted suicide. So the \nchilling effect argument is not accurate.\n  In fact, if you look at the several States that have passed laws \nagainst assisted suicide but for pain management--and there are \nseveral, and I have charts of several: Kansas, Rhode Island, several \nStates--in every one of those States, when they passed legislation \nbanning assisted suicide but encouraging pain management, the use of \nmorphine has gone up dramatically. So instead of having a chilling \nimpact on pain management, it encouraged pain management, it encouraged \nthe use of these drugs, these very strong drugs to alleviate pain. That \nis the history in every single State. It is interesting to note since \nOregon passed their law on allowing or legalizing assisted suicide, it \nis just the opposite. The use of pain management drugs has actually \ngone down.\n  I look at Indiana, the use of morphine has gone up substantially. \nThey have banned assisted suicide. Iowa, the same thing, a dramatic \nincrease in pain control drugs when they banned assisted suicide. \nKansas, again, more than double. Louisiana doubled the use of these \nvery strong drugs to alleviate pain. In Rhode Island, it more than \ndoubled. South Dakota had a big increase. Again, almost all of these \nhave doubled. Tennessee--it has more than tripled the use of pain \ncontrol drugs.\n  When the States banned the use of assisted suicide, they used the \nstrong drugs to alleviate pain. This is what we want to do. We want to \nalleviate pain. We want to be effective. We want to get the very strong \ndrugs that a lot of physicians have been reluctant to utilize and we \nwant to get them into physicians' hands. We want to let them know they \nhave the power, the authority, the education to use these drugs to \nalleviate pain. Even if they increase the use and it causes someone's \ndeath, there is no penalty, and I have to touch on the penalty \nsanctions. My colleague was so wrong.\n  We want them to alleviate pain. My colleague says: If they do not \ncomply, we will have a new group of Federal officers running around, \nand this is going to have a chilling impact. He is exactly wrong. The \nDrug Enforcement Administration is in control of these drugs right now. \nThere are 990,000 registrants who use these federally controlled drugs \nnationwide.\n  My colleague from Oregon implied that if we pass this bill, we are \ngoing to have a new set of Federal police; they are going to be \narresting people and they will do years in jails and pay thousands of \ndollars in fines. We have given zero, none, no additional law \nenforcement authority.\n  Guess how many drug enforcements there were in fiscal year 1999? \nThere are 990,000 registrants, and they investigated 921 cases, almost \nall of which were referred by the States. They revoked their \nregistration, which is DEA's enforcement. They revoked the \nregistrations of 29.\n  In 1998--again, there are almost 1 million people who are licensed to \ndispense these federally controlled drugs--they revoked the \nregistrations of 17; in the year 1997, 18. So DEA already has this \nauthority. They have it nationwide. They have always had it. We do not \ntake it away. We do not enhance their authority.\n  This is a bogus red herring. Somebody is trying to scare the people: \nWe are going to increase the Government power. Hogwash, we are \nincreasing the power of the physicians. We are giving them a safe \nharbor, giving them greater standing. Before somebody can take action, \nthey have to prove intent before there would be any claim against that \nphysician. We give the physicians greater power and greater reliability \nthat they will not be going to court, that they will not be in trouble \nwith law enforcement if they are aggressively using these drugs for \npain management.\n\n[[Page S11213]]\n\n  Under this bill, they can use these drugs aggressively in pain \nmanagement. They just cannot use them for Dr. Kevorkian assisted \nsuicide, plain and simple. In Oregon, in at least 43 cases, they have \nused federally controlled drugs to kill someone. We are saying these \nare federally controlled drugs and you can use them to alleviate pain, \nbut you cannot use them to kill someone.\n  I want to touch on a couple of other issues. I mentioned safe harbor. \nI have a letter from the American Medical Association, which says:\n\n       This bill would explicitly include this as a safe harbor, \n     creating a legal environment in which physicians may \n     administer appropriate pain care for patients without fear of \n     prosecution.\n\n  This is the AMA.\n  They continue:\n\n       The Pain Relief Promotion Act does not create a new Federal \n     authority to regulate physicians. The bill contains specific \n     rules of construction preserving the roles of States and the \n     Federal Government in regulating the practice of medicine.\n\n  I could go on and on.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \nvolume of information because this is an important issue. I have \neditorials, a couple of which came from Oregon, one of which is dated \nJuly 1, 1999. This is the Oregonian. It says: ``Kill the pain, not the \npatients.'' That is what we try to do with our bill. We try to kill the \npain and not the patients.\n  Also, I have an Oregonian editorial which says: ``A state's rights, a \nstate's wrongs.'' This is dated October 19, 1999.\n  And a more recent editorial from the Oregonian, September 10, 2000, \nsays:\n\n       Approve pain relief promotion bill. The Senate should put a \n     quick end to Wyden's filibuster and pass a bill that favors \n     pain killing over patient killing.\n\n  I have a volume of things. I mentioned these three editorials which \nare very well written, and also I have a legal analysis of the bill; I \nhave a list of organizations supporting the Pain Relief Promotion Act. \nThis list is very long.

Doctors might become \n     afraid to prescribe drugs to manage pain and depression--\n     things that, when uncontrolled, can lead the terminally ill \n     to consider killing themselves in the first place. We thought \n     then that the problem could be worked out and that it was \n     possible to keep doctors from using federally controlled \n     substances to kill their patients without also preventing \n     them from relieving their terminally-ill patients' agonies.\n       This Congress's Pain Relief Promotion Act proves it, and \n     the proposed legislation comes not a moment too soon. A new \n     report by the Center for Ethics in Health Care at Oregon \n     Health Sciences University shows that end-of-life care in \n     Oregon--which fancies itself a leader in this area--is far \n     from all it should be. Too many Oregonians spend the last \n     days of their life in pain.\n       There's no real need for that--and the Pain Relief \n     Promotion Act of 1999 would go a long way toward addressing \n     these systemic and professional failures here and elsewhere. \n     The proposal would authorize federal health-care agencies to \n     promote an increased understanding of palliative care and to \n     support training programs for health professionals in the \n     best pain management practices. It would also require the \n     Agency for Health Care Policy and Research to develop and \n     share scientific information on proper palliative care.\n       Further, the Pain Relief Promotion Act would clarify the \n     Controlled Substances Act in two essentials ways.\n       One, it makes clear that alleviating pain and discomfort is \n     an authorized and legitimate medical purpose for the use of \n     controlled substances.\n       Two, the bill states that nothing in the Controlled \n     Substances Act authorizes the use of these drugs for assisted \n     suicide or euthanasia and that state laws allowing assisted \n     suicide or euthanasia are irrelevant in determining whether a \n     practitioner has violated the Controlled Substances Act.\n       Technically, of course, the bill does not overturn Oregon's \n     so-called Death with Dignity Act. But it would thwart it, for \n     all practical purposes, because it makes it illegal for \n     Oregon doctors to engage in assisted suicide using their \n     federal drug-prescribing license. Suicide's advocates may \n     think of some other method, but none seems obvious.\n       Is this a federal intrusion on a state's right to allow \n     physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia?\n       To hear some recent converts to state's rights talk, you \n     might think so. But you could just as easily argue that \n     Oregon's assisted suicide law intrudes on the federal domain. \n     The feds have long had jurisdiction over controlled \n     substances, even as states kept the power to regulate the way \n     physicians prescribe them. At best, it's a gray area.\n       You'll recall that the Department of Justice declined to \n     assert a federal interest in all of this when it plausibly \n     could have, shortly after Oregon voters approved assisted \n     suicide. It's probably better--and high time--that Congress \n     asserts that interest explicitly.\n       This act would establish a uniform national standard \n     preventing the use of federally controlled drugs for assisted \n     suicide. That, in itself, should advance the national debate \n     on this subject in a more seemly way than, say, the recent \n     efforts of Dr. Jack Kervorkian.\n       Beyond that, it's high time that the Congress made clear \n     that improved pain relief is a key objective of our nation's \n     health-care institutions and our Controlled Substances Act. \n     The Pain Relief Promotion Act will do all this. No wonder the \n     American Medical Association and the National Hospice \n     Organization are now on board.\n\n[[Page S11214]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                  [From the Oregonian, Oct. 19, 1999]\n\n                   A State's Rights, a State's Wrongs\n\n\n    not even oregon has a right to intrude on federal government's \n                      traditional regulatory arena\n\n       Nobody can say Oregon didn't have a full debate on assisted \n     suicide before reaffirming in November 1997 what voters first \n     passed a year earlier. Both sides expended much blood and \n     treasure in the fight and it's natural to think the matter \n     should end there. Oregon voters passed assisted suicide; \n     Oregon should have assisted suicide.\n       Normally, we'd agree.\n       But Oregon's ``Death with Dignity Act'' barges into an area \n     of long-standing federal jurisdiction--the Controlled \n     Substances Act--and Measure 16 proponents' new infatuation \n     with ``states' rights'' betrays a misunderstanding of the \n     concept.\n       We mention this as Congress prepares to debate the Pain \n     Relief Promotion Act of 1999. The bill would authorize \n     federal health-care agencies to promote an improved \n     palliative care, and not even our new states' rights \n     enthusiasts are grousing about that proposed federal \n     initiative. The Pain Relief Promotion Act also makes clear \n     that alleviating pain and discomfort is an authorized and \n     legitimate medical purpose for the use of controlled \n     substances under the Controlled Substances Act. Nobody minds \n     this either, which is understandable, since it would ensure \n     that federal drug laws don't get in the way of proper \n     palliative care.\n       But the fur starts flying when the bill states that nothing \n     in the Controlled Substances Act authorizes the use of these \n     drugs for assisted suicide or euthanasia and that state laws \n     allowing assisted suicide or euthanasia are irrelevant in \n     determining if a physician has violated this federal law. \n     Although the act wouldn't technically nullify Oregon's \n     suicide law, doctors here would have to help patients die \n     without the aid of federally controlled substances.\n       Initially, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration \n     Administrator Thomas Constantine ruled that using controlled \n     drugs such as barbiturates to terminate patients violated the \n     Controlled Substance Act, because assisted suicide was not a \n     ``legitimate medical practice.'' We couldn't agree more that \n     helping patients kill themselves is not a ``legitimate \n     medical practice.'' But in a later decision, Constantine's \n     boss, Attorney General Janet Reno, took a different view.\n       She stated there was no evidence that Congress, in the \n     Controlled Substance Act, wanted to override the states' \n     right to determine what was a ``legitimate medical \n     practice.'' Nor is there evidence, Reno continued, that \n     Congress intended to hand the DEA power to decide the \n     assisted suicide question.\n       A fair historical point. Congress probably couldn't imagine \n     in 1969 that a state would countenance assisted-suicide using \n     controlled substances--but what about now? Reno said the DEA \n     shouldn't decide if physician-assisted suicide is a \n     ``legitimate medical practice,'' and that's a fair point, \n     too. These issues, Reno stated, are fundamental questions of \n     morality and public policy.'' But does Congress have a right \n     to answer such questions in the context of the Controlled \n     Substances Act?\n       Absolutely.\n       These are drugs the federal government already controls. \n     The federal government wouldn't allow a state's doctors to \n     dispense heroin simply because a state legalized it. The \n     federal government didn't allow doctors to dispense marijuana \n     even to terminally-ill patients--just because a few states' \n     voters deemed this a nifty idea. Congress didn't even have to \n     weigh in on medical marijuana; the administration made that \n     decision on its own, because of its worries about drug \n     addiction.\n       Clearly, Congress has every right to update or clarify U.S. \n     law on the use of federally controlled substances for \n     assisted suicide. If Congress can concern itself with drug \n     addiction, surely it can--and should--concern itself with the \n     quality of health care across the country.\n       It can--and should--concern itself with the effects of \n     assisted suicide on that health care.\n       And it can--and should--approve the Pain Relief Promotion \n     Act of 1999.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Sunday Oregonian, Sept. 10, 2000]\n\n                   Approve Pain Relief Promotion Bill\n\n\nsenate should put a quick end to wyden's filibuster and pass bill that \n                favors pain-killing over patient-killing\n\n       Life-and-death issues aren't always open to consensus \n     solutions, but a reasonable consensus on end-of-life care \n     seems to have emerged.\n       It's embodied in the Pain Relief Promotion Act that the \n     U.S. Senate should vote on soon--if it has the wisdom to shut \n     off a threatened filibuster led by Oregon's Ron Wyden.\n       How broad is this consensus? Well, the American Medical \n     Association, the American Academy of Pain Management, the \n     Hospice Association of America, and other medical groups all \n     back the Pain Relief Promotion Act.\n       It passed the House, 271-156, last fall and has 42 co-\n     sponsors in the Senate. Democrat Joe Lieberman, Al Gore's \n     running mate, is the chief Senate sponsors along with \n     Oklahoma Republican Don Nickles.\n       The Connecticut Democrat has company on the campaign trail, \n     too, Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush backs the \n     bill. So does the Green Party's Ralph Nader, who worries that \n     HMOs and corporate medical interests will see assisted \n     suicide as a cheap alternative to expensive medical care.\n       It's easy to see why left and right, Republicans and \n     Democrats, support the bill. It calls on federal health \n     agencies to disseminate information on palliative care to \n     health-care providers and the public.\n       It authorizes $5 million a year for grants to teach medical \n     people the latest pain-management techniques. In addition, it \n     makes explicit a ``safe harbor'' provision in the federal \n     Controlled Substances Act. Doctors could use controlled \n     substances to ease pain even when this may unintentionally \n     hasten death. The bill provides for continuing education on \n     this ``safe harbor'' for Drug Enforcement Administration and \n     other law-enforcement officials.\n       Foes claim that the Nickles-Lieberman bill would have a \n     ``chilling effect'' on doctors' ability or inclination to \n     relieve patients' suffering. Please. Every section of the \n     bill advances the cause of pain relief. States that have \n     passed similar laws--Iowa and Rhode Island, for example--have \n     seen per-capita use of federally controlled morphine for pain \n     relief go up dramatically.\n       The only thing Nickles-Lieberman will have a chilling \n     effect on is doctors who want to use federally controlled \n     drugs in their patients' suicides. The bill clarifies the \n     Controlled Substances Act so this 31-year-old federal law \n     cannot be read to countenance the use of federally controlled \n     drugs in assisted suicides and euthanasia. It makes plain \n     that assisted suicide and euthanasia are not ``legitimate \n     medical purposes'' under the Controlled Substances Act. (By \n     contrast, alleviating pain and suffering are, states the \n     bill, ``legitimate medical purposes'' for a controlled \n     substance--``even if the use of such a substance may increase \n     the risk of death.'')\n       As such, the Pain Relief Promotion Act would have a \n     chilling effect on Oregon's assisted suicide law. It wouldn't \n     exactly nullify it, but doctors here couldn't prescribe \n     federally controlled drugs for physician-assisted suicides.\n       This explains Wyden's opposition to the bill, through \n     things get tricky here. He says he actually opposes the \n     assisted suicide law. He just thinks Oregonians have a right \n     to pass this law, good or bad. That's the senator's right, \n     but the Senate shouldn't play along with the effort to dress \n     up this exercise in constituent service as some great stand \n     for states' rights or better pain relief.\n       As we've seen, Nickles-Lieberman's entire thrust is geared \n     to improving pain relief and palliative care under the \n     Controlled Substances Act. As is also clear, Wyden has picked \n     a strange place to make his stand for states' rights. Nickles \n     and Lieberman are, after all, clarifying the federal \n     Controlled Substances Act of 1970. In truth, it's Oregon that \n     has barged into an accepted area of federal regulation, 30 \n     years after the fact, with its assisted-suicide experiment.\n       Debate on the Nickles-Lieberman should lead to an informed \n     decision not put off such a decision and protect one state's \n     warped views of its powers. The Senate should vote a quick \n     end to any Wyden filibuster on its way to passing the Pain \n     Relief Promotion Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 10, 1999]\n\n                          Health, Not Suicide\n\n       With regard to Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber's op-ed column of \n     Nov. 2, ``Congress's Medical Meddlers,'' let's get the facts \n     straight.\n       Federally controlled substances are exactly that--federally \n     controlled. Under present law, they can be used only for a \n     legitimate medical purpose to promote health and safety. This \n     has been true since 1970, when Congress passed the Controlled \n     Substances Act, giving primary jurisdiction over these \n     narcotics and dangerous drugs to the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration. A lethal overdose, otherwise known as \n     assisted suicide, has never been considered a legitimate \n     medical purpose and certainly does not promote public health \n     and safety.\n       Oregon voters passed a state law to allow physician-\n     assisted suicide, and they had the right to do so. But they \n     do not have the right to change federal law. If Oregon were \n     to legalize the use of heroin for medicinal purposes, that \n     wouldn't change the federal law forbidding its use.\n       Last year, Attorney General Janet Reno issued a letter \n     carving out an exception for Oregon to use federally \n     controlled substances for assisted suicide, a decision in \n     conflict with an earlier determination by her own DEA and \n     with the Controlled Substances Act. The Pain Relief Promotion \n     Act makes clear, for the first time, that aggressive \n     treatment of pain is a legitimate medical purpose, and it \n     provides new legal protections for physicians to use these \n     medications to alleviate pain and discomfort. It also \n     restates that the use of these federally controlled drugs to \n     cause, or assist in causing, death is not a legitimate \n     medical purpose.\n                                                       Don Nickles\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        C.

Everett Koop, M.D. on the Pain Relief Promotion Act of \n                                  1999\n\n       I am pleased to lend my strong support to the Pain Relief \n     Promotion Act of 1999.\n       Clearly, controlled substances such as narcotics have very \n     legitimate and important\n\n[[Page S11215]]\n\n     uses in modern medicine, not least in alleviating the \n     suffering of dying patients. Just as clearly, government has \n     a legitimate interest in ensuring that these substances are \n     never intentionally used to take a human life. Physicians \n     entrusted by the federal government with the privilege of \n     using these potentially dangerous drugs in their practice \n     should be the first to understand the need for laws ensuring \n     their proper use. Their own ethical code instructs them \n     always to use medications only to care, never to kill.\n       We should recall what the late Margaret Mead once said \n     about efforts to legalize euthanasia: In such a society, \n     patients will not know whether their physician is visiting \n     them in his role of healer or killer. Acceptance of assisted \n     suicide as a ``solution'' to the problems of dying patients \n     would undermine the trust that all patients must be able to \n     place in their physicians. It would also undermine efforts to \n     improve compassionate care for dying patients, as the ``quick \n     fix'' of assisted suicide replaces the more difficult but \n     vitally important tasks of controlling pain and other \n     symptoms and keeping company with the dying. We cannot let \n     this happen.\n       This Act strikes the right balance, by promoting the much-\n     needed role of federally regulated drugs for pain relief \n     while reaffirming that they should not be abused to assist \n     patients' suicides. A better understanding of the difference \n     between trying to kill pain and trying to kill patients will \n     be of great help to law enforcement authorities, to \n     physicians, and especially to patients themselves.\n       I especially applaud the sponsors for including in this \n     legislation a new grant program to promote improved knowledge \n     and practice in the field of palliative care. When medical \n     professionals truly learn how to ease their patients' \n     suffering and address their real problems during the dying \n     process, assisted suicide and euthanasia become irrelevant \n     issues. All our patients deserve skilled care of this kind, \n     especially when they are weakest and most vulnerable. I hope \n     Congress will approve this bill without delay.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 American Medical Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 7, 2000.\n\n Statement of the American Medical Association in Support of the Pain \n                      Relief Promotion Act (PRPA)\n\n       The American Medical Association (AMA) supports H.R. 2260, \n     the ``Pain Relief Promotion Act'' (PRPA), as reported from \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee, offered by Chairman Orrin \n     Hatch. The new bill represents significant improvements in \n     addressing the continuing concerns of the physician community \n     regarding the proper roles of the state and federal \n     governments in regulating the practice of medicine.\n       The AMA is squarely opposed to physician-assisted suicide \n     and believes it is antithetical to the role of physician as \n     healer. The AMA strongly advocated against the Oregon public \n     initiative that has legalized physician-assisted suicide in \n     that State. In crafting an appropriate legislative response, \n     physicians have been deeply concerned that legislation must \n     recognize that aggressive treatment of pain carries with it \n     the potential for increased risk of death, the so-called \n     ``double effect.'' The threat of criminal investigation and \n     prosecution for fully legitimate medical decisions is \n     unacceptable to the AMA.\n       As reported from the Senate Judiciary Committee, the \n     legislation would recognize the ``double effect'' as a \n     potential consequence of the legitimate and necessary use of \n     controlled substances in pain management, and explicitly \n     include this as a ``safe harbor'' provision for physicians in \n     the Controlled Substance Act. This is a vital element in \n     creating a legal environment in which physicians may \n     administer appropriate pain care for patients without fear of \n     prosecution.\n       The provisions of the Chairman's Substitute to H.R. 2260, \n     reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 27, 2000, \n     represents substantial success in achieving the AMA's policy \n     goals. The AMA is pleased to endorse H.R. 2260, which now \n     contains significant improvements explained below.\n\n\n        preserves state's role in regulating physician practice\n\n       The PRPA preserves deference to state licensing boards and \n     professional disciplinary authority as currently exists under \n     the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). This bill would also \n     maintain the current balance of authority between state and \n     federal government, in which the DEA and state medical \n     licensing boards have overlapping authority when it comes to \n     physicians prescribing controlled substances.\n\n\n the prpa does not create new federal authority to regulate physicians\n\n       The bill contains specific rules of construction preserving \n     the roles of the states and federal government in regulating \n     the practice of medicine. Furthermore the Attorney General is \n     explicitly prohibited from creating new federal standards for \n     pain management or palliative care; existing and developing \n     standards in the private sector and research community will \n     continue to be the gold standard.\n\n\n           prohibits federal guidelines or standards of care\n\n       The PRPA does not give the DEA new powers to regulate \n     physicians or to evaluate whether a prescribing decision is \n     ``legitimate.'' The DEA is already authorized to evaluate \n     whether a physician's prescribing decision is for a \n     ``legitimate medical purpose.'' This amendment also negates \n     the possibility that law enforcement might create its own \n     standards on pain care and clarifies that the training and \n     education programs would not interfere with the traditional \n     role of the state in regulating the practice of medicine.\n\n\n  the prpa will continue to foster professionally developed standards\n\n       This bill will improve pain management and palliative care \n     for patients by encouraging and supporting the vital research \n     necessary for advancing the science and art of pain \n     management and palliative care. While it authorizes grants \n     and educational activity, the Agency for Health Research and \n     Quality is also prohibited from creating its own standards \n     for pain management or palliative care.\n\n\n expands scope of bill to cover pain management, as well as palliative \n                                  care\n\n       H.R. 2260 expands the scope of the bill to include all pain \n     management, rather than an exclusive focus on end-of-life \n     pain.\n       Again, the AMA supports the language contained in the bill \n     reported from the Judiciary Committee which includes \n     essential clarifications of the original bill, specifically \n     expressing the sponsors' intention to honor the existing \n     authority of the states to regulate legitimate medical \n     practice, while exercising the concurrent federal authority \n     to regulate the prescribing and administration of controlled \n     substances. The language of H.R. 2260 has been carefully \n     crafted to reflect this proper balance. We urge the full \n     Senate to pass the ``Pain Relief Promotion Act,'' as soon as \n     possible.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, my colleague was reading a few letters. \nIncidentally, he kept talking about the American Cancer Association. I \ndo not think they ever wrote a letter saying they were opposed to the \nbill. He made it sound like they did. I do not know if they did. He has \none that is maybe questionable on the bill.\n  We have dozens which spent a lot of time supporting us. The National \nHospice Association, the group that takes in individuals in their later \nyears, particularly in the years where they are close to death, \nsupports this bill. So the allegations that this might have a chilling \nimpact is hogwash. To make an allegation that this might be offensive \nto States rights is absolute hogwash. That is not correct.\n  We are not overturning Oregon's law. Oregon cannot overturn Federal \nstatute. Do we want to repeal the Federal Controlled Substances Act? \nThe Federal Government has been controlling these strong drugs before \nthat act. There was another act that passed years before, but the \nFederal Controlled Substances Act is what I am amending and clarifying \nthat legitimate medical purposes includes pain management.\n  What is wrong with that? It also says assisted suicide is not a \nlegitimate medical purpose. Think of that. We have had a Federal \nstatute on the books since 1970 to control very strong drugs because we \nknow they are deadly, we know they are hazardous. So the Federal \nGovernment passed a law regulating these drugs.\n  The State of Oregon said: Let's legalize assisted suicide, and we \nwill pretend that is a legitimate medical purpose. The Drug Enforcement \nAdministration said: No, it is not. The Attorney General wrote a letter \nthat it is in 49 States, but it is not in Oregon because we did not \nprohibit assisted suicide.\n  The Controlled Substances Act says these drugs can be used for \nlegitimate medical purposes. It did not say anything about assisted \nsuicide. So the Attorney General comes up with this weird analysis: \nMaybe it's not prohibited. The Drug Enforcement Administration before \nher said: No, assisted suicide is not a legitimate medical purpose. The \nDrug Enforcement Administration is right, and they have been the ones \nenforcing this law for the last 30 years.\n  Oregon should live under the law just like every other State in the \nNation. In 49 States, you cannot use these drugs right now--you cannot \nuse them in Arkansas or in any other State in the Nation because they \nare Federal controlled substances and they can only be used for \nlegitimate medical purposes. You cannot use the drugs in assisted \nsuicide except in Oregon because the Attorney General says maybe it is \nOK.\n  The law says you can use them to alleviate pain but not assisted \nsuicide. We put that in the bill. I mention that to my friend from \nNevada and my friend from Oregon. It is awfully important that people \nunderstand the substance of this legislation, and this\n\n[[Page S11216]]\n\nlegislation would not have a chilling impact. We would not have all \nthese organizations from the American Medical Association to the \nAmerican Hospice Association supporting this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to review the letters Senator Wyden and I have \nprovided to further complement their knowledge on this issue. I urge \nthem to review the materials we are printing in the Record, and I urge \nthem to support this bill.\n  I am proud of the fact that 40-some colleagues, maybe 38 now--maybe a \ncouple names were removed--support this bill; Democrats and Republicans \nsupport this bill, including Senator Lieberman, who testified with me \non a couple of occasions on this bill. I look forward to its adoption \nand enactment this year.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could say to my Democratic colleagues, \nwe have a number of people who have indicated a desire to speak on this \nissue prior to 3:15. And we appreciate the effort made by the Senator \nfrom Oregon. We have Senator Lincoln, to whom we are going to yield 5 \nminutes; Senator Bayh, to whom we are going to yield 5 minutes; Senator \nTorricelli, 10 minutes; and Senator Dorgan, 10 minutes; Senator Baucus, \n10 minutes; Senator Conrad, 12 minutes.\n  Each minute they are not here means their portion of the share of \ntime will be lessened because we are next in line to speak, and there \nis no one on the Republican side to speak. The time I have allocated \nhere will use up basically all of our time. There will, of course, be \ntime after the 3:15 vote where people can come and speak on any issue \nthey desire. But I have announced to the Senate those who have \nrequested time. Unless there is some other arrangement made, those who \ndesire to speak prior to 3:15 will not be able to do so until after \n3:15.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and request that \ntime be allocated between both sides evenly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will come to the \nfloor and express themselves about this legislation. I know a number of \nour colleagues have indicated an interest in being heard.\n  I note that it is my hope we can still get votes on both the tax bill \nas well as the Commerce-State-Justice bill today. We need to move this \nprocess along. We are now less than 2 weeks away from the election. \nThere is a lot of work that remains prior to the time we leave. It \nseems to me we ought to be maximizing each day. That is why the \nPresident has insisted on 24-hour continuing resolutions.\n  I have just had a conversation with the majority leader and noted my \ninterest in our effort to try to resolve these matters today so we can \nmove on to other outstanding issues. We talked earlier about the \nimportance of trying to bring some resolution to both bills.\n  The Commerce-State-Justice bill could be resolved, certainly, by \nMonday. If we can vote on it, and move it along, I think that behooves \nus and certainly accords us more of an opportunity to ensure that we \ncan resolve these matters at a time that would allow us to bring \nclosure to this whole session of Congress.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. One, I thank my colleague from South Dakota, the \nminority leader, for his statement. I think that would be a great idea. \nWe need to pass these conference reports, and send them to the \nPresident. Somebody said, there is a veto threat on one or two of them, \nand on Commerce-State-Justice. I think there is some work going on \nright now, and some things could happen that would make it possible for \nthat bill to be signed.\n  I do not know if the President has threatened to veto the tax bill. \nRegardless, we need to get these completed. It would be great if we \ncould get them completed today or on Monday or Tuesday, but if we could \ndo it today, I think it would be in the interest of all of our \ncolleagues. Certainly, I know Senator Stevens doesn't think it would be \nhumanly possible to get the Labor-HHS bill out before Tuesday, but if \nwe could clear everything else but for the Labor-HHS bill, that would \nsimplify all of our work. I think it would be a real positive thing for \nour colleagues. So I would be happy to work with my friend and \ncolleague to try to make that happen.\n  Senator Stevens suggested, knowing that Labor-HHS could not be \ncompleted until Tuesday for a vote, extending the time for the \ncontinuing resolution until Tuesday so we do not require everyone to be \nhere. A lot of us will be here Saturday and Sunday and Monday. But to \nbe, one, respectful of religious holidays on Saturday and Sunday, and \nto accommodate people's schedules, is there support on both sides to \namending the continuing resolution--and saving taxpayers some money so \nwe do not have to go through performance sessions--to amend the CR to \nmake it go through Tuesday?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will respond, if I could reclaim my time, and say that \nI know the President has expressed concern on several occasions about \nthe tendency for those of us who serve in the Congress to leave and \nthen not to come back until close to the end of whatever CR timeframe \nwe have been allotted. I think that is the President's concern, that if \nwe were to go to Monday or Tuesday, most likely we probably would not \nrevisit these questions until Monday or Tuesday. But we can certainly \ndiscuss the matter at greater length and attempt to see what \nopportunities for real progress we are going to be making.\n  We are now 28 days into the new fiscal year, and we still have a lot \nof work, especially on appropriations bills, that remains to be done. \nSo it would be my hope that we could maximize every day.\n  And he is right; it is very rare that we have met on Saturdays--or \nSundays, for that matter. It would not be our intention to make a \nregular practice of it, but these are extraordinary circumstances, \nwithout a doubt. I think each day should be used, with the maximum \nopportunity that each day affords us, to try to resolve these issues \nand get our work done. I don't like staying. I had plans this weekend \nmyself. I was going to go home to South Dakota. It does not appear that \nis going to be possible. But I would say, certainly, if we are here we \nought to be maximizing the use of our time. I think that is what the \nPresident intends. Certainly, we ought to attempt to do as well with \neach day that remains.\n  I would also say that we ought to go into this with an attitude that \nwe are going to complete our work successfully. There is no reason why \nwe cannot finish C-J-S. There isn't any reason we cannot finish Labor-\nHHS. There isn't any reason we can't come to an agreement on the \nremaining outstanding issues.\n  There is very little disagreement about the need to address each of \nthese issues. We know we have to address education in the \nappropriations bill. We know we have to address the Balanced Budget \nReform Act and the extraordinary problems that our health facilities \nare facing. We know we have to face and address the issues having to do \nwith Commerce-State-Justice and especially immigration.\n  So there are a lot of issues that demand we stay and resolve them. I \nthink we ought to use the weekend to keep negotiating, to try to find a \nway to resolve these matters, before we get well into next week. \nBasically, I think the bottom line for many of us is, if we can make \nthese bills more fair, if we can address fairness with regard to \nimmigration, if we can address fairness with regard to the BBA bill and \nthe tax bill, if we can address fairness with regard to education and \nschool construction--if we can do all that in a fair and meaningful \nway, we can resolve these matters and be done by the middle of next \nweek.\n  There is no reason why we should not. It seems to me we waste \nopportunities by allowing Senators to leave town and expect somehow \nthey will come back. But I am certainly more than willing to talk about \nit and see if\n\n[[Page S11217]]\n\nwe can make the most of what days remain.\n  Mr. REID. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, no one in the Congress has worked \nharder than you have. So I know you, as much as anyone, would like to \nhave this session end. But I do say, in response to my friend from \nOklahoma about working the weekend--now, I am not an expert in \nreligion; we have a Chaplain and others to take care of our \nprofessional aspects of religion--but I do know that even in biblical \ntimes, when the ox was in the mire on the Sabbath, you had to help get \nthat animal out of the mud. I think that is what we are in now.\n\n  It may be necessary that we work on Sunday; We have so many things \nleft to do. I agree with the minority leader. These breaks don't have \nus doing the work that we need to do. We need our attention focused on \ncompleting Commerce-State-Justice, doing this tax bill, and doing \nwhatever needs to be done on bankruptcy, if, in fact, anything is going \nto be done. There are a number of items we have to do. The minute we \nsay we are not going to do anything until Tuesday, Washington is \nvacated and nothing is done.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the minority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment both my colleagues and say \nthat everybody who has an ox in the mire, who is working on the \nappropriations bills, on BBA adjustments, or on the tax bill, ought to \nstay here until we have those bills totally complete--that includes \nSaturday, Sunday, and Monday--and have our colleagues come in and vote \non Monday or on Tuesday. I just don't think it behooves us to have the \nentire Senate in on Saturday and Sunday. I will be here. I might be \nwatching the football game on Saturday. But for those people who are \ndirectly involved in the negotiations, they need to be here, period. We \nneed to get these wrapped up.\n  I also heard my friend from South Dakota address several issues that \nremain and if we give him everything he wants, we can go home. That is \nnot going to happen. But we might as well find out that is not going to \nhappen on Friday or Monday or Tuesday as have it continue. I look \nforward to working with both my friends from Nevada and South Dakota on \nthe remaining bills. We have about four bills left--five, if you count \nbankruptcy and split the appropriations. We need to finish them one way \nor the other. We need to vote on them and dispose of them. I will work \nwith my colleagues.\n  I would appreciate serious consideration to assist our colleagues to \nextend the CR. You mentioned the President stated he always wanted a 1-\nday CR. All that is going to do is cost the taxpayers money to have the \nentire Senate come back in and vote on Saturday and Sunday. We need to \nhave the negotiators stay here Saturday and Sunday and complete the \nwork.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I could just respond, I will probably \nhave to agree to disagree. I suppose you could argue that we have spent \na lot more money over the last 27 days than most of us realized in \nkeeping the Senate in session as long as we have. We have been in, in \nlarge measure, because we haven't been able to complete our work. One \ncould argue if we would have used the days we had available to us more \neffectively, we wouldn't be here today.\n  As to the President's insistence on trying to find compromise, I \nguess this isn't a matter of whether the President gets all he wants. \nThis is a President who has said on numerous occasions we are making \nprogress in coming together. Let us keep at it. Let us try to find a \nway to resolve these issues. I am not asking for everything I want, but \nI don't expect the Republican leadership to get everything they want.\n  The essence of good compromise is give on both sides. We haven't seen \nthat. That is the essence of the concern we have on this side, the lack \nof fairness, not only with regard to any real void in bipartisanship in \nputting the tax and BBA bill together, but the consequences of having \ndone so without constructive engagement, consequences that led somebody \ninadvertently, I assume, to leave out the minimum wage entirely, to \nnullify the minimum wage for 6 months. That is what happens if this \nbill passes. It is going to be nullified for 6 months. I know that that \nwas not intended, but that is what happens.\n\n  To reference bills as are referenced in this two-page conference \nreport with no real ability to read it thoughtfully, to carefully look \nthrough it, ought to give everybody pause.\n  I know one of the points raised by our colleague from Alaska \nregarding the appropriations bill is that he needs up to 20 hours to \nread, whenever it is agreed to, the Labor-HHS bill, the last \nappropriations bill to be addressed. That Labor and Education bill, if \nit is read by the Senator from Alaska, will at least assure that one \nSenator in this body has had a chance to read it from front to back.\n  Nobody had that opportunity with this bill. There was no 20-hour read \nof this bill, in part because there was no bill. This is a reference to \nfive bills. There was no careful consideration of what went into this \nlegislation. Nobody knows. We are shooting entirely in the dark. We \nhave no appreciation of what is in this bill. What we do know is that \nsome things were inadvertently left out. What we do know is that when \nit comes to school construction, we fall $10 billion short of what \nought to be a minimum in the commitment we make to school construction \nthis year.\n  This country has a deficit in infrastructure of $127 billion, a $127 \nbillion backlog in school construction alone. What we have said is, \nlet's require the States and the school districts to come up with at \nleast $100 billion of that responsibility, but why not do for schools \nwhat we do for courthouses and airports and highways. Let us help \nschool districts. Let us help States provide the funding mechanism that \nwill allow them to refurbish and rebuild and construct new schools.\n  That is part of the debate. That is part of this fairness question \nthat is at the heart of the debate regarding the tax bill. Is it fair? \nThat is the question. Is it fair to provide three times more in \nbusiness lunch deductions than it is school construction? That is what \nthis bill does. Three times more goes to business lunch deductions than \nwe are prepared to commit to school construction. I don't think that is \nfair.\n  We can argue a lot about whether it is fair to give more to the top 5 \npercent of all taxpayers than we do the bottom 80. One can argue that \nis a legitimate thing to do in public policy. But is it fair? I don't \nthink anybody could argue it is fair to give the top 5 percent more in \ntax benefits in this bill than the bottom 80, but we are doing that. \nAgain, it is a question of fairness.\n  The question is, too, Is it fair to have two pots of money--one for \nhospitals, one for clinics, one for hospice, one for all the medical \nand health facilities all over this country--and say: We have a limited \namount of money to spend, and we are going to split that amount into \ntwo pots. We are going to give a third of all the money to HMOs at the \nexpense of all these health facilities.\n  The HMOs are leaving States by the dozens. We are going to pay ransom \nto those HMOs to try to keep them in the States when they have already \npublicly announced they are leaving. The question is, Is it fair to \nsay, no, hospital administrator, no, clinic administrator, no, hospice \ndirector, you can't have the money we are going to give to HMOs, even \nthough you may go bankrupt, even though you may close your doors?\n  That is not fair. And it is a question of fairness. It is a question \nof priorities. It is a question of how we do business around here and \nthe fairness of excluding half the Senate as these decisions are being \nmade.\n  It is really a question of good management as well, when you leave \nout the minimum wage law, when you nullify that law for 6 months \ninadvertently. I think the speaker had it right. I won't use the phrase \nhe used. He said ``half,'' I will say ``baked.'' He said, when you \ndon't use the committee process, you have a half-baked process. Well, \nhe was right because it is half baked. This work product doesn't \ndeserve support. Because it doesn't deserve support, it will be vetoed. \nAnd when it is vetoed, I hope we can come back and do it right.\n  I hope we can say that in the name of fairness we are going to \nprovide more help to health facilities, in the name of fairness we are \ngoing to provide better\n\n[[Page S11218]]\n\nbalance in the Tax Code, in the name of fairness we are going to do \nbetter on school construction, in the name of fairness we are going to \nallow everybody in the room as we make these very critical decisions. \nFairness dictates at least that. That is the essence of this argument. \nThat is why it is important. It is what we should do. It also goes to \nthe whole question of other things we should do. We talked about it \nearlier today.\n  There is so much in unfinished business that we could have \naddressed--unfinished business relating to the Patients' Bill of \nRights, prescription drugs, gun safety. None of those issues was \naddressed. That leads, of course, to the question of how long, if we \ndon't address these and all the issues relating to fiscal \nresponsibility, can we assure that this prosperity continues?\n  There are two very fundamental differences in philosophy and approach \nenunciated in large measure by our two Presidential candidates. \nGovernor Bush has articulated a particular position that, as it bears \nscrutiny, begs the question: How soon will we be right back to where we \nwere 10 or 15 years ago?\n  The American Society of Actuaries answered that question yesterday. \nThey said--not a Democrat or anybody here in the Congress, but they \nsaid--having scrutinized the Bush proposal, we would be back into \ndeficits similar to what we experienced in the 1980s by the year 2015 \nand that we would end the fiscal progress we have made for the last 3 \nyears. It would be gone. If you pass the Bush tax plan, pass the Bush \nSocial Security plan, you are right back smack in the middle of \ndeficits as we were before. That is one approach. Again, as I say, that \nis not our analysis; that is not our report. That report is by the \nAmerican Society of Actuaries.\n  Mr. President, I see that other colleagues are on the floor. I want \nto respect their right to be heard as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I will yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Mexico, Mr. Domenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n20 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this bill, H. R. 2614 contains three \nimportant titles: A Medicare and health package to improve the \ninfrastructure of our health care delivery system; a tax relief package \nand the small business bill.\n  The tax package is $295 billion over ten years. It includes:\n  $35 billion in small business tax relief;\n  $88 billion in health and long term care tax relief;\n  $46 billion in Pension and IRA tax relief;\n  $7 billion in school construction tax provisions and\n  $25 billion in Community Revitalization provisions.\n  The package also includes a repeal of the telephone tax which will \nsave consumers $55 billion over ten years.\n  I am very pleased that this bill includes an IRA Pension Security \npackage. At a time of unprecedented prosperity, it is a startling to \nrealize that most Americans have only saved about 40 percent of what \nthey will need for retirement.\n  Another frightening fact: Americans, in the aggregate, borrow more \nthan they save.\n  The pathetic truth about our tax code: Our federal income tax code is \ndown right hostile to savings and investment. Therapeutically, the bill \nbefore us today is a step toward eliminating some of that hostility.\n  Fact: The baby boom generation is aging. Americans are living longer, \nand yet, there has been no growth in pension coverage for the past 2 \ndecades.\n  Half of the American work force today--70 million Americans--do not \nhave a 401 (k) or any kind of pension plan. The problem is much worse \nfor people who are small business persons. Only 19 percent of small \nbusinesses with 25 or fewer employees have any kind of pension.\n  To address this dire situation Chairman Roth and the joint leadership \nhave developed a package of IRA and pension simplification provisions \nthat are excellent tax and pension policy.\n  The bill includes $46 billion in tax benefits for IRAs to make more \npeople eligible and so that they can save more in their IRAs.\n  The bill increases the IRA contribution limit from $2,000 to $5,000. \nContribution levels were set 20 years ago and they need to be updated.\n  This bill will increase the current law IRA contribution limitations \nto $5,000 over three years in $1,000 increments;\n  Increases the income limits for contributions to Roth IRAs for joint \nfilers to twice the limit for single filers.\n  It increases the income limits for those eligible to make a rollover \nfrom a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA to $200,000.\n  This bill strengthens our pension system. And its expands \nopportunities for Americans to get pension coverage especially women. \nAs we know, women live longer than men but only 32 percent of women \nhave pensions as compared to 55 percent of men. This bill includes \npension catch-up provisions for workers over the age of 50. This is \naccomplished through an accelerated contribution mechanism. Older \nworkers, especially women who return to the work force would have the \nopportunity to build up their retirement nest egg more quickly. Under \nthis bill women who have left the work force, perhaps to be stay at \nhome mothers, and then reenter the workforce later in life, can \nincrease their pension contributions to make up for the time when they \nwere not in the workforce.\n  This legislation modernizes our pension laws to meet the work \npatterns of today's more mobile workers. Defined contribution plan are \nmade portable so workers can move their retirement nest egg from one \ntype of pension plan to another as they move from job to job.\n  This bill allows workers to become vested in their pension plans more \nquickly. The vesting period is the amount of time a worker must stay at \na job in order to take his employee and employer contributions with him \nwhen he changes jobs. Instead of the current law vesting period of 5 \nyears, this bill would shorten the period to 3 years. This means that \nif a worker changes jobs after three years he can take his entire \npension benefit contributions with him and roll it into the pension \nplan at his new job.\n  Small business tax relief is also provided in this bill and it is \ncoupled with an increase in the minimum wage. This package is similar \nto an amendment I offered to the bankruptcy bill last year. It is a \nsound and balanced package.\n  Nationwide, 1.6 million workers are paid the minimum wage. In my own \nstate of New Mexico, roughly 5 percent of all workers (or 40,000 \ncitizens) are paid at or below the minimum wage. I think we should give \nthese workers a raise. However, it is important that we do so in a way \nthat generates the least amount of hardship on small business. That is \nwhy I'm pleased that this bill will increase the minimum wage by $1.00 \nper hour over the next two years, bringing it to $6.15 by 2002 and \nincludes a package of small business tax cuts that will help small \nbusinesses create more and better paying jobs.\n  I would submit that a key reason for modestly raising the minimum \nwage is to ensure the continued success of the historic welfare reform \nlegislation passed by Congress in 1996. I would note that nationally \nsince the March of 1994 record high welfare caseload of almost 5.1 \nmillion families the 1996 welfare reform legislation has reduced the \nnumber of families receiving assistance by 48 percent to about 2.7 \nmillion.\n  However, as we ask more and more people to get off welfare rolls and \nonto employment rolls, we must have a minimum wage that reflects the \nreality of the marketplace. My point is simple, if these individuals \nare to continue as productive members of the workforce, we must ensure \nthe minimum wage at least keeps pace with inflation. For instance, in \nthe New Mexico the average hourly earnings of an individual working in \nretail has increased by one penny over the past year.\n  I would also like to take a minute and briefly discuss the impact of \na minimum wage increase on New Mexico. From 1990 to 1996 the median \nhousehold income actually fell almost $5,000 to about $25,000. Let me \nrepeat that, the median household income in New Mexico has actually \nfallen and not surprisingly the percentage of New Mexican's\n\n[[Page S11219]]\n\nliving below the poverty level has increased fro 20.9 percent to 25.5 \npercent.\n  Sadly, New Mexico ranks near bottom nationally in terms of personal \nincome per capita and median household income and conversely near the \ntop in terms of people living below the poverty level. I do not believe \nfor one minute the minimum wage increase will solve all the ills facing \nNew Mexico, but I do believe it is a good first start.\n  Let me briefly describe the small business provisions included in the \nbill.\n  Above the line deduction for health insurance expenses for families \nwithout employer-provided coverage: Under current law corporations are \nallowed to write off 100 percent of their health insurance costs, but \nworkers without an employer-subsidized plan get no deduction unless \nthey itemize and have total medical costs exceeding 7.5 percent of \ntheir adjusted gross income.\n\n  Most middle class American's don't itemize, and of those who do, few \ncan meet the 7.5 percent AGI test to get any tax relief for health \ninsurance costs. This bill provides an above-the-line deduction \n(available whether you itemized or not) for health insurance costs for \nindividuals whose employers do not pay for more than 50 percent of the \ncosts of coverage.\n  Under the bill, workers may deduct 25 percent of costs in 2001-2003; \n35 percent in 2004 ; 65 percent in 2005 and 100 percent thereafter.\n  One hundred percent Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction will \nhelp 11 million people who are self employed.\n  If a person is doing business as a corporation, health insurance is \n100 percent deductible. This means that the corporation can provide \nhealth care insurance with pre-tax dollars and that makes it much less \nexpensive to provide benefit to employees.\n  This is the way it has been for a long, long time. However, in 1995, \nif someone were self-employed he or she would not be allowed to deduct \nhealth insurance costs because the law lapsed. For several years now, \nCongress has been trying to increase the deduction for the self \nemployed.\n  Under the tax law currently in effect 60 percent of their health \ninsurance costs is deductible for the self-employed. There is no tax \npolicy justification for treating corporations one way and the self-\nemployed another.\n  The majority of all businesses in this country are self-employed.\n  These are often firms with very little cash, a good idea and talent \nstruggling to make a success. Once they do succeed, they are the ones \nthat create nearly two out of every three net new jobs. These small \nfirms have sustained this job creating record for more than twenty \nyears. Clearly, the tax code should not treat them so shabbily.\n  The need for the deduction is indisputable. Unincorporated business \nowners experience the worst of all possible worlds in the health \ninsurance marketplace. Usually they can only buy an insufficient health \ninsurance policy for a very high price and they are denied the same \nincentives and tax treatment enjoyed by incorporated, bigger \nbusinesses. If this legislation becomes law, the self-employed will be \nable to take 100 percent deduction for their health insurance costs on \ntheir 2001 taxes. I am pleased that Congress is taking this step to \naddress the health insurance deductibility gap and to make it \npermanent.\n  Total deductibility has been a top priority of the various state \nsmall business throughout the country. In addition to tax policy \nfairness and job creation, restoring the deduction for the self-\nemployed is important because the self-employed are one of the largest \ngroups of uninsured citizens in America.\n  In New Mexico, there are 75,000 self-employed individuals about one-\nthird of them take advantage of the deduction. This number does not \ninclude farmers and ranchers who are an other group that will benefit \nfrom the tax law change we are making today.\n  The self-employed do not have high level incomes. Over 75 percent of \nthe self-employed have incomes of less than $25,000 and an additional \n13 percent have incomes between $25,000 and $50,000. Twenty-three \npercent of self-employed do not have health insurance.\n  We have as good an economy as we're ever going to have . . . but the \nnumber of uninsured has increased,'' said Chip Kahn, president of the \nHealth Insurance Association of America. ``The problem has gotten worse \nin good times, which means people are very nervous about what would \nhappen in an economic downturn.''\n  This conference report increases the amount that can be expensed from \n$20,000 to $35,000. Under currrent law, the amount that may be deducted \nis $20,000 to 2000; $24,000 in 2001 and 2002; and $25,000 in 2003 and \nthereafter. This change means an additional $15,000 tax savings for \nsmall businesses investing in new equipment next year. Small business \npeople will be able create more jobs because they will be able to \nexpense up to $35,000 of investment in any one year. This will lower \nthe cost of capital, and help with cash flow. I expect that the most \nlikely expenditure to be expensed is computer systems. Computers are \ncontributing significantly to the productivity of the American work \nforce.\n  The work opportunity credit, WOTC, provides a tax credit for wages \npaid to employees hired from one or more of eight targeted groups, i.e. \nindividuals receiving federal assistance. The credit is designed to \nencourage the hiring of hard-to-place workers. The work opportunity tax \ncredit replaced the targeted jobs tax credit which I helped author in \nthe 1970's. The bill extends the WOTC through June 30, 2004.\n  The bill also includes a provision that allows banks to pay interest \non business checking accounts. It's about time.\n  Business meals are one of the few ordinary and necessary business \nexpenses that are not 100 percent deductible. In 1993, the Democrats \nlowered the business and meal deduction from 80 percent deductible to \n50 percent deductible. This bill would reverse that trend. Restoring \nthe deduction to 70 percent will help waiters, waitresses, busboys, \nbartenders, bell hops, reservation clerks.\n  When the Democrats went after the deduction they said they were \ntargeting the three-martini lunch. But experience has shown us that \nthere have been many unintended consequences--consequences that we \npredicted. They meant to stop the three martini lunch, but it was the \nbusiness traveler who eats his own meals, whether eaten in a hotel, \ncoffee shop, or restaurant, or grabbed from a food cart that got the \nax. Most of the people purchasing business meals are self-employed and \nin total, 70 percent of those who purchase business meals have incomes \nbelow $50,000 and 39 percent had incomes below $35,000.\n  The last major section of this tax package that I would like to talk \nabout is the community renewal provisions. The bill would designate 40 \nrenewal communities, 12 of which are in rural areas. They would receive \nthe a 15 percent wage credit on the first $10,000 of wages paid per \nworker, an additional $35,000 of expensing; deduction \nfor revitalization expenditures capped at $12 million per community and \na zero percent capital gains rate on qualifying assets held for more \nthan five years.\n\n  The bill increases the low income housing tax credit and increases \nthe volume cap for private activity bonds that are very useful in \nattracting business.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely pleased this package also contains a \nhelping hand for our seniors. Today we are providing renewed assurances \nto our seniors that Congress is committed to not only the continued \nhealth of the Medicare program but, to improving the program.\n  The ``Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Benefits Improvements and \nProtection Act of 2000'' is a victory for our seniors and I commend my \ncolleagues and especially Leader Lott and Chairman Roth for all of \ntheir work on this measure. The package before us addresses the \ncritical needs of the Medicare+Choice program, skilled nursing \nfacilities, home health care, hospitals, rural health care providers, \nand the Medicaid program.\n  I am especially pleased the package contains the ``Medicare \nGeographic Fair Payment Act of 2000'' that will create a far more \nequitable reimbursement system for the Medicare+Choice program. The \nprovision will place states on more equal footing and begin to end the \nblatant discrimination against states, like New Mexico that deliver \nhealth care in an efficient manner. It means New Mexico seniors will\n\n[[Page S11220]]\n\ncontinue to have the option of sticking with their Medicare-HMO plans \nthat often offer more options, like prescription drugs, than the basic \nMedicare program.\n  Specifically, the package will increase the Medicare+Choice minimum \npayment floor to $525 a month per beneficiary in 2001 for all \nMetropolitan Statistical Areas, MSA's, with populations exceeding \n250,000. In New Mexico, the stakes are particularly high because \nwithout this provision 15,000 seniors will lose their Medicare+Choice \ncoverage on January 1, 2001.\n  Under the provision health care providers in the Albuquerque MSA are \ncurrently reimbursed at $430 per beneficiary and they will now see an \nincrease of $95 to create partial equity with other areas of the \ncountry. The result will be at least an additional $34 million for New \nMexico in FY2001, and at least $170 million over the next five years. \nAlso, the package will increase the payment floor for Rural Areas from \nthe current $415 to $475 in 2001.\n  However, the victory for seniors in New Mexico and across the country \nmay be very short lived because the President believes the legislation \nspends too much money on the Medicare+Choice program. I am utterly \nshocked and dismayed over the President's threat to veto this package. \nI would simply ask the President not to treat this hard-won compromise \nagreement as a political football. Too many lives will be affected on \nwhether this increased funding is made available to ensure continued \naccess to Medicare-HMO benefits, nursing home care or health insurance \nfor children.\n  The Clinton-Gore Administration is actually threatening to veto a \nbill that would increase spending on Medicare and help millions of \nseniors across this country. I find it very hard to believe that the \nPresident would want to veto a bill which: increases payment for \nhospitals, including teaching hospitals and rural hospitals; increases \npayments for home health agencies; and increases payments for hospices \nand other health care providers.\n  I would submit that spending money to end discriminatory practices \nshould never result in veto threats. There is simply no rationale for a \ndiscrepancy of an $814 reimbursement for Staten Island and $430 for \nAlbuquerque. It is especially unfair given the fact that seniors pay \nthe same Medicare premium no matter where they live.\n  I am also sure Benny Maestas of Santa Fe would disagree with the \nPresident's belief the package spends too much on the Medicare+Choice \npackage. I say this because the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper ran a \nstory about one of these seniors--Benny Maestas. Unfortunately, Benny \nwill lose his prescription drug coverage next year and be forced to pay \nseveral hundred dollars a month for his medications, instead of the $50 \nper month he currently pays for his prescription coverage through \nMedicare+Choice.\n  And it is not only seniors in New Mexico that will benefit, but \nseniors from all over the country. Let me name just a few of the places \nthat will get sizeable increases in their payment rates: Portland, \nOregon; Seattle, Washington; Fresno, California; Albany, New York; \nYork, Pennsylvania; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Fayetteville, Arkansas; \nBuffalo, New York, and many more.\n  I would simply ask the Clinton-Gore Administration, which of these \ncities do they not want to help?\n  I also want to state how pleased I am that we are once again \naddressing the need of Skilled Nursing Facilities, SNFs. Our action \ntoday will assure our senior citizens maintain continued access to \nquality nursing home care through the Medicare program. I believe the \nprovisions supporting SNFs are particularly important because \nnationally, almost eleven percent of nursing facilities in the United \nStates are in bankruptcy and in New Mexico the number is nothing short \nof alarming, nearly fifty percent of the nursing facilities are in \nbankruptcy.\n  I believe these provisions are especially important for rural states \nlike New Mexico, because many of our communities are served by a single \nfacility that is the only provider for many miles. If such a facility \nwere to close, patients in that home would be forced to move to \nfacilities much farther away from their families. Moreover, nursing \nhomes in smaller, rural communities often operate on a razor thin \nbottom line and for them, the reductions in Medicare reimbursements \nhave been especially devastating.\n  Additionally, not only does the package stabilize the Medicare \nprogram but, our seniors will be provided with new and improved \nbenefits. In addition to lowering out-of-pocket outpatient hospital \ncosts, the plan also offers new coverage for biannual pap smear \nscreenings and pelvic exams, medical nutrition therapy for patients \nwith diabetes and renal disease, and screenings for colon cancer and \nglaucoma.\n  I am also pleased the package addresses a critical funding problem \nwith the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, faced by \nforty states, including New Mexico. The Medicare-Medicaid package will \nallow New Mexico and other states to retain a majority of their unspent \nFY 1998 and 1999 SCHIP allotments until 2002 and use a percentage of \nthose funds to continue outreach and enrollment activities.\n  New Mexico's situation arose because the Heath Care Financing \nAdministration strictly implemented the SCHIP program and refused \nrepeated requests by the state to implement additional benefits. As a \nresult, New Mexico has only been able to use about $3 million of its \nSCHIP allocation. However, the provision in this package will allow the \nstate to keep about 60 percent of the $58 million it stood to lose this \nyear under the SCHIP program.\n  Mr. President, I was here for part of the discussion by the majority \nleader and minority leader with reference to this bill. I think he made \na few allusions to what soon-to-be-President Bush would do. First, I \nwant to say about this tax bill, for those who think we don't know what \nis in this bill, let me suggest that almost all of it has passed either \nbody, either the Senate or the House--every provision.\n  All of the small business provisions, which are wonderful for many \npeople who work for small businesses, passed the Senate. How do I know \nthat? It was my amendment. It was a minimum wage amendment that had on \nit all the small business tax measures, one of which is earth-shaking \nbut so simple that I don't know how anybody could be against it. Those \nwho vote against this bill are saying to those people who are employees \nand do not get their health insurance paid by their employer, if they \nhave the wherewithal to buy their own insurance, they can deduct the \ncost of that insurance. Now most people listening would say they \nthought that was the law all along; why would you deny that?\n  Businesses deduct the costs of health insurance, but individuals who \nbuy their own, who are employees and are not covered--which, I believe, \nis millions of Americans--will begin deducting the cost of their health \ninsurance, just as businesses do, on their own individual returns. \nRight now, they are precluded, unless they take it as the big \ndeduction, and then 7 percent of the money they earn has to be for \nhealth expenses.\n  Let me suggest that the minimum wage is raised in two pieces. It goes \nup one full dollar. That is what the President wanted. It is in this \nbill. To suggest that we would vote against this bill because there is \nan error in the bill regarding the effectiveness of the minimum wage is \na phony argument. That will be fixed probably before we leave. That \nwill probably be fixed in one of the appropriations bills. I could go \non.\n  Let me ask one question: What does the tax law of this land need more \nthan anything else? It needs provisions that tell Americans: You can \nsave more money for your retirement than you do today. This is probably \nthe most significant package ever passed to enhance the savings of \nAmerican people because the IRAs go up, and many other things they will \nbe using and are using will be enhanced dramatically.\n  The Democrats were up here arguing about retirement reform, in terms \nof having the ability to accumulate more savings for retirement time. \nThey talk about it. This bill does it. It does it in a very good way. \nFrankly, there are some things in this bill I would not favor. It is a \nvery large bill. This Senator remembers when we voted on a tax bill \nthat was brought to the Senate in a big cardboard box. That is not a \ngood way to do it. It happened to be a pretty good bill. But it was \nbrought over here by the Clerk of the House in a big cardboard box; it \nwas so big. It passed the Senate overwhelmingly because pieces and \nparts of it had passed\n\n[[Page S11221]]\n\nboth Houses and, more or less, everybody knew what was in it and \nthought it was a good bill.\n  One last observation. For those on the other side who are talking \nabout how late we are, I want to remind those who pay attention to us \nthat in the last 25 years, most of which have been controlled by that \nside of the aisle, we have completed our appropriations bills on time \nonly three times. That means every single Congress, in 22 out of 25 \nyears, was unable to get its work done by the October 1 deadline. I \ndon't know why. I seek to change that. I seek to make appropriations 2 \nyears and budgets 2 years. That might mean this won't happen in the \nfuture. But even that is hard to get passed.\n\n  So to those who think it is management and it is our Republican \nleader, let me say I think he has done an outstanding job. There has \nnever been a more political time in the closure of a Congress in my 28 \nyears here. The White House is playing politics to the hilt, the \nDemocrats are playing politics to the hilt, and then they blame \nRepublicans for not getting it done.\n  I believe the agenda to finish is an agenda that the Republican \nleader has in mind, and if we just get a little cooperation out of the \nPresident, we will get our job done. If he sits down there like a \ndictator instead of understanding that under the Constitution of the \nUnited States we have a very powerful right, and that is the purse \nstrings and the bills under the purse strings of America--he comes at \nthe end of the session and he wants all kinds of things, such as a \nmajor new immigration law. I might support it, but it obviously needs \nhearings and it ought to be worked on.\n  Now we are being told if you don't do that, you can't get the \nappropriations bill to keep the Justice Department open and the FBI \nsalaries. Maybe we ought to test the President on that one. Maybe he \nought to be permitted to veto the bill that pays the FBI, and other law \nenforcement, and the judges because he doesn't get one thing--just one \nitem--on the bill he wants. That item may be one he is looking at out \nthere and saying, let me be political and see if I can help Vice \nPresident Gore in his campaign.\n  I want to also suggest that the President of the United States is \ngoing to be vetoing this bill when it goes down to him, in spite of the \nfact that there are some real Medicare changes that help seniors across \nthis land. I believe we have made the case that HMO Plus is a good \nprogram in States such as New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Minnesota, \nand literally scores of cities across America. Why? Because the senior \ncitizen is getting more than he gets when he goes to the Federal \nGovernment for Medicare. In many cases, they are getting prescription \ndrugs, which we are arguing about giving them, too. They already get it \nunder HMOs in some parts of America.\n  I want to talk about New Mexico.\n  New Mexico is one of those States that has been discriminated against \nin the Medicare+Choice reimbursement. We were receiving such a small \namount that the HMOs are saying they cannot exist. And they have \nalready told thousands of senior citizens in New Mexico that by January \n1 they cancel out. That is because we have never had an adequate \nreimbursement. Why? Because when we passed the law, it gave the States \nessentially what is was costing them. In New Mexico, Minnesota, Oregon, \nWashington, and scores of other places the cost of health care was very \ncheap. So they gave us a very low rate of reimbursement while other \nparts of America got very large ones.\n  To put it into perspective, in New Mexico the HMOs were getting \nreimbursed at $430 per senior, while in parts of New York they were \ngetting $814.\n  We are asking that this discrimination stop, and the thousands of \npeople in New Mexico who have HMOs that perhaps give them prescription \ndrugs ask that you sign this bill so they can continue to have that \nkind of care and that kind of protection.\n  If it is vetoed, Mr. President, come January 1, in my State, everyone \nwho is going to be denied their current coverage, which they think is \nvery good coverage, can look to this White House and this President for \nsaying: I will not sign that bill--even though it has many provisions \nthe President likes. But he says the HMOs cost too much. He says the \nHMOs are big businesses.\n  Let me tell you, in my State, the three that deliver coverage are \nknown as Presbyterian hospitals--two are the St. Joseph's Hospital Plan \nand the Lovelace Plan. None of them are profit making, as I understand \nit. Two are charitable, and one is a foundation of sorts.\n  So, Mr. President, veto the bill. Say to the seniors in New Mexico \nwho are currently covered that we don't know what is going to happen to \nthem on January 1.\n  There are many other provisions in this bill, contrary to what the \nminority leader said, on the Medicaid side that are very good for \nhospitals and very good for rural hospitals. I am not an expert on it. \nBut this bill provides $31 billion in the first 5 years for Medicare \nreimbursement adjustments.\n  My friend is sitting here. Is it 31 over 10 or over 5?\n  Mr. GRAMM. It is over 5.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How can the President of the United States say he is \ngoing to veto the bill because of the Medicare provisions?\n  Actually, everyone knows that nursing homes need additional \nreimbursement. That is in this bill.\n  I could go on with each one of them.\n  I believe what is happening is that politics is walking up from \nPennsylvania Avenue into the Chambers of the House and Senate, and \npolitics from the White House is saying: You give me everything I want \nor you do not get the bills completed. And then the White House can \nsay: You didn't do your work. You didn't get your work done.\n  Let me say we will get our work done.\n  Mr. President, you just consider the compromise with us on some of \nthese. This is a good bill for the American people. I might like to do \nit differently. In fact, if this bill is vetoed next year, we will do \nit a lot differently. But for now, Mr. President, you cannot get \neverything you want in this kind of bill.\n\n  This one is not our President in the Senate. This is the President at \nthe other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. That President, not our President \nhere. You can't get everything you want, and when you don't get it, \nblame the Republicans for ``not completing their work.''\n  I want to repeat one more time that the Republicans have tried to \nlead this Senate and get its work done. For those on the other side of \nthe aisle who complain about not getting our work done, if you look \nback at the record, it has been the Democrats on that side of the aisle \nwho have been insisting on their agenda all year long. They get a vote \non guns; they want another one on an appropriations bill, or the next \nbill that comes through. They even held up the education bill because \nof guns.\n  That is the record.\n  The education bill that everyone touted was held up by the other side \nof the aisle who wanted their agenda of amendments on that bill.\n  I think our leader did the right thing. He wouldn't let them, after \nthey had their vote once.\n  So what happened? We don't get the bill. Who is to blame?\n  It appears to me that what we ought to do right now is sit down \ntogether and get this work done. And Democrats ought to tell the \nPresident of the United States, instead of concurring with him every \ntime and saying they are with him and to go ahead and veto the bill, \nthey ought to say to him: Mr. President, we have done a very good job \nin the closing moments to try to get our work done, and you ought to \nhelp us, President Bill Clinton, get our work done instead of \nthreatening us.\n  In fact, I am wondering about this business over the weekend with 1-\nday extensions of the appropriations process that has not been \ncompleted--1 day at a time. It is as if the President doesn't care \nanything about our leadership and what we think we ought to do. We have \nto come back every day to vote on a continuing resolution.\n  I have been here a long time--28 years. I have never seen a President \ndo that. As a matter of fact, I have never seen a President use \ncontinuing resolutions to get their way as this President has. They \njust didn't do it in the past.\n  It was kind of a sacred thing to sign appropriations bills and get \nthem done.\n  This President is on the way out. He is very desirous of electing \nVice President Gore. And we all understand that. But everybody knows \nthat the Justice\n\n[[Page S11222]]\n\nDepartment of the United States ought to get its money, the FBI ought \nto get paid, and all of those entities that are part of our criminal \njustice ought to get paid. They ought not be held up for one provision \nthat is really extraneous to that bill because this is an \nappropriations bill. There is an authorizing bill the President wants \non immigration. So the whole bill will die.\n  If they want to talk about who is to blame, then I submit to \nPennsylvania Avenue that it ought to be a two-way street. It ought not \nget down to the end where it is a one-way street or one or two or three \nprovisions that the President insists upon. We are close to completing \nthe people's business, one or two or three provisions that the \nPresident of the United States insists upon that we have offered \ncompromises on, and he says that or nothing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of the minority, I yield 5 minutes \nto the Senator from North Dakota. The Senator from New Mexico used 20 \nminutes. We will just use 15 minutes now.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, if you are asking, we are happy to yield 5 \nminutes. But the minority leader consumed a great amount of time. We \nhad people waiting. We would prefer to continue to go back and forth, \nif the Senator does not mind.\n  Mr. REID. I think the time the minority leader used is almost \nidentical to what the chairman of the Budget Committee used.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, what is the time remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 54 minutes. The minority has \n33 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I hate to admit this, but you are right. We will do that. \nHow long is the next speaker going to take?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I would be very happy to listen to Senator \nDorgan. I will learn something.\n  Mr. REID. I don't think that is possible. But would you think you \nwould mind listening to Senator Torricelli also for a total of 10 \nminutes?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Why don't we do Senator Dorgan, and I will speak. I think \nI have 20 minutes reserved.\n  Mr. BOND. Seriously, Mr. President, we are very tight on time and \nwould like to be able to continue to go back and forth. Many of our \nMembers are waiting.\n  Mr. REID. It will balance out the time. I understand. As I said, I \nhated to acknowledge that, but you were right.\n  Mr. BOND. That is a rare occasion. That should be noted with bugles.\n  Mr. REID. The minority yields 5 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas, \nMrs. Lincoln.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleagues for \nyielding.\n  In listening to the chairman of the Budget Committee, he has been \nwilling to work with me and I truly appreciate that. I thank him for \nhis graciousness in working with me. But in his comments, I would like \nto say, for me and for others, that this is really more of a missed \nopportunity. So much has been talked about in the Presidential debates \nabout bipartisanship.\n  I think all that many are asking for in this process is an \nopportunity to do exactly what the people of Arkansas elected me to do. \nThat is to come into this debate with the ideas and the issues and \nconcerns of the people of Arkansas. It is a missed opportunity for \nMembers to be able to express how we feel about these issues in this \nbill.\n  The people of Arkansas sent me to this Senate to represent them and \ntheir issues. When the President comes from the White House to debate \non these issues, I am not in that room nor are any of my Democratic \ncolleagues. We have missed the opportunity to very passionately \nrepresent the people who have sent us to this body to speak up on their \nvery behalf.\n  There are some good pieces in this bill. I am not here to say the \nother side doesn't know anything or that they haven't done anything \nright. All I am here to say is that the people who elected me to come \nto this body have been shortchanged because I have not been allowed a \npart of that process.\n  Mind you, I know I am on the bottom of the totem pole. I am not one \nof the higher muckety-mucks. The fact is, so many of the issues we hear \nare good for certain States; perhaps they are not good for our State. \nWhen we talk about Medicare+Choice in a State such as Arkansas that is \npredominantly rural, where Medicare Choice has pulled out in some \ninstances and left seniors without coverage, we are going to give one-\nthird of the funds in this bill directly to HMOs without any assurances \nfrom those groups that they will even stay in the Medicare program. Nor \nare there assurances that the HMOs will return to counties where they \nhave already pulled out or will maintain the benefits they promised to \nseniors. We cannot in good conscience give this large sum to HMOs \nwithout providing accountability. If the other side believes that is \nthe way to go, provide me the assurances that those HMOs are going to \nbe willing to come back into those areas where they have already pulled \nout.\n  Meanwhile, in most of the other provisions that are so necessary to \nother providers in our States, the bill receives only 1-year fixes for \nthe funding shortfalls.\n  This is a missed opportunity. No, it is not perfect. But it could be \nso much better for so many people across this Nation. It is our duty to \nstay here until we make it the best it can possibly be.\n  I support many of the provisions in the tax bill brought to the \nfloor. However, there are problems with the bill, and being able to \nprovide something that is the best that we can possibly provide for all \nindividuals out there is our responsibility. I am willing to stay here, \nMr. President, as long as it takes, to do what is right for the \nAmerican people.\n  We deserve to discuss the merits of the school construction \nprovisions in this bill. I want to do more for school construction in \nour country. Our schools, especially in the South, are crumbling around \nour students. The school construction provisions in this bill don't go \nfar enough. If Democrats were allowed in that debate on this issue, \nperhaps we could bring these provisions closer to what we really need \nto do.\n  What we really do need is something similar to what Senator Chuck \nRobb has proposed in his school construction bill. But the fact is we \nhaven't been at the table. We feel as passionately about representing \nthe people in our States as our Republican counterparts do. All we have \nsimply been asking is to be at the table.\n  And I also heard the majority leader say that he was willing to work \non Senator Landrieu's adoption language. Well, was she invited to the \ntable? Did he ask her what would be acceptable to her? There is no one \nmore dedicated to this issue than Senator Landrieu, and she should be \ninvolved in this discussion. When exactly will she be consulted? When \nthey call her name during the roll call vote?\n  I have been particularly frustrated that the Medicare BBA relief \nprovisions in this bill ignore the real bipartisan solutions that have \nbeen worked out between me and many of my colleagues throughout the \nyear. I joined my Republican colleagues in a press conference the other \nday on a crucial bill, the Hospital Preservation Act of 2000, a bill in \nthe Senate that has the support of 59 bipartisan cosponsors but it is \nleft out of this package. This bill would restore full inflationary \nupdates in Medicare hospital payments and is supported by hospitals \nacross the country.\n\n  Another bipartisan bill is also left out of this package. The Home \nHealth Payment Fairness Act of 2000, which has the support of 54 \nbipartisan cosponsors, would eliminate the 15 percent reduction in \npayment rates for home health services. This provision is very \nimportant to home health agencies in Arkansas and across the nation.\n  But the bill we are considering here merely delays this devastating \ncut for one year. This is not a long-term solution. Why spend time on \nshort-term fixes when we could correct this problem right now? We \ndelayed this cut last year for one year, and here we are again, in the \nsame boat. Let's fix this now. It makes no sense to keep postponing \nthese real solutions year after year and leave our health care \nproviders without the ability to plan their budgets for the long-term.\n  The bottom line is, this is a missed opportunity. The bottom line is \nthat we have been spending well over our surpluses while we haven't \nprovided for the essentials, predominantly the downpayment on our debt.\n\n[[Page S11223]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, there are two issues I wish to talk about \nand they are related to the two bills that are before the Senate. Let \nme begin with the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill.\n  As my colleagues are aware, we currently have a situation--Senator \nDomenici has been here longer than I have--that I don't ever remember. \nA President is threatening to veto a bill based on an issue other than \nwhat is in the bill. Obviously, there have been many vetoes as part of \nour constitutional process. But normally when we are dealing with an \nappropriations bill, it has to do with funding or not funding various \npriorities.\n  What we have before the Senate is an extraordinary circumstance where \nthe President of the United States is literally threatening to veto \nthis bill, saying if we don't add a totally extraneous matter that has \nnothing whatever to do with funding the law enforcement effort in \nAmerica, then he is going to veto the bill appropriating funds for the \ncriminal justice system and law enforcement in America.\n  What is even a greater paradox, in my opinion--I have to say, in my \nperiod of public life I have never seen anything like it--the President \nis saying, if we don't grant amnesty to people who violated the law, he \nwill veto a bill that funds DEA, the FBI, the Justice Department, the \nprison system. He is literally threatening if we don't pass a law \nforgiving people who violated the law by coming into this country \nillegally, if we don't grant them amnesty and therefore forgiveness for \nhaving violated the law, his threat to us is that he is going to risk \nshutting down the FBI, the DEA, the criminal justice system, the \ncourts, and the prisons.\n  That is an extraordinary threat. It is a threat that, I am happy to \nsay, is opposed on a bipartisan basis by at least one Democrat who \nhappens to be the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. It \nis opposed very strongly by many Republicans.\n  I want to say on this bill to our President, I want him to sign the \nbill funding our drug enforcement effort, the FBI, the prison system, \nour criminal justice system, our courts. I want to urge the President \nto do that, but I want to make it clear to him there is at least one \nMember of the Senate who is never going to grant amnesty for illegal \naliens to pay a political bribe to the President. That is what this \nissue is about. This is about electioneering, where the President is \nputting politics in front of people. He is willing to play politics \nwith law enforcement and the criminal justice system, to try to \npressure us to grant amnesty for law breakers.\n  I despair of trying to reason with the President in the waning hours \nof his administration, but I say again to the extent that any one \nMember can influence this decision, we will not grant amnesty to \nillegal aliens in this Congress or, hopefully, ever again. We did that \nonce. Everybody said it was a one-time deal. We were never going to do \nit again. The problem with doing it was we reward people who violated \nthe law. We reward people who came into the country illegally. Granting \namnesty to people who broke the law penalizes the millions of people \nwho are waiting to come to America legally. What we have proposed, and \nwhat is in the bill before us, is a provision which I believe is \nstrongly supported by the vast majority of Americans. That provision \nbasically says if you came to America legally, if you played by the \nrules, if you have been self-supporting while you are here, we will \nexpedite the process to allow you to bring your spouse and your \ndependent children. We are for family unification.\n\n  The President, by vetoing this bill, will be denying family \nunification.\n  We also say, where there is a legal dispute, a legitimate dispute as \nto whether people have gotten justice through the courts based on \nrecent court rulings, we give them their day in court because we \nbelieve in due process.\n  I do not need to say any more about this issue other than to simply \nsay I hope the President will sign this bill. I know he probably \nbelieves he is going to force us to grant amnesty to illegal aliens in \nreturn for funding the DEA and the FBI, but I want to tell him I am not \ngoing to support it, I am going to oppose it vigorously. There are many \nMembers of the Senate, I believe, who share my views. The President may \nwin it, but he is not going to win it without one big terrific fight. \nIn the end, I think nobody benefits from that kind of politics as \nusual.\n  I want to now say something about the tax bill that is before us. I \nwould have to say it is pretty extraordinary that the President picked \nout and attacked as a rich person's provision the one provision in this \nbill that I would have thought was absolutely unassailable. In fact, \nour President can say things with a straight face that Shakespeare's \nRichard III would blush in saying.\n  That is a strong statement, but let me give an example. As I am sure \neverybody in this chamber knows, the general pattern in America is, if \nyou have a good job, if you are making good wages, part of your \nemployment package is health insurance. I have the standard Blue Cross/\nBlue Shield policy. People who work for the Government are blessed with \ngood health insurance. People who make high wages in America get their \nhealth insurance through their job.\n  One of the good things in this tax bill is that we think it is wrong \nthat, if the Federal Government helps buy me health insurance, it is \ntax deductible; if General Motors buys health insurance for its \nemployees, it is tax deductible; but if somebody makes a low wage and \ntheir company does not provide health insurance, they have to buy their \nhealth insurance with after-tax dollars, they get no deduction.\n  In what I think is excellent public policy in this bill, we make \nhealth insurance tax deductible for everybody: For the self-employed, \nfor the small business person, and for the person who is working at $7 \nan hour and who is not provided health insurance where they work.\n  You would think that would be pretty unassailable, but it is not \nunassailable by Bill Clinton, because this morning on the radio, Bill \nClinton, through his spokesman, was saying that we are giving health \nbenefits to rich people by providing deductibility for health \ninsurance. I ask my colleagues, do you know any rich people who do not \nget health insurance through their jobs? Do you know any rich people \nwho do not get health insurance by being members of corporate boards?\n  The point is, this is a bill, at least in this provision, that is \ntargeted precisely at moderate-income people who get cheated in the \nsystem because their employer cannot afford to buy them health \ninsurance and they have to buy it with after-tax dollars. That would \nseem to me to be an unassailable position. But to Bill Clinton, it is \nhelping rich people and he is not for it.\n  The plain truth is, any tax cut in Bill Clinton's mind helps rich \npeople, so he is not for it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would you explain ``after-tax dollars''? Since you are \ntalking about millions of Americans who might buy their own insurance \nand get nothing today by way of tax relief, how will that work?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me tell you how it works. Let me take two individuals. \nLet's say one works for General Motors and one works at the Exxon \nstation in College Station. The one who works for General Motors gets \nhealth insurance as part of his employment contract. General Motors \nprovides health insurance and it is a nontaxable benefit to the \nemployee. So, in essence, the employee who works for General Motors \ngets health insurance and the company can deduct from its taxable \nincome the cost of buying the insurance.\n  Joe Brown, who works at the Exxon station changing tires, may work \nfor a small, independent filling station operator who cannot afford to \nbuy health insurance for the employees at the station. So for Joe Brown \nto get health insurance, he has to earn income, he has to take what is \nleft after the Government takes its share and then, with after-tax \ndollars, he has to buy health insurance for him and his family and he \ngets no deduction for the cost of his insurance.\n  What does it mean? It means if you are a high-income worker and you \nwork for a company that provides health insurance, the company gets a\n\n[[Page S11224]]\n\ntax break but if you are a low-income wage earner who has to buy his \nhealth insurance himself, you don't get the tax break. We think that is \nwrong. What this bill does, in its best provision, is it treats \neverybody the same and says Joe Brown can buy health insurance with \npretax dollars, just as General Motors can. It is expensive because we \nhave a lot of Americans, moderate-income people, who are now buying \nhealth insurance with after-tax dollars. We think it is a question of \nfairness. So we fix it in the bill.\n  What does President Clinton say? ``This is a provision that is \nhelping rich people.'' I just simply pose the question: Do you know any \nrich person who does not get health insurance through his or her job? I \ndo not know any. I have never met a poor person--excuse me--a rich \nperson like that; I have met plenty of poor people who do not get \nhealth insurance through their jobs--but I have never met any high-\nincome person who did not have health insurance through his or her job.\n  How the President can stand up with a straight face and say this \nprovision is for rich people, I do not understand. I also do not \nunderstand why the Washington Post and other people in the media write \nit in the paper, as if it were believable, that somehow people who buy \ntheir own health insurance because they do not get it through their \njob--principally low-income or moderate-income people--are suddenly \nrich merely because we are trying to treat them like everybody else.\n  Let me make one final comment about the tax bill before I run out of \ntime. Our dear colleague from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey--Democrat, for \nanyone who was not here listening--remarked that this did not look like \na Republican tax bill. In fact, he wondered what we were doing with a \ntax bill that looks like a grab bag of 300 different parts. Let me say, \nto be bipartisan today, he is absolutely right. But why do we have a \ntax bill that looks like a 300-part grab bag with one little provision \nhere and one little provision there? It doesn't sound very Republican. \nRepeal the marriage penalty, repeal the death tax, cut rates across the \nboard is what we want to do.\n  We have the bill we have because we have the President we have. This \nwas the only bill we had any chance of getting him to sign. He's vetoed \nthe others.\n  The President is threatening, and apparently being supported by \nMembers of his party in Congress, that he is going to veto this bill. \nLet me say to my colleagues, and say to the President, have at it.\n  The bad news is that Bill Clinton is going to veto this bill. The \ngood news is he is not going to be President next year. The good news \nis we are going to have a President, I believe, who will sign a repeal \nof the marriage penalty, a repeal of the death tax, and cut rates \nacross-the-board. And that is what we are really for.\n  So, Mr. President--and I am talking to the President downtown--we \nwrote this bill because we thought this was what we had to do to get \nyou to sign it. But if you do not want to sign it, veto it. I will vote \nto sustain your veto. I am going to be here next year. And next year we \nwill write a much better bill than this bill. This is like the threat--\nthe President reminds me of the guy who is holding a gun to his head \nand saying: Do what I say, or I will shoot.\n  ``If you do not legalize criminal activity, I am going to shut down \nthe FBI,'' he says. If we don't take this tax cut bill and write it his \nway, adding more and more of his provisions and fewer things that we \nare for, he says he is going to veto it.\n  I say: Look, free country. Bill Clinton is President. We tried to \nwrite a bill we thought would help America that he might sign, but this \nis not our bill. This is not our agenda. This does not represent our \nphilosophy. If the President wants to sign it, great. If he wants to \nveto it, veto it. But remember this. There is not going to be another \ntax bill. If the President wants to veto this tax bill, this is going \nto be the last tax bill this year because we are going to be back here \nnext year, we will have a new President next year, and we will produce \na better product.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before Senator Gramm leaves the floor, I \nthank him for this aspect of the bill that helps every senior in New \nMexico and across this Nation, 1.6 million, who have HMO Choice Plus. \nIn this bill, we have provided new reimbursement, increased \nreimbursement to those areas of the United States that were not getting \nenough money to stay in business. Can the Senator comment on whether he \nthinks that is good policy based upon choice and other things?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will comment on it in two ways. First, it amazes me that \nHMOs are the President's favorite whipping boy today. In 1993, you \nremember he wanted to put every American in a giant Government-run HMO. \nThe President is not complaining about how much we reimburse HMOs in \nNew York when they are reimbursed twice as much as what they are \nreimbursed in New Mexico. I wonder why he is not doing that. He says \nthere is something wrong with us trying to help competitive medicine \nstay in business in rural areas and in States such as New Mexico and in \nthe nonurban areas of States such as Texas.\n  Again, if you listen to the President, it sounds as if he is unhappy \nthat HMOs are getting all this money, but he is not unhappy that the \nHMOs in New York are being reimbursed at two times the rate of the same \nHMOs providing the same services in New Mexico. I think what he is \nsaying would have credibility if he were talking about the ones that \nhave high reimbursements.\n  If we were raising reimbursement in New York, he might have a \nlegitimate criticism, but what he is basically saying is we did not \nspend the money the way he wanted it spent.\n  Our President still does not understand that we have a system of \ngovernment where we do not serve under the President. We serve with the \nPresident. We are a coequal branch of Government, and that means give \nand take and compromise. It does not mean he can dictate to us. It does \nnot mean that the President is King and he can tell us what to do.\n  This threat that he is going to shut down the FBI and the DEA and the \ncourt system if we do not grant amnesty to lawbreakers I think, quite \nfrankly, is an outrageous threat, and I am ready to call his hand on \nit. It needs to be stopped. I do not think we should encourage any \nPresident, Democrat or Republican, to think they can just simply say if \nyou do not take totally extraneous legislation--it does not even have \nto do with spending money--and put it in this bill, I am going to veto \nthe bill if you do not do that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have been involved in some discussions \nconcerning one of the appropriations bills that remains to be acted on. \nI was listening to the debate here. I find that we are discussing, are \nwe, the amnesty provision?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I would like to have a few minutes to talk on that.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator have as long as \nhe would like.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. BOND. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I give him the remainder of my time, if I can.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Reserving the right to object, I certainly will not object \nas long as we conform to the 3:15 p.m. vote time. Rearranging the time \nthat remains between now and then is certainly the prerogative of the \nmanager. I just want to secure that time for the vote under the \noriginal UC.\n  Mr. REID. As I understand the request of my friend from West \nVirginia, he is going to use the remaining time of the Senator \nfrom Texas, which is how much?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 10 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. I don't think that will do the trick for Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Why don't you give him 5 minutes and then he will have 6?\n  Mr. REID. I have already explained to the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee, our former leader, that I have allocated all \nof our time. We do not have time left. I have explained it to him. He \nis not just asking now. It is not as if we are denying something to \nwhich he is not entitled.\n\n[[Page S11225]]\n\n He certainly is. He is going to speak on a provision most of us over \nhere like.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Do not run my time. Let me give the time I do have to \nSenator Byrd.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator only has that much time, I do \nnot want to take his time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would like him to take that time.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, that will not be enough. Let me say, it is nobody's \nfault but mine. I could not help being in the appropriations meeting. I \nhave been over to the House side twice, and both times the House \nMembers were not ready, not ready to sit down and discuss it. We are \ntalking about the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. I am not complaining, \nnot blaming anybody.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Texas has \nexpired. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nTorricelli.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield to me without his losing any of his \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have all the time committed on our side. \nI have some time. I can give Senator Byrd 1 minute of my time, but we \nhave people who are waiting to speak on our side as well.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I need 15 minutes. I do not know why we have \nto be out at 3:15.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from West Virginia, based upon the \ncompromise we originally had to vote at 3:30, a number of people have \nairplanes to catch. One of them, for example, has to introduce the \nformer Prime Minister of Great Britain. They have planes to catch.\n  Mr. BYRD. OK. As I say, I blame nobody. I am not complaining, except \nI think this is cramping us a little bit. I am going to vote against \nthis amnesty provision. I would like to speak a little on it. Maybe I \nwill not be able to. At some point today, I will be able to speak, I am \nsure of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I hope my friend from West Virginia \nknows that had I had the time, I would have been happy to yield to him. \nI did not have it.\n  I rise in opposition to the conference report and, unlike some of my \ncolleagues, I am not citing broad policy reasons or enormous \nconstituencies, but for a fight I have waged for almost 3 years, and \nthat is for 17,000 Americans who are going to die, are certain to die, \nwill be dead within a matter of 2 years. They are ALS patients. They \nhave Lou Gehrig's disease, and they are the victims of an unintended \nconsequence.\n  Under Medicare rules, there is a 24-month waiting period from the \ntime of diagnosis. Uniquely, with Lou Gehrig's disease, diagnosis is \ndifficult. Sometimes there is only a simple muscle pain for up to a \nyear, and then at the time of diagnosis, life expectancy is only 2 to 3 \nyears. So people facing the certainty of death and medical bills of \n$200,000 a year are unable to get a dollar, a dime, a penny of Medicare \nassistance while they are losing their lives.\n  This was no one's intention. It is a mistake. It is an error, and it \nshould be changed.\n  Earlier in the year, this Senate unanimously adopted my legislation \nto exempt ALS patients from Medicare's regulations.\n  Twenty-eight Senators have cosponsored the bill.\n  Yet in this conference report, despite strong support from the White \nHouse and this Senate on a bipartisan basis, the conference report \neliminates the provision and asks for a study--a study.\n  The Congressional Research Office has already done a study. I will \ntell you the study. When I introduced this bill, I stood with ALS \npatients outside the Capitol. Almost every one of them is now dead. \nThey lost their lives waiting for Medicare, and they never got it.\n  I will tell you the results of the study. There are now 17,000 people \nin the country who need this same 24-month exemption. If we return here \nnext year to argue this again, half of them will be dead, and they \nnever will have received any Medicare assistance.\n  My request is very simple. And I ask the support of the Republican \nleadership, as I have received the support of my leadership and of the \nWhite House: Give us a 24-month exemption so that these desperate \npeople can get this assistance and their families, in addition to \nlosing someone they love--a parent, a husband, a spouse--also do not \nhave to deal with this enormous financial responsibility.\n  It is a small and unique class of citizens. There is virtually no \nother disease in the Nation with quite the same circumstances--for \nwhich there is no cure, little treatment, and a certainty of death \nwithin the 24-month period.\n  There are desperate people across this country who thought when the \nSenate acted earlier in the year, they would at least have this relief. \nI believe they had reason to believe, given the bipartisan support, and \nWhite House support, when the conference report was written, this would \nhappen. Tragically, the conference report does not contain this relief. \nI cannot imagine anything more cruel to these families.\n  This has to happen. This simply must be done. I ask, again, that if \nthis conference report does not become law, and it is changed again, \nthat these victims of ALS have this numerically and financially \ninsignificant but personally overwhelmingly important relief from the \nMedicare rules.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished minority whip for the time \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for his \ncourtesy, and also the Senator from Idaho for his courtesy.\n  I want to speak today, just quickly, in response to the press \nconference which the President held in the Rose Garden approximately an \nhour and a half ago. The tenor of the press conference was that the \nCommerce-State-Justice bill will be vetoed because the White House had \nnot been allowed to participate in the negotiations on how the bill was \nput together.\n  I chair the Subcommittee on Commerce-State-Justice appropriations. I \nhave to say that I believe the President's statement is an inaccuracy \nof the most egregious level. The fact is, the White House, myself, \nCongressman Rogers, along with Senator Hollings and Congressman \nSerrano, representing the ranking membership on the committee, \nnegotiated with the White House for many hours relative to the \nCommerce-State-Justice bill.\n  The bill that was produced was agreed to in almost all aspects except \non issues of extraneous language that had never been in either bill, \nthat language was authorizing language dealing with immigration--the \nNACARA language, as it has come to be known. This was language that had \nnothing to do with the appropriations bill. It was authorizing on an \nappropriations bill. It has not been acted on in either committee. It \nwas, therefore, not relevant, appropriate, and would not be germane to \nthe bill under our rules. However, the White House wanted action on \nthat language.\n  As to the appropriations bill, his representation that the \nappropriations bill was in some way done in a back room without White \nHouse participation is totally fallacious. The fact is, the White House \nwas there at the table, negotiating. And because of the White House's \ninsistence on certain changes, this bill was changed. The White House \nasked for an additional $700 million. We agreed to it. We agreed to \nfully fund peacekeeping. We agreed to fully fund the COPS Program. We \nagreed to a number of funding increases which the White House demanded, \nas a matter of good faith, to move along this piece of legislation \nwhich is so critical to the operation of our Government.\n  Specifically, this bill, as has been mentioned before on this floor, \nrepresents the funding for almost all law enforcement activities at the \nFederal level. The FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Border \nPatrol, the Federal marshals, the U.S. attorneys, the U.S. court \nsystem--all of these agencies require funding. All of these agencies \nneed the funding in this bill to\n\n[[Page S11226]]\n\noperate effectively in our law enforcement community.\n  This bill also funds the State Department, the other Commerce \nDepartment agencies, and agencies such as the SBA, the FTC, the FCC, \nand the SEC, fairly significant agencies in our Government which need \nto operate.\n  For the President to claim that he has not been a participant in \ndeveloping this bill is absolutely inaccurate. It is an inaccuracy of \nthe worst sort because it is totally inconsistent with the facts as \nthey occurred.\n  They participated. We changed the bill to meet their desires, except \nin one area, the area of NACARA, which, by the way, has nothing to do \nwith an appropriations bill. This type of legislation should be taken \nup on some other bill, and by the Judiciary Committee where the \njurisdiction actually lies.\n  This bill, I am sure, will be vetoed because the President has \npromised to do so. The Administration will throw up a lot of other \nissues, but those issues were essentially settled--questions such as \nAmy Boyer's law. We accepted the two major items they wanted; on issues \nsuch as tobacco. We essentially said: We will no longer try to take \ncongressional control over how money is distributed to the Justice \nDepartment. You have $350 million to do with whatever you want, within \nthe Justice Department, and in the area of litigation. You certainly do \nnot need another $7 or $12 million earmarked to tobacco litigation. \nThey have plenty of money for tobacco.\n  Those issues are red herrings and would not be in play at all except \nfor this extraneous issue of NACARA. The President has once again used \nhis bully pulpit to mislead the American public on this specific issue, \nwhich is the question of whether or not the White House played a role \nin developing the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. The White \nHouse not only played a role, they had a significant impact.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Missouri.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada.\n  It is always interesting to me to watch how a legislative session \nends. None has ended, in my judgment, with less elegance and grace than \nthis one. It is now 26 days past October 1st. That is the date on which \nwe were to have passed appropriations bills and sent them to the \nPresident.\n  On the desk in front of all of us is the Calendar of Business, which \nsays that it is Friday, October 27. The legislative day is September \n22.\n  I just want to remind everyone why it says that, what we have on the \nfloor of the Senate, and why some people are chafing about where we \nfind ourselves.\n  What does September 22 mean? That is the day that a motion was filed, \na motion to proceed on an energy bill that the leadership never \nintended to proceed to--a motion to proceed on an energy bill.\n  Since that day, we have never adjourned. We have always recessed. \nWhy? Because that motion was designed to prevent any other activity on \nthe floor of the Senate, to prevent any single Member from offering a \nmotion, for example, or an amendment to deal with a Patients' Bill of \nRights. Yes, we have had a vote on that before, but there has been a \nchange in the Senate, as we know, and if we took that vote now, we \nwould win that vote. So how do you prevent that from happening? You \nprevent anybody from offering an amendment and having a vote--or on the \neducation issues that we have talked about. So that is what is going on \nhere.\n  This Senate has been blocked since September 22, so that the people \non the Democratic side of the aisle could not offer an amendment. And \nwe have not even adjourned. We are in the legislative day of September \n22. So 26, 27 days now have passed since October 1st, and we find \nourselves not having passed the appropriations bills. People stand on \nthe floor with great surprise, wondering, what on Earth is all the fuss \nhere? I cannot understand why things are not working very well, why \nthings are coming apart on us.\n\n  I will tell you why things are coming apart. Because this Congress \ndidn't get its work done. It was blocking the floor, afraid of \namendments, and then we reached the time when appropriations bills were \nsupposed to have been done. They are not done. Then the tax bill is \ncobbled together and stuck in this vessel called a small business \nauthorization bill. It is cobbled together behind locked doors with no \nDemocratic participation and brought to the floor of the Senate. And \npeople say: Gee, this is reasonable. Why would anyone object to that?\n  Does anybody remember watching the old western movies, the old \nspaghetti westerns where someone inevitably would ride into a box \ncanyon and then wonder: What on earth has happened to me? I am in a box \ncanyon. I am attacked from every side.\n  What happened is, you rode into a box canyon. That is exactly what \nthis Congress has done. It hasn't done its work. What it has done, it \nhasn't done well. And now it can't understand for all the world why \nanyone would object to cobbling together a tax bill on a small business \nauthorization conference and shipping it through here and not receiving \nobjections from us or from the White House.\n  Let's add up the numbers. Together these proposals for tax cuts \nrepresent the single priority of this Congress. It is around $1.4 \ntrillion. I may err on either side a bit, but it is somewhere around \n$1.4 trillion. We have an appetite by those who have no end of desire \nto cut taxes, most of which will inure to the upper income folks, who \nsay: Our fiscal policy is to move us right back into that same old risk \nof toppling this economy into the deficit ditch once again.\n  Our first priority ought not be large tax cuts for upper income folks \nand $1.4 trillion in tax cuts before we even have the surpluses which, \nincidentally, I don't think we will have for 10 years. We are not going \nto have 10 years of surplus. That suggests we no longer have a business \ncycle of contraction and expansion. But the first priority from the \nmajority party is to say: Let's have big tax cuts, and let's put them \nin law permanently right now.\n  Our priority is to say: That doesn't make any sense. Let's do a \ncouple of things. Let's pay down the Federal debt. If during tough \ntimes you run it up--and we did--then during good times, you ought to \nbe able to pay down the Federal debt.\n  There is no money around to pay down the Federal debt when you have \nthe majority party saying they demand $1.4 trillion in tax cuts.\n  Second, it seems to me reasonable that in addition to paying down the \nFederal debt, you want to make some investments that will bear some \nrewards for this country in the years ahead: invest in children, \neducation, invest in health care. That is not the priority; we don't \nwant to do that.\n  Third, yes, some tax cuts, but tax cuts that go to working families \nas well.\n  My friend from Texas a few moments ago said he would be happy to \nlisten to me. I know better than that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes is up.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will talk about tax cuts later. The point is, if we are \ngoing to have tax cuts, they ought to be targeted to middle-income \nfamilies.\n  We should not be surprised to find ourselves in this position on \nOctober 27, 27 days after we should have completed our work.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIdaho, Mr. Craig.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bond for yielding.\n  I have been listening to the Senator from North Dakota. I have to \nremind him by quoting his own leader. Here is what his leader said in \nUSA Today on September 8: We will stall the spending bills until we get \nour way.\n  I suggest to the Senator from North Dakota that he ought to listen to \nhis leader because his leader said it and that is exactly what is going \non at this moment.\n  Let me also say to the Senator from North Dakota, after all these \nspending bills and after this tax cut we are debating, we will pay down \nthe national debt by $700 billion. That is one whale\n\n[[Page S11227]]\n\nof an accomplishment. No, it doesn't go to bigger Government. No, it \ndoesn't go to create a new program. It goes to pay down the debt.\n  So between what his own leader has said and the facts of what we are \ndoing, let me remind the Senator from North Dakota, stalling your way \nthrough this session has complicated matters. The box canyon that he \nreferred to is a box canyon that his own leader created.\n  From USA Today: Senate Minority Leader Daschle, Democrat of South \nDakota, has a simple strategy for winning the final negotiations over \nspending bills: stall, until the Republicans have caved in because they \ncan't wait any longer to recess.\n  That is the reality of where we are. They have stalled their way into \na big problem. Now we will work the weekend, if we have to. We have to \nresolve these issues for the sake of the American people.\n  For just a few moments, let me talk about the tax bill that is before \nus. I so vividly remember the first Clinton-Gore campaign in 1992, \nrunning for election and saying: We will give America a middle-class \ntax cut. It was the mantra of their campaign.\n\n  Remember, they said in that banner during the campaign: It is the \neconomy, stupid; we have to make this economy work. And we are going to \nmake it work by giving a middle-class tax cut.\n  Well, let's remember what happened once they were elected. They \npushed through the largest tax increase in the history of this country. \nThe new bigger bite on the middle class included a fuel tax, a new tax \non Social Security benefits, a hefty variety of small business taxes. \nAnd when the new administration nearly pulled off the greatest scheme \nof all, and that was to nationalize one-sixth of our Nation's economy--\nthat was that great, new health care bureaucracy that became \naffectionately known across the country as ``Hillary Care'' that was to \ngive every American the opportunity to live inside the greatest HMO of \nall, a federalized Government health care program--when Americans heard \nthe detail of that, thanks to a few Senators and a few Congressmen on \nthis side of the aisle who stood up hour after hour and went through \npage after page of what Bill and Hillary Clinton were talking about, \nAmericans rejected that resoundingly.\n  We know what happened. America said things had to change. And they \ndid change in 1995; A Republican Congress was elected. Slowly but \nsurely, we have tried to roll back those massive tax increases. What we \nhave in front of us today is an installment in that effort. At a time \nof unprecedented surpluses, at a time when we are paying down $700 \nbillion on the debt and that side of the aisle does not want to give a \ndime back to the American taxpayer, shame on them. But then again, \ntheir Presidential candidate says: I need it all because I want to \nspend it all for all kinds of new Federal programs. That is the reality \nof what they are dealing with.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, may I interrupt to propound a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \nscheduled for 3:15 p.m. be changed to now occur at 3 p.m. and the time \nbe reduced equally for both sides of the aisle.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that immediately following passage of \nthe joint resolution, the Senate proceed to the conference report to \naccompany the D.C. appropriations bill, including the Commerce-Justice-\nState appropriations bill, the conference report be considered as \nhaving been read, and the Senate proceed to immediately vote on \nadoption of that conference report without any intervening action, \nmotion, or debate.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that statements throughout the day \nrelative to the appropriations conference report be placed in the \nrecord immediately prior to the adoption vote.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the votes at 3 p.m. be reversed \nso that the first vote occur on adoption of the D.C. conference report, \nto be followed by passage of H. J. Res. 117.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I would say \nto my friend, principally, Senator Bayh and Senator Conrad, that means \nthere will be no time for them to speak today. What remaining time we \nhave, which is about 7 minutes, would be for the Senator from Montana. \nI am sure his people will also have to cut back on their time because \nwe have equal allocation of time until 3.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, therefore, for the information of all \ncolleagues, the next votes will occur now at 3 p.m. There will be two \nback-to-back votes at that time. The time has been reduced on both \nsides.\n  I appreciate being able to interrupt the Senator from Idaho.\n  What is the time remaining under this reduced amount?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats will have 6 minutes, and \nRepublicans will have 13 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could, before we finish this procedural \nmatter, the minority would be willing to have a voice vote on the tax \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that during this process we have a voice vote \non the tax bill.\n  Mr. BOND. I object.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not appropriate to seek a voice vote at \nthis time by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me reclaim my time briefly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, because we have collapsed this time--and I \nthink appropriately so--and several colleagues need to be elsewhere \nlater today, let me close my comments.\n  Now some of our bills have been vetoed. We have yet to return to the \nAmerican people all the tax increases they suffered as the result of \nthe 1993 hike. But the last five-plus years also have produced a solid \nrecord of tax relief and IRS reform, thanks to Republican principles \nand bipartisan partnerships. Perhaps most important, that record \nhighlights the Democrat and Republican contrasting views of people \npriorities.\n  Decades of liberal government meant more and more Americans were \nover-taxed on the one hand, and more and more dependent on ``government \nprograms'' on the other. But a determined Republican Congress has been \nturning the tide, slowly but surely--even in the face of frequent \nvetoes and partisan obstruction--because it has believed in its mission \nof returning power to the people.\n  People are empowered when they can keep most of the fruits of their \nown labor, and use those resources to provide for families and their \nfuture the way they feel is best. People are empowered when the tax \nlaws are a help, not a hindrance, to them choosing and being able to \nafford a good education, medical care that meets their specific needs, \nthe right balance between work and family, and secure retirement \nplanning. People are empowered when the government--especially the tax \ncollector--respects the dignity and rights of the individual taxpayer.\n  The Republican-majority Congress has been making strong, steady, \nincremental progress in areas like these. While several major bills \nhave been vetoed, several have become law. Among them: In 1996, \nCongress enacted the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct. This law increased health insurance deductions for the self-\nemployed, created new Medical Savings Accounts so folks can set aside \nmoney for future needs, made it easier for workers to transfer from one \njob to another without losing benefits, allowed penalty-free IRA \nwithdrawals for medical expenses, and reduced the cost of long-term \nhealth care.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 included, among other things, the \n$500 per-child tax credit, credits and deductions for higher education, \nexpanded IRA limits and the new Roth IRA and the first significant \nsteps in death Tax relief for family-owned farms and small business.\n  The IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 finally began shifting \nthe burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS, required the IRS to \npay court costs more often, provided protection for innocent spouses \nfrom IRS collection efforts, and created a new, taxpayer-oriented \noversight board. The\n\n[[Page S11228]]\n\nSenior Citizens Freedom to Work Act of 2000 repealed the ``earnings \nlimit'' on the amount of outside income seniors of retirement age can \nearn without having their Social Security benefits cut.\n  That's a good record but--we can and should do more. The tax \ncollector should not be the uninvited guest at every wedding and the \nrude intruder at every funeral. But the Clinton-Gore Administration \nvetoed bills to repeal the Death Tax and the Marriage Penalty. I \npromise you, however, those issues will not go away. And now, in the \nwaning hours of the 106th Congress, we are hard at work on wrapping up \none more bill to provide tax relief to make health insurance affordable \nto millions of uninsured Americans, help more with retirement planning, \nhelp family farmers and small businesses, and encourage investment in \neconomically depressed areas. In a matter of days it will be up to the \nPresident to decide the fate of that bill, with his signature pen or \nhis veto pen. I hope, this time, he chooses power to the people over \npower to the tax collector.\n  I will conclude by saying this: This very meager tax package in front \nof us, which has been objected to so strenuously by the other side, is \na small step in trying to put money back into the pockets of taxpayers \nduring a time of unprecedented surplus. It is also an opportunity to \nfacilitate; that is, to allow small businesspeople and others who want \nto provide health care and to provide farmers and ranchers and other \npeople in agriculture the flexibility to do all kinds of positive \nthings.\n  But most importantly, the reason the gnashing of teeth and the \nwringing of hands has been heard so loudly on the other side of the \naisle is they don't want to give any tax cut. They don't want to \nprovide any of that opportunity. They want to spend it all and they \nwant to spend it all in a way that will grow Government and grow it in \na way that will reduce our freedoms and, most importantly, deny the \nAmerican taxpayer what should justifiably be theirs. Once you have \nbalanced the budget and you have a surplus, you ought to give just a \nlittle bit of it back--that is, the surplus--to those from which it \ncame.\n  With that, I yield the floor for other allocations of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, let me begin by noting a point made by the \nSenator from Texas. I urge all colleagues to change their plans to be \nhere for the vote at 3 p.m. I believe there are colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle with planes to catch. The sooner we can complete the \nvote at 3 o'clock, the sooner we will be able to go on to the second \nvote, and there are many colleagues on both sides who hear the engines \nwarming up and smell the jet fuel.\n  Mr. President, before I talk about this bill in particular, we have \nhad a lot of politics on the floor and that is where I think it is \nappropriate for us to have our political discussions. I think, as \nchairman of the Small Business Committee, we have been able to work on \na bipartisan basis on small business issues. But something is very \ndisturbing to me, and I want to call that to the attention of my \ncolleagues and to a much broader constituency. It is something that \nappears to be an attempt by this administration to politicize the Small \nBusiness Administration just days before the national election this \nNovember.\n  I call on the SBA Administrator to stop this effort. Yesterday, an \nanonymous employee of the Small Business Administration faxed to my \noffice a draft of the ``SBA Day Plan.'' It was faxed to the Small \nBusiness Committee staff.\n  According to the plan, in the week before the election, the SBA will \nuse personnel from its district offices to conduct a nationwide blitz \nof making small business loans, releasing media statements on the \nClinton-Gore administration accomplishments, and coordinating \nadvertising with 5,000 lending partners across the country. The \nwhistleblower who contacted us had one short message: ``This must be \nstopped.'' I agree. This must be stopped.\n  According to this SBA document, SBA allegedly plans a major public \nrelations campaign in the first days of November, right before the \nelection. SBA central office will make mention of the hundreds of \nevents going on all over the country. SBA regional and district offices \nwill publicize their local SBA Day events throughout their regions.\n  What wonderful timing. Does anybody want to guess what those days \nwill feature? Do you think they will mention the name of the Vice \nPresident?\n  Well, more disturbingly, SBA district offices will enlist and co-opt \nvolunteers from the Small Business Development Centers, Women Business \nCenters, SCORE Chapters, and U.S. Export Assistance Centers, to place \nat least one person in lender offices in branches throughout the \ncountry in the week before the election. I say co-opt because these \nSBDC, SCORE, USEAC, and WBC centers receive a substantial amount of \nfunding from SBA. It appears that the SBA may be using their private \nsector partners' dependence on SBA funding as leverage, pushing them to \ncarry out this SBA campaign plan.\n  SBA partners are expected to encourage local lenders to make joint \nmedia announcements with SBA. SBA private sector partners are also \nexpected to coordinate advertising regarding the SBA Plan Day at their \nlocal offices.\n\n       In particular, SBA district offices [are to] make every \n     effort to target lender offices in key communities (i.e., \n     Hispanic, African American, Asian, Native American, Export, \n     Women).\n\n  The most abusive part of this plan would be SBA's efforts to ``close \nor get commitments for as many new SBA-guaranteed loans as possible \nduring the week of October 30 through November 3, 2000.'' A followup \nnews release, of course, will publicize the success of this effort.\n  Is this a great country or what? When I read this plan, I was shocked \nat what I saw. This thinly veiled attempt by the administration to \npromote itself in the days before the election is an abomination. Too \nmany of us worked too long to allow the political manipulation and \nabuse of SBA resources, SBA personnel, and SBA partners with the goal \nof influencing the election.\n  As chairman of the Small Business Committee, I, along with the \ncommittee, have worked tirelessly on a bipartisan basis to promote \nsmall business development and success. This entire Senate has worked \non fostering small business growth as a top priority on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  Focusing the resources of the SBA and its programs and loans towards \nhistorically disadvantaged and underutilized communities has also been \na chief goal. This Senate passed the HUBZone Program overwhelmingly. It \nis now part of the SBA's programs to bring opportunity to areas of high \nunemployment and poverty. We cannot and should not allow SBA, in the \nwaning days of this administration, to be politically hijacked for an \nelection. Staging the events in the days before the election would \nspread a political taint throughout the SBA. This campaign plan will \nundermine the credibility of every SBA employee and partner. I don't \nwant to see that political destruction.\n  If SBA is serious about raising public awareness of SBA programs and \nservices--and I think that is a good thing to do--then it will do one \nsimple thing: Delay the SBA Day Plan for 1 month. They can begin it in \nDecember instead of November. That would avoid any hint of impropriety. \nIf however, SBA continues with the SBA Day Plan in the days before the \nelection, we have no choice but to conclude that a complete political \ntakeover of SBA had occurred with a goal of advancing the \nadministration's candidates in the November election.\n  I don't know if this SBA pre-election campaign has been coordinated \nwith the national political campaign or local political campaigns \nacross the country. Frankly, we don't need to know, if this issue can \nbe taken off the table right now. I urge SBA to remove any doubts and \npostpone this action. I have written to Administrator Aida Alvarez \nurging her to protect SBA from the taint of political interference.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter and the attached SBA Day Plan \nbe printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I say to all of the outside organizations \nand individuals who may be contacted by the\n\n[[Page S11229]]\n\nSBA, I hope they understand they are free to choose to participate or \nto not participate in any such activities if they are requested to do \nso. We intend to be around to continue oversight responsibilities next \nyear, and we will ensure that there is no reprisal against any SBA \nemployee or non-SBA employee who chooses not to participate in a \npolitical endeavor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Small Business,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 27, 2000.\n     Aida Alvarez,\n     Administrator, U.S. Small Business Administration, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator Alvarez: The purpose of this letter is \n     to express my alarm over the potential politicalization of \n     the Small Business Administration (SBA) in the days leading \n     up to the national elections on November 7, 2000. Employees \n     at SBA have brought to my attention SBA plans for a major \n     public relations campaign across the country in the first day \n     of November.\n       The Administration's use of SBA personnel, offices, \n     programs and private-sector partners to influence public \n     perception of the Administration only days before the \n     election raises the specter of a pernicious manipulation of \n     the federal government for political means. Most alarming is \n     the directive from SBA headquarters to make as many \n     government guaranteed loans as possible during the week \n     before election day. Putting taxpayer money at risk for pre-\n     election campaigning is totally unacceptable.\n       The ``SBA Day Plan'' received by my office details SBA \n     plans to:\n       Close or get commitments for as many new SBA guaranteed \n     loans as possible during the week of October 30-November 2, \n     2000;\n       Release media announcements by all SBA offices on the \n     success of these efforts;\n       Encourage [local lenders] to make joint media announcements \n     with SBA;\n       Coordinate advertising [with local lenders] regarding SBA \n     Day at their local offices/branches;\n       Place at least one person [from SBA District Offices, Small \n     Business Development Centers, Women Business Centers, Service \n     Corps of Retired Executives Chapters of U.S. Export \n     Assistance Centers] in lender offices/branches throughout the \n     country during the week of October 30-November 3, 2000; and\n       Make every effort to target lender offices/branches in key \n     communities (i.e. Hispanic, African-American, Asian, Native \n     American, Export, Women).\n       The work of the Small Business Administration is vital to \n     fostering small business across the country. I share your \n     commitment to bringing these benefits to historically \n     underutilized areas, which is why I sponsored and Congress \n     overwhelmingly passed the HUBZone program.\n       Therefore, I am sure you will agree that SBA should \n     reschedule its SBA Day Plan from the beginning of November to \n     the beginning of December. This would avoid any taint of \n     political manipulation. If you have any questions regarding \n     this issue, please contact Paul Cooksey at 224-5175. Thank \n     you in advance for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Christopher S. Bond,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              SBA Day Plan\n\n\n                                  goal\n\n       1. Raise public awareness of SBA programs and services and \n     the impact these have on local communities.\n       2. Tout SBA accomplishments and announce SBA loan numbers \n     for fiscal year 2000.\n       3. Kick off the new fiscal SBA year (2001) positively and \n     collaboratively.\n       4. Close or get commitments for as many new SBA guaranteed \n     loans as possible during the week of October 30-November 3, \n     2000.\n\n                                Concept\n\n     Week of October 30-November 3, 2000\n       SBA District Offices, with the collaboration of SCORE \n     Chapters, district SBDCs, USEACs, and WBCs, will place at \n     least one person in lender offices and branches throughout \n     the country during the week of October 30-November 3, 2000. \n     In particular, SBA district offices will make every effort to \n     target lender offices/branches in key communities. (i.e. \n     Hispanic, African-American, Asian, Native American, Export, \n     Women)\n       Local lenders will be encouraged to make joint media \n     announcements with SBA and coordinate advertising regarding \n     SBA Day at their local offices/branches.\n     Tuesday, October 31, 2000\n       Media Announcement by all SBA offices of year-end \n     accomplishments/loan numbers. A follow-up news release will \n     be made the following week regarding the success of SBA Day.\n       SBA central office will announce national accomplishments \n     and year end numbers for FY2000 and will make mention of the \n     hundreds of events going on all over the country kicking off \n     SBA's new fiscal year.\n       SBA regional and district offices will incorporate regional \n     and local accomplishments and year-end numbers for FY2000 \n     into the central office national announcement and will \n     publicize their local SBA Day events taking place at lender \n     locations throughout their region/district.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Very simply put, we have a tax bill before us which includes some \nprovisions that are unbalanced. That is unfair. There has not been \nanything that would approximate consultation between the majority and \nminority, including the White House. It is going to pass with a \nmajority vote. It is going to be vetoed by the President, as it should.\n  Frankly, I know the majority party will vote for this bill very \nquickly when we get back together, and we will pass a balanced bill in \nconsultation with both parties and with the White House. After all, \nthat is by and large what the American people want. They want us to \nwork together. They want us to pass legislation that is balanced.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us is not balanced. It is very \nlopsided and very much toward upper income levels. Also, it does not \ninclude provisions to help lower middle income Americans, which I will \noutline a little bit later.\n  In addition, the bill before us is one that was crafted by the \nmajority leadership, despite what has been said on the floor here, \nwithout consultation that in any way is adequate with either the White \nHouse or with the Democratic Party. That is unfortunate. I say that \nalso because the Senate Finance Committee not too long ago passed out \nof the committee, on a unanimous vote, a balanced bill that addresses \nthe tax provisions in this bill.\n  What do I mean?\n  First of all, the bill that passed the Finance Committee on a \nbipartisan basis, with a unanimous vote, had one-third of the tax cuts \ndirected to lower and moderate-income taxpayers to help them also save \nfor good times. It is true the bill also raised contribution limits for \npeople in moderate and upper income levels, as it should.\n  My point is not that those should not be raised. My point is there \nare no provisions in the current bill which also give the incentives to \nmoderate- and low-income people.\n  In addition, it is important for us to reflect for a moment about the \nimportance of retirement income. Sixteen percent of today's retirees \ndepend exclusively and entirely on Social Security for their entire \nincome. Two-thirds of American seniors depend upon Social Security as \ntheir primary source of retirement income. That is basically because \nSocial Security benefits only replace about 40 percent of the income \nearned during retirement.\n  Who are those retirees who depend primarily on Social Security? They \nare people who spend their entire working lives making minimum wage and \nwho earn just enough to make ends meet but not enough to save for \nretirement.\n  Only one-third of American families with incomes under $25,000 are \nsaving for retirement either through a pension plan or through an IRA. \nThat compares with 85 percent of American families with incomes over \n$50,000. Eighty-five percent of American families with incomes of \n$50,000 or over are saving either through a pension plan or IRA.\n  That is why the bill that passed the Finance Committee--again, \nunanimously--attempted to address that disparity by including a tax \ncredit for families with less than $50,000 in income to help them also \nsave for retirement. The credit was really one of two items in the bill \nthat helped provide that balance. It also made the bill more \nprogressive.\n\n  The unanimously passed, bipartisan Finance Committee bill had a \ncouple other incentives to help small businesses establish pensions for \ntheir workers. These were very important provisions to help balance the \nbill and raise limits for upper income Americans and also help provide \nincentives for lower and moderate-income Americans.\n  You won't find these provisions in the bill before us today. You \nwon't find the provisions that passed the Finance Committee \nunanimously, on a bipartisan basis, to help middle and lower income \nAmericans as well as upper income Americans. That pattern is repeated.\n  Measures that the Finance Committee, again, on a bipartisan basis, \npassed to help balance the legislation before us are not included in \nthis, I might say, closed-door bill that we have before us today. For \nexample, the\n\n[[Page S11230]]\n\nsection on health care spends $88 billion, with $56 billion of that \ngoing to basically HMOs that subsidize people who already have health \ninsurance.\n  I ask: Where are the provisions designed to help the uninsured in \nAmerica? They are not there. There is no provision, for example, to \nexpand the Children's Health Insurance Program as part of the \ncompromise. You won't find other efforts to help encourage people who \nare uninsured to get insurance.\n  As I mentioned and as many other speakers have mentioned, this bill \nwas slapped together in the last couple of days. There are parts of it \nthat almost no one saw before yesterday morning. We have no idea what \nspecial interest provisions are in here, and we do not know what \nmistakes are in it. There are probably going to be a few--again, \nbecause it was not written in the sunshine.\n  I am even told there is a section here that may have accidentally \nrepealed the minimum wage altogether for 6 months. I don't know. It is \npossible.\n  Again, good law is not made behind closed doors by a small number of \npeople. It is made by all of us here in the full light of sunshine.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote against this bill. But, more importantly, \nwhen the President vetoes it, let's get together and do something that \nis balanced for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are about ready to conclude the debate on \nthis portion of the omnibus small business.\n  Let me point out before we go to the votes on District of Columbia/\nCommerce-State-Justice and adopt the resolution numbered 245, there has \nbeen a lot of talk about all of these things not having passed. Ninety \npercent of the bill has been voted out of the House by a large margin, \nand parts have come out of the Finance Committee.\n  I can tell you from the Small Business Committee that we took a \nbipartisan, broadly supported bill, and we were not able to get all of \nthe things that we in the Senate wanted included. Frankly, one of the \nkey elements I wanted was rejected. I know a provision advocated by the \nSenator from Minnesota was rejected. But I can assure you that it was \nover my strong objections, and only at the last was it rejected.\n  This measure does many things to continue the small business programs \nand to assure small businesses can provide jobs in areas where there \nare great needs when there is poverty and unemployment. There are \nprovisions that are recommended by the Women's Business Conference. \nThere are provisions to bring jobs into needy low-income communities. \nThese bills together have many of the things that the President also \nrequested.\n  I regret to say that the President and some of our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle are pouting because they didn't get it all. I \ncan tell you something. I didn't get all that I wanted in this bill \neither. I took some things I didn't want, that were wanted by the House \nand that were wanted by other Members.\n  But this bill provides significant savings incentives and income-\nlimited savings incentives on IRAs that could do more to help savings.\n  Medicare give-backs will enable providers to continue to serve needy \npeople.\n  Those who ran against the HMOs are trying to make HMOs available in \nStates such as New Mexico and rural areas that do not have the \ntremendous bonanza of the reimbursements that they do in New York \nState.\n  There are many good provisions in this bill. An overwhelming number \nof them have been supported and requested by the President and, at one \ntime or another, supported by the people on the other side of the \naisle. Unfortunately, they say: We are just not getting enough. Sixteen \nbillion dollars in school construction, two-thirds of what the \nPresident wanted, is not enough. Our friends have never seen a tax cut \nthat they liked nor a tax surplus they didn't want to spend.\n  This strikes the happy medium. I hope ultimately we will adopt this \nmeasure and have it signed by the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11230-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11230-S11241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The clerk will report the \nconference report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate on the bill H.R. \n     4942, ``Making appropriations for the government of the \n     District of Columbia and other activities chargeable in whole \n     or in part against revenues of said District for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 2001, and for other purposes'', \n     having met, have agreed that the House recede from its \n     disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and agree to the \n     same with an amendment, signed by a majority of the conferees \n     on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The report was printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nOctober 25, 2000.)\n\n\n                     fbi's jewelry and gem program\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I commend my friend and colleague from \nHew Hampshire, Senator Gregg, for his effective leadership on this \nimportant Commerce, Justice, State appropriations conference report. \nThe Senate version of the fiscal year 2001 Commerce, Justice, State \nappropriations bill included a recommendation of up to $2.2 million for \nthe FBI's Jewelry and Gem Program within funds available for Organized \nCriminal Enterprises, OCE, to address crimes against jewelry vendors \nwho have proven easy targets for thieves, including organized South \nAmerican gangs. The House report on the bill encourages the FBI to \ncontinue to allocate sufficient resources to disrupting these criminal \nenterprises. This program is designed to protect small businesses and \nthe lives of employees in this field from violent crime. The conference \nagreement adopts the House position, but it is my understanding that \nthe FBI decided to commit significant funds to combating these crimes \nin fiscal year 2000. Therefore, the conference agreement should be \nunderstood to recommend the FBI make available sufficient funds for the \nJewelry and Gem Program. May I ask my distinguished colleague from New \nHampshire, the chairman of our subcommittee and our Senate conferees, \nif my understanding is correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, my distinguished colleague from Colorado \nis correct. The conference agreement should be read to recommend that \nthe FBI expend sufficient funds for OCE on combating the crimes \naddressed by the Jewelry and Gem Program.\n\n\n                              fast program\n\n Mr. BURNS. Madam President, the conference report for the \nCommerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary appropriations bill provides \nthat $5 million is appropriated for the Small Business Innovation \nResearch (SBIR) Rural Outreach Program at the Small Business \nAdministration, SBA. Given how this legislation evolved, I believe that \nclarification is needed as to how the Conferees intend that the SBA \nspend such money.\n  Next year, there will be two programs at the SBA that focus on small \nhigh-technology business outreach: The Federal and State Technology \nPartnership (FAST) program and the SBIR Rural Outreach Program. While \nthe FAST program and the Rural Outreach Program share the similar goal \nof facilitating the development of small high-technology businesses, \nthey are separate programs and the FAST program is much broader in \nscope than the Rural Outreach Program. The FAST program is a \ncompetitive matching-grant program that provides states with wide \nlatitude to develop strategies to assist in the growth of their small \nbusiness high-technology sectors. In contrast, the Rural Outreach \nProgram is targeted at only those states that receive the fewest SBIR \nawards and is limited to funding activities to encourage small firms in \nthose states to participate in the SBIR program. My state of Montana \nhas benefitted greatly from the Rural Outreach Program and it is very \nimportant that this program be funded.\n  The FAST program, which has been included in SBIR legislation that \nhas\n\n[[Page S11231]]\n\nbeen separately passed by both the Senate and the House and which I \nanticipate will be enacted prior to Congress adjourning, was initially \nappropriated $5 million in the bill reported out of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. In the conference report, it appears that the \nfunds appropriated for both the FAST program and the Rural Outreach \nProgram were inadvertently combined under the general heading of \nfunding for the Rural Outreach Program. This is apparent because $5 \nmillion is targeted in the conference report for the Rural Outreach \nProgram, while the authorization for that program is only $2 million. I \nam concerned that without clarification about how the SBA is required \nto spend such funds, that the SBA will use excess amounts for programs \nother than the FAST program and the Rural Outreach Program. \nAccordingly, am I correct in my interpretation that funding for the \nFAST Program was combined with funding for the Rural Outreach Program \nin the conference report and that the Conferees intend that the $5 \nmillion be used to support both programs?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, the interpretation is correct. Both of these programs \nprovide support for high-technology businesses and, therefore, both \nhave been funded under the general topic of SBIR Rural Outreach. Thank \nyou for bringing to our attention that clarification.\n  Mr. BURNS. I know that there is substantial support for both of these \nprograms. Can you tell me how the conferees intend that the SBA spend \nthe $5 million on the Rural Outreach Program and the FAST program?\n  Mr. GREGG. My understanding is that the intent of the conferees is \nthat $1.5 million of the total amount be spent on the Rural Outreach \nProgram and $3.5 million be spent on the FAST program.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator for the clarification.\n\n\n                         grocery slotting fees\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, the conference report that includes \nfiscal year 2001 Commerce-Justice-State appropriations picks up some \nSenate report language providing up to $900,000 for completion of a \nFederal Trade Commission investigation into slotting allowances and \nfair competition in the retail grocery business.\n  I understand that the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] originally \nrequested that language. I would like to engage the Senator from \nMissouri and the chairman of the subcommittee [Mr. Gregg] in a colloquy \nsimply to clarify the scope and intent of that provision.\n  Because this language is brief, I wanted to make sure it would not be \nmisread to suggest that we are providing these funds for use in any \ncompany-specific investigation.\n  It is my understanding that committee's intent is for the FTC to use \nthese funds solely to undertake a general study, collecting \ncomprehensive data on the current competitive environment related to \nsuch practices, assessing their impact, and reporting back to Congress \non appropriate policy considerations.\n  I am concerned that our current understanding of the practice of \nslotting fees, as well as the payment of other discounts, fees, and \npromotional allowances, is still limited. A thorough understanding of \nindustry practices and their effects should inform policymaking.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct. The Small Business Committee, which \nI chair, has invested considerable time and effort working on this \nissue. While we have made much progress, many of the facts surrounding \nthis practice remain shrouded, and little hard data has been produced \nto gauge slotting's impact, especially on small businesses and small \nfarmers. For example, at a recent hearing, the General Accounting \nOffice reported it has been unable to collect data needed to prepare a \nthorough analysis of the practice. The FTC, however, would have the \nlegal authority under Section 6 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to \ncollect the data necessary to continue with a full and complete \nanalysis of these practices and their impacts.\n  This funding was requested for the purpose of the FTC preparing a \ncomprehensive report to Congress, pursuant to Section 6 of the Federal \nTrade Commission Act, that outlines the appropriate policy \nconsiderations arising from this issue. The report should concentrate \non industry-wide practices of retailers that engage in the sale of \ngrocery items with respect to slotting allowances and other similar \npractices including, without limitation: Their impact on competition \nand retail prices; their impact on all forms of grocery retailing, \nincluding smaller grocery retailers; their impact on manufacturers and \nsuppliers; and their relationship to consolidation in the retail \ngrocery industry.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senators are correct. The intent of the committee in \noriginally providing for this funding in the Senate-reported \nappropriations is as the Senators have described it. The conference \nreport maintains the Senate position. I would also state it is our \nexpectation that the FTC provide this report to Congress no later than \nsixteen months from the date of enactment of this legislation.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for clarifying the committee's intent.\n  I want to add my personally strong feeling that it would be \ninappropriate for the FTC to launch individualized investigations and \nenforcement actions on the basis of notions about industry practices \nthat are not-fully-informed, before it can sort out what appropriate \nlaw and policy should be. Unfocused, premature, or ad hoc actions could \nbe counterproductive, possibly disrupting markets and chilling some \npositive industry practices that actually benefit consumers. It is \nimportant now for the FTC to focus on resolving uncertainties and \nacquiring a better understanding the facts, law, market practices, and \nimpacts related to these issues.\n\n\n                  medical corrections options program\n\n  Mr. MACK. Madam President, last year the Commerce, Justice, State and \nJudiciary Appropriations Subcommittee included funding for the Southern \nFlorida Medical Corrections Options Program, which began operations \nthis spring. Working with the Broward County Mental Health Court and \nthe Broward County Sheriff's office it has had tremendous success in \ntreating mentally ill misdemeanants and preventing recidivism. My \ncolleague from Hawaii shares my interest in the program because Hawaii \nfaces many of the same challenges as Florida in treating mentally ill \nmisdemeanants.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, my colleague from Florida is correct. \nTogether, we are seeking to expand the South Florida Medical \nCorrections Options Program to initiate a Hawaii program that will \nenhance our knowledge in this field. We are also seeking to provide \nmuch needed data for the eventual expansion of the national mental \nhealth court program.\n  Mr. MACK. The Fiscal Year 2001 Commerce, State, Justice and the \nJudiciary Appropriations Committee Report includes a number of programs \nthat the committee has encouraged the Bureau of Justice Assistance \n(BJA) to examine and fund, if possible, under the Edward Byrne Memorial \nDiscretionary Grants Program. I am hopeful that the BJA will consider \nfunding for the joint Hawaii/Florida demonstration project to develop a \nnational model for future mental health courts.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank my colleague for his support in expanding this \nimportant project into the State of Hawaii, and would appreciate the \nagreement of the Chairman to support this project for funding \nconsideration.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank my colleagues from Florida and Hawaii and would \nlike to clarify that the BJA should consider funding under the Edward \nByrne Memorial Discretionary Grants Program for this joint Hawaii/\nFlorida demonstration project.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his comments.\n\n\n                            land acquisition\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I would like to inquire of the \nranking member of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and \nRelated Agencies, Senator Hollings, about a particular provision of the \nconference report.\n  The conference report to the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 2001 specified that $1 million is available for \nland acquisition in Raritan, New Jersey under the National Estuarine \nResearch Reserve system.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. As I understand it, the intent of this language is to \nallow for the purchase of specific parcels of wetland habitat in the \nRaritan\n\n[[Page S11232]]\n\nBay region of New Jersey. The Raritan Bay area in Monmouth County, New \nJersey, is the area of focus of this provision, not Raritan Borough in \nSomerset County, New Jersey nor Raritan Township which is located in \nHunterdon County. In addition, the intent of this provision is for the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Estuarine \nResearch System to work cooperatively with the State of New Jersey to \ncoordinate the acquisition and management of these lands.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator is again, correct on both points. As the \nSenator from New Jersey has stated, the intent of this provision is to \nallow NOAA to work with the State of New Jersey to acquire lands along \nthe Raritan Bay for inclusion in the National Estuarine Research \nReserve System.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the ranking member for clarifying the meaning \nof this provision.\n\n\n                                  CARA\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I have a question about a last minute \nchange in language of the appropriations measure establishing a Coastal \nImpact Assistance program as section 31 of the Outer Continental Shelf \nLands Act. The Coastal Impact Assistance program, with relatively few \nchanges, is identical to language referred to and reported by the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources as part of H.R. 701, the \nConservation and Reinvestment Act of 2000, commonly referred to as \nCARA. The last minute change I am concerned about places the Secretary \nof Commerce in charge of the Coastal Impact Assistance program rather \nthan the Secretary of the Interior. Both the House of Representatives, \nwhen it passed CARA, and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \nwhen it reported CARA to the Senate, placed responsibility for Coastal \nImpact Assistance with the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of \nthe Interior has the overall responsibility under the Outer Continental \nShelf Lands Act for the leasing program that creates the impact on our \ncoastal communities that Coastal Impact assistance seeks to address and \nis also the source of revenues to fund not only such assistance but \nalso various conservation programs that were included under CARA. I do \nnot understand why the change was made, but I want to make certain that \nthe change has no effect on the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources over the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and \nespecially exclusive jurisdiction over the Coastal Impact Assistance \nprogram established under section 31 of that act.\n  Mr. LOTT. I can assure the Senator that the change has absolutely no \neffect on the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources over that program. As the Senator knows, at one time there \nwere discussions about adding the entire CARA package to the Interior \nappropriation bill. The allocation of funding required us to add this \nportion, which includes Coastal Impact Assistance, to the Commerce \nappropriation. The change made in what Secretary disburses the funds \ndoes not alter in any manner the nature of the program, the purposes of \nthe program, or the exclusive jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources over the program.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I fully agree with the response from the majority \nleader. Whether the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of \nCommerce or the Secretary of the Treasury makes the disbursements has \nabsolutely no effect on the exclusive jurisdiction of the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources over this program. The Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources has jurisdiction over the Outer Continental Shelf \nLands Act and was the committee that originally reported the Coastal \nImpact Assistance program as part of the CARA legislation. The fact \nthat we have funded the first year through the Department of Commerce \nhas absolutely no effect on the exclusive jurisdiction of the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources over the Coastal Impact Assistance \nprogram, including oversight and any future changes.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let me add as chairman of the Committee on \nAppropriations that we were not in any manner attempting to alter the \njurisdiction of the authorizing committees over any programs. As a \nresult of the agreement made on the Interior appropriations bill, we \nwere forced to fund the Coastal Impact Assistance program on the \nCommerce appropriations measure. To do that, we needed to include \nauthorizing language. We took the language that had been reported by \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources with only minor \nalterations. There was a last minute change to insert a definition of \n``Secretary'' for the purposes of the new section 31 of the Outer \nContinental Shelf Lands Act to be the Secretary of Commerce. All that \nchange does, is alter who will disburse the funding to the coastal \nStates. I can assure all my colleagues that there was no intent to \nalter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \nover the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act or its exclusive \njurisdiction over the Coastal Impact Assistance program that is \nestablished as a new section 31 of that act.\n  Mr. BYRD. I also agree with these comments. The Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources has jurisdiction over ``Extraction of minerals \nfrom oceans and Outer Continental Shelf lands'' under Rule XXV(g)(1)6. \nof the Standing Rules of the Senate. Pursuant to that authority, it has \njurisdiction over the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation continues to have jurisdiction \nunder Rule XXV(f)(1) over ``Transportation and commerce aspects of \nOuter Continental Shelf lands''. The Coastal Impact Assistance program, \nwhich will now be section 31 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, \nis an important and necessary component of our leasing program on the \nOuter Continental Shelf and is certainly within the jurisdiction of the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources. How we choose to route the \nfunding for this program is incidental and has nothing to do with the \njurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. As the \nminority leader noted, it is immaterial whether the Secretary of the \nInterior or the Secretary of Commerce or some other officer is \nresponsible, the program remains exclusively within the jurisdiction of \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I want to thank the managers of \nthis bill for their hard work in putting forth annual legislation which \nprovides federal funding for numerous vital programs.\n  This bill provides funding for fighting crime, enhancing drug \nenforcement, and responding to threats of terrorism. It further funds \nthe operation of the District of Columbia, addresses some of the \nshortcomings of the immigration process, funds the operation of the \njudicial system, facilitates commerce throughout the United States, and \nfulfills the needs of the State Department and various other agencies.\n  Unfortunately, for the second time in a month, I must express my \ndismay over the process whereby the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act \n(LIFA) has been considered by this Congress. Like many Americans who \nbelieve policies that reflect compassion and family values should apply \nto immigrants and U.S. citizens alike, I welcome inclusion of the Legal \nImmigration Family Equity (LIFE) Act in this bill. But I had hoped that \nthis legislation would supplement, rather than substitute for, the \nFairness bill, which is far broader. I am disappointed that members of \nmy party refused to include LIFA in this bill. As a consequence, \nhundreds of thousands of hard-working, tax-paying members of our \nsociety will be denied the amnesty, parity, and family-unification \nprotections of LIFA. I will continue to work for passage of the Latino \nand Immigrant Fairness Act and trust that, next year, we can pass it on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Regretfully, I must oppose this measure.\n  There are hundreds of millions of dollars in pork-barrel spending and \nthe legislative riders that are riddled throughout this bill. The \nmultitude of unrequested earmarks buried in this measure will \nundoubtedly further burden the American taxpayers. While the amounts \nassociated with each individual earmark may not seem extravagant, taken \ntogether, they represent a serious diversion of taxpayers' hard-earned \ndollars at the expense of numerous programs that have undergone the \nappropriate merit-based selection process.\n  For example, under funding for the Department of Justice, some \nexamples\n\n[[Page S11233]]\n\nof earmarks include: $130,000 to Jackson City, Mississippi, for public \nsafety and automated technologies related to law enforcement; $2 \nmillion for the Alaska Native Justice Center; $15 million for an \neducation and development initiative to promote criminal justice \nexcellence at Eastern Kentucky University in conjunction with the \nUniversity of Kentucky; and $4 million for the West Virginia University \nForensic Identification program.\n  Under funding for the Department of Commerce, some of the earmarks \ninclude: $500,000 for the International Pacific Research Center at the \nUniversity of Hawaii; $855,000 for weather radio transmitters in \nKentucky; $2.5 million for the Center for Spatial Data Research at \nJackson State University; $500,000 for the South Carolina Geodetic \nSurvey; and $500,000 for the California Ozone Study.\n  And the list of questionable spending goes on with even more funding \nfor the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, Utah. For example: \n$3 million for the Utah Olympic Public Safety Command to implement the \npublic safety master plan for the Olympics; $5 million for the Utah \nCommunication Agency Network for enhancements and upgrades of security \nand communication infrastructure to assist with law enforcement needs \nof the Olympics; and $590,000 for the NOAA Cooperative Institute for \nRegional Prediction at the University of Utah to implement data \ncollection and automated weather station installation in preparation \nfor the Olympics.\n  There are many more projects on the list that I have compiled, which \nwill be available on my Senate Website.\n  I also want to address the legislative riders in this bill. In \nparticular, I want to express my disappointment that legislation \nrestricting low-power FM services has been added behind closed doors to \nthis appropriations conference report. The addition of this rider \nillustrates, once again, how the special interests of a few are allowed \nto dominate the voices of the many in the back-door dealings of the \nappropriations process.\n  Low-power FM radio service provides community-based organizations, \nchurches and other non-profit groups with a new, affordable opportunity \nto reach out to the public, helping to promote a greater awareness \nwithin our communities. Low-power FM is supported by the U.S. \nconference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, the Consumers' \nUnion and many religious organizations, including the U.S. Catholic \nConference and the United Church of Christ. These institutions support \nlow-power FM because they see what low-power FM's opponents also know \nto be true--that these stations will make more programming available to \nthe public, and provide outlets for news and perspectives not currently \nfeatured on local radio stations.\n\n  But, the special interests opposed to low-power FM--most notably the \nNational Association of Broadcasters and National Public Radio--have \nmounted a vigorous behind-the-scenes campaign against this service. \nTheir stated objection to this service is potential interference, of \ncourse, not potential competition. They claim that a 10 or 100 watt low \npower station that can only broadcast a few miles will ``bleed into'' \nand overpower the signal of nearby 100,000 watt full-power radio \nstations that broadcast about 70 miles. Interestingly, the FCC, the \nexpert government agency that evaluates such radio interference claims, \ndoes not share this claimed concern. To the contrary, after developing \nan extensive record and evaluating these alleged technical concerns, \nthe FCC proceeded with licensing and established procedures to address \nany interference issues that actually arose.\n  Moreover, competitors' speculations about potential interference from \nlow-power stations were given a fair hearing not only in the FCC, but \nalso in this Congress. Earlier this year, Senator Kerry and I \nintroduced the Low Power FM Radio Act of 2000, which would have struck \na fair balance between allowing low-power radio stations to go forward \nwhile at the same time protecting existing full-power stations from \nactual interference. Under our bill, low-power stations causing \ninterference would be required to stop causing interference--or be shut \ndown--but non-interfering low power FM stations would be allowed to \noperate without further delay. The opponents of low-power FM did not \nsupport this bill because they want low-power FM to be dead rather than \nfunctional.\n  Congress should not permit the appropriations process to circumvent \nthe normal legislative process. Every time we do this, the American \npeople lose more faith in us. And in this context, they will become \neven more cynical when they learn that special interests like the NAB \nwere able to use the appropriations process to highjack and overturn \nthe sound technical decisions by the government radio experts that \nwould have authorized new outlets for religious and political speech--\nand new outlets for their local churches and community groups.\n  Low-power FM is an opportunity for minorities, churches and others to \nhave a new voice in radio broadcasting. In the Commerce Committee, we \nconstantly lament the fact that minorities, community-based \norganizations, and religious organizations do not have adequate \nopportunities to communicate their views. Over the years, I have often \nheard many members of both the Committee and this Senate lament the \nenormous consolidation that has occurred in the telecommunications \nsector as a whole and the radio industry specifically. Here, we had a \nchance to get out of the way, and allow non-interfering low-power radio \nstations to go forward to combat these concerns. Instead, we let \nspecial interests hide their competitive fears behind the smokescreen \nof hypothetical interference to severely wound--if not kill--this \nservice in the dead of night.\n  This report also contains legislation establishing a rural loan \nguarantee program intended to help bring broadcast signals to the most \nremote areas in this country. While I support this legislation, and I \ncommend my friend, Senator Burns, for his leadership in this area, \nthere is one aspect of this legislation that still causes me concern.\n  This legislation would let incumbent cable monopolies qualify for \nU.S. taxpayer subsidized loans in the name of ``technology \nneutrality.'' Unfortunately, this approach will fail to achieve any \nreal ``technology neutrality'' while simultaneously expanding a limited \nloan guaranty program into an unnecessary corporate welfare program.\n  In a perfect world, a loan guaranty program would be equally \navailable to every competing industry segment because this would ensure \nthat no industry segment would benefit from a government-sanctioned \nadvantage in the marketplace.\n  Unfortunately, telecommunications law has already departed so \nsignificantly from principles of ``technology neutrality'' that \n``neutrality'' in the narrow field of taxpayer-subsidized loan \nguaranties will only increase the cost of the program for the benefit \nof previously favored technologies. Indeed, my experience has shown \nthat in telecommunications technological neutrality has been sacrificed \nby a misplaced focus on protecting competitors at the expense of \ncompetition and the American consumer. For example, the broadcast \nindustry has been given 70 billion dollars of free spectrum, yet the \nwireless industry must compete for spectrum at auction. And certain \nindustry sectors, such as cable, have been given government-franchised \nmonopolies. In the telecommunications world, some are already more \nequal than others.\n  It is against this reality that any claims of ``technological \nneutrality'' must be evaluated. In the real world, cable companies not \nonly have a government-sanctioned advantage--they have a government-\nfranchised monopoly. Monopolists, almost by definition, need no more \ngovernment protection against competition. Perhaps it is just a \ncoincidence, and not due to a lack of competition, but cable companies \nhave been able to raise their rates approximately three times the rate \nof inflation (for about a 30 percent total increase) since the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act. This scenario hardly requires the helping hand \nof the U.S. taxpayer.\n  ``Technology neutrality'' is a fine phrase, but not if it means that \nthe American taxpayers must further subsidize industries that have \nalready received undue and unnecessary market advantages sanctioned by \nthe government.\n\n[[Page S11234]]\n\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to curb our habit of directing hard-\nearned taxpayer dollars to locality-specific special interests and our \ninclusion of legislative riders which thwart the very process that is \nneeded to ensure our laws address the concerns and interests of all \nAmericans, not just a few who seek special protection or \nadvantage.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, one of my priorities in this bill was to \nmake sure that Washington seniors continue to have access to their \nMedicare+Choice program and to expand choices for other seniors who \nhave been dropped from the program due to low payment rates in \nWashington state. We need to make sure Medicare+Choice is a stable \noption in the Medicare program for our seniors.\n  I am concerned, however that the new requirements on the submission \nof adjusted community rate ACR proposals for 2001 may interfere with my \ngoal of ensuring the stability of this program for seniors in my state. \nUnder this bill, plans that have ensured seniors have consistent access \nto the Medicare+Choice program cannot use the increased funds to \nstabilize the benefits they already provide or to ensure adequate \npayments to providers such as doctors and hospitals--even if they are \nlosing money on providing those benefits right now.\n  In Washington State we have plans that are operating at a deficit \nevery year but they continue to stick with this program and offer \nhealth care to our seniors. They need this money simply to stabilize \nand maintain current benefits. Without these funds, there will be no \nbasic programs for seniors at all. Plans cannot offer enhanced benefits \nor lower premiums if there is no program in existence, in Washington \nstate, that is what we are facing--the possibility of no \nMedicare+Choice programs at all.\n  I don't disagree with the intent of the provision to ensure that \nseniors benefit from this new funding in the form of reduced premiums \nor increased benefits. My point is that there are more ways to help out \nseniors and one way is to ensure that their plan will not only be there \nthis year, but the next year and into the future. One way to do that is \nto simply add a provision to the current language that allows plans to \nstabilize or enhance patients access to providers such as doctors and \nhospitals.\n  You can spend millions of dollars on the fixtures of a new house, on \nantique furniture, on expensive paintings, and the like but if there is \nno foundation the house will fall to the ground and no one will \nbenefit. Our first priority should be to ensure that the \nMedicare+Choice program is stabilized that at a minimum seniors \ncontinue to have the choice we promised them.\n Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I support the passage of the \nCommerce-Justice-State conference report, which includes a bill of \ncritical importance to rural America, the ``Local TV Act.'' The Local \nTV Act will create a $1.25 billion loan guarantee program that will \nbring local TV signals to Montana and other rural states, over \nsatellites or other technologies, in a fiscally responsible way.\n  I want to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Banking \nCommittee and the Majority Leaders in both the Senate and the House for \nhelping to reach completion on this issue. I should add that Senator \nLeahy, Senator Hollings, Senator Thomas and Senator Grams have worked \ntirelessly on this matter. I would also like to thank my colleagues in \nthe House for their efforts. Representative Goodlatte was involved in \nevery stage of the complex negotiations that took place on this bill, \nas were House Commerce Committee Chairman Bliley, House \nTelecommunications Subcommittee Chairman Tauzin, House Agriculture \nCommittee Chairman Combest and Representative Boucher. I thank them all \nfor helping to reach such a positive result, which was only possible \nthrough an extraordinary, bipartisan effort.\n  Providing access to local television signals is crucial to rural \nstates. With over-the-air broadcast signals and cable delivery limited \nby the geography of my own state of Montana, satellite television has \nbeen a staple of our so-called ``video marketplace'' for many years. In \nfact, Montana has the highest penetration level of satellite television \nin the country at over 35 percent.\n  I initially proposed legislation in this area because I was concerned \nthat without it, only the largest television markets in America would \nreceive local-into-local service authorized by the Satellite Home \nViewer Improvement Act. These are the profitable cities like New York \nand Los Angeles with millions of television households. Currently, only \nthe 20 largest television markets are being offered local TV signals \nvia satellite. The two largest direct broadcaster satellite providers \nhave announced plans to offer service to an additional 20 or 30 large \nmarkets over the next few years.\n  What about the other TV markets? There are 16 states--including my \nown--that do not have a single city among the top seventy markets. \nBecause of the ``Local TV Act,'' they will now no longer be left out of \nthe information age just because they are smaller.\n  The ability to receive local television signals is more than just \nhaving access to local sports or entertainment programming. It is a \ncritical and immediate way to receive important local news, weather and \ncommunity information. Access to local signals is particularly critical \nin Montana, where we experienced severe flooding last fall and sudden \nblizzards are always a possibility.\n  The ``Local TV Act'' reflects the belief that the loan guarantee \nprogram should not favor one technology over another and it should not \npose a burden to the taxpayer. The ``Local TV Act'' is a win for \nconsumers and for taxpayers. Earlier this year, the bill passed the \nSenate 97-0, a similar version passed the House by an overwhelming \nmargin and I again thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for \nreaching agreement on this critical matter.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I would like to take a moment and join \nmy subcommittee chairman and colleague, Senator Gregg, in commenting on \nthe fiscal year 2001 Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary and \nrelated agencies appropriations portion of the conference report before \nthe Senate today. Once, again, I would like to commend Chairman Gregg \nfor his outstanding efforts and bipartisan approach in bring an \nappropriations bill to the floor that is good and balanced.\n  Putting together the conference report is always a tremendous \nchallenge, and this year has proven to be no different. We face the \nchallenge of adequately funding a host of varying missions, This bill \nfunds efforts to fight crime and drugs on our streets. This bill funds \ninitiatives that enhance business opportunities for small and large \ncompanies at home and abroad. This bill funds agencies like the FTC and \nthe SEC that protect consumers from fraud. This bill provides funding \nfor scientific research needed for better fisheries management. This \nbill provides free and accurate weather forecasting to farmers who rely \non it day by day for tending their crops and to families who live in \nareas where timely and accurate forecasts can save their lives from \nviolent tornadoes, torrential rains, floods, and hurricanes. While the \nmissions funded through this bill may vary, one point remains constant: \nThe funding provided in this bill seeks to improve the daily lives and \nsafety of all American at home and abroad.\n  In total, the conference report provides $38.0 billion in budget \nauthority which is about $1.7 billion less in total budget authority \nthan the fiscal year 2000 levels. The bill is $12.9 billion less than \nthe President's request level; however, his request level, as in past \nyears, included advanced appropriations, which the CJS Subcommittee \ntraditionally does not provide.\n  Senator Gregg has mentioned many of the funding specifics in this \nbill, so I will not repeat the details; however, I would like to point \nout to our colleagues some of the highlights of this bill:\n\n\n                      justice and law enforcement\n\n  The conference report provides $21.1 billion for the Department of \nJustice, including $3.3 billion for the FBI, $1.3 billion for the DEA, \n$4.8 billion for INS, $4.3 billion for BOP, and $4.6 billion for the \nOffice of Justice Programs. This conference report funds both block \ngrant programs--such as Byrne, local law enforcement, and juvenile \njustice--and the COPS Program--such as the universal hiring and \ntechnology components. Our colleagues in the Senate\n\n[[Page S11235]]\n\nonly need to review the FBI's preliminary annual uniform crime report \nreleased this past May to appreciate how well all these programs are \nworking. According to the FBI's report, in 1999, serious crime dropped \nfor an eighth consecutive year, down seven-percent from the year \nbefore. This is the longest running crime decline on record. The \nsuccessful reduction in crime in no small way must be attributed to the \nbipartisan efforts to fund DOJ's crime fighting initiatives during the \npast ten years.\n  In an effort to continue the decline in serious crime, we continue to \nfund many of the programs that are working. Not only are we funding \ncops on the beat, we also continue the safe schools initiative which \nSenator Gregg and I started two years ago. This bill provides $227.5 \nmillion for this initiative. Madam President, we cannot allow violence \nor the threat of violence to turn our schools into a hostile setting \nthat prevents our students from obtaining the education they deserve. \nThe bill before the Senate provides increased funding from last year's \nlevels, through the Office of Justice programs, to continue the hiring \nof school resource officers, and the implementation of community-based \nplanning and prevention activities. This initiative is working but \nthere is much more that has to be done, and this increased funding will \ncontinue our efforts to return our schools to a safe place for children \nto learn.\n  I am pleased to see in this year's conference report $1.3 billion \nfunding for the DEA, which is a $69.45 million increase from last \nyear's level. This funding is aimed at combating the latest battle in \nthe war on drugs--methamphetamines. Included in the DEA fundings is \n$25.9 million for personnel and operations to combat the production and \nuse of methamphetamines. Also included in the bill is $28.5 million for \nState and local law enforcement to combat methamphetamine production \nand $2.5 million for equipment. Another $20.0 million will be \ntransferred from the COPS Hot Spots Program to reimburse the agency for \nthe costs associated with assisting State and local law enforcement in \nmeth lab cleanup.\n  The conference report also includes $288.7 million for the violence \nagainst women program, which includes $31.6 million for civil legal \nassistance, $25 million for rural domestic violence programs, $11.5 \nmillion for court appointed special advocates, and $11.0 million for \ncollege campus programs.\n  There is one issue within the Department of Justice for which I am \ndisappointed we did not provide funding--the Justice Department's \nLawsuit against the Tobacco industry. I appreciate Senator Gregg's \neffort to reach a middle ground between those members who want to \nprevent DOJ from bringing a lawsuit, and those who want to provide DOJ \nwith adequate resources to do their job. It is the U.S. court's \nresponsibility to weigh the evidence and decide whether the tobacco \ncompanies have broken the law, not Congress's responsibility. In fact, \njust recently, the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia \nrules that DOJ does have standing to bring a suit against the tobacco \ncompanies under the RICO (racketeering, influence, and corrupt \norganizations) Act. It is Congress's responsibility to provide the \nJustice Department with the tools and adequate resources it needs to do \nits job. This conference report does not do that.\n\n\n                         department of commerce\n\n  The conference report provides $4.7 billion for the Commerce \nDepartment, an increase of $460 million above last year's funding \nlevel. We provide $337.4 million for ITA, and while we could not fully \nfund all of the President's request for this important administration, \nwe did provide funding for the trade compliance initiatives. I also \nappreciate Senator Gregg's support for language requiring the USTR to \nassist the Import Administration with office space in Geneva given the \nimportance of the Import Administration's responsibilities relating to \nantidumping and countervailing duties.\n  While we did not fully fund the administration's new internet access \ninitiatives for NTIA, we did provide more than $100 million in funding \nfor the NTIA to continue its core missions--funding for digital \nconversion, and funding for infrastructure grants.\n  Regarding technology, the bill includes $312.6 million for NIST \nscientific and technical research and services. Under NIST, the \nAdvanced Technology Program (ATP) is funded at a program level of \n$190.7 million, and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) \nProgram is funded at $105.1 million.\n  The conference report also provides $3.1 billion for NOAA, more than \n$700 million above last year's level, and $850 million above the House \nlevel for FY 2001. I appreciate Chairman Gregg's support and efforts to \ninsure that we maintain a focus on our oceans and coast. I have made it \nclear this year that I am disappointed in the administration's request \nfor NOAA. Most of the funding increases requested this year were for \ncommunity assistance type programs--making NOAA a mini-EDA--and not the \nscience and research missions that have been NOAA's trademark during \nthe past three decades. The budget request was particularly \ndisappointing given the one hundred plus lawsuits currently pending \nagainst NOAA due to a lack of scientific data.\n  Madam President, at present, we generate more than 30% of our gross \ndomestic product from coastal areas, and nearly one out of every six \njobs is marine-related. By the end of this decade, about 60% of \nAmericans will live along our coasts. We cannot ignore the stress and \nstrain of this growth on our coastal environment, and we must continue \nto strive for better management of our marine resources. Of course, \nthese efforts are nothing new. Three decades ago, our nation roared \ninto space, investing tens of billions of dollars in that effort. \nDuring that golden era of science, some of us also recognized the \nimportance of exploring the seas and protecting the coasts on our own \nplanet. In 1966, Congress enacted the Marine Resources and Engineering \nDevelopment Act in order to define national objectives and programs \nwith respect to the oceans. One of the central elements of the 1966 act \nwas establishment of a Presidential commission, called the Stratton \nCommission, to develop a plan for national action in the oceans and \natmosphere. The Stratton Commission laid the foundation for U.S. ocean \nand coastal policy and programs and has guided their development for \nthree decades. Their report led to the creation of NOAA and laid the \ngroundwork for science and research and for management regimes that are \nthe cornerstone of our efforts to properly manage our fisheries, and \nprotect our coasts today. This conference report fully funds all of \nNOAA's base science and research missions.\n  FY 2001 funding for NOAA also includes additional funds for coastal \nconservation reflecting this year's coastal funding proposals in \nCongress (``CARA'') and the administration's budget (``lands legacy''). \nThe $420 million in increased funding includes $135 million for \nspecific conservation projects and $135 million to strengthen NOAA's \nefforts to conserve and protect our coral reefs, national marine \nsanctuaries and reserves, as well as fisheries and coastal habitats. \nThis $135 million infusion of funding in the coming year will greatly \nbenefit NOAA's important coastal stewardship programs throughout the \nNation. The increased coastal funding also includes $150 million to \nassist those States whose coastal areas are adversely affected by \noffshore oil development.\n\n\n                          department of state\n\n  The conference report includes a total of $7.1 billion for the \nDepartment of State and related agencies, an increase of $1.3 billion \nabove last year's funding level of $5.8 billion. Within the State \nDepartment account, $1.1 billion has been provided for worldwide \nsecurity upgrades of State Department facilities. Additionally, the \nbill provides $846 million to continue our Nation's international \npeacekeeping activities.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n  In closing let me say again that except for a one or two major policy \nissues this is a decent bill. Many--but not all--of the \nadministration's priorities were addressed to some extent. Likewise \nmany--but not all--of the priorities of our colleagues were addressed \nto some extent. It is with regret that I cannot support this bill at \nthis time. I cannot support an effort that starts down the slippery \nslope of the U.S. Congress telling the Department of Justice who they \ncan and cannot sue. It is my hope that this issue will be corrected \nshould this conference report pass the Senate and be vetoed by the \nPresident.\n\n[[Page S11236]]\n\n  I would like to take a moment before closing to acknowledge and thank \nSenator Gregg's staff--Jim Morhard, Kevin Linskey, Paddy Link, Dana \nQuam, Clayton Heil, and Katherine Hennesey--and my staff--Lila Helms \nand Sonia King--for their hard work and diligence in bringing together \na bill that does everything I have just mentioned and more. They have \nworked nonstop in a straightforward and bipartisan manner, to deliver \nthe bill that is before the Senate today. This bill could not have come \ntogether without their efforts and I thank them for all of their hard \nwork.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I want to speak about the appropriations \nagreement for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the \nJudiciary, and Related Agencies for fiscal year 2001. This bill is part \nof the D.C. Appropriations bill and I thank the Senator from Texas for \nher help on this matter and everyone else on the subcommittee.\n  I cannot tell you how hard we have tried to work with OMB and the \nWhite House on this bill. I find it hard to believe that they want to \nveto the bill based on what is in here. The main issue they have \ndifficulty with is on immigration and it was never requested by the \nPresident and is not an appropriations matter.\n  This bill does include $38.0 billion for these agencies. I believe \nthe funding levels in this bill will allow the departments and agencies \nfunded by it to fulfill their mandates.\n  The first title in this bill is the Department of Justice. We provide \n$21 billion, an increase over last year's level. Within Justice, there \nare a number of issues that stand out.\n  This bill provides comprehensive counter drug funding. It is our goal \nto provide the resources to protect our communities from the violence \nassociated with illegal drugs. One of the most prevalent concerns in \nthis area is the production of methamphetamine. The Drug Enforcement \nAgency (DEA) has reported an increase in clandestine lab seizures \nnationwide. In 1997, 3,327 labs were seized by Federal, State, and \nlocal law enforcement. By 1999, that number had escalated to 7,060.\n  Although the number of clandestine methamphetamine labs has almost \ndoubled since 1997, the President included no funding to combat \nmethamphetamine production, trafficking, and use in his FY 2001 budget \nrequest. We remedy that mistake here.\n  Our recommendation includes a total of $76.9 million for \nmethamphetamine initiatives. We provide $25.9 million for \ninvestigations and day to day operations on methamphetamine cases, \nincluding maintaining a database of labs around the country.\n  Since the bi-products from methamphetamine production are hazardous, \nexplosions or fires often result and specially equipped teams are sent \nin to clean-up the lab sites. We provide $20 million to the DEA through \nthe COPS Methamphetamine Drug Hot Spots Program for clean-up \nactivities. We have also made available for State and local law \nenforcement agencies $28.5 million for their methamphetamine \nenforcement and cleanup efforts.\n  Of course, methamphetamines are not the only problem. We provide \n$28.8 million to DEA for its heroin-related efforts. Because drug \ntraffickers are highly adaptive, we must have the ability to respond \nwhere ``hot spots'' arise. The bill provides $24.2 million for Regional \nDrug Enforcement Teams and $53.9 million for Mobile Enforcement Teams.\n  To aid those communities that have suffered because of the presence \nof drug dealers, we provide $34.0 million in direct funding for the \nWeed and Seed program. This program distributes grant funding to \nqualified neighborhoods so that they can weed out criminals in their \ncommunities while seeding new prevention and intervention services to \nhelp revitalize the neighborhood.\n  The drug problem in the United States is so pervasive that over 480 \ndrug courts have evolved to handle these particular cases. This bill \nincludes $50.0 million through the Office of Justice Programs for drug \ncourts; additional funding can be obtained through the Local Law \nEnforcement Block Grants or the Juvenile Accountability Block Grants.\n  Moving on to another important program in this bill, we continue the \nSafe Schools Initiative. This initiative was one the Ranking Member and \nI sponsored in 1999 just after the Columbine massacre. For fiscal year \n2001, we provide a total of $227.5 million for State school programs \nwith $180.0 million for school resource officers and $15.0 million for \nschool technology. This program gives school administrators resources \nto enhance safety measures. It grants them the flexibility to implement \ndecisions on how best to maintain a safe learning environment without \nimpacting funding for educational programs.\n  The final agreement contains funding for after-school youth programs. \nA leader in this category is the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. For \nthis reason, $60.0 million is available for their programs.\n  Additionally, Juvenile Mentoring Programs, JUMP, receive $16.0 \nmillion. These programs, including Big Brothers/Big Sisters, foster \nhealthy relationships between at risk youth and responsible adults.\n  The next item is of particular interest to me. The Missing Children \nprogram is one that continues to show positive results, and is funded \nat a level of $23.0 million. Within this amount, $6.5 million is \nprovided for investigative cyber units for State and local law \nenforcement agencies and $11.4 million for the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children.\n  One of the Center's most valuable resources is the Cyber TipLine, \nwhich allows individuals to report information about missing children \non-line. Information reported to the Center is compiled and made \naccessible to law enforcement officers all over the continent. The \nCenter dedicates significant resources to preventing and responding to \nincidents of cyber stalking. Overall, this bill includes more than \n$830.0 million for juvenile programs through the Office of Justice \nprograms, the juvenile justice budget, and the COPS program.\n  Our dedication to communities and families is also captured in our \nsupport of the Violence Against Women Act programs, which address \ndomestic violence and its effects. For fiscal year 2001, we fund the \nprogram at $288.7 million. This includes funding for legal assistance, \nrural domestic violence initiatives, and court-appointed-special \nadvocates.\n  At my request, this bill also recommends $11.0 million for grants to \naddress violence on college campuses. Grantees use these funds to \nexpand defense classes; to make capital improvements, such as \ninstalling emergency phones and improving lighting on campuses; and to \ntrain campus administrators and students on how to deal with violence \nand its after effects.\n  On a related topic, the conference agreement directs the Center for \nSex Offender Management to develop a system through which local law \nenforcement can notify communities when a sex offender has been \nreleased and is living nearby.\n  Law enforcement is Justice's primary mission, and there are several \nkey components. The U.S. Marshals are responsible for protecting our \nFederal judges and courthouses, for serving legal papers in Federal \ncases, and for recapturing fugitives. The $604.3 million recommended \nfor the Marshals provides funds for new initiatives to apprehend the \nmost dangerous fugitives; outfit and man new courthouses; and reduce \nthe backlog of security upgrades at old courthouses.\n  The recommendation provides $4.6 billion for the Immigration & \nNaturalization Service, INS; $1.5 billion of this is derived from fees. \nThe amount provided improves our posture on the border, expands efforts \nto apprehend illegal aliens in the interior, increases resources for \nnaturalization backlog reduction, and begins to tackle the nationwide \nbacklog on INS construction, maintenance, and repair.\n  An appropriation of $3.2 billion is dedicated to the FBI. This \nincludes $67.5 million for the National Instant Criminal Background \nCheck System, NICS, used by gun dealers to prevent the sale of weapons \nto individuals who are prohibited from owning a gun. We have reiterated \nthe Senate recommendation that no fees be charged to conduct these \nchecks.\n  The FBI Crime Lab is famous for its forensic capabilities, and many \nStates rely on its scientific expertise. The bill provides $137.3 \nmillion for forensic services within the Bureau.\n\n[[Page S11237]]\n\n  DNA testing is just one example of an important emerging forensic \nscience. The FBI reported a 15 percent increase in the number of cases \naided this year by having DNA profiles available in a national \ndatabase. Our recommendation includes $1.4 million for the National \nOffender Database, which stores the DNA profiles of convicted \ncriminals.\n\n  The Internet has created numerous social and economic benefits in the \nUnited States and around the world. Unfortunately, it is also an \nefficient medium by which crimes can be committed.\n  The conference agreement includes an increase to $3.9 million for the \nFBI's Computer Analysis and Response Teams and $30.5 million for its \ndigital storm program. In addition, we continue funding levels for the \nField Computer Crime Intrusion Squads, which are highly trained \ncomputer experts available on demand to field offices. Finally, $5.5 \nmillion is recommended for the Special Technologies Applications Unit \nof the National Infrastructure Protection Center, a clearinghouse for \nFederal cases dealing with cyber crime.\n  We aggressively fund State and local law enforcement assistance, \nproviding $2.8 billion.\n  COPS is funded at $1.03 billion. A large portion of this amount is \nfor hiring initiatives. This high level of funding also allows law \nenforcement agencies to upgrade technology. For programs funded under \nthe Crime Identification Technology Act, $130.0 million is available. \nThere is an additional $140.0 million for non-CITA technology needs.\n  In order to get this bill passed without a veto, we have also \nprovided $25.0 million for community prosecutors and $75.0 million for \ngun prosecutions. The agreement limited these funds to prosecutions of \nindividuals who committed crimes with firearms.\n  Separate from COPS funding we provide funding for the programs that \nCongress traditionally supports. There is $523.0 million available for \nthe Local Law Enforcement Block Grants, $569.0 million for the Edward \nByrne Grants, and $686.5 million for State Prison Grants.\n  The last item I want to talk about in the Justice section of this \nbill is my proposal on how to prevent misuse of Social Security \nnumbers.\n  We have incorporated language that will protect people from the \nimproper use of Social Security numbers. We must protect individuals \nwhen access to an individual's most personal information is wrongly \nobtained.\n  A recent example of the gross misuse of a Social Security number \nhappened in Nashua, New Hampshire, just one year ago. Amy Boyer was \nmurdered by a stalker who was able to purchase her Social Security \nnumber on the Internet. The social security number gave him access to \ninformation so that he was able to track her down and kill her.\n  We have named the incorporated provision after Amy because its goal \nis to ensure that no more stalkers can easily use Social Security \nnumbers for their nefarious acts. Amy Boyer's Law prohibits the display \nor sale to the public of any person's Social Security number without \nthat individual's consent. It imposes civil and criminal penalties on \nthose who violate this law.\n  This legislation, while banning improper or fraudulent uses of social \nsecurity numbers, does preserve the legitimate uses of Social Security \nnumbers by such groups as the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren, the Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America, and the Association \nfor Children for the Enforcement of Support, ACES, as well as banks, \ninsurance companies, and others who use these numbers to prevent fraud. \nI am confident that this legislation is crafted in such a way as to \nbalance the many concerns surrounding the use of Social Security \nnumbers. I believe that passing Amy Boyer's Law is one of the most \nimportant things that Congress can accomplish this year.\n  The next title in the bill is the Department of Commerce and its \nrelated agencies. Title II is funded at a level of $4.7 billion.\n  One of the primary functions of Commerce is to generate a \ncomprehensive international trade policy for our country. Many agencies \nplay a part in this effort. For the agency that has the lead on \nnegotiating trade agreements, we provide $29.5 million for the United \nStates Trade Representative, USTR.\n  To one of its supporting agencies, the International Trade \nCommission, we provide $48.1 million. Their statutory mandate also \nincludes enforcing dumping and counterveiling duty actions in \naccordance with the World Trade Organization and General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade.\n  The International Trade Administration is responsible for promoting \nexports and provides information on Federal Government export \nassistance to individuals and businesses. We provide $337.4 million. \nThis level includes additional funding to increase trade enforcement \nand compliance activities, in concert with USTR. Of particular \nimportance are the funds included in this bill for compliance \nactivities with respect to China, Japan, and the European Union. The \nbill also continues funding for the core programs within the agency.\n  The bill includes $64.9 million for the Bureau of Export \nAdministration which is an increase of roughly $10.8 million over the \nfiscal year 2000 appropriation. The Committee increases funding for \nexport cooperation for the implementation of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention.\n  Also, increased funds are provided to assist in export enforcement in \nthe area of counterterrorism and computer export verification to ensure \nthat high technology exports are being used for peaceful purposes and \nnot for proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  We are providing significantly less money this year for the census \nbecause most of the activities supporting the decennial census have \nbeen concluded. The Committee provides $433.6 million to conclude \nCensus 2000 and maintain normal operations for fiscal year 2001.\n  The conference agreement provides funding to permit the initiation of \nan effort to include a measurement of electronic business in the fiscal \nyear 2002 economic census. The Committee's funding level should also \npermit the Bureau to continue issuing key reports on manufacturing, \ngeneral economic, and foreign trade statistics which are so important \nto the U.S. business community.\n  Moving on to the scientific side of the Commerce Department, this \nbill includes $100.4 million for the National Telecommunications and \nInformation Administration. From within this funding, $43.5 million is \nfor the public telecommunications grant program and $45.5 million is \nfor information infrastructure grants.\n  The President believes solving the digital divide is a government \nobligation. He requested $50.0 million to provide new Home Internet \nAccess grants. Neither the House nor Senate bills included funding for \nthis program. However, the President made this a priority and raised it \nin discussions with us, so we have directed $30.0 million into the \nInformation Infrastructure Grants as a compromise position.\n  However, I note that in an earlier age, public libraries were created \nto give those without the resources to maintain a personal book \ncollection access to information. The Schools and Libraries program was \ncreated in 1996 to provide access to the Internet for every American \nvisiting a library and to school children.\n  Just as Enoch Pratt and Andrew Carnegie endowed public libraries \nthroughout the country, the high tech industry has the ability and the \nwealth to create an endowment for addressing the so-called digital \ndivide. Every person in America who has a phone contributes to the \nUniversal Service fund, which provides funds for the Schools and \nLibraries program. I do not believe that asking Americans to contribute \nadditional funds to bring Internet access to homes is the way to solve \nthe so-called digital divide.\n  One of the agencies whose goals is to stimulate economic competition \nand innovation is the National Institute for Standards and Technology, \nNIST. This agency provides industry with assistance to leverage their \nefforts in technological advances and infrastructure enhancements that \nbenefit all of us by keeping U.S. companies on the cutting edge.\n  NIST's funding level is $598.3 million for fiscal year 2001. Of this \namount, $312.6 million is for scientific and technical research and \nservices programs; $155.0 million and carryover funding\n\n[[Page S11238]]\n\nare available for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP), and $105.1 \nmillion for the Manufacturing Extension Program (MEP).\n  Also, $10 million is provided to develop new measurements, test \nmethods, and guidelines to better protect the information technology \nelements of the Nation's critical infrastructure, of which our cyber \ninfrastructure is a key component. NIST's research results are made \npublicly available so that all may benefit from its findings and \nsuggestions.\n  Another agency within the Department with scientific expertise is the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The bill before you \nincludes $2.6 billion for NOAA, and the five major line offices within \nNOAA are funded as follows: the National Ocean Service at a level of \n$290.0 million; the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) at $517.0 \nmillion; the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research at $323.0 \nmillion; the National Weather Service at $630.0 million; and, the \nNational Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service at a \nlevel of $125.0 million.\n  Within the National Ocean Service, $28.25 million for the National \nEstuarine Research Reserve program. We continue the efforts to reduce \nthe backlog of NOAA mapping and charting as well as to map shorelines. \nThe bill supports the Coastal Zone Management grants at a level of \n$52.0 million and the Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab at the \nSenate level of $7.0 million.\n  Under the National Marine Fisheries Service, we assist the collecting \nof scientific data on healthy fisheries as well as those that are \nthreatened. Protection for threatened and endangered species continues. \nFor NMFS Information, Collection, and Analysis programs, the bill \nprovides $120 million.\n  The funding levels included in the bill for the Office of Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Research support several important programs of interest to \nthe Senate. The Sea Grant College program continues at a level of \n$62.25 million and $15.8 million for the National Undersea Research \nProgram.\n  Climate and Air Quality research is funded at $68.5 million. A new \nclimate initiative was requested for fiscal year 2001, and while the \nconference could not support the total request of $24.0 million, there \nis a recommendation of $9.25 million for initiating the ocean \nobservations component of the proposal.\n  The National Weather Service touches all of our lives, and provides \nthe warnings to protect life and property. The Committee funds Weather \nService Operations and Research and systems acquisitions at $630.8 \nmillion.\n  NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service \noperates the satellites which provide data used by the Weather Service \nto track hurricanes and to provide guidance for forecasts and warnings. \nFunding of $125.0 million is provided for this office within NOAA in \nfiscal year 2001. In addition, funding is provided elsewhere in the \nbill for the acquisition of both geostationary and polar-orbiting \nsatellites.\n  The next title in our bill covers the Judiciary. For the third branch \nof government we provide an increase to $4.25 billion. We provide \nconditional funding for the cost of living adjustment for the justices \nand judges. However, the Senate Committee language ending the ban on \nhonoraria for judges was not incorporated into this final agreement.\n  Now, for the last department in this bill, we provide $6.6 billion to \nthe State Department. This is an increase over the fiscal year 2000 \nlevel for the department.\n  After the Dar Es Salaam and Nairobi bombings, we poured funding into \nState Department security, but we emphasized the need for a cohesive \nplan that had the capability of being effective. The past performance \nof the Department and resulting plans have not allayed the misgivings \nwe have about their handling of the billions of dollars we appropriate \nto them.\n  We are disturbed by the security breaches. The State Department was \nnot just lax with security overseas, but that it has been less than \nstellar at its headquarters here in Washington. From losing 16 laptop \ncomputers and letting press agents roam unattended through its \ncorridors, the State Department's security plans remain of grave \nconcern. We are providing the funding but are not seeing improvements.\n  This bill gives the State Department substantial resources to address \nits requirements. The funding levels include $410 million for worldwide \nsecurity under Diplomatic and Consular Programs. We also provide $663.0 \nmillion in security-related construction under the Embassy Security, \nConstruction, and Maintenance account.\n  The agreement includes a sizeable increase over last year's levels \nfor Cultural and Educational Exchange Programs, providing $231.6 \nmillion--an amount above the President's original request and the \nSenate and House levels. The funding is used to bring individuals \ntogether, professionally and culturally, to share experiences to foster \npeace and understanding among multiple countries and the United States. \nMy colleagues may be familiar with the Fulbright, International \nVisitors, and English Teaching Fellows programs that are included in \nthis account.\n  Lastly in State, we provide $299 million to cover our country's \nregular dues to the United Nations and $846 million for U.N. \npeacekeeping.\n  We remain concerned that the United Nations continues to levy \npeacekeeping payments against us based on a percentage system setup \nduring the 1970s connected to estimates on what member countries could \nafford to pay for such ventures at that time. The United States \ncontests millions of dollars in payments to the United Nations because \ntheir billing procedure is outdated and does not reflect the fiscal \ncapacities of the current member states.\n  For decades, the United States has been levied to pay roughly one-\nthird of peacekeeping efforts even though it is an obligation of all \n188 United Nations members. We will continue to encourage other members \nwho have rebuilt and financially recovered from the ravages of the \nTwentieth Century's wars. They must step up and take over a more \nproportionate share of the financial burden of current peacekeeping \nendeavors.\n  This bill contains a handful of related agencies that act \nindependently of the departments within this bill, and comprise $2.2 \nbillion of the total of this bill.\n  The first of these agencies is the Maritime Administration which is \nresponsible for administering several programs for the maritime \nindustry relating to U.S. foreign and domestic commerce and our \nnational defense. The bill includes a total of $219.6 million for its \nefforts. Within this level, the Maritime Security Program receives \n$98.7 million. The Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program (Title XI) is \nfunded at $34.0 million. In addition, $10.0 million in carryover \nbalances from prior fiscal years are available for this purpose.\n  The final bill before you includes an increase over last year's \nfunding level for the Federal Communications Commission to $230.0 \nmillion.\n  The Small Business Administration (SBA) is one of the larger \nindependent agencies in this bill. We provide $837.0 million for the \nSBA. Within this amount, $88 million is appropriated for the Small \nBusiness Development Centers; $15.0 million for PRIME; $3.8 million for \nSCORE; and, $4.0 million for the Veteran's Outreach program.\n  For SBA's business loan program account, the bill provides a total of \n$294 million in fiscal year 2001. This funding level provides a program \nlevel of $10.4 billion for 7(a) loans.\n  For the SBA disaster loan program, a total of $186.5 million is \nincluded to cover loans and the administration of the program.\n  The last two agencies I want to mention are the Federal Trade \nCommission, FTC, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC. We \nhave given both these agencies increases this year, funding the FTC at \na level of $147.2 million and the SEC at a level of $422.8 million. The \nInternet has caused a fundamental change to both these agencies as they \ntry to put in place mechanisms to prevent fraud in the electronic \nmarket place.\n  The FTC has brought 100 cases against 300 companies and individuals \nfor Internet fraud. As Internet access expands and more Internet \nbusinesses come on-line, the need for these agencies to have a strong \npresence in the market increases. There is a need to\n\n[[Page S11239]]\n\nprotect consumers, and particularly elderly consumers who are prone to \nattacks, from ever varying fraudulent schemes. In 1999, consumers were \nestimated to have spent $20.2 billion on line, and the expectation is \nthat this number will grow almost exponentially over the next 4 years.\n  We are providing additional funding for investigators and prosecutors \nwithin both the SEC and FTC to grow with the impending surge of \nactivity. We provide funding to expand Consumer Sentinel so that \ninternational law enforcement officers will have access to it.\n  The strong presence we promote throughout this bill in the cyber-\nworld is not one derived from statutory and regulatory restrictions, \nbut achieved instead through the presence of enforcers of existing laws \nthat will aggressively seek out those who abuse the Internet. I have \nmade a point of mentioning throughout this summation the key Internet \ninitiatives within the agencies and departments because it is such a \ncritical issue for all of us.\n  Its importance will continue to grow. We have bolstered Federal \nagencies' efforts to stay on top of Internet advancements and maintain \nfunctionality in the technological world.\n  This bill effectively uses our resources to provide adequate funding \nfor the agencies under our jurisdiction. It addresses the most pressing \nneeds that were brought to our attention by the Administration and by \nmy colleagues. Chairman Rogers, the Ranking Members, and I have worked \ntogether with the members of the Committee to craft a bipartisan bill \nto recommend to both our houses. I do want to thank my colleague from \nSouth Carolina for his efforts in creating this bill. He remains a \nleader on many of the issues we address. I urge my colleagues to adopt \nthis funding agreement.\n  Madam President, I would also like to acknowledge today the \ndedication of one of the staffers who drafted portions of this effort \nwho has retired from Federal service.\n  Paddy Link served on the Committee for 4 years dealing with the \nFederal Communications Commission, FCC, the Commerce Department, the \nSmall Business Administration, and many other agencies. She was an \nexpert in FCC and NOAA. Her astute evaluation and handling of technical \nconcepts made her a valued part of the Committee. She has in-depth \nknowledge of the people and issues in the areas she worked on which \ngave her much appreciated insight on the issues the Committee had to \ntackle.\n  She provided decades of Federal service, starting as staff in the \nHouse of Representatives, moving to the Department of Commerce as a \ncongressional liaison officer and then to be the director of the office \nof legislative affairs for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric \nAdministration. Most recently before her time with Appropriations, \nPaddy was the staff director of the Senate Commerce Committee under \nformer Chairman Larry Pressler and had a critical role in writing and \npassing the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\n  We miss her political acumen as well as her sense of humor. We wish \nher the best of luck in the future.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Broadwave affiliates of Northpoint \nTechnology proposes to share the spectrum currently being used by the \nDirect Broadcast Satellite (DBS) services in the 12.2-12.7 GHz \nfrequency bands. Through the use of its technology in the 12.2-12.7 GHz \nband, Northpoint has the potential to provide much needed competition \nto cable by offering low cost multichannel video services and high-\nspeed Internet access.\n  A provision, however, addressing sharing issues in the 12.2-12.7 GHz \nband has been added to the ``Launching Our Communities' Access to Local \nTelevision Act of 2000'' (also referred to as the Rural Loan Guarantee \nbill). Section 12 of this Act imposes three general requirements. \nFirst, it requires that a terrestrial wireless applicant proposing to \nuse the 12.2-12.7 GHz band have its technology subjected to an \nindependent demonstration or have its technical showings subjected to \nan independent analysis to determine whether the technology will cause \nharmful interference to DBS operators. Second, the Federal \nCommunications Commission is required to select an independent \nengineering firm recommended by the IEEE or other similar body to \nanalyze the technologies proposed in the pending wireless terrestrial \napplications. Third, the demonstration or analysis must be concluded \nwithin 60 days of enactment of the Rural Loan Guarantee bill and the \ncomment cycle cannot exceed an additional 30 days. Lastly, I want to \nnote that enactment of this provision by Congress does not release the \nFCC from its obligations under section 2002 of SHIVA.\n  In my home state of South Carolina, there are Broadwave affiliates \nawaiting regulatory approval so that they can begin to provide service. \nTherefore, I expect that the testing required under the Rural Loan \nGuarantee legislation will constitute the final interference analysis \nneeded to evaluate sharing requirements between terrestrial applicants \nwith pending applications and existing DBS service providers. Moving \nthis proceeding forward is important, because if Northpoint is able to \nobtain the necessary regulatory authorizations, it will not only be \nable to provide competition to cable, but through its affiliate \nstructure, it also will afford small businesses an opportunity to \nparticipate in a vibrant segment of the communications marketplace.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in 1992, Congress enacted legislation \nregulating the cable industry because of the lack of competition and \nthe resulting high rates. In 1996, Congress anticipating that \ncompetition would replace regulation in restraining prices, passed \nlegislation terminating the FCC's right to regulate the price of basic \ncable in March 1999. Unfortunately, competition has not emerged as \nfully as I would have liked. According to the FCC's latest report only \n157 communities out of 33,000 communities across America have \n``effective competition.'' In fact, in many communities in Hawaii, \nconsumers have no cable service at all.\n  Northpoint Technology and its Broadwave affiliates want to provide \nlow cost multi-channel video and data services in every television \nmarket in the United States. Therefore, it is critical that Congress \nand the FCC take the actions necessary to resolve sharing and other \ntechnical and policy issues quickly with respect to the applications of \nthe Broadwave affiliates. Furthermore, these applications are subject \nto a Congressional mandate (Section 2002 of S. 1948, the Satellite Home \nViewer Improvement Act) that requires the FCC by November 29, 2000 to \ngrant or deny applications such as those of the Broadwave affiliates, \nthat can provide television service in rural areas. The technical \nsharing analysis required by the ``Launching Our Communities' Access to \nLocal Television Act of 2000'' does not obviate the legislative \nobligation imposed by S. 1948. Therefore, the FCC should do whatever is \nnecessary to meet its November 29, 2000 obligations.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the controversy \nsurrounding Section 12 of this bill, Section 1012 of Commerce, Justice, \nState and the Judiciary Appropriations conference report, has been \nresolved. Although I believe the new provision is unnecessary, I hope \nthat requiring a technical demonstration to resolve harmful \ninterference questions in the 12.2 GHz band will put this issue to \nrest. However, let me be clear that I support Section 12 with the \nunderstanding that it does not supercede or otherwise impact relevant \nprovisions in the Satellite Home Viewers Improvement Act (Public Law \n106-113, 113 Stat 1501)) which require the FCC to complete by November \n29, 2000, the processing of applications and other authorizations for \nlocal facilities that can provide local television and broadband \nservices to rural and underserved areas.\n  Northpoint Technology and its 69 Broadwave affiliates applied on \nJanuary 8, 1999, to provide lower cost multi-channel video and data \nservices in every television market in the United States. Northpoint's \ntechnology is particularly innovative and accomplishes something that \nis unique in telecommunications history. Using Northpoint's patented \nsystem, the Broadwave affiliates will be able to re-use the 12.2-12.7 \nband without the need to relocate existing users DirecTV and Echostar.\n\n[[Page S11240]]\n\n  Northpoint Technology through its Broadwave affiliates will offer \nconsumers in Boston and several other markets the benefits of true \ncompetition in the marketplace for multichannel video programming and \ndata services. In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress \nestablished March 1999 as the sunset on the FCC's authority to regulate \nthe price of basic cable service. Congress took this action with the \nanticipation that competition would replace regulation in restraining \nprices and improving quality in the video programming marketplace. The \nrapid introduction of Broadwave service to communities across America \nwill go a long way toward achieving the goals of the 1996 Act and \nensuring that consumers enjoy the fruits of competition including \ngreater choice, lower prices and quality service.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Hart-Scott-\nRodino Act reform included in the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations \nBill. Our provision updates the law, which hadn't been adjusted for \ninflation since it was enacted in 1976, and makes several improvements \nto the merger review process undertaken by the Antitrust Division of \nthe Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. It is a \nbipartisan measure, authored by Senators Hatch, Leahy, DeWine and \nmyself and Representatives Hyde and Conyers, and it deserves our \nsupport.\n  The Hart-Scott-Rodino Act is crucial to the enforcement of \ncompetition policy in today's economy--it ensures that the antitrust \nagencies have sufficient time to review mergers and acquisitions prior \nto their completion. The statute requires that, prior to consummating a \nmerger or acquisition of a certain minimum size, the companies involved \nmust formally notify the antitrust agencies and must provide certain \ninformation regarding the proposed transaction. For those transactions \ncovered by the Act, the parties to a merger or acquisition may not \nclose their transaction until the expiration of a waiting period after \nmaking their Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing. It also authorizes the \ngovernment to subpoena additional information from merging parties so \nthat the government has sufficient information to complete its merger \nanalysis.\n  While this statute has a very laudable purpose, especially with the \ntremendous numbers of mergers and acquisitions taking place in recent \nyears, some of its provisions are in need of revision. Most \nimportantly, while inflation has caused the value of a dollar to drop \nby more than a half in the past 25 years, the monetary test that \nsubjects a transaction to the provisions of the statute has not been \nrevised since the law's enactment in 1976. As a result, many \ntransactions that are of a relatively small size and pose little \nantitrust concerns are nevertheless swept into the ambit of the Hart-\nScott-Rodino review process. This legislation updates this statute to \nbetter fit into today's economy by raising the minimum size of \ntransaction covered by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act from $15 million to \n$50 million. This will both lessen the agencies' burden of reviewing \nsmall transactions unlikely to seriously affect competition and enable \nthe agencies to allocate their resources to properly focus on those \ntransactions most worthy of scrutiny.\n  Further, exempting smaller transactions from the Hart-Scott-Rodino \nprocess will significantly lessen regulatory burdens and expenses \nimposed on small businesses. The parties to these smaller transactions \nwill no longer need to pay the $45,000 filing fee--or face the often \neven more onerous legal fees and other expenses typically incurred in \npreparing a Hart-Scott-Rodino filing--for mergers and acquisitions that \nusually don't pose any competitive concerns.\n  In exempting this class of transactions from Hart-Scott-Rodino \nreview, however, it is important that we not cause the antitrust \nagencies to lose the funding they need to carry out their increasingly \ndemanding mission of enforcing the nation's antitrust laws. This bill \nwill reduce the number of Hart-Scott-Rodino filings and therefore \nreduce the revenues generated by these filings if the filing fees were \nkept at their present level. Of course, in a perfect world, we wouldn't \nfinance the Antitrust Division and the FTC on the backs of these filing \nfees. But because they are a fact of life, the antitrust agencies \nshould not be penalized by these reforms by suffering such a reduction \nin revenues. As a result, in order to assure that this reform is \nrevenue neutral, we have worked with the Appropriations Committee to \nensure that this bill raises the filing fees for the largest \ntransactions. Consequently, filing fees are to be increased for \ntransactions valued at over $100,000,000, which makes sense because \nthese transactions require more scrutiny.\n  This legislation makes other changes designed to enhance the \nefficiency of the pre-merger review process. The waiting period has \nbeen extended from twenty to thirty days after the parties' compliance \nwith the government's request for additional information, a more \nrealistic waiting period in this era of increasingly complex mergers \ngenerating enormous amounts of relevant information and documents. And, \nas in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, when a deadline for \ngovernmental action occurs on a weekend or holiday, the deadline is \nextended to the next business day. This simple provision will eliminate \ngamesmanship by parties who currently may time their compliance so that \nthe waiting period ends on a weekend or holiday, effectively shortening \nthe waiting period to the previous business day.\n  Finally, in recent years many have expressed concerns regarding the \ndifficulties and expense imposed on business in complying with \nallegedly overly burdensome or duplicative government requests for \nadditional information. So our legislation also contains carefully \ncrafted provisions to ensure that business is not faced with unduly \nburdensome or overbroad requests for information, while assuring that \nthe antitrust agencies' ability to obtain the information necessary to \ncarry out a merger investigation is not hampered. Specifically, our \nlegislation mandates that the FTC and Antitrust Division designate a \nsenior official who does not have direct authority for the review of \nany enforcement recommendation to be designated to hear appeals to the \nappropriateness of the government's information requests the so called \n``Second Requests''. The bill also sets forth the specific standards \nthat this senior official is to utilize when considering such an appeal \nand mandates that these appeals be heard in an expedited manner.\n  In sum, I believe this legislation to be a reasonable and well \nbalanced reform of our government's vital merger review procedures. It \nwill make long overdue adjustments in the filing thresholds--ensuring \nreview of those mergers in most need of governmental scrutiny while \nreducing the burden and expense on government and private parties by \nexempting smaller transactions from often expensive and time consuming \npre-merger filings. It will also significantly reform the merger review \nprocess to ensure that the government has sufficient time to analyze \nincreasing complex merger transactions, while also adding protections \nso that private parties do not face unduly burdensome or duplicative \ninformation requests. I urge swift passage of this measure.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, today we are considering the \nConference report for the District of Columbia. This conference report \nalso includes the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations act.\n  We crafted a good bill in conference.\n  We have fully funded the D.C. tuition program--which allows D.C. high \nschool students greater educational choices beyond the border of this \nCity.\n  We have fully funded the new metro station in the New York Avenue \ncorridor, which I know is important to the economic development of the \nCity.\n  We have $3 million in funding for the Poplar Point environmental \nclean up.\n  We have increased funding for the Courts. The salaries of Court \nemployees are 19 percent below the level of federal court employees--\nthus--it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep a quality \nworkforce.\n  Our bill also increases the budget for offender services so that we \ncontinue the program of drug testing and treatment for offenders who \nare on probation or awaiting trial.\n  Much as been said in the past about ``riders'' to the District \nbudget. This year, we have eliminated over 30 of last year's riders.\n\n[[Page S11241]]\n\n  The bill will authorize the District's planned tobacco securitization \nprogram--the proceeds of which will be used to reduce debt or build \nreserves.\n  With respect to the District's reserves, we have restructured the \nreserve funds of the District so they can function more efficiently. \nThis is probably the most important reform in this bill.\n  The District is supposed to hold a $150 million reserve now--and a \nbudget surplus of 4 percent of revenues.\n  But we found last year that the District wanted to dip into the \nemergency reserve funds for things that are considered ordinary \nexpenses. We also found that the reserves were really hollow--entirely \ndependent on how much cash flow the District had on any given day.\n  I didn't think this was good enough for this City. The bond markets \nwant and need reassurance that the District's financial turnaround is \nsound.\n  We have restructured the District's reserves so that they will have \nboth an emergency reserve and a contingency reserve. This is modeled on \nthe practices of other cities. And, most importantly, when established, \nthese reserves will be in cash and will be held in separate accounts, \nearning interest.\n  The contingency reserve, which will be 3 percent of their budget, is \nfor unanticipated expenses, like court orders, new federal mandates or \nextremely bad weather. It will be more flexible.\n  The emergency reserve, which will be 4 percent of their budget, is \nfor extraordinary needs, like natural disasters. It will be the backing \nfor the financial soundness we seek.\n  In consultation with the CFO and the Mayor, we allow the District a \nseven year glide path to establish these reserves, but both have \nassured me the tobacco securitization program will be used to fund this \nemergency requirement now. There could be no better use than this and \ndebt reduction.\n  The District has had a dramatic financial recovery. I consider this \nthe last leg of the financial plan. This will serve as a true ``rainy \nday'' fund--one that is ready and able to be tapped in those \ncircumstances.\n  To conclude, although the President has indicated he has reservations \nabout the CJS bill--he has indicated that the D.C. portion of the \nconference report is a bill he would sign.\n  Madam President, let me now turn to the Commerce, Justice, State \nprovisions.\n  I want to thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member for their work on \nthis bill. They have worked very hard to put more federal resources on \nour border, though we still have a long way to go.\n  These are not resources just for Texas. The drugs that come into the \nUnited States along the Southwest border will find their way into every \ncity in the United States. The Southwest border is ground zero in the \nwar against drugs.\n  Making our border more secure--makes every American city more secure \nfrom the scourge of drugs.\n  The Conference report provides for the hiring of over 400 new border \nagents. I would have preferred a higher number--but the Administration \nhas dragged its feet on higher agents in the past--so we know this is a \nrealistic goal for next year.\n  It provides $15 million in equipment upgrades for the border patrol.\n  It provides greater funding for DEA, with emphasis on helping drug \nthreats at the State and local level.\n  The Conference report also addresses the ``upstream'' effect of more \nlaw enforcement on the border.\n  What has happened is this: as we have increased our law enforcement \npresence on the border--a strain has been felt on our judiciary system.\n  This bill provides for 13 new U.S. Attorneys along the Southwest \nborder--where they are desperately needed. The five U.S. courts along \nthe border are the busiest courts in the Nation--handling 26 percent of \nall the criminal cases in the United States. These new positions are \ndesperately needed.\n  The bill also provides for two new Federal judges one in the Southern \nand one in the Western judicial district in Texas. I sponsored the bill \nto create 13 new judgeships along the border. I would have preferred \nthe full number of judgeships, but I am pleased the Committee has \naccommodated the need for new judges in my State.\n  The bill does not provide badly needed salary increases for border \npatrol agents, which the Senate has passed and fought to produce. I \nwill continue to press to bring our Border Patrol in line with all \nother border government salary schedules.\n  It is regrettable that the President has threatened to veto this \nbill, particularly over the immigration provision. I believe we have \nstruck a balanced approach on this issue in this bill.\n  President Clinton's plan would grant broad amnesty to immigrants that \narrived between 1982 and 1986. Our Border Patrol Officers have said ``a \nnew amnesty would encourage innumerable others to break our laws in the \nfuture.'' I couldn't agree more.\n  Our proposal would provide greater due process to those who believe \nthey were wrongly denied amnesty. We also shorten the waiting period \nfor spouses and children to join their relatives in the United States. \nThese relatives will likely be able to immigrate legally soon, but we \nallow them to come to the U.S. while their petitions are awaiting \naction. This is a reasonable proposal the President should accept.\n  Madam President, I will yield the floor and urge my colleagues to \nsupport the bill.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

As we resolutely \nwork toward the goal of adjournment, I want to take a few moments to \npay tribute to Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, our former \ncolleague and the nation's 20th Secretary of Defense.\n  Secretary Cohen, better known as ``Bill'' to all of us, has since \nJanuary 24, 1997, been at the helm of the Department of Defense and the \nleader of the\n\n[[Page S11243]]\n\ngreatest military force in the history of our great Nation. His tenure \nas Secretary of Defense will be marked by great advances in the quality \nof life for our military personnel and their families, the refocusing \nof the Department of Defense to the new threats of weapons of mass \ndestruction and cyber-terrorism, and, more importantly, assuring this \nNation's position as the world's only super power.\n  Bill Cohen is a Renaissance Man of the same mold as the founders of \nthis Nation. A forward thinker who has been an influential voice on \ndefense and security issues since he was first elected to the House of \nRepresentatives from Maine's Second Congressional District in 1973. \nDuring his eighteen years as a United States Senator representing the \nState of Maine, Bill Cohen played a leading role in defense matters \nwhile a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Not only was he \na key sponsor of the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act of \n1986, but also the GI Bill of 1984, the Intelligence Oversight Reform \nAct of 1991, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 and the Federal \nAcquisition Reform Act of 1996.\n  His long and distinguished service to the Nation and the State of \nMaine, both as a legislator and Secretary of Defense, will serve as a \nlasting tribute to William S. Cohen. I congratulate him on his long and \ndistinguished career and thank him for the courtesies and friendship he \nextended to me during his service in the Senate and as Secretary of \nDefense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11243-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RETIREMENT OF OFFICER OLIVER ``ANDY'' ANDERS FROM THE UNITED STATES \n                          CAPITOL POLICE FORCE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \npraiseworthy individual who has dedicated his life to serving the \npeople of this Nation as an officer on the United States Capitol Police \nForce, Officer Oliver ``Andy'' Anders. Andy will be retiring from the \nCapitol Police on November 3, 2000, after 26 years of faithful service. \nHis presence will be missed throughout the halls of Congress.\n  Over the last three decades I have had the opportunity to get to know \nAndy. For many years, he greeted me at the doors of the Senate chamber \nwhere he stood sentry. I always appreciated having the opportunity to \nchat with this friendly native of Greer, South Carolina, and I admired \nthe professionalism he demonstrated throughout his tenure.\n  Too often we fail to properly thank the courageous men and women who, \nlike Officer Anders, serve on the Capitol Police Force. These fine \nindividuals make countless sacrifices to protect and serve both the \ndaily visitors and the workers at the Capitol. They are on guard 24 \nhours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, providing a vital service \nso that we can walk these hollowed halls without fear. These officers \nhave continuously displayed integrity and honor, and I commend them for \ntheir dedicated service. We are truly in their debt.\n  At this time, I ask that my colleagues join me in wishing Officer \nAnders health, happiness, and success in all of his future endeavors. \nHe has served his Nation well, and we are grateful for his assistance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11243-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, the Bible says in Ecclesiastes, ``To \neverything there is a season, a time for every purpose under heaven.'' \nAnd, now, as the 106th Congress is coming to a close, the hour has come \nto pay tribute to five distinguished colleagues--Senators with whom I \nhave had the honor and pleasure of working. These gentlemen of the \nSenate have decided that it is now time to embark on a new chapter in \ntheir lives.\n  Each in his own way has left behind a part of their vision for \nAmerica and has influenced the course of our country.\n  The Senate Finance Committee is seeing a great exodus as four of the \nfive Senators retiring served this Committee. I will certainly miss \ntheir participation on this committee and the leadership on key issues.\n  Daniel Patrick Moynihan and I were elected to the Senate from our \nrespective states in the same year--1976. So we two freshman learned \nthe ways of this august body at the same time. And, I have to say to my \ncolleagues who have more recently been elected to this body, that was \nno minor education. We began our Senate service with giants like James \nO. Eastland, Barry Goldwater, Hubert Humphrey, and Howard Baker.\n  The difference was that Pat Moynihan had already had a distinguished \ncareer in public service having served as urban affairs advisor to \nPresident Nixon and as Ambassador to India and the United Nations. I \nhave always had great admiration for his strong character, great \nintellect and exceptional diplomacy--particularly on those occasions \nwhen it was between warring political parties, not countries.\n  Senator Moynihan is famous for spotting emerging issues long before \nanyone else. He has been warning for years that Social Security needs \nreform. He has urged reform of the alternative minimum tax, and worked \ntirelessly in the effort to reform a broken welfare system.\n  On the candor scale, Senator Robert Kerrey would rank near the top. \nThat is a commodity sadly lacking in many circles--and not just in \ngovernment, but in business and academia as well. Bob Kerrey has been \nas courageous about sharing his opinions as he was when serving in the \nVietnam war, during which he was awarded a Purple Heart, Bronze Star, \nand our nation's highest honor, the Congressional of Medal of Honor.\n  He left the governorship of Nebraska with a 70 percent approval \nrating, which tells us something about his record of employing common \nsense and exercising integrity in governance. Nebraskans are no \nnonsense, hard-working people. They would not have tolerated any less.\n  Bob Kerrey has put those same virtues to work in the Senate, \nparticularly in our bipartisan efforts to reform Social Security and \nMedicare as well as the IRS.\n  I am going to miss my colleague from the West, Senator Richard Bryan. \nThough we have not agreed on every issue--who does?--we have a common \nappreciation for the impact of federal policy on the western states.\n  I was also most appreciative and grateful for his honest, \nstraightforward, and thorough leadership of the Senate Ethics \nCommittee--no doubt one of the more thankless jobs in the Senate. But, \nevery senator, regardless of political party, could be assured that, if \nwrongs had been committed,\n\n[[Page S11244]]\n\nthey would certainly be found out. If allegations were false, the \nverdict would be made clear to all.\n  Senator Frank Lautenberg, like me, is living proof that the American \ndream can come true. His hard work, determination, and ingenuity \nbrought him from humble beginnings to build with two partners the \nAutomatic Data Processing (ADP) Company, which became the world's \nlargest computing services company.\n  I was pleased to work with Senator Lautenberg on legislation to \nprohibit smoking on public transportation. He has been a tireless \nworker in the war to prevent teenage smoking.\n  To my Democratic colleagues, Senators Lautenberg, Moynihan, Bryan and \nKerrey: We have battled through many issues, each of us committed to \ndoing what we believed was best for America and for our respective \nstates. There has never been a dull moment. It has been a privilege to \nwork with you.\n  Last but not least, I have to bid farewell to my fellow Republican \nand Finance Committee member, Senator Connie Mack. His friendship, \nleadership, and dedication to furthering the causes of fiscal \nresponsibility, governmental accountability, and medical research will \nbe greatly missed.\n  Senator Mack has successfully fought for Florida's concerns and kept \nhis campaign promise of ``less taxing, less spending, less government \nand more freedom,'' which resulted in 70 percent of the vote in 1994, \nmore than any other Republican Senatorial candidate in the Nation.\n  The Roman politician Cicero states, ``It is the character of a brave \nand resolute man not to be ruffled by adversity and not to desert his \npost.''\n  I believe Senator Mack has been this exemplary leader; and, instead \nof faltering like most men, Senator Mack had the ability to rise above \nnot one, but three, personal battles with cancer--his wife's, his \ndaughter's and his own. Senator Mack lost his mother, father and \nyounger brother to cancer. This history makes the Mack's the poster \nfamily for early detection, a role they have indefatigably played.\n  Drawing from this experience, Senator Mack has fought to double the \nfunding for National Institute of Health (NIH) in order to step up the \nsearch for a cure for cancer as well as other diseases that plague our \nfamilies and society today. This is a goal I will continue to support \nnot as a legacy for Connie Mack, but inspired by him and his family.\n  It has been a pleasure and an honor to serve with these men, and I \nwant to take this opportunity to bid farewell and best wishes to our \ncolleagues as they begin what I hope will be a very rewarding \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11244-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INFORMATION SYSTEMS SECURITY\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the General Accounting Office recently \nconcluded that formal software management policies at eight of the \nsixteen U.S. Federal agencies they investigated were found to be \ninadequate and that controls over access to software codes were weak. I \nam convinced that the information systems used by the Department of \nDefense are critical components of the warfighting capability of the \nUnited States. Off-the-shelf and customized software is critical to the \nfunctioning of these systems. I rise today to express my concern that \nthe security and integrity of critical government systems could be at \ngreat risk if their operational software has been procured or developed \noutside the United States or without proper oversight and control. I \nhave read, with growing concern, a number of news articles that suggest \nthat foreign software acquisitions can have potentially catastrophic \nconsequences on both classified and unclassified national information \nmanagement systems used by Federal agencies for sensitive applications.\n  I would like to cite just few examples to illustrate my point. An \narticle in the February 16, 2000, Washington Post discussed the State \nDepartment's purchase of an unclassified, but sensitive, business \noperations system with software code developed by former citizens of \nthe Soviet Union. According to the article, State withdrew the system \nfrom their embassies worldwide because they were concerned that hidden \ncode might have been added during development and fielding. The final \nparagraph of the article states: ``The lesson of State's fiasco is \nsimple--but so important it should be hard-wired: As people and \norganizations grow more dependent on computers, they become more \nvulnerable. It's easy to forget that every line of code can be a \npotential spy or saboteur.''\n  On March 2, 2000, the New York Times reported that Japanese software \nsuppliers associated with the terrorist sect responsible for the Tokyo \nsubway nerve gas attack had sold software programs to several Japanese \ngovernment agencies, to include their Defense Ministry. According to \nthe article, the agencies and companies that ordered the software were \nunaware that the sect was involved because the principal suppliers had \nsub-contracted the work to others. As recently as June 19, 2000, the \nDefense News reported that two German defense industry employees were \nconvicted of selling missile secrets to Russia. A software provider \ncould have easily employed these ``spies.'' Unfortunately, this is not \na new phenomenon. On October 24, 1999, as we prepared for the Y2K \ntransition, the Los Angeles Times ran an article citing concerns by \nsecurity experts that the use of foreign contractors for Y2K solutions \ncould have placed critical systems at risk. The article reports that, \nin the words of one government security expert, ``The use of untested \nforeign sources for Y2K remediation has created a unique opportunity \nfor foreign countries or companies to access and disrupt sensitive \nnational security and proprietary information systems.'' The GAO \nfurther maintained that background screening policies for personnel \ninvolved in Y2K remediation were lacking or inadequate despite at least \n85 Federal contracts being completed using foreign nationals.\n  The Department of Defense routinely purchases software developed by \nforeign companies. The Department is often unaware of that fact. For \nmany of its unclassified, but critically important, business operating \nsystems, government agencies contract with a systems integrator. The \nintegrator then selects the software system to be installed as part of \nthe operating system. The Agencies are often not aware that the \nsoftware was developed in a foreign country, by foreign developers, and \nperhaps, even in a foreign language. I believe that, at a minimum, the \nprovision of software produced by a U.S. company (or at least software \ncontrolled by a U.S. company) should be a consideration in the \nacquisition process. Encouraging the Defense Department (and other \nGovernment agencies) to at least consider the origin and ownership of \nsource codes will not eliminate vulnerability, but it is a step in the \nright direction. Additionally, it reinforces software development as a \nkey component of our defense industrial base. For that reason, I urge \nthe Administration to put in place protocols in the selection process \nthat consider the origin of all source codes used in the development of \ninformation systems acquired or developed. This should include those \nacquisitions arranged via sub-contracts by prime contractors or system \nintegrators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11244-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11244-S11245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SUPPORT FOR CHINA COMMISSION INCREASED FUNDING\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the Commerce, \nState and Justice Appropriations Conference report's recommendation \nwhich provides $500,000 for the congressional-executive commission on \nChina. This noteworthy commission was established in Title III of the \nChina/PNTR bill, which the Senate passed with a strong majority and the \nPresident signed into law just two weeks ago.\n  It is my understanding that the Commission would normally require a \nfunding level of at least $1.3 million. However, this year the \nconferees allocated a lesser amount based on the fact that the \nCommission will operate for less than a full year in FY2001.\n  Without a doubt, we should fully support the Commission at its \nrequested level of $1.3 million in FY2002 and subsequent years once \nmembers have been appointed, staff hired and the operation is fully \nfunctional for an entire fiscal year. While the initial request of \n$500,000 is sufficient for the start-up operation of the Commission, it \nfalls far short of the amount required by its enabling legislation and \nour congressional intent.\n\n[[Page S11245]]\n\n  Passage of PNTR for China is one of the most significant pieces of \nlegislation this Congress has passed in this decade. The Commission \nwill play an essential role in the oversight of its implementation and \nChina's adherence to its international obligations.\n  Again, Mr. President, I support funding accorded by the CJS \nAppropriations bill for FY2001 and will further support increased \nfunding of at least $1.3 million in the next and following fiscal \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11245-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SENATOR DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Senate will soon bid a fond farewell \nto one of its most distinguished members, the senior Senator from New \nYork. I rise today to bid him adieu.\n  As we all know, Daniel Patrick Moynihan is the Senate's Renaissance \nMan, a man of dazzling intelligence and accomplishments in many arenas \nof public life. A scholar, an author, a teacher, a statesman, a \nSenator: he is--to paraphrase President Kennedy's comment on Thomas \nJefferson--perhaps the most extraordinary collection of talent, of \nhuman knowledge, that has ever graced the United States Senate. This \nbody and every one of its members have been touched by his grace, and \nwe shall all be ever the richer for the days he spent with us.\n  I have enjoyed the additional pleasure of serving with Senator \nMoynihan on the Environment and Public Works Committee. In past years, \nas Chairman of the Committee, he raised public awareness on the issue \nof acid rain. In doing so, he broadened our horizons by greatly \nexpanding our understanding of the far-reaching effects that human \nactions can have on the environment and the effects that environmental \ndegradation can have on human beings.\n  Mr. President, I know that Senator Moynihan has much more to offer \nhis country, and I hope that he will long continue to give the Senate \nthe benefit of his peerless intellect, insight, and experience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11245-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SENATOR RICHARD H.

Bryan of Nevada.\n  With his impending retirement from the Senate, Senator Bryan will \nculminate 36 years of public service at the local, state, and national \nlevels. He has served the people of Nevada as a district attorney, \npublic defender, state legislator, state attorney general, governor, \nand United States Senator. Throughout his career, he has been known for \nhis intelligence, integrity, and good sense.\n  During his two terms in the Senate, Dick Bryan has addressed a \nvariety of national issues without forgetting the people of his state. \nHe has been a leading champion of American consumers, fashioning laws \nto require air bags in automobiles, protect Internet privacy, reduce \ntelemarketing fraud, and reduce errors in personal credit reports. He \nhas fought for American taxpayers by working to reduce wasteful \nspending, eliminate special-interest subsidies, and balance the Federal \nbudget.\n  Senator Bryan has been a vigilant and tireless protector of Nevada's \nenvironment, working to save Lake Tahoe and prevent the construction of \na nuclear waste storage facility at the Nevada Test Site. Earlier this \nmonth, he won another victory for his home State's environment with the \npassage of the Black Rock Desert--High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails \nNational Conservation Area Act, which will provide added protection to \nnearly 800,000 acres of federal land in northwestern Nevada.\n  Senator Bryan is a gentleman, a man known for his ability to work \nwith people of all parties and persuasions. In bidding him farewell, I \nhope that the Senate will carry on his spirit of comity, courtesy, and \nbipartisanship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11245-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SENATOR FRANK LAUTENBERG\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to the senior \nSenator from New Jersey: my dear friend and distinguished colleague, \nSenator Frank Lautenberg.\n  This is a bittersweet occasion for me--sad because Frank will be \nleaving us soon, but sweet because he leaves us with so many fond \nmemories and such a great example of what it means to serve the \nAmerican people through this great institution.\n  Frank Lautenberg has been one of my closest friends in the Senate. He \nhas also been my colleague, confidante, mentor, and role model. \nIntensely patriotic and ethical, he takes his role as legislator very \nseriously without taking himself too seriously. A man of deep and wide-\nranging intellect, he is quick to grasp the essentials of any issue \nbefore the Senate yet slow to criticize others, even those with whom he \ndisagrees. A tolerant and benevolent man, he is ever ready to \ncompromise in the name of harmony yet firm in his core beliefs and \nsteadfast in acting on them.\n  Frank Lautenberg is a living embodiment of the American Dream. The \nson of poor immigrants, he served in World War II, graduated from \nColumbia University on the G.I. Bill, went into business with friends \nand developed one of the world's leading computer services companies. \nHe chose public service not as a career move but as a way of giving \nsomething back to the people of his state and nation.\n  During his three terms in the Senate, Frank Lautenberg has worked to \ndefend and improve the health, safety, and security of every American \nfamily. He wrote the laws to raise the national drinking age, ban \nsmoking on airplanes, toughen the standards on drunk driving, and \nprevent anyone convicted of domestic violence from owning a gun. He \nhelped write the Superfund, Clean Air, and Safe Drinking Water Acts. \nAnd he co-authored the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997, which put \nAmerica on the path to sustaining Social Security and Medicare.\n  Frank Lautenberg served the public good before he came to the Senate, \nand he will do so long after he leaves us. He founded the Lautenberg \nCenter for General and Tumor Immunology three decades ago, and he \ncontinues to support its work as one of the world's leading cancer \nresearch institutions. A noted philanthropist, he continues to support \ncharitable work in education, the environment, the arts, and the Jewish \ncommunity.\n  Mr. President, Frank Lautenberg is someone I could point out to my \ngrandson and say, ``There is a man.'' He is a great human being, a \ngreat American, and a great Senator. His departure will be a great loss \nto the Senate, but his presence has been a great gift to us all. I \nthank him for all that he has done for me, for this body, and for the \npeople of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11245-4", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATOR ROBERT KERREY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to Senator \nRobert Kerrey, a distinguished friend and colleague who will be leaving \nthe Senate at the close of this Congress.\n  Bob Kerrey is a true American hero, a man of great physical and \npolitical courage. We all know about his heroism on the battlefield, \nthough he rarely mentions it and does nothing to solicit the admiration \nshowered upon him. A man of peace and goodwill, he speaks with \nunparalleled authority on the need to maintain a strong national \ndefense while working for reconciliation with America's former \nadversaries.\n  Bob Kerrey's political courage is evidenced by his independence, \ncandor, and willingness to tackle the toughest issues. He took on \nentitlement reform when few others dared look it in the face. He took \nthe first brave steps toward a bipartisan reform of Medicare in order \nto guarantee the program's long-term stability. And he has continued to \npress for universal health care coverage for all Americans.\n  In an era when even the finest legislators hesitate to speak before \nconsulting the polls, Bob Kerrey says what he means and means what he \nsays. He never hesitates to follow his personal moral compass, even \nwhen this means working with the other political party or criticizing \nhis own.\n  Mr. President, as Senator Kerrey leaves the halls of Congress for the \ngroves of academe, I know that he will bring the same courage and rigor \nto his new career that he has displayed here in the Senate. I join my \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle in sending him off with our \nbest wishes and profound gratitude.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11246-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11246]]\n                OBJECTION TO PROCEEDING TO CERTAIN BILLS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

I do so consistent with the commitment I have made \nto explain publicly any so-called ``holds'' that I may place on \nlegislation.\n  S. 2691 is a bi-partisan bill, authored by myself and Senator Smith \nof Oregon, and supported by all the members of Oregon's Congressional \ndelegation.

Mr. President, recently the Burlington Free Press \nhad an article about Ann Kriesel of Burlington, VT and praised her as \nthe volunteer of the week.\n  The Leahy family has known Ann Trueblood Kriesel almost from the time \nshe came to Burlington. She is an extraordinary person, loved and \nrespected by all who know her. She and her husband, Peter, are dear \nfriends of Marcelle's and mine, and she has made her mark on our \ncommunity in a way that would bring great pride and credit to anyone.\n  As an exemplary teacher, as a mother and grandmother, her \nintelligence, quiet wit and grace has helped Vermonters of all ages.\n  It is with pride that I ask the article about her be included in the \nCongressional Record, so that all Senators might know this exemplary \nwoman and how much she and Peter mean to all of us.\n  The article follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Oct. 18, 2000]\n\n             Former Teacher Enjoys New Role as a Volunteer\n\n                          (By Beth Gillespie)\n\n       Anne Kriesel is one of those special people who go out of \n     their way to enrich other people's lives.\n       The volunteer at The Converse Home in Burlington browses \n     through local libraries for short stories, essays and \n     articles that the home's residents would enjoy and reads the \n     selections once a week. She also calls out for bingo games \n     and facilitates group crossword puzzles.\n       A hostess during their social hours, Kriesel visits with \n     people and serves refreshments, and during outings she helps \n     those who use walkers get on and off the bus, carries \n     articles for them and keeps track of everyone.\n       Kriesel introduces herself to new residents and helps them \n     feel comfortable. She worked one-on-one with one woman until \n     her death, visiting with her and playing canasta, Kings in \n     the Corner, rummy and other games.\n       ``Anne is generous, genuine and dependable,'' says Patti \n     Meyer, activity/volunteer director for Converse. ``Her bright \n     personality and positive `can-do' attitude are priceless--she \n     enthusiastically embraces her responsibilities and gladly \n     does whatever she can to help out. Anne has become part of \n     our family as she helps to make Converse a true home. The \n     time she shares with us is very precious and we thank her \n     from the bottom of our hearts.''\n       Kriesel also substitutes for Meals on Wheels and is \n     involved with the Joint Urban Ministries Program through her \n     church, College Street Congressional. She greets clients who \n     come to the Urban Ministries Program for counseling, helps \n     them fill out forms and visits with them until they can see a \n     counselor.\n       A retired teacher, Kriesel spent 22 of her 27 years in \n     education at Colchester Middle School, and now works part-\n     time for the University of Vermont Department of Education as \n     a supervisor of student teachers. She lives in Burlington \n     with her husband, Peter, and the couple has two adult sons \n     and one granddaughter. She enjoys walking, gardening, \n     cooking, reading and writing.\n       ``I loved my 27 years of full-time public school \n     teaching,'' Kriesel says. ``It's fun for me now to branch \n     out, try some new things and work with people at the opposite \n     end of the age spectrum. I find that they have such rich \n     lives and wonderful stories to tell.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11246-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11246-S11247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE JOHN EDWARD PORTER\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \npay tribute to Congressman John Edward Porter who, after two decades of \nservice in the House of Representatives, will retire at the end of this \nsession.\n  Since 1994, when John Porter became Chairman of the House \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation, and I took over as Chairman of the Senate Labor, HHS and \nEducation Subcommittee, we have spent untold hours working together on \nwhat is arguably one of the most important pieces of legislation to be \nvoted on by Congress each year.\n  During his tenure, John Porter has earned a reputation as a champion \nof education, family planning, and disease prevention and control \nprograms. But he is perhaps most recognized as a passionate and \ntireless advocate for the National Institutes of Health. Anyone who has \nspent time with him undoubtedly knows that he considers medical \nresearch to be one of our Nation's highest priorities. He makes no \nsecret of his commitment, calling medical research ``our greatest hope \nfor effectively treating, curing and eventually preventing disease and \nthereby saving our country billions of dollars in annual health care \ncosts.''\n  I share John's passion for the NIH. I have said many times that it is \nthe crown jewel of the Federal government. Over the past six years, he \nand I, working alongside my distinguished colleague Tom Harkin, have \nincreased funding for biomedical research by $9.4 billion. In 1998, we \nmade a commitment to double federal funding for the NIH over five \nyears. And with this year's increase of $2.7 billion, we are on track \nto reach that goal by 2003. Even though John will no longer be in the \nCongress, I know that he will continue to help us fulfill that promise.\n  John's commitment to medical research has earned him high praise from \nnumerous scientific, medical and research organizations. Among the many \nhonors bestowed on him, the American Medical Association recently \nhonored him with the Nathan Davis Award as ``Outstanding U.S. \nRepresentative.'' The American Federation of Clinical Research honored \nhim with its ``Distinguished Friend of Medical Research,'' Public \nService Award.\n  John's interests reach beyond medical research. He is the co-founder \nof the Congressional Coalition on Population and Development, an \norganization that advocates and defends international and domestic \nvoluntary family planning programs. He is also a dedicated supporter of \nthe arts and humanities, and since 1999 has served on the Board of \nDirectors of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\n  John has an impressive education background: He attended the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology and received his undergraduate \ndegree from Northwestern University. Following service in the U.S. \nArmy, he received his law degree from the University of Michigan. He \nserved three terms in the Illinois House of Representatives before \nbeing elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. In addition to his \npublic service, John was an attorney private practice in Evanston, \nIllinois.\n  Today, I want to pay a special tribute to John by recommending that \nthe neuroscience building on the campus of the National Institutes of \nHealth be named the John Edward Porter National Neuroscience Center. \nThis building will be a fitting tribute to a man who has devoted so \nmuch towards finding ways to prevent disease and improve the quality of \nlife of all Americans.\n  To John Porter, I say, you have carried out your responsibilities \nwith skill\n\n[[Page S11247]]\n\nborn of rich experience and insight born of deep compassion. I want to \noffer to you my gratitude for the character, courage and dedication \nwith which you have served the people of the tenth district of Illinois \nand the country. I wish you the best as you begin the next chapter of \nyour life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11247-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11247-S11248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      JUBILEE RED MASS HOMILY OF THE MOST REVEREND PAUL S. LOVERDE\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on Sunday, October 1st, the Most \nReverend Paul S. Loverde, Bishop of Arlington, delivered the Red Mass \nHomily at the Cathedral of St. Matthew here in Washington. It was the \n48th annual Red Mass at St. Matthew's, all of which have been sponsored \nby the John Carroll Society.\n  The Red Mass--a Solemn Mass of the Holy Spirt--originated hundreds of \nyears ago to mark the beginning of judicial year of the Sacred Roman \nRota, which is the supreme ecclesiastical and secular court of the Holy \nSee. The name of the Mass is drawn from the red vestments traditionally \nworn by the celebrants, and also by the scarlet robes of the royal \njudges who attended. The color red represents tongues of fire, \nsymbolizing the presence of the Holy Spirit.\n  The tradition of the Red Mass spread from Rome to Paris--where it is \nnow the only Mass held at La Sainte Chapelle, London--celebrated \nannually at Westminster Cathedral since the Middle Ages, and beyond. \nThe tradition was inaugurated in the United States in 1928 at Old Saint \nAndrew's Church in New York City. Here in Washington, the Red Mass is \nheld on the Sunday before the first Monday in October to coincide with \nthe new term of the United States Supreme Court. Justices of the Court, \nother judges, law professors, lawyers, diplomats, government officials, \nand people of all faith attend the Mass to invoke God's blessing and \nguidance in the administration of justice.\n  As Bishop Loverde pointed out in his homily, this year's Mass is \nspecial since it occurs in a Jubilee Year and at the dawn of the third \nChristian Millennium.\n  The Jubilee tradition stems from the Book of Leviticus, in which God \ninstructs Moses to ``hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty \nthroughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a \njubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, \nand ye shall return every man unto his family.'' (25:10) God further \nadmonishes Moses, ``Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but \nthou shalt fear thy God: for I am the Lord your God.'' (25:17)\n  Fifty years ago, we were engaged in a twilight struggle with \nCommunist totalitarianism. Today, the Soviet Union exists no longer, \nand we are at peace and prosperous--due in large part, no doubt, \nbecause we are a nation of laws. We think of our nation as young, but \nwe are old: there are two nations on earth, the United States and Great \nBritain, that both existed in 1800 and have not had their form of \ngovernment changed by forces since then. There are eight--I repeat, \neight--nations which both existed in 1914 and have not had their form \nof government changed by violence since then. Do we recognize how \nextraordinarily blessed we re? We abide by the rule of law, and so \npersist and prosper.\n  Bishop Loverde lovingly reminds us that in this ``Year of Favor,'' \nthe work of justice is peace--opus iustitiae pax. He quotes from Joseph \nAllegretti, who wrote, ``those who enter law with the intent to bring \njustice to a broken world, to vindicate the rights of the weak and \nvulnerable, to heal broken relationships, to ensure equality to all \npersons . . . these persons have responded to a true calling.'' \nAllegretti remarked that law ``is a vehicle of service to God and to \nneighbor, not simply a gateway to financial and social success.'' I \nmight add that law is not only ``a vehicle of service to God.'' It is a \ngift from God which we must cherish.\n  It is fitting that the John Carroll Society sponsors the Red Mass \neach year. John Carroll helped the colonies win their independence. \nAfter the Revolution, he was appointed superior of all U.S. Catholics. \nIn 1789, he founded Georgetown University. he and his brother, Daniel, \nwho was a member of the Constitutional Convention, insisted that the \nnew Constitution prohibit any religious test for public office, and \nwere influential forces for the freedom of religion clause contained in \nthe First Amendment. In 1790, Carroll was consecrated the first \nCatholic bishop in the United States, and served from his cathedral in \nBaltimore. Ten years later, four additional dioceses were created and \nCarroll became Archibishop. He established St. Mary's College and \nSeminary, and he encouraged Elizabeth Ann Seton to found the order of \nThe Sisters of Charity.\n  Mr. President, it is customary each year to have the Red Mass Homily \nplaced in the Congressional Record. I commend Bishop Loverde's homily \nand his moving call to all who are servants of justice and peace to be \nadvocates for a ``new humanism'' that affirms the fundamental dignity, \nworth, and inalienable rights of each of us. I feel privileged to ask \nthat the Bishop's homily for this year's Red Mass be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The material follows:\n\n                        Jubilee Red Mass Homily\n\n\n   The most reverend Paul S. Loverde--Bishop of Arlington, Virginia, \n               cathedral of st. matthew, washington, DC.\n\n       Your Eminence, Distinguished Guests, Sisters and Brothers \n     all in the Lord:\n       This 48th annual celebration of the Red Mass here at St. \n     Matthews Cathedral is truly unique this year. It is the \n     Jubilee Red Mass celebrated at the dawn of the Third \n     Christian Millennium. This Jubilee tradition began in the Old \n     Testament and continues in the history of the Church. Every \n     Jubilee year is understood to be a Year of the Lord's favor \n     to His people.\n       The words of today's first reading from the Book of the \n     Prophet Isaiah powerfully proclaim the core meaning of the \n     Jubilee Year and the responsibility entrusted to each of us \n     every day, but with greater emphasis now during this special \n     Year. ``The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because the Lord \n     has anointed me; He has sent me to bring glad tidings to the \n     lowly, to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the \n     captives and release to prisoners, to announce a year of \n     favor from the Lord and a day of vindication by our God . . \n     .'' (Is. 61:1-2). These words of Isaiah remind us, in this \n     ``Year of Favor,'' of the spirit of humanism that must guide \n     our every action.\n       Moreover, this is a year of ``increased sensitivity to all \n     that the Spirit is saying to the Church and to the Churches, \n     as well as to individuals through the charisms meant to serve \n     the whole community'' (Tertio Millenio Adveniente, 23). Are \n     we not gathered in prayer during this Votive Mass of the Holy \n     Spirit to give tangible expression to our desire to be more \n     sensitive to what the Holy Spirit is saying? Is not our \n     participation in this Red Mass a concrete expression of our \n     desire to be docile and open to the action of the Holy Spirit \n     in our minds and hearts this year in a renewed way? Are we \n     not seeking in prayer--a prayer that is sincere and humble \n     and hope-filled--to hear ``what the Spirit is suggesting to \n     the different communities, from the smallest ones, such as \n     the family, to the largest ones, such as nations and \n     international organizations, taking into account cultures, \n     societies, and sound traditions'' (Tertio Millennio \n     Adveniente, No. 23)?\n       Addressing the Italian National Association of Magistrates \n     this past March, Pope John Paul II pointed out that the \n     Jubilee challenges the people of our time to fulfill \n     responsibly the tasks entrusted to them. His words also speak \n     eloquently to you: ``By your freely accepted vocation, you \n     have put yourselves at the service of justice and so also at \n     the service of peace. The ancient Romans liked to say: `opus \n     iustitiae pax' (The work of justice is peace). There can be \n     no peace among human beings without justice. This opus \n     iustitiae, on which peace is based, is carried out within a \n     precise ethical-juridical) framework and is an ongoing \n     worksite. Indeed, wherever fundamental human rights, the \n     inalienable rights that no legislation can violate, are \n     codified in laws, it is always possible to give them a more \n     complete juridical formulation and, above all, a more \n     effective application in the concrete context social life'' \n     (Pope John Paul II, Address to the National Association of \n     Magistrates, 3/31/00). This does not happen easily. To this \n     end, the Pope states further: ``A legal culture, a State \n     governed by law, a democracy worthy of the name, are \n     therefore characterized not only by the effective structuring \n     of their legal systems, but especially by their relationship \n     to the demands of the common good and of the universal moral \n     principles inscribed by God in the human heart'' (Pope John \n     Paul II, Address to the National Association of Magistrates, \n     3/31/00).\n       What then is the Spirit of truth saying to us specifically \n     at this Jubilee Red Mass? What is the Spirit of truth saying \n     to those of you who serve the cause of justice and peace as \n     judges, lawyers, members of the Legislative and Executive \n     branches of government, diplomats, professors and students of \n     the law? The Jubilee Year challenges you to give fundamental \n     rights, ``a more complete juridical formulation and above \n     all, a more effective application in the concrete context of \n     social life'' (Pope John Paul II, Address to\n\n[[Page S11248]]\n\n     the National Association of Magistrates, 3/31/00). This takes \n     on many forms, many formulations, but all are directed to the \n     same end--the protection of the human person and society. \n     Moreover, I speak of the perennial challenge in our day to \n     work for a ``new humanism.'' This ``new humanism'' finds its \n     basis in the dignity of the human person and his/her \n     inalienable rights. ``The dignity of the person is the \n     most precious possession of an individual. As a result, \n     the value of one person transcends all the material world \n     . . . The dignity of the person constitutes the foundation \n     of the equality of all people among themselves . . . The \n     dignity of the person is the indestructible property of \n     every human being. The force of this affirmation is based \n     on the uniqueness and irrepeatability of every person'' \n     (cf Cristifideles Laici, no. 37). You and I are repeatedly \n     called to be advocates for this ``new humanism.''\n       From the Christian viewpoint, the challenge is to \n     rediscover the central reality of Christ who ``fully reveals \n     man to himself and brings to light his most high calling'' \n     (Gaudium et Spes, 22). Quite specifically, ``Christian \n     humanism implies first of all an openness to the \n     Transcendent. It is here that we find the truth and the \n     grandeur of the human person, the only creature in the \n     visible world capable of self-awareness and recognizing that \n     he is surrounded by that supreme Mystery which both reason \n     and faith call God'' (Pope John Paul II, Address to \n     University Professors, no. 4, 9/9/00). Pope John Paul II \n     applies this insight further saying: ``The humanism which we \n     desire advocates a vision of society centered on the human \n     person and his inalienable rights, on the values of justice \n     and peace, on a correct relationship between individuals, \n     society and the State, on the logic of solidarity and \n     subsidiarity. It is a humanism capable of giving a soul to \n     economic progress itself, so that it may be directed to `the \n     promotion of each individual and of the whole person' '' \n     (Pope John Paul II, Address to University Professors, no. 6, \n     9/9/00).\n       In being advocates for this ``new humanism'' within the \n     complexity of our culture and society, a powerful Advocate is \n     being sent to stand by you. That Advocate is the Holy Spirit. \n     It is the particular role of God the Holy Spirit to reveal \n     God's Word and Will, and to help us in understanding and \n     responding to His divine plan for us. Indeed, Jesus makes \n     this very promise in today's gospel. ``If you love me and \n     obey the commands I give you, I will ask the Father and He \n     will give you another Advocate--to be with you always; the \n     Spirit of truth . . . You can recognize Him because he \n     remains with you and will be within you'' (Jn. 14:15-17).\n       Catholic theology, reflecting on scripture, enumerates \n     seven particular gifts of the Holy Spirit: Knowledge, \n     Counsel, Understanding, Wisdom, Piety, Fortitude, and Fear of \n     the Lord. These gifts of the Spirit are permanent \n     dispositions which make us docile and open to the promptings \n     of the Holy Spirit. These are gifts for which we pray in a \n     special way during this Mass of the Holy Spirit, this Jubilee \n     Red Mass.\n       Knowledge is the gift which helps us to know God and what \n     He expects of us through His self revelation in creation and \n     in the person of Jesus Christ.\n       Counsel is the gift from the Holy Spirit in which one \n     receives the very counsel of God--divine advice. It is \n     insight from the Holy Spirit which leads to a correct \n     assimilation of the knowledge we have discovered.\n       Understanding assists us in perceiving the hidden meanings \n     of reality. As St. Thomas Aquinas observes: ``There are many \n     kinds of things that are hidden within, which human knowledge \n     has to penetrate, so to speak. Under the appearances of a \n     thing lies hidden its essence, under words lies hidden their \n     meaning, and under effects lie hidden their causes--and vice \n     versa.'' (cf. Summa Theologica II/II, Q.8, art. 1).\n       Wisdom enables one to know the purposes and plan of God. It \n     gives us the ability to see life and its meaning, as well as \n     persons, events and things, from the divine point of view, \n     and to recognize the inner value of persons, events and \n     things.\n       Piety leads one to a devotion to God. ``As a gift of the \n     Holy Spirit, piety moves us to worship God Who is the Father \n     of all, and also to do good to others out of reverence for \n     God'' (Our Sunday Visitor Catholic Encyclopedia, p. 784).\n       Fortitude provides the internal strength and courage to be \n     firm in difficulty and constant in doing good.\n       Lastly, there is the gift of the Fear of the Lord. This is \n     not a servile fear, but a filial fear, the desire not to \n     offend because of love, not fear. This gift ensures our awe \n     and reverence before God and helps us to acknowledge our \n     radical dependence upon Him.\n       As we advocate the ``new humanism,'' which centers on the \n     human person and protects and ensures his or her inalienable \n     rights within the context of justice and peace, these seven \n     inter-connected gifts provide much encouragement, insight and \n     support. They are given to help you, to help you in your \n     essential and truly important work for our world, this \n     country and our city. They are gifts of God to each of us, \n     gifts for which we constantly pray.\n       A renewed understanding of your vocation as advocates for \n     justice emerges and is reflected so simply, yet so \n     powerfully, in the words of one distinguished professor: \n     ``Those who enter law with the intent to bring justice to a \n     broken world, to vindicate the rights of the weak and \n     vulnerable, to heal broken relationships, to ensure equality \n     to all persons * * * these persons have responded to a true \n     calling. Law for them is a vehicle of service to God and to \n     neighbor, not simply a gateway to financial and social \n     success'' (Joseph Allegretti: The Lawyer's Calling: Christian \n     Faith and Legal Practice, p. 31).\n       I applaud those among you who share your legal talents with \n     those in need, especially those who participate in the \n     Archdiocesan Pro Bono Legal Network. For you, the practice of \n     law truly becomes ``a service to God and to your neighbor.'' \n     Yet the need for pro bono assistance keeps increasing and \n     demands an even greater and more generous response in our \n     day.\n       Those among us involved with the forging ahead of a ``new \n     humanism'' must respond genuinely and faithfully. Ours is a \n     Nation founded upon the ideal of the ``inalienable rights of \n     every person.'' Our Nation leads the world in technological \n     advancement, economic growth and military strength. Yet, \n     there still exists a sad inequality among us in our society. \n     I mention the following three examples in response to the \n     challenge of the ``new humanism.'' First, 40 million \n     Americans live without health care benefits, of whom 10 \n     million are American children (U.S. News, Matthew Miller 8/\n     18/97). Secondly, a large number of senior citizens find it \n     difficult to afford much needed prescription drugs. Thirdly, \n     the choice for quality education is not always available for \n     many in our Nation. Each cries out for our collective \n     response.\n       In addition, we live in a culture where distrust and lying \n     are only too evident. We must learn to speak the truth in \n     love, to proclaim the sanctity of all human life, both of the \n     innocent and of the guilty, from conception through every \n     stage until natural death. the splendor of the truth must \n     shine through the ``new humanism'' you advocate.\n       So much of your time is spent with time-sheets, agenda \n     books, email, faxes and meetings. Your inner spirits surely \n     thirst for something more; indeed, for time to be with the \n     Transcendent One--the Holy One--the source of these seven \n     gifts, especially wisdom and fortitude. In those treasured \n     moments, your minds will be enlightened and your inner \n     spirits renewed, so that your advocacy for justice and peace \n     will be all the more authentic and real.\n       Yes, the Jubilee challenges you who are servants of justice \n     and peace to be advocates for a ``new humanism,'' which will \n     permeate your legal decisions, your legislative processes and \n     your diplomatic service. May the Holy Spirit--the Advocate--\n     be at your side, as together we move forward in joy and in \n     hope! Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11248-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11248-S11249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN RECOGNITION OF MS. YALILE RAMIREZ\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, at the Hispanic College Funds \nAnnual Scholarship Awards Banquet earlier this month, Ms. Yalile \nRamirez, recipient of the Hispanic College Fund Award for 2000-2001, \ngave a speech regarding the upliftment of the Hispanic-American \ncommunity which I found to be extremely insightful. I rise today not \nonly to insert her remarks into the Congressional Record, but also to \nsalute an extraordinary young woman with a bright future ahead of her.\n  Ms. Ramirez was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. She is \ncurrently a senior at Michigan State University, where she is pursuing \na double Bachelor's degree in International Relations and Finance. In \nMay of this year, she graduated from the University's James Madison \nCollege of International Relations, so she is now focusing her efforts \non her financial studies.\n  In addition to receiving the Hispanic College Fund Award, Ms. Ramirez \nhas received the Bill Gates Millennium Scholar Award. She made the \nDean's List in 1998, 1999 and 2000, and in 1997 was presented with the \nNational Dean's List Award.\n  Ms. Ramirez is a member of the Women in Business Student Association, \nthe Phi Beta Delta National Honor Society, the American Advertising \nFederation: Research Team Leader, and the Phi Sigma Pi Co-Ed National \nHonors Fraternity. She is also a Mentor Program Coordinator, and spends \nher remaining free time with aerobics, running and volunteering.\n  I applaud Ms. Ramirez on her many achievements both on and off the \ncampus of Michigan State University. She is not only a dedicated \nstudent but also a dedicated member of society, concerned with a great \ndeal more than her own success. As is clearly illustrated in her \nremarks, she cares deeply about the upliftment of America's Latino \npopulation, and believes that this upliftment can best occur through \neconomic empowerment--attaining positions of leadership within the \nbusiness community. In the not too distant future, I look forward to \nseeing Ms. Yalile Ramirez become one of these\n\n[[Page S11249]]\n\nleaders. With that having been said, I ask to print her remarks of \nOctober 5, 2000, in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n   Remarks by Ms. Yalile Remirez at the Hispanic College Fund, Inc., \n                   Annual Scholarship Awards Banquet\n\n\n                            OCTOBER 5, 2000\n\n       Good evening ladies and gentlemen, my name is Yalile \n     Ramirez. I am a senior, pursuing a double Bachelor's degree \n     in International Relations and Finance at Michigan State \n     University. First, I would like to thank Sprint for making my \n     scholarship possible. I would also like to thank the Hispanic \n     College Fund for granting me the honor of speaking to you on \n     this special night. When I started to think about what I \n     could share with you this evening, I asked myself ``What am I \n     an authority on?'' So, I decided to talk about the one thing \n     I have mastered, being me.\n       In some aspects, my involvement in the Latino community has \n     differed from what some of my fellow peers and faculty \n     members believe it should be. When I first attended MSU, I \n     was not fully aware of all the issues confronting the Latino \n     community in the U.S. And I did not have any Latino role \n     models to whom I could turn to for guidance, with the \n     exception of my parents. However, I was aware of the \n     inequities embedded within our society. I knew we were a \n     different color, I knew we spoke a different language and I \n     knew many in America did not welcome this diversity. At the \n     college level, my experiences with fellow Latino students and \n     faculty members has heightened my interest and sensitivity to \n     Latino issues. I strongly support our community and \n     participate in a select number of activities. However, the \n     career path I have chosen also differs from those that many \n     have elected to pursue; such as education, criminal justice, \n     political science and pre-law.\n       While many of them are demanding justice through political \n     rights and representation, I seek economic empowerment. \n     Economic empowerment is derived from our continual plight for \n     justice, political power and independence. We can look back \n     to our history dating back to the American Revolution. Was it \n     all for greater religious freedom or greater economic \n     freedom?\n       My family has struggled economically and socially in \n     pursuit of the American dream for our family and for \n     generations yet to come. As first generation American Latina, \n     I recognize the importance of economic empowerment in our \n     community. While possessing a flagrant entrepreneurial spirit \n     and great patriotism to the American form of capitalism; \n     resources, capital, and networks are salient to real \n     empowerment. But, where do we go to obtain these resources? \n     To whom do we turn to with confidence, respect and trust? \n     Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are among those resources \n     right here, right now. With a vigorous economy and a fast \n     growing Latino population, our Latino community is coming of \n     age. How will we succeed? Latino business leadership is \n     paramount to attaining prosperity in our communities and in \n     sustaining future success. By seizing this opportunity and \n     creating a network of Latino businesses and business leaders, \n     we can actualize a network of resources and capital for \n     future entrepreneurs. Latino business leadership has a \n     profound impact in our Latino community by creating \n     opportunities to produce and access resources. For me, then, \n     real economic empowerment and leadership will assist in our \n     overall pursuit of our economic well-being and prosperity. We \n     have to expand the opportunities to enter the business \n     sector. Once we enter and thrive in that arena, it is \n     imperative to sustain and share our economic power with a new \n     generation of leaders. Economic empowerment. To put it \n     another way, I choose a quote from the Chairman of the \n     Hispanic College Fund, Mr. Dario Marquez.\n       ``What we want is a seat at the table of dialogue and \n     debate in government, academia, and in industry--not a seat \n     that has been assigned--but as many seats as our abilities \n     and talents will afford.''\n       Finally, I have been honored to have been selected as a \n     scholarship recipient of the HCF. I would like to also \n     congratulate the other recipients gathered on this stage \n     tonight and all the others enrolled in colleges and \n     universities across the country. On our behalf and on behalf \n     of our families and communities, we thank all the companies, \n     businesses, individuals, and events that donated the funds \n     that helped us afford a college education. And, I am \n     especially grateful to Sprint for making my scholarship \n     possible. This scholarship is not only monetary assistance \n     but also an investment in a woman with great potential for \n     realizing future success. I have struggled with economic and \n     social issues and I firmly believe that education is the key \n     that will unlock our full potential as Latinos and ultimately \n     contribute to the economic prosperity of America. Let us \n     continue to pursue a better future for our and future \n     generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11249-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN RECOGNITION OF DAVID M. LANEY\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. \nDavid M. Laney, who soon will complete his term as a member of the \nTexas Transportation Commission. Governor George W. Bush appointed Mr. \nLaney to the commission in April 1995, designating him chairman and \nCommissioner of Transportation. In April 2000, he stepped down as \nCommissioner of Transportation, serving the remainder of his term as a \nmember of the commission.\n  During his term on the commission, Mr. Laney has been the champion of \nthe state's efforts to increase the state's share of federal \ntransportation dollars returning to Texas. As chairman, he was a \npartner to the Texas Congressional delegation's efforts to develop \nfairer highway funding formulas, promoting the efforts of a coalition \nof ``donor'' states to work with Congress toward achieving at least a \n90.5 percent return on payments into the Highway Trust Fund. As a \nresult of our efforts, Texas received an increase of more than $700 \nmillion annually in federal highway funds and David Laney deserves a \ngreat deal of the credit.\n  In addition, he promoted increased federal funding for the nation's \ngeneral aviation and reliever airports, which Congress provided in the \nAviation Investment Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR 21). Finally, \nMr. Laney has been a strong advocate for the state's small urban and \nrural transit systems, working with Congress to provide much needed \ndiscretionary funding to address the vehicle replacement needs of these \nvital transportation systems, the most extensive in the nation. With \nthese additional funds for Texas transportation programs, the \ncommission will be better able to meet the tremendous transportation \ndemands of the growing regional and international trade traffic in \nTexas.\n  With a look to the future, as Commissioner of Transportation Mr. \nLaney led the Texas Department of Transportation in its efforts to \nobtain the flexible financing tools it needs to help address \ntransportation needs in Texas. He was successful in working with the \nTexas Legislature to create the Texas Turnpike Authority Division of \nthe department, which provides toll-funding options for the state's \nmajor transportation projects. With his strong support and \nencouragement, the division has applied for and expects to receive an \n$800 million loan under the federal Transportation Infrastructure \nFinance and Innovation Act for a major Central Texas turnpike project. \nUnder Mr. Laney's leadership, the commission has used the Texas State \nInfrastructure Bank, authorized under the National Highway System \nDesignation Act of 1995, to provide needed assistance to localities to \nhelp move forward important transportation projects.\n  Mr. Laney also initiated a major Texas border strategy to address the \ndemands of international trade traffic.\n  Throughout his tenure on the commission, Mr. Laney has provided \nstrong and confident leadership to the Texas Department of \nTransportation, promoting the development of a first-class Texas \ntransportation system. His legacy is a transportation agency with a \nmenu of solid financial and operational tools providing a safe, \neffective, and environmentally-sensitive transportation system for the \npeople of Texas and the nation. His dedication to transportation and \nhis strong leadership on the commission will be missed.\n  Mr. President, I know my fellow Texans join me in this expression of \nappreciation to David Laney for his exemplary leadership on the Texas \nTransportation Commission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11249-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11249-S11250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RETIREMENT OF THE HONORABLE CLAYTON E. PREISEL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nHonorable Clayton E. Preisel, who is retiring on December 31, 2000, \nafter an extraordinary career spanning over 50 years. During this time, \nhe has served in the Marine Corps, been a teacher and school \nadministrator, and, for the past 18 years, presided over the Lapeer \nCounty Probate Court. Whatever the forum, Judge Preisel has been a \nleader and an inspiration to those around him.\n  Judge Preisel was born on January 29, 1927. He graduated from Imlay \nCity High School in 1945, and departed for\n\n[[Page S11250]]\n\nthe Marines in July of that same year. He served until August of 1946, \nand then returned to the State of Michigan to attend Michigan State \nUniversity. He graduated from MSU in 1951 with a degree in Agriculture.\n  After graduation, Judge Preisel moved to Carson City, Michigan, and \nbegan teaching. After four years, he returned home to Imlay City, where \nhe continued his teaching career. He taught in Imlay City until 1969, \nand spent the final two years of his tenure there as both a teacher and \na school administrator. During this time, Judge Preisel also doubled as \na student, obtaining a Master's of Science degree in 1956, and, in \n1968, receiving a Jurist Doctorate degree from the Detroit College of \nLaw.\n  Upon receiving his law degree, Judge Preisel entered into private \npractice, where he stayed until 1982, when he was elected to serve as \nLapeer County Probate Judge. He has held this position for the past 18 \nyears, and during his time on the bench has become respected not only \nfor his knowledge of the law but also for his sensical approach to its \napplication. Individuals leave Judge Preisel's courtroom with the \nknowledge that they have been treated fairly, which in my mind is the \nmost worthy thing that can be said of a Judge.\n  Judge Preisel has always found time to partake in community service. \nHe was a member of the Imlay School Board from 1969-1983. He has also \nbeen involved in 4-H, the Lions Club, the Community Foundation, United \nWay, Kids In New Directions (KIND), Big Brothers-Big Sisters, and the \nLapeer County Bar Association.\n  Judge Preisel's retirement will allow him to spend more time with his \nfamily. He and his wife, Beulah Joann Anderson, who celebrated their \n50th Anniversary on September 9th, 2000, have four children (Kathleen, \nJanet, Karen and James), and five grandchildren (Heather, Jason, \nAlysha, Katelyn and Steven).\n  I applaud Judge Preisel for his extraordinary service to Lapeer \nCounty and the State of Michigan. His leadership in all phases of his \ncareer has been exceptional and will be dearly missed. On behalf of the \nentire United States Senate, I congratulate and thank the Honorable \nClayton E. Preisel on a wonderful and successful career, and wish him \nthe best of luck in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11250-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:17 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 11.

A bill to establish a national center on volunteer and \nprovider screening to reduce sexual and other abuse of children, the \nelderly, and individuals with disabilities, to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n               NATIONAL CHILD PROTECTION IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as everyone in this room knows all too \nwell, I have devoted much of my career to fighting crime. And if there \nis one thing that I have learned over the course of the past 30 years \nin public service, it's this: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound \nof cure. I have\n\n[[Page S11253]]\n\nwatched as the Boys and Girls Clubs and other non-profits have worked \nto make certain that kids have a safe place to go after school. I have \nbeen supportive of countless crime prevention initiatives to protect \nour children, our parents and those unable to protect themselves. And \nguess what, these programs have worked to prevent crime. But even those \nprograms whose single purpose is to do good, have seen some bad times. \nAnd that is why today, I am introducing the National Child Protection \nAct.\n  Today, more than 87 million kids are involved each year in activities \nprovided by child and youth organizations which depend heavily on \nvolunteers to deliver their services. Millions more adults are also \nserved by public and private voluntary organizations. Places like the \nBoys and Girls Clubs rely on volunteers to make these safe havens for \nkids a place where they can learn. But, while these non-profit \norganizations are doing God's work, there are some volunteers who have \na different agenda--and there are abuses that occur.\n  The National Mentoring Partnership reports that incidents of child \nsexual abuse in child care settings, foster homes and schools ranges \nfrom 1 to 7 percent. This is basic stuff--these organizations can not \nfunction effectively without a safe infrastructure in place.\n  Currently most child-service organizations do background checks on \nvolunteers, but they may have to wait weeks or months for the result of \na state or national criminal background check. Conducting these checks \nis also costly and therefore many organizations conduct only a limited \ncheck of their volunteers. And some organizations don't have access to \nnational fingerprint databases which means that while a volunteer may \npass a name-check in one state, he may have been convicted of \natrocities in another. Our children, our parents and the disadvantaged \nare at risk and they need help.\n  That is why my bill authorizes $180 million over five years for the \nFBI to establish a national center to conduct national criminal history \nfingerprint checks. Their checks will be provided to volunteer \norganizations at no cost and to all other organizations that serve \nchildren at minimal cost. This national center would screen 10 million \nvolunteers each year and will make these volunteer-oriented \norganizations a safer place for all. My bill also authorizes $5 million \nto provide states with funds to hire personnel and improve fingerprint \ntechnology so that they can update information in national databases.\n  This should be an easy one for all of us. Most of us already \nunderstand the positive impact that these non-profits are having. Now, \nwe have a duty to make these places safe for those most at-risk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nplaced in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3252\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Child Protection \n     Improvement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL CENTER ON VOLUNTEER AND \n                   PROVIDER SCREENING.\n\n       The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 \n     (42 U.S.C. 5601 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n    ``TITLE VI--NATIONAL CENTER ON VOLUNTEER AND PROVIDER SCREENING\n\n     ``SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       ``This title may be cited as the `National Child Protection \n     Improvement Act'.\n\n     ``SEC. 602. FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress finds the following:\n       ``(1) More than 87,000,000 children are involved each year \n     in activities provided by child and youth organizations which \n     depend heavily on volunteers to deliver their services.\n       ``(2) Millions more adults, both the elderly and \n     individuals with disabilities, are served by public and \n     private voluntary organizations.\n       ``(3) The vast majority of activities provided to children, \n     the elderly, and individuals with disabilities by public and \n     private nonprofit agencies and organizations result in the \n     delivery of much needed services in safe environments that \n     could not be provided without the assistance of virtually \n     millions of volunteers, but abuses do occur.\n       ``(4) Estimates of the incidence of child sexual abuse in \n     child care settings, foster care homes, and schools, range \n     from 1 to 7 percent.\n       ``(5) Abuse traumatizes the victims and shakes public trust \n     in care providers and organizations serving vulnerable \n     populations.\n       ``(6) Congress has acted to address concerns about this \n     type of abuse through the National Child Protection Act of \n     1993 and the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994 to set forth a \n     framework for screening through criminal record checks of \n     care providers, including volunteers who work with children, \n     the elderly, and individuals with disabilities. \n     Unfortunately, problems regarding the safety of these \n     vulnerable groups still remain.\n       ``(7) While State screening is sometimes adequate to \n     conduct volunteer background checks, more extensive national \n     criminal history checks using fingerprints or other means of \n     positive identification are often advisable, as a prospective \n     volunteer or nonvolunteer provider may have lived in more \n     than one State.\n       ``(8) The high cost of fingerprint background checks is \n     unaffordable for organizations that use a large number of \n     volunteers and, if passed on to volunteers, often discourages \n     their participation.\n       ``(9) The current system of retrieving national criminal \n     background information on volunteers through an authorized \n     agency of the State is cumbersome and often requires months \n     before vital results are returned.\n       ``(10) In order to protect children, volunteer agencies \n     must currently depend on a convoluted, disconnected, and \n     sometimes duplicative series of checks that leave children at \n     risk.\n       ``(11) A national volunteer and provider screening center \n     is needed to protect vulnerable groups by providing \n     effective, efficient national criminal history background \n     checks of volunteer providers at no-cost, and at minimal-cost \n     for employed care providers.\n\n     ``SEC. 603.

A bill to provide assistance to East Timor to facilitate the \ntransition of East Timor to an independent nation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n           EAST TIMOR TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, along with Senators Chafee, Leahy, \nHarkin, Feingold, Reed and Jeffords, I am introducing legislation to \nhelp facilitate East Timor's transition to independence. Congressman \nGejdenson has introduced similar legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In August 1999, after almost three decades of unrest under Indonesian \nrule, the people of East Timor voted overwhelmingly in favor of \nindependence.\n  They did so at great personal risk. Anti-independence militia groups \nkilled hundreds, hoping to intimidate and retaliate against those \nsupporting independence. The militias also destroyed or severely \ndamaged seventy percent of East Timor's infrastructure. Government \nservices and public security were severely undermined.\n  An international effort, led by Australia and including the United \nStates, brought much-needed stability to East Timor.\n  Now, under the United Nation's Transitional Authority, stability is \ntaking hold again in East Timor, and normal life is slowly returning.\n  In coming months, looking to America and other democratic nations as \nan example, East Timor's leaders will hold a constitutional convention \nto decide which form of democratic government to adopt. It is a process \nthat reminds us of our own Constitutional Convention and would make our \nFounding Fathers proud.\n  Late next year, after choosing a form of democratic government and \nelecting leaders, East Timor is expected to declare its independence as \nthe UN draws\n\n[[Page S11255]]\n\ndown. A new, democratic nation will take its rightful place in the \nworld.\n  This is a success story. It is a great success story. But it is far \nfrom over.\n  East Timor remains one of the poorest places in Asia. Only 20 percent \nof its population is literate. The annual per capita gross national \nproduct is $340.\n  The people of East Timor need and deserve our help. The extraordinary \nphysical and moral courage they demonstrated over the years is \nimpressive. The great faith in the democratic process they showed by \nvoting for independence under the barrel of a gun must not go \nunrewarded.\n  This bill is our chance to help them, and help now. Its purpose is to \nput U.S. governmental programs and resources in place now and to enable \nU.S. government agencies to focus on the imminent reality of an \nindependent East Timor. If we wait until East Timor declares its \nindependence before we do the preliminary work, we will lose crucial \ntime and do a disservice to both the United States and to East Timor.\n  Specifically, this bill lays the groundwork for establishing a firm \nbilateral and multilateral assistance structure.\n  It authorizes $25 million in bilateral assistance, $2 million for a \nPeace Corps presence and $1 million for a scholarship fund for East \nTimorese students to study in the United States.\n  It encourages the President, the Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation, the Trade and Development Agency and other agencies to put \nin place now the tools and programs to create an equitable trade and \ninvestment relationship.\n  It requires the State Department to establish an accredited mission \nto East Timor co-incident with independence.\n  And it authorizes the provision of excess defense articles and \ninternational military education and training, after the President \ncertifies that these articles and training are in the interests of the \nUnited States and will help promote human rights in East Timor and the \nprofessionalization of East Timor's armed services.\n  The people of East Timor have chosen democracy. The United States has \na golden opportunity to help them create their new democratic nation. \nBut we must prepare for that day now. We must not miss this rare \nopportunity to help.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord at the end of my remarks, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3254\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``East Timor Transition to \n     Independence Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On August 30, 1999, the East Timorese people voted \n     overwhelmingly in favor of independence from Indonesia. Anti-\n     independence militias, with the support of the Indonesian \n     military, attempted to prevent then retaliated against this \n     vote by launching a campaign of terror and violence, \n     displacing 500,000 people and murdering hundreds.\n       (2) The violent campaign devastated East Timor's \n     infrastructure, destroyed or severely damaged 60 to 80 \n     percent of public and private property, and resulted in the \n     collapse of virtually all vestiges of government, public \n     services and public security.\n       (3) The Australian-led International Force for East Timor \n     (INTERFET) entered East Timor in September 1999 and \n     successfully restored order. On October 25, 1999, the United \n     Nations Transitional Administration for East Timor (UNTAET) \n     began providing overall administration of East Timor, guide \n     the people of East Timor in the establishment of a new \n     democratic government, and maintain security and order.\n       (4) UNTAET and the East Timorese leadership currently \n     anticipate that East Timor will become an independent nation \n     as early as late 2001.\n       (5) East Timor is one of the poorest places in Asia. A \n     large percentage of the population live below the poverty \n     line, only 20 percent of East Timor's population is literate, \n     most of East Timor's people remain unemployed, the annual per \n     capita Gross National Product is $340, and life expectancy is \n     only 56 years.\n       (6) The World Bank and the United Nations have estimated \n     that it will require $300,000,000 in development assistance \n     over the next three years to meet East Timor's basic \n     development needs.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO SUPPORT FOR EAST TIMOR.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States should--\n       (1) facilitate East Timor's transition to independence, \n     support formation of broad-based democracy in East Timor, \n     help lay the groundwork for East Timor's economic recovery, \n     and strengthen East Timor's security;\n       (2) begin to lay the groundwork, prior to East Timor's \n     independence, for an equitable bilateral trade and investment \n     relationship;\n       (3)(A) officially open a diplomatic mission to East Timor \n     as soon as possible;\n       (B) recognize East Timor, and establish diplomatic \n     relations with East Timor, upon its independence; and\n       (C) ensure that a fully functioning, fully staffed, \n     adequately resourced, and securely maintained United States \n     diplomatic mission is accredited to East Timor upon its \n     independence;\n       (4) support efforts by the United Nations and East Timor to \n     ensure justice and accountability related to past atrocities \n     in East Timor through--\n       (A) United Nations investigations;\n       (B) development of East Timor's judicial system, including \n     appropriate technical assistance to East Timor from the \n     Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \n     and the Drug Enforcement Administration; and\n       (C) the possible establishment of an international tribunal \n     for East Timor; and\n       (5) support observer status for an official delegation from \n     East Timor to observe and participate, as appropriate, in all \n     deliberations of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation \n     (APEC) group.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a \nrehabilitation credit for certain expenditures to rehabilitate historic \nperforming arts facilities; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          historic performing arts facility rehabilitation act\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill that will \nbenefit the cultural cornerstones of many of our communities--our \nnation's historic performing arts facilities. From the non-profit \ncommunity theater housed in an historic opera house to the non-profit \nmetropolitan performing arts complex of historic significance, this \nnation's historic performing arts facilities play a lasting and \nimportant role\n\n[[Page S11257]]\n\nin the cultural fabric and cultural evolution of this nation.\n  There are over 200 non-profit performing arts organizations with \nhistoric facilities nationally, including the Traverse City Opera House \nin Traverse City, Michigan; the Paramount Theater in Anderson, Indiana; \nthe Polk Theater in Lakeland, Florida; the Strand Theater in \nShreveport, Louisiana; the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, \nRhode Island; and the Victoria Theater in Dayton, Ohio. As the cultural \ncornerstones of their communities and regions, these facilities also \nplay an important economic role as the anchors of economic development \nwithin their communities. These theaters attract tourism, stabilize \nneighborhoods, and generate increased economic activity of surrounding \nbusinesses.\n  Since the 1950s, this nation has also seen the emergence of nearly \nforty larger multi-purpose, multi-use performing arts complexes in \nurban areas as part of a larger urban renewal movement, such as the Los \nAngeles Music Center, the Wang Center for the Performing Arts in \nBoston, the Cincinnati Music Hall and Aronoff Center for the Arts in \nOhio, the Regional Performing Arts Center in Philadelphia, the Lincoln \nCenter for the Performing Arts in New York City, and the Kennedy Center \nfor the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. Each of these performing \narts organizations has revitalized and spurred development in its \ncommunity, and many of these larger facilities are centered around \nhistoric facilities or are historic places themselves.\n  This bill, the Historic Performing Arts Facility Rehabilitation Act, \nprovides parity between non-profit and for-profit historic performing \narts organizations that rehabilitate these national treasures. For many \nyears, for-profit entities, including for-profit theaters, that \nrehabilitate their nationally registered historic structures have \nqualified for a rehabilitation tax credit. This bill would simply \npermit non-profit performing arts organizations, with facilities \nsimilarly listed on the National Register of Historic Places, to \nbenefit from the same program.\n  The bill permits non-profit performing arts organizations to receive \nthe existing credit, equal to twenty percent of qualified \nrehabilitation expenditures, in the form of a credit certificate. The \ncertificate would be transferable to a lending institution that \nprovides all or part of the financing related to the qualified \nrehabilitation expenditure in exchange for a reduction in interest or \nprincipal.\n  This bill has the support of the performing arts community and the \nsupport of historic preservation organizations. I hope many of my \ncolleagues will support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Smith of Oregon):\n  S. 3260. A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to establish \nthe conservation security program; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                       conservation security act\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proud to reintroduce the Conservation \nSecurity Act today together with Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon. This \nimportant bipartisan legislation represents the first meaningful step \ntoward comprehensive conservation on all of America's working farms and \nranches. Although the reintroduction of this bill comes late in the \nsession, it represents the beginning of the new approach for \nconservation in the next farm bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate \ntoday to speak to the important issue of conservation in agriculture. I \nam pleased to join with my friend from Iowa, the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Harkin, on the \nintroduction of the Conservation Security Act. The introduction of this \nlegislation represents the culmination of a great deal of work on the \npart of Senator Harkin and his staff to explore new ways to address the \nneeds of American farmers in the area of conservation. With the debate \nover a new farm bill on the horizon for the next Congress, I think it \nis important that we begin this dialogue now to consider how federal \nprograms for farmers can be made more flexible and, frankly, more \nrelevant, to farmers throughout the country.\n  As some of my colleagues know, I come from rural Eastern Oregon. In \nmy part of the State, which is noted for its wheat farms, it is often \nsaid that every day is Earth Day for farmers. And every year, as more \nand more farmland is lost to development, people from both urban and \nrural America are starting to realize how much a friend to the \nenvironment our farmers are. Farmers have long recognized their direct \ndependence upon the land and the blessings of nature for their \nlivelihoods, and, as a result, are some of the best stewards of the \nland in this country. I think you will find, Mr. President, that when \nit come to environmental stewardship measures, farmers are almost \nalways willing to step up to the plate to do their part, provided that \nthey can still make a living. Too often, I believe they are simply told \nthrough regulation what they can or cannot do with their land. Not \nenough attention is paid to the real impact of such regulation on the \nfarmer's bottom line or on the relative competitiveness of U.S. \nAgriculture to foreign competition. What good does it do for the \nenvironment to drive farmers out of business only to trade farmland for \nstrip malls? We all know there is a place for common sense \nenvironmental regulation, but I don't believe we have done nearly \nenough on the incentive side of the coin.\n  The Conservation Security Act is a bold step toward filling the gap \nin our current federal farm conservation regime. Simply put, this \nlegislation offers compensation to farmers for voluntary conservation \nactivities performed on land that is in agricultural production. \nSeveral aspects of this approach are significant improvements over the \nconservation tools available to farmers today.\n  First, this legislation recognizes that there are a number of things \nthat are beneficial to the environment that farmers can do short of \nsimply idling their land. Adopting an integrated pest management plan \nthat reduces pesticide use, or using soil-conserving rotational crops \nare just two examples of environmentally sensitive measures farmers can \ntake while their land is still under production. Most of our spending \nfor conservation programs at the federal level is geared toward paying \nfarmers to set aside environmentally sensitive land altogether, such as \nunder the Conservation Reserve Program. While such programs serve an \nimportant need, they don't address the range of conservation activities \nthat farmers can, and often do, on their land in production. The \nConservation Security Act fills this need in conservation programming \nand offers farmers the flexibility of choosing from amongst three tiers \nof conservation measures.\n  A second significant feature of this legislation is its applicability \nto all farmers, not just program commodity producers. I come from a \nstate that produces everything from blueberries to potatoes to \nhazelnuts and nearly everything in between. These specialty crop \nproducers need to have conservation options too. I am pleased to note \nthe Conservation Security Act is open to all farmers in the nation. It \nis critical that the next farm bill more effectively addresses the \nneeds of specialty crop producers in this area.\n  Finally, I have to note the potential for this legislation to help \naddress the current farm crisis that is affecting so many of our family \nfarmers. Those of us from agricultural states know too well the \ndifficulties our farmers have faced in recent years, with the cost of \nproduction often exceeding the price paid for their commodities. While \nI believe a number of unusual circumstances have contributed to this \nproblem--such as the Asian economic crisis--I also recognize that we \nmust develop a more effective income support mechanism that the ad-hoc \nemergency farm spending packages we have relied upon in recent years. \nAn investment in conservation, such as outlined in the Conservation \nSecurity Act, could contribute to that end.\n  In summary, Mr. President, I believe the Conservation Security Act \nhas great potential to address crying needs of farmers all across the \nnation, while encouraging enhanced environmental stewardship. These are \ngoals I think we should all agree on when it comes to farm policy. Over \nthe upcoming recess, Senator Harkin and I will seek more input from the \nagriculture community\n\n[[Page S11258]]\n\nas well as other interested colleagues on this important legislation. \nThe Conservation Security Act offers a serious attempt to address the \nconservation needs of farmers as well as the troubling overall decline \nof the family farm in this country. I urge my colleagues to give in \ntheir consideration over this recess and look forward to reintroducing \nthis legislation at the beginning of the next Congress as the debate \nover the next farm bill begins in earnest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11258-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 187\n\n  At the request of Mr. Roth, the name of the Senator from Ohio (Mr. \nVoinovich) was added as a cosponsor of S. 187, a bill to give customers \nnotice and choice about how their financial institutions share or sell \ntheir personally identifiable sensitive financial information, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 821\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lautenberg, the name of the Senator from \nMaryland (Mr. Sarbanes) was added as a cosponsor of S. 821, a bill to \nprovide for the collection of data on traffic stops.\n\n\n                                S. 2938\n\n  At the request of Mr. Brownback, the name of the Senator from \nTennessee (Mr. Frist) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2938, a bill to \nprohibit United States assistance to the Palestinian Authority if a \nPalestinian state is declared unilaterally, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 3045\n\n  At the request of Mr. Leahy, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n3045, a bill to improve the quality, timeliness, and credibility of \nforensic science services for criminal justice purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 3067\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kennedy, the name of the Senator from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Boxer) was added as a cosponsor of S. 3067, a bill to \nrequire changes in the bloodborne pathogens standard in effect under \nthe Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11258-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 383--EXTENDING THE AUTHORITIES RELATING TO THE SENATE \n                    NATIONAL SECURITY WORKING GROUP\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I thought for the next few moments I would \nspeak basically in response to my colleague from Nevada, who is here on \nthe floor. He has taken the floor in the last two evenings to quote \nrather liberally and at length statements made by Republican \nPresidential candidate George W. Bush, and of course those statements \nstand in the Record as he has presented them. He quoted them verbatim, \nsaying he believed it was necessary to demonstrate the policy positions \nof this Presidential candidate.\n  I thought it would be appropriate to lay into the Record this evening \nsimilar quotes from Al Gore, the Presidential candidate for the \nDemocrat Party, who on many occasions has made a variety of \nembellishments about certain facts. For the next few moments, I want to \ntake this opportunity to read some of his quotes, which I think is \nappropriate as a comparative between the two Presidential candidates.\n  I will start with a CNN quote on ``Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer,'' \nMarch 9, 1999. Vice President Al Gore, at that time, said:\n\n\n[[Page S11263]]\n\n\n       During my service in the United States Congress, I took the \n     initiative in creating the Internet.\n\n  In the New York Times, December 1, 1999, he said:\n\n       I found a little place in upstate New York called Love \n     Canal. I had the first hearing on that issue and Toone, \n     Tennessee.\n\n  I assume he meant in Tone, Tennessee.\n\n       But that was the one that started it all.\n\n  I think that was the one where we knew the Vice President took credit \nfor discovering Love Canal and acting on it.\n  During a flight on Air Force One, Gore was chatting with reporters. \nThis is what he said:\n\n       He . . . spent two hours swapping opinions about movies and \n     telling stories about old chums like Eric Segal, who, Gore \n     said, used Al and Tipper as models for the uptight preppy and \n     his free-spirited girlfriend in ``Love story.''\n\n  That is a quote out of Time magazine, December 15, 1997.\n  This is from the first Presidential debate on October 3, 2000:\n\n       I accompanied James Lee Witt down to Texas when the fires \n     broke out.\n\n  Of course, he recanted that the next day, saying he really didn't do \nthat. He was down there on the ground, but not with Mr. Witt, Director \nof FEMA.\n  Then during the first Presidential debate on October 3, he said:\n\n       They can't squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to \n     stand during class.\n\n  Of course, immediately that school rejected that, saying that was \nsimply not true. The first day of classes, her desk was not available, \nbut the second day it was.\n  On the NBC ``Today Show,'' January 24, 1997, he said:\n\n       I did not know it was a fundraiser.\n\n  Of course, we know what he is talking about because then in an FBI \ndeposition transcript on May 23, 1997, he said:\n\n       I didn't realize it was in a Buddhist temple.\n\n  Those are actual quotes from a man who wants to be President of the \nUnited States.\n  He went on to say this in the Washington Post on September 24, 2000, \ntalking about the Strategic Oil Reserve which was established in 1975, \n2 years before Al Gore was elected to Congress:\n\n       I've been a part of the discussion on the Strategic Oil \n     Reserve since the days when it was first established.\n\n  In reference to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, he said:\n\n       I've worked on this for 20 years because, unless we get \n     this one right, nothing else matters.\n\n  That was on the Al Gore 2000 web site, October 14, 1999. Of course, \nduring his career here in the Senate, Mr. Gore openly opposed the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  In reference to the death penalty, Mr. President, candidate Gore has \nsaid this:\n\n       I have always supported it because I think society has a \n     right to make careful judgments about when that ultimate \n     penalty ought to be applied.\n\n  That was from the Associated Press, November 19, 1999. Senator Al \nGore voted against the death penalty for drug kingpins on June 28, \n1990, and against the death penalty for terrorists on February 20, \n1991.\n  Remember, he said, ``I support it,'' and then he twice voted against \nit.\n  In reference to the earned-income tax credit, he said:\n\n       I was the author of that proposal. I wrote that, so I say, \n     welcome aboard. This is something for which I have been a \n     principal proponent for a long time.\n\n  That was in Time Magazine, November 1, 1999.\n  Carthage Courier, February 21, 1980. Al Gore cast the tie-breaking \nvote in the Senate on August 6, 1993, to raise taxes on Social Security \nbenefits.\n  He said:\n\n       Social Security Benefits will remain untaxed . . . I \n     sincerely believe that any plan to tax Social Security \n     benefits would place an unforgivable burden on our senior \n     citizens who are currently trying to enjoy their retirement \n     years in the face of ever-increasing prices. . . . It is \n     totally inconceivable. . . . It is unfair.\n\n  Yet, of course, he was the one who cast the tie-breaking vote August \n6, 1993.\n  In reference to investing Social Security funds in the stock market, \nhe said:\n\n       We didn't really propose it. We talked about the idea.\n\n  See Clinton-Gore fiscal years 2000 and 2001 budget proposals. They \nnot only talked about it; they proposed it in their budget, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Here is another interesting quote:\n\n       Does he (George W. Bush) have the experience to be \n     President? You know he has never put together a budget. The \n     Governor of Texas is by far the weakest chief executive \n     position in America and does not have the responsibility of \n     forming or presenting a budget.\n\n  Now, if you look at Texas law, section 401.041, it reads:\n\n       The Governor of Texas is the chief Budget Officer of the \n     State.\n\n  Also, section 401.406 reads:\n\n       The Governor shall deliver a copy of the Governor's budget \n     to each member of the legislature not later than the sixth \n     day of each regular legislative session.\n  In reference to the McCain-Feingold campaign finance legislation, he \nsaid, ``Unlike Senator Bradley, I was a cosponsor of it.''\n  That was in the New York Times, November 24, 1999.\n  Cosponsor? I didn't know that Vice Presidents could become cosponsors \nof legislation. But be that as it may, that is what he said.\n  Here is another quote; The American Prospect, June 5, 2000.\n\n       One-hundred and sixty-three bills for free or reduced-cost \n     TV have been introduced in Congress since 1960.\n\n  Here is what the Vice President said about it:\n\n       Some of you may know that I don't come new to this issue; I \n     introduced the very first free TV legislation in the Senate, \n     exactly nine years ago this past Saturday, October 18, 1998.\n\n  Interestingly enough, the first bills were introduced in 1960.\n  Again, another mistake by our Vice President from the Columbia \nJournal Review, January 1993:\n\n       In an interview published last Sunday by the Des Moines \n     Register, Gore was quoted as saying he ``got a bunch of \n     people indicted and sent to jail'' while working as a \n     reporter for the Tennessean in the 1970s.\n\n  Two people were indicted for alleged corruption during the same \nperiod Al Gore covered the Nashville Metro Council. Neither of the two \nwere imprisoned.\n\n       I carried an M-16 . . . I pulled my turn on the perimeter \n     at night and walked through the elephant grass, and I was \n     fired upon.\n\n  Los Angeles Times, October 15, 1999.\n  According to witnesses, Al Gore was a reporter who never saw combat \nand was kept out of harm's way.\n  A speech to the New England Business Council, November 30, 1999:\n  ``I was a home builder after I came back from Vietnam. . . I know a \ngood bit about how to make money that way''--meaning home building--\n``to build this country is a great thing.''\n  Tanglewood Homebuilders was a Gore family corporation. The contractor \nsaid Al Gore visited the construction site once or twice.\n\n       I live on a farm today. I have my heart in my own farm.\n\n  ABC News, December 23, 1999.\n  Of course, we know that Mr. Gore was raised here in the city of \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Recognizing my time has expired, I will continue this \ndialog probably on Monday night. I have now quoted 20 of about 40 of \nthese kinds of situations in which the Vice President has found \nhimself. I will make them a part of the Record to compare them to what \nthe Senator from Nevada has stated, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11263-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11263-S11269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DIFFERENT APPROACHES\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, in yesterday's New York Times, there was a \nstory about a young man in Poughkeepsie, NY, who used a global \npositioning satellite device--a little, hand-held device that tells you \nexactly where you are--to do something that apparently is sweeping the \ncountry; that is, to cachet something and then put a GPS label on it. \nThen somebody else goes out and tries to find it. It is the latest fad \nin the never-ending pursuit of ways to use sophisticated technologies \nto accomplish useless things.\n  With great respect to the Senator from Idaho, what we have here is \none more attempt to come down here and use sophisticated descriptions \nof the Vice President to accomplish useless things.\n\n[[Page S11264]]\n\n  The other day, the Senator from Nevada came down and read I don't \nknow how many pages of statements of the Governor of Texas; things that \nhe said were incorrect. ``Nigeria is a continent''--things like that--\nand, ``I am the only candidate who knows how to put food on my \nfamily.''\n  It is funny.\n  The truth is, the Vice President, in the House of Representatives, \ndid play an instrumental role in providing the funding for the National \nScience Foundation, DARPA, and other sorts of things. One of the \nfounders of Netscape the other day said Netscape wouldn't have been \ncreated--he is the guy that wrote the software at Champaign-Urbana, IL, \ncalled Mosaic that lead to the creation of the Internet.\n  He said: I wouldn't have gotten my start, and we wouldn't have been \ndoing our work were it not for Al Gore's work over in the House.\n  All of these things we can argue.\n  I have been asked repeatedly: Do you think the Governor of Texas is \ncompetent enough to be President? Does he lack intelligence?\n  I was asked the other day on a radio show. I don't say that the \nGovernor of Texas lacks intelligence; I do not suggest that he is \nincompetent; But I think it is important to examine the proposals that \nare on the table. The Governor of Texas says we ought to cut income \ntaxes by $1.6 trillion. He says let the American people decide how the \nmoney is going to be spent.\n  That is a reasonable thing to do. I don't object to letting the \nAmerican people decide how they are going to spend their own money.\n  Over the last 10 years, we have made great strides, starting with a \npiece of legislation that the father of the Governor of Texas supported \nin 1990. George Herbert Walker Bush, when he was campaigning in 1980 \nfor the Republican nomination, described Ronald Reagan's proposals as \n``voodoo economics.'' He went along with him as Vice President for 8 \nyears, and for 2 years as President.\n  In 1990, he said we have had enough. He signed legislation and \nimposed caps that we are obliterating this year.\n  We are ignoring the caps this year. I think we are going to be $300 \nbillion over on appropriations; the tax bill, another $250 billion \nagainst Medicare; health provisions, another $250 billion. We are about \n$900 billion over the caps.\n  But the Governor of Texas is determined to do another $1.6 trillion \non top of that--$1.1 trillion of payroll tax; ``voodoo economics,'' and \nwill put at risk not just this surplus that we have but the jobs that \nhave been created as a consequence of what his father started in 1990.\n  That is what this campaign is about. It should not be in pursuit of \nwhat I consider to be sort of useless arguments where you find that the \nVice President said something that isn't 100 percent true. So he finds \nsomething that the Governor of Texas says isn't 100 percent true. That \nreally makes unusual candidates for office. It is a fairly common thing \nfor us to do in the campaign.\n\n  But, in my view, an awful lot is at stake here--an awful lot more \nthan just trying to figure out who says the silliest things and the \nmost preposterous things.\n  The economic strategy of these two individuals is dramatically \ndifferent. Their approach to problem solving is also dramatically \ndifferent, and their attitudes toward many issues are dramatically \ndifferent. We ought to allow the American people to distinguish one \nfrom the other.\n  I for one am getting sort of weary from all of these attempts to \ndemonstrate that one person lies and the other person is so stupid that \nthey can't figure out one thing from another.\n  It is far more important, it seems to me, for the American people to \nassess where it is these two individuals want to take this country, and \nthen try to, as well, give them the opportunity to separate themselves. \nAnd they are clearly dramatically different in their approach not only \nto the issues but in their approach to the economy and in their \napproach to where they want to take the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor and look forward to the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I listened to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Idaho and the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, and I would \nlike to say that there is a real difference between the two candidates \nfor President. I think we in America can say that the candidates \nrunning for President and Vice President are decent people. Their wives \nare good people. I know them all very well. The differences between \nthem, however, are really stark.\n  I believe if you compare the Bush and Gore economic programs you will \nfind that the programs of George Bush have much more justification than \nthe other side.\n  We all know that these comments about reducing the national debt are \njust a front. We haven't seen that happen since 1994 when the first \nRepublican Congress in decades took over.\n  The year 1994 was the first time in decades that we controlled both \nHouses of Congress and since then we have balanced the budget three \ntimes. We have paid down the debt $361 billion. By the end of next year \nit will be $\\1/2\\ trillion. That would not have happened had it not \nbeen for the first Republican Congress.\n  I remember as a Member of this body in 1994 when the President \nsubmitted the budget for $200 billion in deficits well into this \ncentury. President Clinton said at the time that nothing could be done, \nthere was no way we could have anything but those deficits for at least \n10 years.\n  Of course, we have shown that good fiscal discipline can literally \nbalance the budget. I have to say what we are in right now is a mess. I \nthink it will take George Bush and Dick Cheney to straighten it out. \nOne of the things I like about George Bush so much is that he picked \nDick Cheney, who, without question, is head and shoulders over most \npeople who have served in Washington. Cheney is bright. He is extremely \nintelligent. He is extremely knowledgeable and has a lot of experience. \nHe is honest to a fault, and he is straightforward. He is just the type \nof a person we need in government today.\n  When you have a $4.6 trillion projected surplus, it is pretty clear \nto me that taxpayers are being asked to pay too much in taxes. Frankly, \nBush's approach is to set aside $2.3 trillion for Social Security; he \nhas $1.3 trillion to give back to the taxpayers and use the other $1 \ntrillion to pay down the national debt.\n  In order to have a $4.6 trillion surplus, we better pursue a wise \neconomic approach. This economic approach has reduced the marginal tax \nrates from 70 percent down to 28 percent in 1986, and reduced capital \ngains from 28 percent to 20 percent 3 years ago. We had to think \nseriously about balancing the budget during our battles for the \nbalanced budget amendment. But the first Republican Congress in decades \nmanaged to balance the budget. And we also had a wonderful head of the \nFederal Reserve in Alan Greenspan, a Republican, who basically has done \nmiraculous work. There is no question that Secretary Robert Rubin did a \ngood job and helped to stabilize world markets.\n  In all honesty, if we want to keep this economy going, we have to \nrealize that marginal tax rates have jumped from 28 percent in 1986 up \nto over 40 percent today. Of course, they are still 30 points below \nwhere they were when Ronald Reagan took office with double-digit \ninflation and double-digit interest rates.\n  I hope the American people realize we have to have a change in \nWashington or we are going to go back to the old ways of deficits, high \ninterest, and high taxes.\n  I might also add that I get tired of this 1 percent business. Let's \nface it, the top 1 percent of those who pay income taxes pay almost 35 \npercent of the income taxes in this country. The upper 50 percent, \nwhich comprises people with incomes over $27,000 a year, pay 96 percent \nof all taxes. The bottom 50 percent pay around 4 percent of all taxes. \nNaturally, Bush wants everybody who pays taxes to receive some benefits \nfrom having done so. Those who earn less than $35,000 a year are going \nto have a 100-percent reduction in most cases. Since the average wage \nin Utah is $37,000, it is easy to see we are going to have a lot of \npeople in Utah benefiting from the Bush tax cuts. If you make $50,000 \nor less, you\n\n[[Page S11265]]\n\nhave a 50 percent or a 55 percent reduction in your tax burden. At \n$75,000, you have 25 percent.\n  I felt it necessary to make these comments because the differences \nbetween the two candidates are stark. I think both candidates are good \npeople. Vice President Gore and his wife Tipper are good people. There \nis no question that Governor Bush is a very good person, and his wife, \nLaura, is a wonderful person.\n  The difference is philosophy. It is time for us to get the country \ngoing in the right direction. That is my view.\n  Mr. President, I make a few comments to discuss a matter of great \nimportance to immigrants and to all Americans.\n  President Clinton has repeatedly threatened to veto the Commerce, \nJustice, State appropriations if it does not include his proposals for \nimmigration amnesty for undocumented aliens, or in most cases, illegal \naliens. He calls it the Latino Immigration Fairness Act.\n  The CJS conference report does far better than the Latino fairness \nbill that the President is advocating. This CJS Report includes \nprovisions that will restore fairness to immigrants from all countries, \nincluding hundreds of thousands of Latinos. The CJS bill contains a \nproposal carefully crafted by myself and others and we call it the \nLegal Immigration Family Equity Act, the LIFE Act. Our proposal has at \nits foundation a simple goal--to take a much needed step toward \nbringing fairness to our Nation's immigration policy by reuniting \nfamilies and helping those who have played by the rules. Our proposal \ndoes not pit one nationality against another, nor does it pit one race \nagainst another. Our legislation provides relief to immigrants from all \ncountries involved.\n  By contrast, the Clinton-Gore proposal would grant a blanket amnesty \nto millions of undocumented aliens--many or most of whom have broken \nour immigration laws. It also picks out specific groups of immigrants--\nnamely, Central Americans--for special treatment. Unlike the Clinton-\nGore proposal, our plan does not provide relief to those who have \nviolated our laws at the expense of those who have played by the rules. \nInstead, it restores due process to a class of immigrants wrongly \ndenied the ability to apply for residency nearly 15 years ago and \nexpeditiously reunifies husbands, wives, and children of resident \naliens. In other words, legal aliens.\n  It is important to bear in mind that at the same time the \nadministration wants to grant amnesty to millions of people, it cannot \neven tell us how many people are waiting in line to come here legally. \nThe administration's best guess on the number of immigrants waiting in \nline--a figure which is nearly four years old--is that over 3.5 million \npeople are waiting to immigrate to the United States. Over 1 million of \nthese applicants are spouses and children of permanent residents, that \nwe take care of in our bill. The others we will look at, but not in the \ncontext of this bill. No; instead, the administration proposes to move \nto the front of our immigration lines those who have violated our \nimmigration laws.\n\n  That doesn't seem right to me. We have to focus our efforts on \nhelping reduce this backlog in addressing any legitimate due process \nissues. Our proposal does these things to accomplish these goals. The \nfirst part of our LIFE Act creates a new form of visitor visa for \nspouses and children of permanent residents. Our plan puts our Nation's \nresources behind reuniting families, instead of processing amnesty \napplications. Eligible applicants would be allowed to reunite with \ntheir families residing in the United States, and work legally while \nawaiting a decision on the merits of their petitions.\n  Our proposal would allow approximately 600,000 over the next 3 years \nto come to the United States legally, ahead of schedule, to be reunited \nwith their immediate families.\n  Second, the LIFE Act further strengthens family and marriage by \npermitting spouses of U.S. citizens married outside the United States \nto obtain visas allowing spouses to enter the United States to await \nimmigrant visa processing. Before the Clinton-Gore White House proposes \nthat we give residency to those who have broken our minimum immigration \nlaws, shouldn't we first be in the position of letting the wives of our \ncitizens into this country, those who are legal?\n  Third, the LIFE Act restores due process to immigrants who are \nwrongly denied adjustment of status because of an INS administrative \nerror.\n  My proposal allows the late amnesty class of 1982 to pursue their \nlegalization claims under the original terms of the 1986 Act. We \nrestore fairness to this group of individuals that has spent over 10 \nyears in litigation.\n  This portion of the LIFE Act would assist approximately 400,000 \nimmigrants in the class of 1982 who have played by the rules and now \ndeserve the chance to legalize their status in accordance with law. Our \nproposal is strongly supported by those who lived through this \nlitigation and fought against the Clinton administration's INS for \nfairness--not the political interest groups that would prefer to divide \nour country over this issue. Members of the class of 1982 prefer our \nsolution to the administration's. One member of the class recently \npleaded:\n\n       We urge President Clinton to now call upon his INS to lay \n     down its arms, to stop its decade-old battle to block our \n     legalization, to comply with the numerous court orders we \n     have won.\n\n  In short, our LIFE Act will help close to one million people who have \nbeen treated unfairly by our nation's immigration laws.\n  But Republicans have not stopped there. We recognize that there is a \nserious need to reform the Immigration and Naturalization Service in \nboth its mission and its structure. We have complaints all the time \nabout it. It is time to reform it. The INS should offer better service \nand a culture of respect for our newest Americans. Many Republicans and \nDemocrats have worked hard toward promoting these broad goals.\n  Although we have yet to receive any written or formal response from \nthe administration concerning the LIFE Act, we have presented the White \nHouse with language that says we should hold hearings and consider \nlegislation that addresses the backlogs in applications for lawful \npermanent residency, furthers keeping families together, and addresses \nwhether there are worker shortages in different sectors of our economy. \nFurther, we have proposed that the Attorney General prepare a report to \nCongress no later than March 1, 2001, addressing facts relating to the \nadministration's proposal.\n  Why do we need a report? Well, before the Congress is asked to \nproceed to grant separate treatment to different nationalities, or \nconsider a blanket amnesty, I think it might make some sense to know \nhow many people would be covered by the proposal. We have repeatedly \nasked for such information from the administration--they have yet to \nprovide it. Let's be clear: the Clinton-Gore administration cannot even \ntell us how many people will be covered by their proposal. Why can't \nthey tell us? Either they do not know the answer or they do know the \nanswer but don't want the American people to know it. They would rather \nplay politics with this issue.\n  I have no objection to seriously considering immigration reforms \nduring the next Congress. I am chairman of the Republican Senatorial \nHispanic Task Force. I have worked very hard for Latinos throughout our \ncountry--frankly, throughout the world, and will continue to do so. But \nsuch major reforms should not be pursued in an election year rush to \ncreate wedge issues that divide, rather than unite Americans. Real INS \nreform requires that we proceed in a responsible way, after we know the \nfacts.\n  Unfortunately, the President appears not to care about the facts. If \nhe did care, he would not threaten to veto this important bill since a \nveto jeopardizes funding for some of our most crucial government \nprograms.\n  This chart shows just some of the many programs funded by the CJS \nappropriations bill--programs which the President threatens to cut off \nfunding for with his veto. The CJS appropriations bill allocates $4.8 \nbillion for the INS. If those funds are cut off by that veto we are \ngoing to be in a bigger mess on immigration then ever before, as bad as \nsome think INS is. It contains an additional $15.7 million for Border \nPatrol equipment upgrades. How will President Clinton explain to \nAmericans that he wants to shut down the INS and Border Patrol in order \nto\n\n[[Page S11266]]\n\nforce Congress to grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens? What \nkind of a message does this send to the men and women of the Border \nPatrol who risk their lives doing their job each and every day? I would \nnote that the Border Patrol officers oppose his amnesty proposal--or \nshould I say the proposal of those on the other side.\n  This appropriations bill also contains $3.3 billion for the FBI, and \n$221 million for training, equipment, and research and development \nprograms to combat domestic terrorism. How will President Clinton \nexplain to the families of those killed in the U.S.S. Cole bombing that \nFBI agents may have to be brought home because he has cut off funding \nfor the FBI in order to grant amnesty to millions of undocumented \naliens who violated our immigration laws?\n  This appropriations bill contains $4.3 billion for the federal prison \nsystem and $1.3 billion for the Drug Enforcement Administration. How \nwill President Clinton explain to the American people that funding for \nFederal prisons and drug enforcement and drug interdiction will be put \nat risk because he wants to grant amnesty to millions of people who \nhave violated our immigration laws?\n  We do not even know how many millions because they will not give us \nthe figures. I suspect the reason they will not give us the figures is \nbecause it amounts to more than 4 million people.\n  Let me just put another thing up here. At the end of this Congress, \nwe got into an awful bind that threatened to stop us from reauthorizing \nthe Violence Against Women Act--for which we allocate $288 million. \nThis is the Biden-Hatch bill. We passed it 6 years ago, as I recall. It \nhas worked very well to help Women In Jeopardy Programs, legal aid for \nbattered women and children, and a whole raft of other things to help \ncope with the problems of violence against women. This all goes down \nthe drain if the President vetoes this bill. It is a matter of great \nconcern. Like I say, this bill allocates $288 million for the Violence \nAgainst Women Act Program, legislation that I strongly supported and \nhelped to break free at the end of this Congress.\n  Does President Clinton want to cut off funding for assistance to \nbattered women and their children in order to grant amnesty to millions \nof illegal aliens? It does not sound logical to me. I know we are weeks \naway from an election. I also appreciate the desire of the Clinton-Gore \nWhite House to play wedge politics. But I feel it is incumbent upon me \nto note this White House, indeed, some White House officials involved \nin this immigration effort, have a pretty poor record when it comes to \nletting political motivations cloud their judgment on matters, \nimportant matters of public interest and public safety. Let's not \nforget how the Clinton-Gore White House granted clemency to convicted \nFALN terrorists in order to, in their words, ``have a positive impact \namong strategic Puerto Rican communities in the U.S. (read voters).''\n  The White House consciously targeted Puerto Rican voters and, it \nseemed to me, under the worst of circumstances and in the worst way.\n  Actions have consequences. If President Clinton vetoes this bill, he \nis putting the public safety and well-being at risk, both at home and \nabroad. He is doing this all in an effort to play wedge politics. The \nPresident's veto threats ring especially hollow because this \nappropriations bill provides many proposals to help immigrants. The \nPresident himself has stated that he wants, ``to keep families \ntogether, and to make our immigration policies more equitable.''\n  This is exactly what my LIFE Act does. In order to get that done, I \nhave had to bring together people with all kinds of varying viewpoints, \nfrom those who do not want any immigration changes at all to those \nothers who do not care about immigration.\n  I believe in the Statue of Liberty. I believe this is a country that \nought to be open for legal immigrants.\n  I believe we ought to do everything in our power to solve these \nproblems. I am willing to hold hearings right to see if we have not \ncovered some of the problems that need to be covered. More than 1 \nmillion people are going to be covered by the LIFE Act. We have been \nable to bring together both Houses of Congress, as far as Republicans \nare concerned, and I think a lot of good Democrats when they look at \nthis will be very impressed that we have been able to get this much \ndone. I cannot go beyond that because there are people who just will \nnot go any further.\n  I am willing to commit to holding hearings right after the first of \nthe year to determine what else needs to be done. I am not prepared \ntoday, without all the facts, without hearings, without knowing where \nwe are going, to grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens and put \nthem on the list ahead of those who need their spouses and families to \nbe brought together.\n  When we fought these matters on the floor, there was a lot of anguish \nand whining by some on the other side that we were not taking care of \nfamilies and children. I said we would try to do that and we have done \nit.\n  This bill does more than the President's bill, and it does it legally \nin the right way, giving preference to the people who have played by \nthe rules rather than those who have not.\n  Most Americans descend from someone who came to this great country in \nthe hope of pursuing a better life, in the hope of fulfilling the \nAmerican Dream. I believe the American Dream is still alive and that we \nin Congress should try to serve as its custodians. For this reason, I \nbelieve it is not right to penalize families and to disadvantage those \nwho have played by the rules. Indeed, I believe most current and future \nAmericans--most Hispanics, most Asians, most Africans, and most Arabs--\ndo not want to see people who play by the rules disadvantaged in an \nelection year rush to help those who have not. And if you put the \nquestion to those the administration seeks to help, I think they would \nagree as well.\n  A veto of CJS appropriations and the LIFE Act would elevate political \nposturing above immigrant families and would place interest group \npolitics over protecting the health and well-being of all Americans.\n  We have brought a lot of people together on this bill. I call upon \nthe President to look at that. It is quite an achievement under \ncircumstances that have been difficult for people such as myself.\n  It surprises me that the administration has suddenly called for \nurgent immigration reform for fairness' sake. It was 4 short years ago \nthat the President eagerly signed the Illegal Immigration Reform Act of \n1996. The President's current proposal stands the 1996 law on its head. \nHere is what the President said then about the 1996 Act in his signing \nstatement:\n\n       This bill also includes landmark immigration legislation \n     that reinforces the efforts we have made over the last 3 \n     years to combat illegal immigration. It strengthens the rule \n     of law by cracking down on illegal immigration at the border, \n     in the workplace, and in the criminal justice system--without \n     punishing those living in the United States legally, or \n     allowing children to be kept out of schools and sent into the \n     streets.\n\n  I think the President ought to live by those words, instead of \nundermining existing law through Latino fairness. Getting our LIFE bill \ntogether has taken a lot of effort on my part and on the part of others \nunder difficult circumstances. We have been able to bring together \npeople who almost always have difficulty with immigration laws.\n  Our proposal has something that will solve the 1982 problem of due \nprocess rights. Those people have not been treated fairly by the INS. \nThe INS keeps appealing their cases even though they win them every \ntime. We will solve that problem for them.\n  It solves the problem of reuniting minor children with their parents \nin this country. It does it in the best of ways, and it does it \nexpeditiously. It solves the problem of bringing spouses together with \ntheir husbands and wives who are legal, and it will help close to 1 \nmillion people. That, to me, having worked on immigration matters over \nthe last 24 years, is a pretty darn good accomplishment if we can get \nit done.\n  I do not want to have this process break down because politics are \nbeing played. I know there will never be an agreement to allow up to 4 \nmillion people who are illegal aliens into this country in preference \nover these three categories of people I have talked about, these 1 \nmillion people who deserve to be treated better.\n  I hope the President will listen to what I have said. I have not had \na chance to personally chat with him, but I have talked with his Chief \nof Staff who is a good friend and decent\n\n[[Page S11267]]\n\nman and who I think, having served on the Senate Judiciary Committee \nfor all those years on the Democratic side, understands how difficult \nthese matters are to put together.\n  I believe it is time to resovle these problems. I have done my best \nto do it. This is as far as we can go now, but we make a promise to \nlook into every issue that is raised in hearings as soon as we get \nback, assuming we are still in the majority. Even if we are not, I will \ncooperate in seeing those hearings are held in an orderly and \nintelligent way.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold for a moment?\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, be recognized for 20 minutes following \nthe Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, my good friend from Utah just described \ntwo things that I see much differently than he does. The conflict we \nare having right now over Commerce-State-Justice is occurring as a \nconsequence of the House and the Senate not finishing their \nappropriations work. They are supposed to be done by the first of \nOctober. We are supposed to have all 13 bills passed. Our work is \nsupposed to be done and all the bills sent to the President for \nsignature. We were not able to get the work done. We are not able to \nlook much further than what has happened to fiscal discipline around \nhere to discover why we have been unable to get our appropriations \nbills done, why there have been delays on the appropriations bills. The \nanswer is we are spending a lot more than the budget caps allow.\n  According to Bill Hoagland, who in the New York Times lays it out as \naccurately as anybody--I consider him to be an extremely reliable \nanalyzer of the numbers--the appropriations bills we are going to pass \nwill be $310 billion over the caps as estimated by CBO over the next 10 \nyears, and that presumes that only inflation will be allowed over the \nnext 10 years in growth in appropriations which we did not do this \nyear. We are way beyond inflation this year. It is probably not $310 \nbillion. It is probably much more than that. That is the problem.\n  It is very much a case where we had a glass slipper that was too \nsmall for our great big foot, and we could not get all the things we \nwanted to spend into that shoe. The Republican majority, facing that \nproblem, had to decide what it was going to do. It has delayed, \ndelayed, delayed, and as a consequence, we are now in a situation \nwhere, if we attach anything to it that is objectionable to the \nPresident, it is going to provoke a veto.\n  You know what you have to do to get the President to sign it. He will \ntell you what to do to sign it. If you are 27 days late, do not be \nsurprised if you have lost leverage. Of course you have lost leverage; \nyou are 27 days beyond the battle line, what the law tells us we are \nsupposed to be doing with our appropriations bills.\n  There are two things I want to talk about as we head toward the end \nof this session that I find to be very troubling. The first is what we \nare doing with the surplus itself. Again, the second thing the Senator \nfrom Utah said earlier is we balanced the budget in 1997 and that it \ncame about as a result of the election of a Republican House and Senate \nin 1995.\n  I voted for a Republican budget in 1995. I voted for a Republican \nbudget in 1997 in order to balance it. But we began down this trail in \n1990. That is when the budget caps were enacted. That is when we \nestablished sequestration to put in automatic across-the-board cuts if \nwe were unable to get our budget inside the caps. There was a purpose. \nBalancing the budget was not an end in itself; it was a means to an \nend.\n  What was the end? The end was growth in the economy. We believed that \nif you balanced the budget--in other words, if you spent less than you \ntaxed--that that would produce growth in the economy. That was the \nargument, not just in 1990, but way long before that.\n  I recall, when I was Governor, signing a letter in support of what \nthe Republican Senate was doing in 1985 to try to balance the budget. \nIt included a freezing of the COLA, which some say contributed to the \nloss of the Republican Senate in the 1986 election. I do not know if \nthat is true or not. It was tough medicine. It would have balanced the \nbudget. It is not easy to balance the budget.\n  I remember voting in 1990, 1993, and 1997--and the criticism is \nalways the same: I want to balance the budget. I believe deficit \nreduction is important. I just don't want to pay any more or take any \nless. The only objection is, you cut my program and increased my taxes. \nOther than that, I liked what you did.\n  We had tough medicine in 1990, tough medicine in 1993, and tough \nmedicine in 1997. All during those years, we had a means to say to our \ncitizens: Look, I have to say no; I have a spending cap up until this \nyear. If you came to this floor, and there was a motion to waive the \nBudget Act, it was tough to get 60 votes. Not anymore. Today, it is \nrelatively easy to get 60 votes. I am not even sure we are going to \nhave a vote to break the budget caps on appropriations.\n  Listen to what Mr. Hoagland says: This year we started off with a \n$2.4 trillion general fund surplus. The appropriations is going to \nreduce that surplus by $310 billion. An additional $295 billion in \nsurplus goes for two tax cuts: the $240 billion package we are battling \nover right now and a separate $55 billion reduction in taxes on long \ndistance telephone calls.\n  I listened to the argument. This is a Spanish-American War tax. For \ngosh sakes, the income tax is a World War I tax. Let's get rid of that, \ntoo, if that is the basis of why eliminating a tax makes good sense.\n  But we are going to eliminate a $55 billion tax. We are going to \nincrease payments to Medicare. That is $74 billion more in the surplus, \nanother $44 billion going to increased pension benefits to military \nretirees. Tax cuts and spending increases come to $723 billion over 10 \nyears. The surplus is actually reduced by an additional $187 billion \nbecause of interest costs, bringing the total to $910 billion.\n  Since the 1990 Budget Act, signed by President Bush--all through the \n1990s--we had to come to the floor, and if you wanted to offer \nsomething that spent more money, you had to have an offset. It was \ncalled the pay-go system.\n  We discovered that tucked in this little $247 billion tax bill that \nwe are arguing about is a provision that waives the pay-go provisions. \nI mean, we are abandoning everything that got us to where we are today.\n  Again, I emphasize to people who want to know, what is this all \nabout? Twenty-one million dollars have been created. The recovery, in \nmy view, started prior to 1993. It started in 1991 and 1992. The \ndeficit started coming down in 1992, and in no small part because of \nwhat we did in 1990. The full story did not begin in 1997. It did not \nstart in 1993. It started in 1990. And now we are just throwing it all \nout the window, saying: It does not matter anymore; we have a great big \nsurplus. That is why the American people are distrustful. That is why \nthey are saying to us: Take that surplus and pay down the debt. That is \nwhy they are not supporting big tax cuts.\n\n  I voted for the Republican tax cut the first time it came up. Then I \nwent home and the people of Nebraska said to me: We don't want it. We \ndon't want it. Pay down the debt.\n  This fiscal discipline has been good for us. It has created jobs. It \nhas promoted economic growth. There has been a positive result.\n  So I say, especially with the Governor of Texas saying he is \ncommitted to a $1.6 trillion income tax cut and a $1.1 trillion payroll \ntax cut, that on top of what we have already done, in my view, that is \nunquestionably going to put us right back in the soup. That is the \nfailed policy of the past.\n  The failed policy of the past is when we said it doesn't matter if \nour budget is balanced. The failed policy of the past is when we were \ntaking 22 percent of our income and spending it with 18-percent taxes \ncoming in. Now it is the opposite. Spending levels are at 18 percent--\nthe lowest level they have been since the middle of the 1970s, before \nthis year, before what we have been doing in the past week or so--\nheading to 16 percent. It has not been at that level since Dwight \nEisenhower was President.\n\n[[Page S11268]]\n\n  I have to say that given what Congress is doing, and what we are \nseeing at the Presidential debate level, my hope is the American people \nwill wise up and say: We got to where we are with tough choices. We are \nabout ready to throw it all down the drain.\n  My belief is that fiscal discipline has not just been good for us \nhere domestically, it has given us the strength to do an awful lot of \nthings throughout the world as well. That is our greatest source of \nstrength, our capacity to keep our economy growing.\n  You do not have to look any further than the former Soviet Union and \nRussia. They have a GDP that is $30 billion less than we have for \ndefense. I am not saying our defense ought to be lower. I support \ntaking it higher. I do not compare our defense against Russia, but \ntheir GDP is so low they cannot take care of submarines such as the \nKursk.\n  I took a trip to Africa. Of the 11 nations we visited, they spend \nless than $10 per person on health care and $10 per person on \neducation. The reason is their income is insufficient. They do not have \nthe growth and are not producing things that the world wants to buy, \nand the United States of America does.\n  So I do not want to go back to the failed policies of the past. I do \nnot want to go back to ``voodoo economics.'' I do not want to go back \nto those days when we said to the American people that it does not \nmatter whether or not our budget is balanced.\n  We paid too big a price to get to where we are today. The American \npeople not only are more prosperous and more enthusiastic about their \neconomy and their future, but they have an awful lot more confidence in \ndemocracy as a result of our finally being able to do something about \nwhat was public enemy No. 1, all the way through the 1980s, and all the \nway through the 1990s.\n\n  I am sure former President Bush remembers what happened in 1992. He \nhad a guy by the name of Ross Perot who made the deficit a battle cry \nand enabled him to have an impact upon that Presidential election, and \nprobably enabled then-Governor Clinton to win that election, with 43 \npercent of the vote.\n  So you do not have to go back very far to see why it is that we have \nto reestablish fiscal discipline. We are going in the wrong direction. \nTo get rid of the pay-go provisions is reason enough to vote against \nthis tax bill for anybody who went all the way through the 1990s in \nthis Congress. And that is the reason we are struggling with Commerce-\nState-Justice.\n  The dirty little secret is that our spending appetite exceeds the \nbudget caps that got us to where we are today. As I said, this sounds \nlike all process arguments. But there was a big payoff in eliminating \nthat deficit, paying down the public debt, and relieving the pressure \nupon the private sector of borrowing, as we have done.\n  It did not just enable the economy to grow, it lowered the cost of \nborrowing money for a house, lowered the cost of borrowing money for an \nautomobile, and lowered the cost of borrowing money for a business. In \nmy view, at least as one former businessperson, it promoted an awful \nlot of economic growth. It has a huge impact on our capacity to create \nthe kind of jobs that the American people want.\n  There is a second troubling thing that I have heard said over and \nover during this tax debate and the debate on the Medicare balanced \nbudget give-backs as well. Those are both provisions we have, \nrecognizing in 1997 we took almost $300 billion out of Medicare for \nproviders instead of the $100 billion that we thought. So we are trying \nto adjust that a bit and make things a little easier for--in my State, \nespecially the rural providers--the providers, but also home health \ncare people and long-term care providers, and so forth, that are in \nthat package.\n  I have heard it said over and over that, gee, this was largely \nbipartisan. Many of the provisions in this bill are provisions that \nwere supported by Democrats. That is absolutely true. There are many \nprovisions that are in this bill that were supported by Democrats. That \nis not the issue. The problem is, I heard one of my colleagues say \nearlier--he was describing negotiations with China--an agreement is \njust a temporary interruption in the negotiations.\n  We had an agreement on pensions. We had an agreement on pension \nreforms. Democrats came on board saying: We recognize that in order to \ndo pension reform, you are going to have to provide changes in the law \nthat are likely to benefit upper income people.\n  The distinguished Senator from Utah earlier talked about the 1 \npercent. He is absolutely right.\n  Almost 40 percent of the swing in the deficit from 1992 to today, 43 \npercent, an estimate made by Bill Hoagland of the New York Times--43 \npercent of that came because income tax rates were higher, and we had a \nbig run-up in the stock market, a big cashing out of stock options, and \na big cashing out of pensions as well. So upper income people are \npaying more taxes, especially Americans who have more than $1 million \nof taxable income. They are paying a lot of taxes.\n  So Democrats--I for one--acknowledge that if you are going to do a \npension reform bill, it is likely to benefit upper income people. We \nare not going to demagogue that. It is likely to be that that is the \ncase. But we asked for a couple little provisions to help that low- and \nmoderate-income worker. They were tax credits.\n  The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Archer, doesn't \nlike tax credits. So he stripped the two provisions out that we had in \nthere for small businesses to help them defray the cost of start-up \npensions. He stripped the provision out that had a matching in there \nfor this low- and moderate-income worker who is working for small \nbusinesses that have fewer than 100 employees. He stripped that out \nbecause he doesn't like tax credits. We had a deal. So when the \nRepublican leadership got together, they yielded to Mr. Archer and \nstripped out provisions of the pension bill we wanted that made it more \nfair.\n  I said last night, God created Democrats so we can ask the question: \nIs it fair? Sometimes we don't ask: Can we pay for it? That is \nsomething we have to train ourselves to do, and I thought we had \nthrough the 1990s with the budget caps. I talked about that earlier. \nBut we asked the question: Is it fair? If we are going to spend money \nand try to increase the amount of pension coverage we have in the \nUnited States of America, shouldn't we try to do it for low- and \nmoderate-income working people in the workforce with employers who have \nfewer than 100 employees? Shouldn't we do that? We answered yes. And \nRepublicans in the Finance Committee agreed with us. That is what we \ngot.\n  Mr. Archer said he doesn't like tax credits. So when the Republican \nleadership all got together--without a hearing--they stripped it out. \nGuess what. With it stripped out, Mr. Archer still votes against it.\n  So they took something out of the pension bill they now want us to \npass, that we had insisted on in order to get Mr. Archer's support, and \nhe still votes against the darn thing.\n  That is why we are pushing back. That is why we urge President \nClinton to veto this thing. We would like to get most of the things \nthat are in this tax bill. We believe Vice President Gore is correct \nwhen he says we ought to make careful decisions and selections about \nwhose taxes are going to get cut. That is what we ought to attempt to \ndo. We ought to target those tax cuts.\n  But you have to target the tax cuts, especially when you are dealing \nwith pensions and health care, as much of this does, you ought to \ntarget it so as to increase the number of people who have pensions.\n  All of us here in Congress aren't going to have any difficulty \ncontributing to get another $5,000. We have plenty of disposable income \nto come up with the money to be able to increase our contributions. The \nproblem is for that minimum-wage, or slightly over, individual in a \nsmall business who is struggling to get it done.\n  The same on health insurance: If you are trying to increase the \nnumber of people who have health insurance, you have to do more than \nwhat is in this tax package. My friend from Texas, Senator Gramm, was \ntalking about the value of the tax deduction. The value of the tax \ndeduction is much greater the higher your income. I get a 40-percent \nsubsidy as a consequence of the level of my income. But if my income is \n$16,000 a year, I don't get any deduction. If I am paying at the 15-\npercent\n\n[[Page S11269]]\n\nrate, I get a 15-percent deduction. That is how it works.\n  The Joint Tax Committee estimates that 26 million people will get \nbenefits as a consequence of the health care provisions, but only 1.6 \nmillion of those people are people who currently don't have health \ninsurance.\n  Republicans in Congress, I think correctly, are saying that what \nGovernor Bush said in the third debate, ``That is the difference \nbetween my opponent and I;'' he wants Washington to decide and select \nwho gets a tax cut. Republicans apparently are saying that the Governor \nis wrong, because we are going to select who gets the tax cuts.\n  If you are going to have a tax cut right now, it seems to me one of \nthe things we ought to try to do is to say: This remarkable recovery we \nare having right now has been fabulous, but there are some people who \nhave been left behind. Let's try to help them acquire pensions in their \npart of the American dream. Let's try to help them acquire health \ninsurance in their part of the American dream. We don't do that.\n  As I said, I heard my Republican friends assert several times that \nDemocrats were on board and support many of the provisions. That is \ntrue. But we added provisions that were stricken out. We added \nprovisions that would have made the proposal much more fair. I believe \nyou cannot apply a fairness test every single time you are doing \nthings. There are times when life isn't fair. But when you are giving \ntax cuts to American working families, it seems to me a test of \nfairness is appropriate. When you are trying to increase the number of \npeople who have pensions in the workforce, when you are trying to \nincrease the number of people who have health insurance, a test of \nfairness is appropriate for Members of Congress to try to apply to the \npiece of legislation we are considering.\n  Those are the two objections I have to what is going on right now. \nThe first is, I think we have lost our way when it comes to fiscal \ndiscipline, the discipline that enabled us to say to a citizen, when a \ncitizen comes and says, Senator, it only costs $100 million over 10, \nwould you offer an amendment, and I would always say in the 1990s, \nwell, I have to have a ``pay for.'' I have to find an offset.\n  Not anymore. If the pay-go provisions of the Budget Act are repealed, \nas is proposed in this tax bill, no longer will that be necessary. It \nused to be I would say: Look, this is going to be tough because it is \nbeyond what we authorized in the Budget Act and to get 60 votes to \nwaive the Budget Act is going to be hard.\n  Not any longer does it appear to be difficult to waive the Budget \nAct. That discipline that enabled us to get where we are today is at \nrisk in the closing days of the 106th Congress.\n  I hope that in this election the American people will say loud and \nclear we recognize the value of that fiscal discipline. We benefited \nfrom economic growth. We benefited from lower mortgage payments. We \nbenefited from greater opportunity as a consequence of Congress getting \nits act together, all the way through the 1980s and 1990, 1993, and in \n1997.\n\n  Secondly, I have great objection, as I look at especially the tax cut \nproposal, but also the BBA give-back proposal, that we simply haven't \napplied a test of fairness. That is why it was a mistake for \nRepublicans to have a meeting with only Republicans. If you want \nsomething to be bipartisan, you have to let Democrats in the room. \nLikewise, Democrats can't hold a meeting and expect it to be bipartisan \nif we are the only ones in the room, and then go out and say: Gee, I \ndon't understand why Senator Hatch won't sign on board. It is something \nhe supported years ago. I don't understand why he won't support this. \nIt is similar to something he was talking about. The answer is, he \nwasn't in the room. He didn't have an opportunity to voice his concern. \nHe didn't have an opportunity to say what he liked or didn't like.\n  What the Republicans did is they brought something that stripped out \nthings we had agreed to, and they did not apply a test of fairness. As \na consequence, I am pleased, especially connected to the loss of fiscal \ndiscipline, that in the closing days of the 106th the President has \nindicated he is going to veto these two pieces of legislation. I think \nthe American people will be the beneficiaries of it.\n  My hope is, on both of them, that it will result in bipartisan \nnegotiation and producing something the President can sign. It can be \ndone. We don't have to run out of here over the weekend. We know \nexactly what to do. It would take us about 30 minutes to put together a \ntax bill and a BBA give-back bill that would get 80 votes on this \nfloor. We wouldn't have to sit and say, I wonder if the President is \ngoing to sign it. We would know he would sign it. If we have 80 votes, \nhe is going to sign it. The last time I checked, that is still enough \nto override a veto. But we didn't do that.\n  As a result, we are left here on October 27, 27 days beyond the time \nwe were supposed to be done and home, we are left here, still a long \nway to go before we have an agreement, a long way to go before we will \nbe able to say we have closed up shop and we have finished the people's \nbusiness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, my colleague made some pretty good points \non fairness, except we asked ``is it fair,'' too. Is it fair to allow \n3.5 million legal immigrants to be held in line so that we can take \ncare of approximately 4 million illegal immigrants? That is the point I \nwas making earlier in the day. Frankly, it is a matter I find of great \nimportance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11269-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             PRIVATE RELIEF\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 383 submitted earlier \nby Senators Lott and Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 383) extending the authorities \n     relating to the Senate National Security Working Group.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to sponsor this resolution to \nextend the authorities of the Senate National Security Working Group \nthrough December 31, 2002.\n  The Senate National Security Working Group is a bipartisan Group, \nestablished almost two years ago by myself and the Democratic Leader, \nthat seeks to shed further light on important national security topics \nof interest to the Senate and the American people. Such topics include, \nbut are not limited to: ballistic missile defenses, arms control, \nexport controls, and weapons of mass destruction.\n  During the 106th Congress, the Working Group held numerous important \nbriefings on topics of concern to the members of the Group and the \nSenate. Senior Executive branch officials from the Departments of \nDefense and State and other U.S. Government agencies appeared before \nthe Group to describe the status of and rationale for on-going \ndiplomatic discussions and formal and informal negotiations on various \nissues and to answer questions from Republican and Democratic Senators \nabout those discussions and negotiations.\n  I am certain the Administration would agree with my assessment that \nthe give-and-take in those meetings served a useful purpose.\n  In addition, I am pleased to report that members of the Group and \nstaff were able to travel overseas, as part of their official \nresponsibilities, to witness first-hand on-going diplomatic discussions \nand negotiations involving the United States, Russia, and other \nnations, and to visit certain foreign capitols for intensive \ndiscussions with foreign diplomatic and military leaders on topics of \nmutual concern. I strongly encourage the members of the Group to \ncontinue and expand this practice during the 107th Congress.\n  I am also pleased to announce that Senator Thad Cochran from my home \nstate of Mississippi has agreed to serve during the 107th Congress as \nthe Republican Administrative Co-Chairman of the Group. I appreciate \nhis willingness to once again serve in this capacity. I look forward to \nparticipating in the Group's activities beginning early next year.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to support the reauthorization of \nthe Senate's National Security Working Group--NSWG. The NSWG was \ncreated last year as the successor to the Arms Control Observer Group, \na group that had served the Senate well for over a decade.\n  Like its predecessor, the purpose of the NSWG is to be the Senate's \nnon-partisan eyes and ears on defense and national security issues. \nUnlike nearly every other group in the Senate and the Congress, the \nNational Security Working Group is composed of an equal number of \nDemocrats and Republicans. This makeup was intended to ensure the NSWG \nworked by consensus. No single Senator or political party could \ndominate the group's agenda or actions. Establishing a group with equal \nnumbers of Democrats and Republicans was also intended to signify that \nthe Senate believes the issues that come before this group are too \nimportant to be discussed in a partisan setting.\n  These were the objectives the Senate had in mind when it unanimously \napproved the legislation authorizing the formation of this important \ngroup. They remain the objectives today. Although the group worked \ntogether relatively well in the year since it was established, a number \nof us believe it could work a little bit better if we formally spelled \nout some simple rules of the road to govern the group's routine \nactivities. Therefore, at the same time we re-authorize the NSWG, I \nwould also like to insert for the record a series of administrative \nprocedures that clearly spell out how the group should conduct its \nbusiness. As put forward in these procedures, the group's \nadministrative co-chairmen must recommend travel in writing to the \nMajority and Minority leaders and both leaders must approve the travel \nrequest in writing. They encourage member participation and indicate \nthat staff travel should be the exception not the rule.\n  It is my understanding that these procedures have been agreed by both \nleaders and the majority and minority co-chairmen of the NSWG. I \nbelieve their adoption will help meet the objectives we all hold for \nthis unique and important group.\n  I ask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Administrative Procedures for the Senate National Security Working \n                                 Group\n\n       These administrative procedures govern the functioning of \n     the Senate National Security Working Group (NSWG or Working \n     Group) based on the authorizing legislation (S. Res. 75, as \n     amended) agreed to March 25, 1999. They outline the agenda-\n     setting process, travel procedures, routine functioning of \n     the Working Group, and the procedures to ensure that complete \n     records are kept in accordance with the proper use of \n     government funds.\n       1. The staff should meet regularly (once a month during \n     session), with recorded minutes. A central record of all \n     Working Group papers should be maintained (with an access \n     log) by the Office of Senate Security, with access to the \n     records open to all Working Group Members and designated \n     staff with appropriate clearances.\n       2. The Group's regular staff meetings should, if \n     appropriate, include a briefing from the Administration on \n     matters of concern to the Working Group.\n       3. These regular staff meetings should provide the forum \n     for establishing a consensus recommendation to Members of \n     agenda items for the Working Group and prospective briefings \n     and/or trips to be arranged for the Working Group. Official \n     notice of briefing to Members should be given no later than \n     seven days prior to the briefing. Official notice will be \n     issued by the Majority Administrative Co-Chairman and the \n     Minority Administrative Co-Chairman.\n       4. Any Member may propose foreign travel, but both \n     Administrative Co-Chairmen must recommend travel in writing. \n     Their letter should indicate the dates, locations, and a \n     detailed purpose of the trip, and the trip must correspond to \n     the mission of the Working Group. Pursuant to S. Res. 75 Sec. \n     2(d), written authorization of both the Majority and Minority \n     Leaders is required. Members and Staff from both sides must \n     be invited on all trips in sufficient time to be able to plan \n     for attendance. Travel should be arranged and conducted as a \n     bipartisan delegation in order to minimize administrative and \n     Host confusion.\n       5. It is the intent of the Working Group that Members \n     participate personally in the role of observer at negotiating \n     sessions (noting that neither Members nor staff are direct \n     participants in any negotiating sessions). Therefore, in \n     keeping with past practice and precedent, staff-only trips \n     are expected to be the exception, not the rule. If staff-only \n     foreign travel is determined to be necessary because no \n     Working Group Member is able to participate, the Member \n     requesting the travel must provide detailed justification to \n     the Working Group for such a request and the request should \n     go through the foreign travel approval process outlined \n     above.\n       (a) When the Working Group opts to send staff only, staff \n     shall be limited to no more than three for the Majority and \n     three for the Minority. Nothing in the foregoing is to be \n     construed as limiting the number of designated Working Group \n     staff that can travel on a Member-led official delegation. \n     Also in keeping with past precedent, staff missions may be \n     briefed by either the head of the negotiation delegation or \n     by his designee.\n       (b) In the event either Leader is unable to participate in \n     a NSWG authorized trip, that Leader may designate a Senator \n     who is not a Working Group member to travel in his or her \n     place.\n       6. Each trip must be followed by an unclassified Memorandum \n     to the Members, and, if necessary, a classified annex \n     thereto, that outlines the itinerary, briefers, and topics \n     covered in briefings. The memorandum also must be provided \n     for the official file in the Office of Senate Security.\n\n[[Page S11274]]\n\n       7. Reimbursements to eligible Members for staff expenses \n     require the signature of both Administrative Co-Chairmen and \n     require notification of designated staff by letter to the \n     Senate Financial Clerk and to both Administrative Co-\n     Chairmen. Vouchers for designated Majority staff shall be \n     administered by the Majority Administrative Co-Chairman or \n     his designee; vouchers for designated Minority staff shall be \n     administered by the Minority Administrative Co-Chairman or \n     his designee.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Energy \nCommittee be discharged from the following bill, and the Senate proceed \nen bloc to its consideration and the consideration of the following \nbill at the desk: S. 2638 from the Energy Committee and H.R. 3388.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bills by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2638) to adjust the boundaries of the Gulf \n     Islands National Seashore to include Cat Island, Mississippi.\n       A bill (H.R. 3388) to promote environmental restoration \n     around the Lake Tahoe Basin.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bills, \nen bloc.\n\n\n                             mineral rights\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Murkowski, Senator Craig \nThomas, and the members of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nfor reporting out and helping Senator Lott and me secure passage of \nSenate Bill 2638, the Cat Island authorization legislation. When \nSenator Lott and I introduced the legislation earlier this year, we \nsought to preserve the beautiful, natural treasure of Cat Island, \nMississippi, and complete the vision of the Gulf Islands National \nSeashore begun nearly 30 years ago. The passage of this legislation \nbegins this process by authorizing the National Park Service to acquire \nthe island and save it for future generations.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in our legislation, we also sought, at the \nrequest of our Mississippi State officials, to clarify the State of \nMississippi's ownership in the mineral rights underlying the Gulf \nIslands National Seashore. Mississippi conveyed much of the surface \nproperty to create the Seashore in 1972. Until recently, the National \nPark Service has conceded ownership of these subsurface rights to \nMississippi, as is reflected in the State's authorizing legislation in \n1971 and the subsequent deed signed by the Governor and other \nMississippi State officials. A copy of such deed is entered into the \nrecord with this statement. The only limitation on these rights was to \nbe the way in which any future development of them occurred, so that \nthe surface of the Seashore property would not be used for extraction \nof the minerals.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, our State officials, and we today, \nacknowledge that the Gulf Islands National Seashore should be preserved \nand protected as a place of relatively undeveloped natural beauty, and \nthat does involve limitations on minerals development but not a \nreinterpretation by the Park Service of the ownership of these mineral \nrights. These rights are important to Mississippi and may offer our \nState in the future much needed income to address education, health \ncare and other priorities for our citizens.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the bill as introduced included language \nwhich would have allowed the State of Mississippi to maintain the \nState's rights in or to any oil, gas, or other minerals through this \nacquisition. After further review of this legislation and the deed and \nrelated documents, our inclusion of the mineral rights provision was \nunnecessary, as the language was merely redundant with respect to the \ndeed of 1972. It is our understanding that the deed clearly reserves \nthe State of Mississippi's mineral rights with respect to the Gulf \nIslands National Seashore, and that no additional legislative language \non mineral rights is required in the Cat Island legislation, because \nthe State has made no conveyance with respect to Cat Island. Does the \nChairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee agree?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes, Mr. President, I agree. This legislation does not \noverturn the State of Mississippi's reservation of its mineral rights. \nThe deed asserts ownership, and this legislation does nothing to \ndiscredit such deed.\n  I thank Senator Cochran and Senator Lott for their sponsorship of \nthis legislation that will preserve Cat Island and add the last piece \nof the Mississippi Sound Barrier Islands to the Gulf Islands National \nSeashore. It is an important addition and one that will be treasured \nfor years to come.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 4351 to S. 2638\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, continuing what I was talking about \nearlier, I would like to point out I am not sure all my colleagues \nunderstand. But in this tax bill that we are going to take up tomorrow \nand next week, it has one key provision. Again, this was done with \nHouse and Senate leadership getting together and trying to figure out \nwhat was put in. It is tucked away at the very end. It is a provision \nnot listed in any summary list by the bill's backers.\n  The provision calls for the abandonment of the pay-as-you-go budget \ndiscipline which, since its initial adoption in 1990, has required all \ntax cuts and spending increases be offset with other tax increases or \nentitlement spending cuts. This provision would order the Office of \nManagement and Budget to set the PAYGO scorecard to zero instead of \nreflecting the actual cost of the tax bill in order to avoid a huge \nsequester the OMB would order, since the cost of the tax bill, if it \nbecame law, would come from the projected budget surplus rather than \nthe required offsets.\n  I understand why it is being done. I understand we cannot do it any \nother way. But that is why we should not do it. All the way through the \n1990s when we had this PAYGO provision in there, we were able to \nmaintain our fiscal discipline in spite of great pressure to do the \ncontrary. Whether it was tax cuts or spending increases that were being \nproposed, we could maintain that discipline because every time we \nbrought an amendment down here to the floor that spent more money or \ncut somebody's taxes, we had to have an offset. That is the PAYGO \nprovision. And we are going to throw it out the window, it seems to me, \nand we are going to abandon a principle that has enabled us not just to \nbalance our budget but to help produce the growth in our economy by \nkeeping the pressure off private sector borrowing that we were \ncompeting with all the way through the 1980s.\n\n  We are now paying down debt. I note Government treasuries are \nbecoming of more and more value as they become less and less available, \nand because people are sensing the economy is growing a bit flat. But \nthere is no pressure. It kept pressure off the Federal Reserve which \nkept interest rates low, grew our economy, and produced many of the \njobs for which we all take credit. So this is a substantial change in \nthe way we have conducted business previously.\n  The second point I want to make, in spite of what the Governor of \nTexas has been saying about not targeting tax provisions, that is what \nthis bill does. It targets tax provisions. Indeed, of the 119 targeted \ntax provisions--I note this amends the 1986 Tax Simplification Act. I \nthink it is the twentieth or thirtieth time we have done that since \n1986 and the principal sponsor of it, I note with great amusement, is \nCongressman Armey, who is also the No. 1 advocate for tax \nsimplification and the flat tax. But of the 119 targeted tax provisions \nin this tax bill, only one of the provisions is included in the Bush \ntax proposal.\n  This is us saying, I think appropriately, that we are going to try to \ntarget the taxes. The last thing I would say, I reiterate--I am sure \nour colleagues have seen and know the numbers in your own State about \nthe number of people who do not have health insurance for all kinds of \nreasons.\n  Mr. President, 94 percent of the tax benefits in the health insurance \ncategory go to subsidize people who already have insurance. Only 6 \npercent attempts to do what I think America has done at its finest, and \nthat is to try to push the circle of opportunity out further and \nfurther.\n  There is no doubt today there is a correlation between lack of health \ninsurance and poor health status. It is most unfortunate that, if we \nare going to do targeted tax cuts, we do not do those targeted tax cuts \nin a way that increases our confidence, that as a consequence of what \nwe are doing we will decrease the number of people in our States who \ncurrently are out there without any health insurance whatsoever.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, would the Senator from West Virginia \nallow me to have 3 minutes to comment on the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Nebraska?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I will be glad to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11279-4", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A TRIBUTE TO SENATOR KERREY\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have been remiss in not taking the \nfloor to pay tribute to the Senator from Nebraska for his service here. \nThe presentation we have had, although I disagree in some detail with \nsome of the aspects of it, demonstrates how much we will miss him. The \nSenator from Nebraska has been a key figure in the group that has been \nknown variably around here as the Centrist Coalition, or Chafee-Breaux, \nor the group that tries to get together across partisan lines and work \nthings out.\n  As I sat in the chair and listened to the Senator from Nebraska, I \nrealized if he and I could sit down in a room, between the two of us--\nand not have the White House there, and not have the leadership there \nof either House--we could arrive at a conclusion that I think he would \nbe satisfied with, I would be satisfied with, and I think would be good \nfor the country.\n  I think that comes from the fact that he has a business background \nand I have a business background. In business, you are not as \ninterested in ideology as you are in getting the thing solved.\n  So I atone for my past failure and say publicly that this body will \nmiss the Senator from Nebraska. This particular Senator considers him \nnot only a good friend but a wise legislator, and I think the country \nhas been well served as a result of his willingness to give these two \nterms to the Senate. I wish him well in whatever endeavor he undertakes \nin the future.\n  I say to the Senator from Nebraska, if he should decide to seek the \nPresidency once again, I would cheer for the Democratic Party to choose \nhim as their nominee. I may not vote for him, but I would feel more \nreassured if he were the alternative on the other side.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Senator very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11279-5", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11279-S11281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE COMMERCE-JUSTICE-STATE BILL\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, earlier today I voted for the conference \nreport\n\n[[Page S11280]]\n\non the Commerce-Justice-State bill, which was included with the D.C. \nappropriations bill. Both those bills were in the same conference \nreport. I voted in favor of those measures. But the CJS measure was, in \nactuality, a seriously flawed piece of legislation with a number of \nproblems attendant to it.\n  The first problem that I had with it was that it was a conference \nreport, and thus it was not subject to amendment. The underlying \nappropriations bills went straight from the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee to the conference committee, totally bypassing the Senate \nfloor. The full Senate was afforded no opportunity to debate or amend \nthese two appropriations bills. These are not the first appropriations \nbills to be herded through Congress in this fashion this year, but that \nfact does not make the practice any less objectionable. It is a simple \ncase of cutting corners in the name of political expediency, a \npractice in which the United States Senate should not engage.\n\n  Second, the Commerce, Justice, State bill includes a controversial \nimmigration rider, the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act, a scaled \ndown spinoff of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. The Senate dealt \nwith this issue last month during consideration of the H-1B visa bill, \nwhen it refused to consider the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. I \nopposed suspending the rules to allow that measure to be offered as an \namendment to the H-1B visa bill because I believe that such legislation \nsends the wrong message to those who might consider entering this \ncountry illegally. I believed then, as I believe today, that granting \namnesty to aliens who are in this country illegally simply encourages \nothers to enter the country illegally.\n  Although the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act would grant amnesty \nto a smaller group of illegal aliens, it creates the same problems as \nthe Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act by rewarding illegal aliens for \nbreaking U.S. law. It should make no difference whether we grant \namnesty to one million illegal aliens or only a handful of that number. \nThe principle is the same. Amnesty for illegal immigration sends the \nwrong message, period. Worse, these bills are an affront to those \nimmigrants who have played by the rules, often waiting many years \nbefore being allowed to settle here legally.\n  I am opposed to the sending of these mixed signals by Congress. It is \ncounterproductive for the United States to vigorously protect its long \nand porous borders from illegal aliens--at great expense to the \ntaxpayers, I might add--while at the same time granting amnesty to \nselected groups of those aliens who manage to cross the border \nundetected or otherwise enter the country under false pretenses. The \nSenate should not endorse an immigration policy that rewards aliens who \nviolate the law.\n  I realize that my views are at odds with a number of my colleagues, \nand I respect their position. I respect their viewpoints, and I would \nbe very happy to debate the merits of new immigration legislation with \nthem at the proper time and on the proper vehicle. This was not the \nproper time, and this conference report was not the proper vehicle. \nNeither the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act nor the Legal Immigration \nFamily Equity Act has been considered by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, which has jurisdiction over immigration issues. No hearings \nhave been held. No report has been issued by the Committee so that \nother senators can better understand the implication of these bills. No \nfull scale debate has been aired.\n  The Commerce-Justice-State conference report could not be amended. It \nwas a take-it-or-leave-it-package. Controversial immigration \nlegislation that the Senate refused to consider once this year as an \namendment to an immigration bill should not be resurrected under any \nguise as a legislative rider on an unamendable appropriations \nconference report.\n  Finally, I am concerned with executive branch meddling on this \nconference report. The President has said he will veto the conference \nreport because the immigration rider does not go far enough. He wants \nthe broader Latino and Immigrant Fairness legislation on this \nappropriations bill. This is the same President who has been \ncomplaining bitterly about legislative riders on other appropriations \nbills. This is the same President who vetoed the Energy and Water \nappropriations conference report because it contained an environmental \nrider to which he objected. This is the same President who berated \nCongress for including legislative riders along with supplemental \nfunding provisions attached to the Military Construction appropriations \nbill. This is a President who has made it clear time and again that he \nobjects to legislative riders on appropriations bill, and yet he has \nvowed to veto this conference report because the legislative rider it \ncontains does not go far enough to suit him.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has a responsibility to complete its work--\nnot avoid its work or compromise its work, but complete its work. This \nconference report is an example of how not to complete the Senate's \nbusiness. The Commerce-Justice-State bill funds many vitally important \nprograms, and that is why I voted for it. It is a bill that can and \nshould stand on its own merits. It should not be hamstrung by \nlegislative riders or election year politics.\n  Mr. President, the problems that I have cited with this conference \nreport are not a reflection on the Senate Appropriations Committee. \nChairman Ted Stevens has done yeoman's work this year to shield the \nappropriations process from both the Democratic and Republican \npolitical agendas.\n  I can compliment equally all of the members of the Appropriations \nCommittee in this respect--the Republicans who chaired the \nsubcommittees and the Democrats who were the ranking members. They all \nworked together, as they always do. There is no partisanship when it \ncomes to the Appropriations Committee. Republicans and Democrats work \ntogether and politics is off the table. That was the case when I was \nchairman of that committee, and that has been the case since when \nformer Senator Hatfield was chairman and now Senator Ted Stevens of \nAlaska. Senator Stevens and I resisted mightily the sledgehammer \napproach that was used to bring this and other appropriations \nconference reports to the floor. Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings, \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Commerce-Justice-State \nSubcommittee, labored diligently to complete work on their bill and \nbring it to the floor under its own steam. No, the problem with this \nconference report is not the fault of the Committee but is the result \nof a breakdown in the legislative system that has seeped--seeped--\nthrough the appropriations process this year. The appropriations bills \nare the victims of this breakdown, not the cause of it.\n  It does not have to be this way, and it should not be this way. The \nSenate is fully capable of doing its work in an orderly and disciplined \nmanner, capable of drafting, debating, and passing 13 individual \nappropriations bills, and of completing a separate legislative agenda.\n  Sadly, that is not to be the case this year. Congress is limping \nslowly toward a long overdue adjournment, leaving behind a trail of \nunfinished business and the wreckage of the appropriations process. Mr. \nPresident, I hope this sorry spectacle will never be repeated. I hope \nthat the clean slate of a new Congress will bring a fresh perspective \nto next year's appropriations process. I hope and I pray that next year \nwill be different.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished minority whip, Mr. Reid, for \nhis never-failing attendance to the business of the Senate.\n  The Bible says: ``Seest now a man diligent in his business? He will \nstand before kings.'' Senator Reid is always diligent in his business. \nI appreciate his arranging for me to have this time. He is thoroughly \ndependable and always courteous and considerate to me and to all other \nSenators. I commend him for it. The people of his State have every \nright to be proud of him as their senior Senator. And we on our side of \nthe aisle have every right to be proud of him as the minority whip.\n  Mr. REID. If I could say to my friend, before he leaves the floor, I \njust came from the studio where I did a little TV thing because we are \nnow not going to be able to be in Nevada next week. Senator Bryan and I \njoined together to name a hospital for the most decorated soldier from \nNevada who served in\n\n[[Page S11281]]\n\nWorld War II, a man by the name of Jack Streeter, who is alive.\n  It is amazing, as I went through this American hero's record--seven \nSilver Stars, two Bronze Stars, five Purple Hearts--now, I know that \nthe Senator from West Virginia, his medals have not been on the field \nof battle in Germany like my friend Jack Streeter, but I was thinking, \nas the Senator was talking to me--I am the minority whip. Of course, \nthis is one of the lesser positions the Senator from West Virginia has \nheld.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has been whip, majority leader, \nminority leader more than once, and in addition to that, the honor that \nmost people would feel they had fulfilled their career with, of being \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  So I say to my friend publicly, as I have said privately, what an \nhonor it is to be able to serve with one of the legends, in his own \ntime, of the Senate: Robert Byrd. There are not many Senators that you \nthink of as being so closely connected with the Senate as Robert Byrd. \nWe have the Calhouns and we have a few people whose names come to our \nmind, but Robert Byrd is someone, when the history books are written, \nwill always be mentioned as one of the all-time leaders of the \ncongressional process. What a great honor it is to be able to serve \nwith the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Mark Twain said he could live for 2 weeks on \na good compliment. The compliment that the distinguished Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Reid, has just paid me can help me to survive for quite a \nlong time. I shall not forget it. His words are a bit embellished, but \nI am deeply appreciative of what he has said.\n  I appreciate it very much. I thank him again for his good work every \nday on the floor of the Senate. Having been whip, I know when we have a \ngood one. And Senator Reid is here, looking after the Senate's \nbusiness, and always very attendant upon our every need. I am ready to \nvote for him again any time. He does not have to look me up and find \nout if I am still for him.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Just one last comment while we are throwing compliments \naround this late Friday afternoon.\n  I can remember when I went and spoke to Senator Byrd, and he \nindicated he would support me 2 years ago for this job. And I wrote him \na letter. I can very clearly remember writing it. It took a little time \nin thinking of what I wanted to say. In that letter I said that as far \nas I was concerned he was the Babe Ruth of the Senate. I don't know if \nyou remember that letter, but that is what I said.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I remember that letter.\n  Mr. REID. With Babe Ruth, you always think of the best baseball \nplayer. And when you think of Robert Byrd, you think of the best player \nin the Senate. Thank you.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I believe it was September, in 1927, when Babe Ruth \nbeat his own former record of 59 home runs. In 1927, he swatted 60 home \nruns.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Byrd, I can remember, as if it were yesterday, you \nasked me one weekend--\n  Mr. BYRD. I believe that was September 30, 1927. And I believe it was \non the 22nd of September 1927 that Jack Dempsey and Gene Tunney fought \na fight in which--we who lived in the coalfields hoped Jack Dempsey \nwould win back his title, but he did not win it back. That was the \noccasion of the ``long count.''\n  It was in May of that year that Lindbergh flew across the ocean in \nthe Spirit of St. Louis. Sometimes he was 10 feet above the water; \nsometimes he was 10,000 feet above the water. And his plane had a load, \nwhich I remember, of about 500 pounds. He carried five sandwiches, and \nate one-half of a sandwich.\n  I remember reading in the New York Times about that historic flight. \nHe said he flew over, I believe, what was Newfoundland, at the great \nspeed of 100 miles per hour--at a great speed, 1927.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Byrd, I do not want to put you on the spot here, \nbut I can remember returning from one of my trips in Nevada, and we had \na conversation. You asked me what I had done, and I said, I hadn't read \na particular book in 25 years. And I picked up the book ``Robinson \nCrusoe'' to read about Robinson Crusoe. You said to me: I know how long \nhe was on that island. I just read the book, and you told me. And I had \nto go home and check to see if you were right, and you were right, to \nthe day.\n  Mr. BYRD. I believe that was 28 years, 2 months, and 19 days.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I have not forgotten that.\n  Mr. BYRD. I believe that is right.\n  Mr. REID. I went home and checked, and I will do it again. I am \nconfident you are right.\n  Mr. BYRD. All right. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11281-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11281-S11283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE LATINO IMMIGRANT AND FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my good friend from West Virginia talked \nabout his opposition to the provision in the bill dealing with Latino \nimmigrant fairness. He and I have had a number of conversations about \nthat. I, of course, respect his views as were just laid out here, his \nfeelings on that piece of legislation.\n  Briefly, I would just say about this legislation that the Republicans \nhave chosen to ignore what we felt is something that is very important. \nWe have tried to have hearings. We have tried to do legislation on \nthis. Simply, we were ignored.\n  We, of course, have met with our counterparts in the House. And they \nfeel strongly about this. They have been ignored, just as we have over \nhere. We have received the support of the administration to help us in \ncrafting legislation that would protect what we believe is a basic \ntenet of American justice.\n  They have decided to ignore our bill and those who support it, and \nhave decided to include their own immigration bill. The President has \nhad no choice but to do this drastic maneuvering measure. We have \ntried, time and time again, to bring this bill to the floor, and it is \nalways met by the other side's intransigence.\n  We have a simple goal: One of fairness. We want one set of rules for \nall refugees and immigrants. And we offer a clear plan to correct \nserious flaws in our immigration code. Meanwhile, the majority is \ntrying to cloud the issues, distort our bill, and create an intricate \nmaze that helps very few.\n  The current system is unworkable and unfair. Out plan aims to correct \nflaws in the current unworkable and biased immigration rules. For \ninstance:\n  There is one set of rules for Cubans and Nicaraguan refugees who fled \nleft-wing dictatorships; and another, far stricter set of rules for \nrefugees from Central America, the Caribbean, and Liberia who fled \nother dictatorships;\n  Because Congress failed to renew Section 245(i), families who have a \nright to be together here in the U.S. are being torn apart, sometimes \nfor up to 10 years; They are forced to leave their families and can't \ncome back for 10 years. They haven't done anything illegal.\n  Because of past Congressional action and bureaucratic bungling, some \npeople who were eligible for a legalization program enacted in 1986 are \nnow U.S. citizens; while others are facing deportation.\n  Democrats want a simple set of fair rules that make sense and clean \nup the immigration code.\n  We want to establish legal parity between Central American, Liberian \nand Caribbean refugees so that all refugees who fled political turmoil \nin the 1990s are treated the same.\n  We want to renew 245(i). This provision, which has allowed all family \nmembers of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents to adjust their \nstatus while in the U.S., has been allowed to expired. Our proposal \nwould renew it and allow all immigrants who have a legal right to \nbecome permanent residents to apply for their green cards in the U.S. \nand remain here with their families while they wait for a decision.\n  The registry date would allow all persons who came to the U.S. before \n1986 to be eligible to adjust their status. This provision has been \nregularly updated since enactment in 1929 but has not been updated \nsince 1972.\n  Republicans now agree that Congress should help some immigrants, but \ntheir proposal provides no relief on parity, little on 245(i), and even \nless on the registry date.\n\n[[Page S11282]]\n\n  When you read the fine print, their immigration proposals don't fix \nwhat is broken in our immigration code.\n  Instead, the majority wants to continue to pick and choose between \nimmigrants and which countries they should come from--rewarding some, \ndenying others, with no just cause.\n  We want a simple, fair, family unification policy. That's what we're \nproposing. That's what we'll fight for. That's what Congress must do \nbefore we adjourn.\n  The main reason I came to the floor today is to respond to my friend \nfrom Idaho who came to the floor to talk about some of the things the \nVice President said that were exaggerations, according to him. I would \nlike to comment on some of the statements he made. This is a difficult \ngame. The game is that these men go around giving a lot of statements, \nBush and Gore. And they should be held to the same standard. What is \nthat standard? Listen to everything they say.\n  Now, we know from an October 23 Washington Post in a column written \nby Michael Kinsley entitled ``The Emperor's New Brain'' that:\n\n       George W. Bush's handling of the stupidity issue has been \n     nothing short of brilliant. A Martian watching the last \n     presidential debate might have concluded that this man would \n     be well-advised not to put quite so much emphasis on mental \n     testing.\n\n  This has been raised by the Senator from Idaho, and I am happy to \nrespond. The same article says:\n\n       But if George W. Bush isn't a moron, he is a man of \n     impressive intellectual dishonesty and/or confusion. His \n     utterances frequently make no sense on their own terms. His \n     policy recommendations are often internally inconsistent and \n     mutually contradictory.\n\n  He further states:\n\n       When he repeatedly attacks his opponents for \n     ``partisanship,'' does he get the joke? When he blames the \n     absence of a federal patients' rights law on ``a lot of \n     bickering in Washington, D.C.,'' has he noticed that the \n     bickering consists of his own party which controls Congress, \n     blocking the legislation? When he summarizes, ``It's kind of \n     like a political issue as opposed to a people issue,'' does \n     he mean to suggest anything in particular? Perhaps that \n     politicians, when acting politically, ignore the wishes of \n     the people?\n       In the debate, he declared, ``I don't want to use food as a \n     diplomatic weapon from this point forward. We shouldn't be \n     using food. It hurts the farmers. It's not the right thing to \n     do.'' When, just a few days later, he criticized legislation \n     weakening the trade embargo on Cuba--which covers food along \n     with everything else--had he rethought his philosophy on the \n     issue? Or was there nothing to rethink.\n\n  The article ends by saying:\n\n       In short, does George W. Bush mean what he says, or does he \n     understand it? The answer can't be both. And is both too much \n     to ask for?\n\n  My friend from Idaho talked about some things that Al Gore had said \nover the years. We will talk about those in a minute. He said he was \nhere because of some of the statements I made. I didn't make any \nstatements. I came here without any editorial comment other than saying \nI was quoting direct, verbatim statements made by Gov. George Bush.\n  I am not going to go through the 20-odd pages of ``Bushisms\" or \nwhatever you want to call them. I am going to talk about a few that \nobviously got the attention of my friend from Idaho.\n  Florence, SC, January 11, 2,000:\n\n       Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?\n\n  New York Times, October 23:\n\n       The important question is, How many hands have I shaked?\n\n  Concord, NH, January 29:\n\n       Will the highways on the Internet become more few?\n\n  Nashua, NH:\n\n       I know how hard it is for you to put food on your family.\n\n  New York Daily News, February 19:\n\n       I understand small business growth. I was one.\n\n  LaCrosse, WI, October 18, a few days ago:\n\n       Families is where our nation finds hope, where wings take \n     dream.\n  Same day, WI:\n\n       Drug therapies are replacing a lot of medicines as we used \n     to know it.\n\n  Saginaw, MI, September 29, a few weeks ago:\n\n       I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully.\n\n  Redwood, CA, September 27:\n\n       I will have a foreign-handed foreign policy.\n\n  On the Oprah show:\n\n       I am a person who recognizes the fallacy of humans.\n\n  As I said, I have talked about some of the things he has said. I \nhaven't in any way changed a single word, a single paragraph, a single \nspelling. I just quoted directly. This is a man who is running for \nPresident of the United States. I think it is something we need to \nconsider, especially in light of the fact that on Wednesday, the Rand \ncommission came out with a study. The Rand commission is bipartisan. \nThey are widely respected. They are independent. Basically what they \nsaid is that all the claims that Governor Bush has made about education \nin Texas, how it has improved, simply are false, not true. Then we have \nthe next day, on Thursday, the Actuary Commission came out and said \nthat if you took into consideration all of the things that Governor \nBush wanted to do with Social Security and taxes, it would, in effect, \nbankrupt the country.\n  I think we have to recognize that Governor Bush is talking about some \nreal big whoppers, if the Senator from Idaho wants to talk about \nwhoppers.\n  In fact, the Wall Street Journal, which is deemed by some to be the \nnewspaper of the Republican Party, had in a news story, dated October \n12 of the year 2000, a headline saying ``The Biggest Whopper: The Bush \nTax Cut.''\n  Among other things, the article says:\n\n       Writing before last night's debate, the winner for the \n     biggest exaggeration is easy: George W. Bush and his tax cut.\n       The GOP nominee claims his tax measure principally will \n     help the working poor and middle-class Americans. The rich, \n     he says, will get a smaller percentage than they currently \n     do, and the tax plan comfortably fits with projected budget \n     surpluses and his Social Security plans.\n       None of that is true.\n       Instead of making the case that a huge tax cut is necessary \n     to reward the productive elements of society who will make \n     the investments that ultimately benefit everyone, Mr. Bush \n     misrepresents the size and shape of his proposal. He suggests \n     that after setting aside half of the 10-year surplus for \n     Social Security, he will divide the rest between tax cuts and \n     initiatives in areas like education, health care and defense. \n     In truth, he proposes over $1.3 trillion in tax cuts and less \n     than $500 billion for those other initiatives, not including \n     $196 billion of unspecified reductions in discretionary \n     spending.\n\n  The biggest whopper:\n\n       The Bush claim that his tax cut not only doesn't reward the \n     rich but actually makes them pay more is really phony.\n\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       The Republican nominee has been unsparing in his criticism \n     of the Clinton-Gore administration's defense spending, \n     claiming more needs to be done on pay, readiness and missile \n     defense. Yet over the decade, the Gore budget envisions \n     spending $55 million more than Mr. Bush proposes. Why? The \n     Texan can't afford it, given his tax cuts.\n       The press has tripped all over itself to praise Mr. Bush \n     for suggesting a ``solution'' to long-term Social Security \n     with partial privatization. Yet unlike the serious Social \n     Security proposals--such as Senators Pat Moynihan and Bob \n     Kerrey--Mr. Bush insists he can do this without any cuts in \n     Social Security benefits.\n\n  Of course, Mr. President, that is indicated in the study by the \nactuaries as absolutely impossible; it can't be done. And ``In His Own \nWords'' in the New York Thursday, October 26, 2000, there were remarks \nout of Sanford, Florida, where George W. Bush said:\n\n       They're trying to say, you know, old George W. is going to \n     take away your check. But I'm going to set aside $2.4 \n     trillion of Social Security surplus.\n\n  On October 17, in the debate, here is what he said:\n\n       . . . And one of my promises is going to be Social Security \n     reform. And you bet we need to take a trillion dollar--a \n     trillion dollars out of that $2.4 trillion surplus.\n\n  Well, he heads to Florida and then increases it by $1.4 trillion. \nWith all due respect, I am not sure that the good Governor understands. \nAccording to people who have studied the issue, he doesn't. You can't \ndo both. You can't cut Social Security and think that those moneys that \nare set aside to pay benefits can also be taken out to put into \nprivatization. It won't work.\n  My friend from Idaho said today that one of the things that Al Gore \nis considered to be untruthful about is his statement that he was \ninvolved in the authorship of the book that was made into a great movie \nby Erich Segal called Love Story. He is saying it is simply untrue that \nAl Gore had anything to do with that. But understand that the author of \nthe book, who I think should have some foundation to\n\n[[Page S11283]]\n\nspeak about the book he wrote, says that his protagonist, Oliver Barret \nIV--the man in Love Story--was partly based on Mr. Gore. Now, that is a \nfact. Erich Segal, the author, said that his protagonist in the book \nLove Story, Oliver Barret IV, was based on Albert Gore. So what my \nfriend from Idaho said, and what others have said, cannot contradict \nwhat the author of the book has said.\n  Talking about exaggerations and misstatements, look at the Seattle \nPost-Intelligencer on October 4 of this year. Byline, Paul Krugman. He \nsays:\n\n       I really, truly wasn't planning to write any more columns \n     about George W. Bush's arithmetic. But his performance on \n     ``Moneyline'' last Wednesday was just mind-blowing. I had to \n     download a transcript to convince myself that I had really \n     heard him correctly.\n       It was as if Bush aides had prepared him with a memo \n     saying: ``You've said some things on the stump that weren't \n     true. Your mission, in the few minutes you have, is to repeat \n     all those things. Don't speak in generalities--give specific \n     false numbers. That'll show them.''\n       First, Bush talked about the budget--``There's about $4.6 \n     trillion of surplus projected,'' he declared, which is true, \n     even if the projections are dubious. He went on to say: ``I \n     want some of the money, nearly a trillion, to go to projects \n     like prescription drugs for seniors. Money to strengthen the \n     military to keep the peace. I've got some views about \n     education around the world. I want to--you know, I've got \n     some money in there for the environment.''\n\n  Figure that one out, if you can.\n  Mr. President, further in the New York Times of October 11, a man by \nthe name of Paul Krugman writes a column, and the heading is: ``A \nRetirement Fable; No Fuzzy Numbers Needed.''\n  Among other things, he says:\n\n       Mr. Bush has made an important political discovery. Really \n     big misstatements, it turns out, cannot be effectively \n     challenged, because voters can't believe that a man who seems \n     so likable would do that sort of thing. In last week's debate \n     Mr. Bush again declared that he plans to spend a quarter of \n     the surplus on popular new programs, even though his own \n     budget shows he plans to spend less than half that much. . . \n     .And he insists that he has a plan to save Social Security, \n     when his actual proposal, as it stands, would bankrupt the \n     system.\n\n  Michael Kinsley, in the Washington Post, on the 24th, a couple days \nago, says, among other things, referring to Bush:\n\n       His utterances frequently make no sense in their own terms. \n     His policy recommendations are often internally inconsistent \n     and mutually contradictory. Because it's harder to explain \n     and prove, intellectual dishonesty doesn't get the attention \n     that petty fibbing does, even though intellectual dishonesty \n     indicts both a candidate's character and his policy \n     positions. All politicians. . .get away with more of it than \n     they should. But George W. gets away with an extraordinary \n     amount of it.\n\n  He continues to say.\n\n       . . .he'll get the trillion dollars needed for his partial \n     privatization ``out of the surplus.'' Does he not understand \n     that the current surplus is committed to future benefits, \n     which will have to be cut to make the numbers work? Or does \n     he understand and not care?\n\n  Kinsley further says:\n\n       When he repeatedly attacks his opponent for \n     ``partisanship,'' does he get the joke? When he blames the \n     absence of a federal patients' rights law on ``a lot of \n     bickering in Washington, DC,'' has he noticed that the \n     bickering consists of his own party, which controls Congress, \n     blocking the legislation?\n\n  Also, if we are talking about people who misstate things, let's \nreally put a magnifying glass on some of the things that the Governor \nhas said. In last week's debate, Gore described his own education plan, \nbut Bush said that the ``three'' men convicted in the murder of James \nByrd, a black man dragged to his death from his pickup truck, will \nreceive the death penalty. That is not quite true. One faces life \nimprisonment. Bush took credit for expanding a child's health insurance \nprogram in Texas. He took credit in the debate for working with the \nDemocrats to get a Patients' Bill of Rights. He vetoed that. And then \nhe says we have a provision to allow lawsuits. He didn't sign that.\n  Mr. President, we hear a lot about how the Vice President has been \ninvolved in the Russian situation. And he has. He has done a good deal \nto work out differences between the two nations--the former Soviet \nUnion and now Russia. The Vice President has had extensive experience \nworking on that. One of the people he worked with was Prime Minister \nChernomyrdin, who he didn't pick, the Russian government picked him. In \nthis debate--we all heard it--and I will get the citations from the \nWashington Post, byline by Howard Kurtz and others. He said:\n\n       Money from the International Monetary Funded wound up in \n     the pocket of former Russian Prime Minister Viktor \n     Chernomyrdin. Chernomyrdin has been linked to corruption.\n\n  Experts say there is no proof he received any IMF money.\n  Further, Bush said that our European friends would put troops on the \nground in the Balkans, where the bulk of the peacekeeping forces are in \nBosnia and Kosovo. Bush also cited Haiti as example of a country from \nwhich the U.S. should withdraw its troops, when in fact all but 100 \ntroops have left.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho said he will be back Monday \nafternoon. I am happy to visit with him on the statements that the \nGovernor of the State of Texas has made. I didn't make them, he made \nthem. I simply came to the Senate floor to discuss with the American \npeople what he has said:\n\n       I am a person who recognizes the fallacy of humans.\n       Drug therapies are replacing a lot of medicines as we used \n     to know it.\n       I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully.\n       I will have a foreign-handed foreign policy.\n       Families is where our nation finds hope, where wings take \n     dream.\n       I understand small business growth.. I was one.\n       Will the highways on the Internet become more few?\n       I know how hard it is for you to put food on your family.\n       Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?\n       The important question is, how many hands have I shaked?\n\n  These are statements made by the Governor of the State of Texas.\n  Anytime anyone wants to come and talk to me about the statements made \nby the Governor of the State of Texas, I am happy to do it. I didn't \nmake them up. I am quoting them directly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, I want to first commend my colleague, \nfriend, Senator Reid from Nevada, for not only his statement but his \nleadership in this body to try to move the process along. \nUnfortunately, we have reached an impasse.\n  We have sent to the President an appropriations bill for the \nCommerce- State-Justice Departments which will be vetoed because of \nglaring deficiencies in that bill.\n  We are holding in abeyance for the moment a conference report which \nnot only deals with Medicare readjustments because of the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997, but also contains provisions dealing with assisted \nsuicide--a hodgepodge of issues, all of which will, once again, elicit \na Presidential veto.\n  Let me just speak for a moment about this pending bill, although in \nsome respects it defies description. It is more of an accumulation of \ndifferent ideas thrown together to get out of town. But part of it \ndeals with Medicare and balanced budget refinement proposals.\n  All of us in this body for the last several years have been pointing \nout some of the consequences--many of then unintended--of the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 with respect to Medicare reimbursement in an effort \nto make sure that our health care system continues to be vibrant and \ncontinues to be sustainable. And we are resolved to try to address \nthese issues and in a bipartisan way.\n  But we have found ourselves with a very partisan approach--an \napproach that has not included any of my Democratic colleagues on the \nFinance Committee, and has included no real participation by the \nDemocrats in this body at all with respect to issues that are of \nconcern to all of us which should be dealt with on a bipartisan basis.\n  As a result, we are faced with legislation that comes to us which is \nterribly distorted and terribly slanted, and which will not deal with \nthe real crisis we face. In fact, many health care providers, such as \nhospitals, home health care agencies, hospice agencies, nursing homes, \nand others are literally\n\n[[Page S11284]]\n\nbeing shortchanged in the process where a significant and inordinate \namount of money is going to HMOs that operate Medicare managed care \nplans.\n  These are the same HMOs that abruptly, in many cases, withdrew from \nthe market because they could not make their margins--that walked out \non seniors. And, in effect, we are rewarding them for abandoning \nseniors and walking away from them by giving them a huge amount of \nmoney with the presumption, of course, that this money will be passed \non to the providers who care for our elderly and disabled. That is not \nthe case at all.\n  With respect to the not-for-profit HMOs, their first instincts will \nbe to build up their reserves and continue to negotiate very tough \nreimbursements with hospitals and nursing homes. In some cases, they \nare the only game in town. They can go to a hospital or a nursing home \nor a home health agency, and say: These are the terms--take it or leave \nit. But their goal will not be simply passing on the generosity of the \nFederal Government to providers--the people actually giving the care. \nIt will be to enhance their own financial positions by continuing to \nput aside money for the proverbial rainy day.\n  When it comes to the for-profit HMOs, their incentive is not only to \nenhance their financial position because that is what enhances their \nstock price in the market, but also to provide dividends to their \nshareholders. After all, they are profit-making enterprises.\n\n  I think it is entirely fallacious to believe that by simply giving \nmoney to HMOs for seniors, with no accountability and no requirements, \nthey will in return provide coverage. Simply giving them the money is \nthe wrong way to ensure that our seniors and disabled receive adequate \nhealth care.\n  That is precisely the path that has been chosen in this partisan \nRepublican legislation that we will see in the days ahead.\n  We would like to see Medicare managed care plans succeed. We would \nlike to see that happen. But we can't simply wish by giving them money \nthat they will change the practices they have pursued over the last \nseveral years.\n  When they looked at the situation, when they thought they were not \ngetting the kind of return and the kind of profits they should in these \nprograms, they simply walked away.\n  Yet we are not requiring them even with this great infusion of money \nto commit to stay the course for our seniors. It is the wrong approach.\n  The right approach--the approach that was advocated very forcefully \nby my colleagues on the Finance Committee on the Democratic side--is to \nprovide additional reimbursements and additional support for the actual \nproviders--the hospitals, the hospice agencies, and home health \nagencies--all of the agencies that are struggling just to stay afloat \nand to stay viable.\n  In particular, we have seen over the course of the last several years \nwith respect to home health agencies that many have gone out of \nbusiness because of severe cuts in the reimbursements. We originally \nestimated that $16.1 billion would be saved over five years. It turns \nout that we have already saved $19. 7 billion in just two years and are \non track to save four times what we originally projected. It is about \ntime to put the money back in to these important activities.\n  Yet, that is not what this bill would do. As I mentioned before, this \nconference report contains several last minute additions coming from \nthe outfield, including the misnamed Pain Relief Promotion Act, which \nis an attempt to undercut the legislation and the will of the people of \nOregon with respect to the very sensitive issue of assisted suicide.\n  I strongly disapprove of assisted suicide. I am pleased that my State \nof Rhode Island has, in fact, adopted legislation that outlaws this \npractice but still makes the prescription of drugs by physicians for \nthe purposes of alleviating pain a medical matter and not a law \nenforcement matter.\n  The fallacy of the approach embodied in the Pain Relief Promotion Act \nis to take the Drug Enforcement Agency and make it the arbiter of good \nmedical practice. I can't think of a more inappropriate combination of \ninstitutions and functions than that. But that has been thrown into the \nmix in this conference report.\n  We have been endeavoring over many months to come up with bipartisan \nsolutions to these issues of Medicare reimbursement and of the \nrestoration of funds that were cut in 1997 under the Balanced Budget \nAct. But it has come to naught so far.\n  I hope that in the next few days in anticipation of a Presidential \nveto there will be a second or third or fourth look at these issues and \nwe can try to deal with them in a thoughtful and constructive way.\n  One particular issue is the fact that we face a further 15-percent \nreduction in home health care reimbursement rates, which is currently \nscheduled to take effect in October of 2001.\n  We already know that these agencies cannot sustain such a further \nreduction. But the only thing that this bill does is temporarily delay \nit for another year.\n  I have joined with many of my colleagues, including Senator Collins \nof Maine, to suggest the elimination of this 15-percent cut because \nagencies have to know not only that they have a 1-year reprieve, but \nthey can plan with some confidence for the years ahead, and that they \nwon't face such a further draconian cut in their reimbursement.\n  It is the only way they can attract the kind of financial lending \nsupport they need to cover expenses. It is the businesslike thing to \ndo.\n  That is another irony. For a party that styles themselves as \nconscious of the business community and knowledgeable of the ways of \nbusiness, the massive distribution of funds to HMOs defy the logic of \nboth the not-for-profit and for-profit HMO because they will not pass \nthem on. They will either disgorge them to their shareholders as \nprofits or they will put them aside so that their ratings and their \nfinancing will be that much more secure when they are raided by outside \ngroups.\n  So this legislation is not only unhelpful for the people who need the \nhelp, the providers and ultimately the seniors, but it is, I think, \ncontradictory to the obvious business practices that will be undertaken \nby the HMOs and others who receive these great funds.\n  I suggest, again, we go back to the table, that we look hard at all \nthese proposed solutions to the problems engendered by the 1997 \nBalanced Budget Act in regard to Medicare, and that we strive for a \nbipartisan approach that will get the money to the providers who give \nthe care to the seniors. If we do that, we are going to make great \nprogress. If we don't do that, we will be back here again next week \ndealing with another proposal after a Presidential veto.\n  Now that is just one aspect of what has been transpiring in this \nbody, one aspect of the impasse we face.\n  Today we sent to the President legislation providing appropriations \nfor Commerce, Justice, and State Departments. What we did not send \nforth was legislation that would include the Latino Fairness Act, that \nwould include, also, fairness for other groups.\n  One group in particular of which I have been very supportive is the \nLiberian community in the United States. I have heard my colleagues on \nthe other side say the reason we are not doing this is because we will \nnot engage in country-specific relief in our immigration laws. That is \nnonsense. We have had country-specific relief. We have had it \nthroughout the history of this country. One just has to look at the \nCuban community in this country to see very specific and very helpful \ncountry-specific relief in terms of the rules of immigration, rules of \nestablishing permanent residence.\n  Also, people suggested we don't want to legitimize people who come \nhere illegally and stay here illegally without the color of law. In the \ncase of the Liberian community, these individuals have been recognized \nand allowed to stay here under temporary protective status issued first \nby President Bush and continued subsequently. Now, however, they face \ndeportation because their TPS status has lapsed. They are now under a \nstatus called deferred enforced departure--still legal status, allowing \nthem not only to stay here but also to work. So this is a group of \npeople who are legally recognized to be here, and they have the same \nrights, I believe, or should have the same rights, as everyone else.\n\n[[Page S11285]]\n\n  This whole issue with respect to Liberians, with respect to Latinos--\nreally, hundreds of thousands who have come here; many have been here \nfor decades or more--who are part of our economy, just as all of those \nhigh-tech workers whom we labored so diligently to accommodate under \nthe H-1B visa program. In fact, in places such as Nevada, the home of \nmy colleague, Senator Reid, the business communities are asking us to \npass the Latino fairness bill because it is their workers who are \naffected by not being recognized or allowed to establish permanent \nresidence.\n  I think we can do much more and should do much more. This discussion \nleads invariably to a litany of lost opportunities and partisan action \nwhich undercuts the very brave language of Governor Bush who talks \nabout bipartisanship. Certainly we haven't seen any bipartisanship \nhere. We haven't seen a great deal of leadership here on issues that \nare important to all of us and are particularly important to the \nAmerican people.\n  If we finish next week simply by adopting the remaining \nappropriations bills, we will have neglected to deal with the real \nissues that the American people have demanded of us for months and \nmonths and months. There will be no prescription drug benefit for \nseniors. Yet I hazard a guess that each and every one of us has gone \nback to our States and talked with fervor and passion about how \ncritical it is these seniors have access to a Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit. Yet that is not likely to happen. Another lost \nopportunity, another missed chance at the issue, another disappointment \nto the legitimate hopes of the American people that we would work \ntogether and accomplish something for them.\n  We have not enacted a meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights. Yet for \nmonths and months and months we have been talking about it. We have \nseen our colleagues in the other body pass a bipartisan Patients' Bill \nof Rights. Yet in this body it has languished, and its days are now \nnumbered. So we will not have, for the American people, something they \nwant: Simply to be able to get from their managed care organization the \nbenefits they thought they were entitled to and that their employer \ntypically thought he or she had paid for. But we are not doing that \nbecause in this body we didn't pass a real Patients' Bill of Rights. We \npassed a sham. My collages hoped that sham would be enough of a \ndiversion so the American people will forget what we failed to \naccomplish.\n  Education reform. Governor Bush is talking about education and \ntouting his record of education. The Rand study has showed some \nevidence that is not really a record of success but it is a record of \nless than success. We haven't even gotten around to doing the routine \nbusiness of the Congress. This is the first time in decades we have \nfailed to pass the Elementary and Secondary Education Reauthorization \nAct. It is the first time we didn't do it in a bipartisan way, \nlistening to the voices of all of our colleagues, trying to accommodate \nthem, all to try to come up with a product that would represent further \nprogress in reforming education.\n  Reforming education or providing incentives for States to do the bulk \nof that work because that is their responsibility more than ours--we \nhaven't done that. As a result, we haven't made progress on improving \nteacher training, we haven't made progress for modernizing libraries, \nwe haven't made progress with parental involvement, we haven't reduced \nclass size or repaired crumbling schools or done all we can to keep our \nschools safe from violence.\n  Frankly, one of the reasons we did not have the will to bring this \nlegislation to the floor was a paranoia on the side of the Republicans \nthat we would actually vote on sensible gun controls that would help \nimprove the safety not only of our schools but of our streets and our \ncommunities all across this country. And as a result, we sacrificed on \nthe altar of fidelity to the NRA a chance to pass elementary and \nsecondary education legislation in this Congress.\n  We haven't passed a hate crimes bill that would say stoutly, \nvigorously and courageously that we just don't talk about tolerance in \nthe United States, we actually have laws to require the same.\n  We would actually have a Federal statute that would assist \ncommunities when they find themselves convulsed by the kind of vicious \nhate crimes that we saw in Wyoming with Matthew Shepard, that we saw in \nTexas with Mr. Byrd, so that there would be a Federal response, not \njust an alternative way to prosecute, but resources to prosecute, with \nhelp and assistance. By doing this, we would send a very strong signal \nthat this is not an issue of East or West or North or South, but this \nis at the core of our American values. This is a country that was built \non the idea that men and women from very different backgrounds, very \ndifferent cultures, very different traditions, could come together and \nform a perfect union. We have failed in that.\n  We could go on, too, talking about some of the commonsense gun safety \nand juvenile justice legislation that has languished and will shortly \nexpire. We have not closed the gun show loophole. That was the loophole \nthat was used by the killers at Columbine High School to obtain some of \nthe weapons they used on that attack. How soon we have forgotten.\n  We have not passed legislation to require child safety locks on \nweapons. Yet we know that could save the lives of some children, and \neven one child's life saved because he or she would not get access to a \nfirearm in the home is something for which we would be very proud. We \nhave not done it, despite Senator Lautenberg's great efforts and the \nefforts of many of my colleagues.\n  Although we have engaged in debates about policy, we are looking \nahead at the consequences of this election where several things will be \nextraordinarily important--obviously. First, this election will help \ncast the composition of our Supreme Court. That is not just a \njurisprudential matter, that is not just something that should be of \ninterest to law review editors and students at law schools. It will \nshape whether or not this Federal Government can still play a vital, \nactive role in the lives of its citizens, because the trend of the \nCourt, the trend of the Republican appointees of the Court, has been to \ncircumscribe, dramatically, the power of the Federal Government to act \nin lieu of the States.\n  When people talk about the Federal role in education, that role might \ndiminish dramatically, regardless of what we do in this body, if we \nhave Justices who believe there is no real congressional/Federal role \nin education. That is a part of the consequences of this election.\n  Governor Bush has proposed a tax policy that is hard to understand, \nexcept for the fact that it seems to leave very little for the other \nissues with which we must deal: making sure we transform our Armed \nForces, making sure we can protect the solvency of the Social Security \ntrust fund, making sure we can keep our Medicare obligations to \nseniors, making sure we can continue to invest in this country, in its \ninfrastructure--both its physical infrastructure and its human and \nsocial infrastructure--through education and training.\n  We are at a point now where, at the end of this Congress, we are \nfacing the turn point, the turning back from the kind of fiscal \ndiscipline that has produced the record prosperity over the last \nseveral years, to a situation where we fall back again into deficits, \ninto the high interest rates, into the economic stagnation of the late \n1980s and early 1990s. We could miss this opportunity to invest in our \npeople, to strengthen our country, its physical strength and its \neconomic vitality and its military prowess, and also its spirit as a \nnation of neighbors helping others to make their lives better and to \nmake their communities better.\n  We have reached this impasse. I hope we can break through this \nimpasse. I hope we can, through deliberations over the next few days, \nreach a Medicare refinement proposal that will truly help providers and \nnot just HMOs. I hope we can see a Commerce-State-Justice bill that \nwill come back with Latino fairness legislation, that will recognize \nthat these are good people, struggling to be Americans through work and \nfamily and all of the attributes that we see as part of America--not a \nlegal status but a condition of the heart and a habit of the heart.\n\n  I hope we can do that. But that will take bipartisan effort. It will \ntake all\n\n[[Page S11286]]\n\nour efforts. I hope over the next several days we do something we have \nnot done over the last many months--work together for the benefit of \nthe American people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11286-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11286-S11290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE LAST CONGRESS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\n\n\n                               H.R. 2614\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I come on this early Friday evening with a \nsense of extreme disappointment, extreme disappointment that we are \nconcluding the last Congress of the 20th century with so little \ncommitment to provide a vision and a sense of assistance and help to \nAmericans as they prepare for the 21st century. I would describe it as \nthe ``lack of vision thing.'' We cannot seem to envisage the surplus as \na once-in-a-century chance to tackle the most important issues for our \nday, issues that will affect our children and grandchildren, issues \nsuch as Social Security and Medicare, the two great programs in which \nthe U.S. Government has a contract with its people, and how to deal \nwith the national debt, which grew so explosively over the last 30 \nyears, and that we now have an opportunity to substantially reduce.\n  Instead, we see the surplus as a giant windfall that allows us to \ndole out favors to favored constituencies, as if Halloween has already \narrived. The result of this ``tunnel vision thing,'' is a bill that \nwill absorb $320 billion of the non-Social Security surplus faster than \nthe kids next Tuesday will be able to empty their Halloween bags.\n  As troubling as the specifics of this legislation is the process by \nwhich it found its way to the Senate floor. This legislation, which \nwould propose substantial tax reductions and additional provider \nfunding under the Medicare program, is a major assault against our \nability to use the budget surplus in a rational way.\n  As we all remember from Abraham Lincoln's immortal Gettysburg \naddress, ours is a Government ``of the people, by the people and for \nthe people.''\n  For such a government of, by, and for the people to function, it must \nbe conducted in full view of the people.\n  As several of my colleagues have already discussed earlier today, \nthis program of tax cuts and paybacks to additional reimbursement to \nMedicare providers was created by a self-appointed, elite group of \nMembers in the proverbial smoke-filled room of old-style machine \npolitics. The irony is that the very Republicans who snuck into the \ncloset, locked the door behind them, and emerged with this poor excuse \nfor a fiscal plan are the same leaders who are now encouraging George \nW. Bush to be elected President of the United States on a promise to be \na uniter, not a divider, and a builder of coalitions and bipartisan \nconsensus.\n  If this is what the blueprint is for bipartisanship and consensus \nbuilding, I shudder to imagine the legislation that will ooze out from \nthis closed door should Governor Bush win the Presidency and follow the \ncounsel of those who have brought us to this sad end on this fall \nevening.\n  Governor Bush would do well to consider that the Republican Congress \nlacks the vision thing. It is always more difficult to see the big \npicture when you are in the dark. The legislation before us is a prime \nexample of what happens when you try to see the big picture in the \ndark.\n  I will not claim that this bill is without some positive qualities, \nsome redeeming features. Many of those features I have strongly \nadvocated and, in a number of instances, have been a prime sponsor. But \nthe bill has serious deficiencies. I choose this evening to focus only \non two of those deficiencies: First, the high level of additional \nfunding being given under the Medicare program to managed care \nproviders at the expense of the beneficiaries; and, second, the failure \nto provide adequate incentives for small employers to offer pensions to \ntheir employees.\n  Both of these deficiencies have a common theme, and that is that we \nare not just proposing measures as a means of adding back or increasing \nthe payments to Medicare providers. We are not providing tax incentives \njust to reward certain people with additional pension or retirement \nbenefits. We are trying to achieve objectives.\n  In the case of Medicare, we are trying to achieve the objectives of \nchanging the orientation of this program from one which focuses on \nillness, one which focuses on treating people after they have become \nsick enough to go into a hospital or have suffered a major accident, to \none which focuses on wellness, keeping people healthy as long as \npossible, and which recognizes that a fundamental part of any wellness \nstrategy is providing access to prescription drugs which are the means \nby which conditions are appropriately managed or reversed so that \nwellness can be achieved or maintained.\n  We also have as a vision to provide a balanced retirement security \nfor older Americans, a retirement security that is based on three \npillars: Social Security, employer-based pensions, and private savings. \nIt is to achieve this goal of a balanced, secure retirement program \nthat we should be directing our attention in terms of how we fashion \ntax incentives and other measures that use public incentives and funds \nin order to achieve that objective.\n  I am disappointed that this tax legislation, this Medicare \nreimbursement legislation that we have before us, fails on both of \nthose accounts, and I will elaborate on the nature of that failure.\n\n  First, by making health maintenance organizations the only Medicare-\nbased means by which a prescription drug benefit can be achieved, we \nare, in effect, herding seniors who need prescription drug coverage \ninto private health maintenance organizations. This bill, by any \naccount, gives disproportionately too much money to the health \nmaintenance organizations, organizations that do not need it and do too \nlittle to seniors and health care providers who do. We give too much \nmoney to the HMOs, too little to the beneficiaries, and too little to \nother health care providers.\n  While I appreciate the modest improvements for beneficiaries included \nin this bill, the fact remains that health maintenance organizations \nwill receive substantially more than one-third of the overall package \nover the first 5 years and even more over 10 years. I am alarmed by the \nattempt at offering substantial increases in payments to HMOs because \nexperts tell us that these payments are already too high. The General \nAccounting Office says that under current law--under current law, not \nthe increases we are considering here--and I quote from the General \nAccounting Office report:\n\n       Medicare's overly generous payments rates to health \n     maintenance organizations well exceed what Medicare would \n     have paid had these individuals remained in the traditional \n     fee-for-service program.\n\n  The General Accounting Office concluded that Medicare health \nmaintenance organizations ``have never been a bargain for taxpayers.''\n  Increasing HMO payments will not keep them from leaving the markets \nwhere they are most needed. According to the testimony from Gail \nWilensky, chair of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and a \nformer Administrator of the Federal Health Care Financing \nAdministration, HCFA:\n\n       Plan withdrawals have been disproportionately lower in \n     counties where payment growth has been most constrained.\n\n  The withdrawal of HMOs from counties has actually been lower where \nthe payment growth to HMOs has been most constrained.\n  It comes down to priorities: Should we spend billions more on HMOs or \nshould we try to help frail and low-income beneficiaries, people with \ndisabilities, and children?\n  The managed care industry and its advocates in Congress have thwarted \nevery effort to reform the Medicare+Choice Program so that it does what \nit is designed to do: provide services while saving the Government \nmoney.\n  There is a complex formula by which Medicare+Choice plans are \nreimbursed. In a simplified form, it works this way. It is an \narithmetic formula:\n  A calculation is done in each county in the country as to how much \nfee-for-service medicine is costing per Medicare beneficiary. Ninety-\nfive percent of\n\n[[Page S11287]]\n\nthat number then becomes the method by which the HMO+Choice plans are \nreimbursed.\n  If you happen to have a county that has a high fee-for-service \nmedicine, for instance, because it has tertiary medical care or \nparticularly because it has a teaching hospital, which tend to result \nin driving up the overall fee-for-service costs within that county \nbecause they are providing exceptional and generally exceptionally \nexpensive services, then you have a high reimbursement level to HMOs. \nThat is why you tend to find lots of HMOs wanting to do business in \nthose high-cost, fee-for-service counties.\n  Conversely, if you happen to be in a county that has no hospitals or \nonly primary care hospitals and relatively low fee-for-service costs, \nthen you have low HMO reimbursements, which frankly is a formula that \nmakes no sense.\n\n  For many years, there has been an effort to find a new way to \nreimburse HMOs that is more market oriented as opposed to relying on \nthe accident of whether you happen to be in a high fee-for-service \ncounty or a low fee-for-service county.\n  Several times in recent years Congress has initiated a program to do \na demonstration project using some of the competitive bidding processes \nwhich are prevalent in the way in which private corporations and State \nand local governments determine how to reimburse their HMOs. They put \ntheir HMO contracts out for competitive bid and see what HMOs will \noffer in order to secure the business of a large corporation or a State \nor local government. I believe strongly that we should at least \nexperiment with this approach to reimbursing HMOs through Medicare.\n  In 1997, as an example, two demonstration projects were included in \nthe Balanced Budget Act. These were to provide information on the \ncompetitive bidding process for Medicare+Choice contracts. What \nhappened? As soon as two cities--in this case Kansas City and Phoenix--\nwere selected to be the sites for the demonstration projects, the HMOs \nand their allies in those communities led an assault against the \ndemonstration project, and in an end-of-the-session, largely \nclandestine attack, those demonstration projects were terminated even \nbefore they had started. In so doing, the HMOs have been able to assure \nthat they will not have to compete for Medicare's business based on \nmerit and the marketplace. In fact, they would not have to compete at \nall.\n  This year, the HMOs have again launched a multimillion-dollar \nlobbying effort to pressure Congress to increase their payment rates \nbased on this discredited 95-percent formula. The HMOs are claiming \ntheir current reimbursement rates are too low. Yet these are the same \nHMOs that committed congressional homicide when they killed the \nproposal that would have allowed a more market-oriented system, which \ncould have resulted in higher reimbursement rates or lower \nreimbursement rates; at least they would have been the reimbursement \nrates that were set by market competition, not by an arbitrary \ndiscredited formula.\n  This action, of claiming that you need to have higher reimbursement \nrates after you have just killed the method by which we were going to \ndetermine what would be the means of setting those appropriate rates, \nis the equivalent of the child who shoots his mother and father and \nthen claims to deserve the mercy of the court because he is an orphan.\n  The HMO industry has shot every effort to establish a rational means \nof reimbursement.\n  Then they come here late at night, late in the session, saying that \nthey need to have a third or more--a third or more--of all the money \nthat is going to be used to provide reimbursement to Medicare providers \nbecause their rates are too low. They are providing services to \napproximately one out of six Medicare beneficiaries. Yet they want to \nhave a third or more of all of the money that goes for additional \nreimbursement.\n  I was pleased to learn that within this bill one positive thing that \nwas being considered was additional preventative benefits for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. This is a cause I have long advocated as part of the \nfundamental conversion of Medicare from a sickness system to a wellness \nsystem.\n  I strongly believe that Medicare must be reformed from a system which \nis based on treating illness to one that is based on maintaining \nwellness.\n\n  I have introduced many bills to this effect, some of which are now \nthe law of the land. The benefits that I have included have been based \non recommendations made by experts in the field. We have used the \nmedical expertise to determine which preventive modalities have been \nproven to be efficacious and cost-effective. Therefore, I was \ndisappointed to find that this bill fails to provide Medicare coverage \nfor those areas of prevention which have been identified by the U.S. \nPreventive Services Task Force as being the most efficacious and cost-\neffective.\n  What were these areas of prevention? Hypertension screening and \nsmoking cessation counseling. These were the highest priorities \nidentified by the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force. But these \napparently did not meet the ``political correctness'' standards of \nthose who were writing this final bill.\n  The bill also provides one of the other priorities: Access to \nnutrition therapy for people with renal disease and diabetes. But it \nleaves out the largest group of individuals for whom the Institute of \nMedicine recommends nutrition therapy--people with cardiovascular \ndisease.\n  This is the publication of the Institute of Medicine on ``The Role of \nNutrition in Maintaining Health in the Nation's Elderly,'' which urges \nthat access to nutrition therapy be made available to people with \ncardiovascular disease. Again, apparently they did not meet the \nstandard of ``political correctness'' to be included in the prevention \nmodalities that will be funded in this bill.\n  I believe strongly that additions to the Medicare program must be \nbased on scientific evidence and medical science, not on the power of a \nparticular lobbying group or on the bias of a single Member.\n  It appears that instead of taking a rational, scientific approach to \nprevention, the Members use a ``disease of the month'' philosophy, \nleaving those who need help the most without relevant new Medicare \npreventative services.\n  When I asked why the authors of this bill ignored the expert \nrecommendations, such as providing seniors with cardiovascular disease \nwith nutritional therapy, I was told it was excluded because it was too \nexpensive; we could not afford to provide nutrition therapy to seniors \nwith cardiovascular disease.\n  It does not take a Sherlock Holmes, or even a Dr. Watson, for that \nmatter, to understand what is happening here. This bill provides $1.5 \nbillion over 5 years for all of the prevention programs and a whopping \n$11.1 billion for the HMOs. But it is just too expensive to provide \nadequate, rational, prioritized prevention services for our elderly.\n  Clearly, the money is there. But the real goal of those who wrote \nthis plan is to herd seniors into private HMOs as a means of avoiding \nthe addition of a meaningful Medicare prescription drug benefit for our \nNation's seniors.\n  Whether you believe in the broad Government subsidization of the \nmanaged care industry or in providing benefits to seniors and children, \nwe should all agree that taxpayers' money should be spent responsibly.\n  Congress has the responsibility to make certain that the payment \nincreases we offer are based on actual data rather than anecdotal \nevidence or speculation.\n  How then can we justify that over the next 10 years the managed care \nindustry is set to walk away with almost the same amount of funding \nincreases as hospitals, home health care centers, skilled nursing \nfacilities, community health centers, and beneficiaries combined.\n  Over the next 10 years, under this plan, health maintenance \norganizations will receive, in additional funding, the amount that \nhospitals, home health care centers, skilled nursing facilities, \ncommunity health centers, and beneficiaries will receive combined.\n  The most disturbing problem with this bill is that it does nothing to \naddress our efforts to pass a Medicare prescription drug bill in the \nyear 2000. The Republican leadership would like for you to believe that \ntheir bill will solve the problem of providing a prescription drug \nbenefit for seniors.\n\n[[Page S11288]]\n\n  According to a story in the October 26 Washington Post:\n\n       Unlike the rest of Medicare, this plan provides some \n     prescription drug benefits; and by pumping more money into \n     it, the GOP can defuse Democratic charges that the Republican \n     Congress has failed to act on prescription drug benefits for \n     seniors.\n\n  What we have here is the attempt to use this exorbitant amount of \nmoney, more money than is going into hospitals, home health care \ncenters, skilled nursing facilities, community health centers, and \nbeneficiaries combined, pumping all that money into HMOs in order to \ncreate the facade that we are providing a prescription medication \nbenefit and therefore don't have to provide a prescription medication \nbenefit to the rest of the Medicare beneficiaries, the five out of six \nMedicare beneficiaries who get their health care through the \ntraditional fee-for-service program as opposed to an HMO.\n  The Republican leadership and George W. Bush criticize our \nprescription drug plan by claiming that we are forcing seniors into a \nGovernment-run HMO. By that so-called HMO, they mean Medicare, \ntraditional Medicare, Medicare on which nearly 85 percent of the \nbeneficiaries rely today.\n  In reality, the Republican plan to strengthen Medicare is to force \nseniors into private HMOs in order to get their prescription drugs.\n  Here is what seniors can count on in this plan of forcing seniors \ninto private HMOs as the means of securing their prescription drugs.\n  First, the plan will cover less than one in six Medicare \nbeneficiaries. Very few seniors have elected or in many cases even have \nthe opportunity to participate in Medicare+Choice. Only 16 percent of \nthe 39 million Medicare beneficiaries have joined a Medicare HMO plan.\n  Second, Medicare beneficiaries can look forward to plans that are \nhere today and gone tomorrow. Nearly 1 million seniors will be \nabandoned by their HMOs in this year of 2000 alone. More than 87,000 of \nthose are in my State of Florida. Seniors in 33 counties of the 67 \ncounties in Florida either never had a Medicare+Choice plan or had one \nonly briefly before it packed up and left town.\n  Third, seniors will have no guarantee of their prescription drug \nbenefits. What is unlimited coverage today may be a capped benefit \ntomorrow.\n  Listen to these numbers. This is what the prescription drug benefit \nis for some of the most significant HMOs in the country operating in \ncommunities with very large Medicare beneficiary populations.\n  In Hernando County, FL, north of Tampa, there are two Medicare+Choice \nplans, Wellcare and United. Both offer a prescription drug benefit, the \ntype of benefit we are hoping to expand by pumping more money through \nthis Medicare additional reimbursement into HMOs. Both of those plans \ncap their benefits for prescription drugs, in the one case at $748 a \nyear and in the other at $500 a year. There are many Medicare \nbeneficiaries who spend more than that in 1 month. Yet that is the \nannual cap on prescription drugs for those two HMOs which claim they \nare providing effective prescription drug coverage for their \nbeneficiaries.\n  Another example is the HIP Health Plan of Florida which offers \nseniors in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties a drug plan that covers up \nto $700 annually for brand name drugs. Seniors in the same plan in Palm \nBeach County, which is immediately north of Broward County, have an \nannual limit of $250 for brand name drugs.\n  What kind of prescription drug benefit is that? For many seniors, \nsuch as a constituent to whom I have referred frequently, Elaine Kett \nof Vero Beach, these annual capped amounts represent less than 30 days' \nworth of their prescription drug needs.\n\n  The HMOs' tendency toward denying choice and rationing of health care \nwill not benefit our Nation's seniors and people with disabilities. \nTalk about denying people choice; talk about rationing of health care; \nThis is it.\n  Fourth, seniors can expect no guaranteed choice of a doctor. HMOs \nhave networks of doctors that are constantly changing. If Mrs. Smith's \ndoctor is not in her HMO network, Mrs. Smith can't see the doctor. She \ncan't see the doctor who knows her the best. She can't see the doctor \nshe trusts to treat her and prescribe the medications she needs.\n  Even if Mrs. Smith's doctor writes a prescription drug, her HMO may \nhave a restrictive formulary and substitute her doctor's wisdom for \ntheirs by filling her prescription drug with something else. Even if \nMrs. Smith's doctor writes her a prescription drug, her HMO may have a \nrestrictive formulary which will deny her the medicine that her doctor \nbelieved was medically necessary.\n  To continue looking at the facts, let's look at the materials that \nHumana, one of the largest Medicare+Choice providers, HMOs, in the \ncountry, provides to seniors as it explains their prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  Here is what Humana says:\n\n       For medications with dispensing limits and age limits, \n     additional information may be required for approval. These \n     requests can only be made by your physician to be considered. \n     Please have your physician contact the Humana clinical \n     hotline at the number below.\n\n  So it is not the patient relying on the best medical advice of the \ndoctor and then taking that medical advice in the form of a drug \nprescription to a pharmacist in whom they have confidence to be filled. \nIt is the patient relying on the goodwill of the HMO to allow the best \njudgment of the doctor to be fulfilled.\n  Reading further in the Humana preferred drug list publication:\n\n       All of the above is not a complete list and is subject to \n     change.\n\n  So what you think may be your relationship with your doctor and your \npharmacist today may be different tomorrow, if your HMO decides it \nwants to make it different tomorrow.\n  If Mrs. Smith's doctor prescribes a medication that is not on \nHumana's formulary, she can only get it filled with prior authorization \nfrom Humana. That means upon learning that her medication is not on \nHumana's formulary, probably when she is standing at the pharmacist's \ncounter trying to get her drug prescription filled, Mrs. Smith will \nhave to call her doctor and ask her doctor to call a 1-800 number on \nher behalf.\n  Once the doctor gets through, Mrs. Smith's doctor will have to \nconsult with an HMO bureaucrat and provide additional information \nregarding Mrs. Smith's health so the bureaucrat can determine whether \nMrs. Smith is eligible to receive the medication her own doctor \nprescribed. After all of this, the request to have Humana cover the \ndrug may still be denied. To add to the difficulty of having a drug \nprescription filled, Humana states in its materials that the list of \ncovered drugs is subject to change. A drug that is covered for Mrs. \nSmith today may be excluded on her next visit to the pharmacy.\n  Fifth, there are few, often no, options to participate in \nMedicare+Choice in rural areas. Because of this perverse formula that \nrelates the fee-for-service costs within that county to the amount of \nreimbursement that HMOs will receive, while seniors in urban centers \nmay have access to Medicare+Choice plans, many of our seniors do not \nhave that option. In over 20 counties in Florida and in the entire \nStates of North Dakota, Utah, and West Virginia, there are no managed \ncare programs for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  I wonder, do those who would advocate that this managed care approach \nprovides meaningful prescription drug coverage for our Medicare \nbeneficiaries think the people in North Dakota, Utah, and West Virginia \ndo not need prescription medications?\n  All of these factors beg the question: If seniors don't have access \nto or don't like Medicare managed care now, because of their own \nexperience, why would they like it better just because we are about to \ndecide to throw an enormous amount of money at it, without any rational \njustification, without any sense of the priorities among Medicare \nhealth care providers? Why, just because we are about to act in an \nirrational way, would it suddenly make these plans better in the eyes \nof the ultimate beneficiary?\n  As I have said in a series of floor statements, the attack on a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit is, in reality, an attack on the \nMedicare program itself. Let me repeat that. This attack on using fee-\nfor-service Medicare as the fundamental means by which prescription \ndrug benefits will be delivered is but a veiled attack, an assault on \nthe\n\n[[Page S11289]]\n\nbasic principles of Medicare itself; universality, comprehensive \nservice, affordability, those are principles that are under assault \nunder the veil of denying prescription medication benefits through \ntraditional Medicare.\n  The Washington Post article of October 27 entitled ``Ad Blitz Erodes \nDemocrats' Edge on Prescription Drugs'' describes how Republicans have \nused ads to achieve ``some success in muddying the waters on \nprescription drugs.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record immediately after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In the legislation we are considering today, we have \nfound yet another smoking gun to validate our suspicions that the \nRepublican Party--and, I am afraid, its Presidential candidate--are \nseeking to do as Newt Gingrich was candid enough to say publicly: Let \nMedicare ``wither on the vine.''\n  I believe the cynical way in which this bill purports to provide a \nprescription medication benefit by pumping enormous amounts of money \naway from beneficiaries in more effective prevention programs, and away \nfrom institutions such as hospitals and home care centers which have \ndemonstrated a legitimate basis to receive additional compensation, and \ntoward the institutions which have fought against every reform and \nwhich, by the General Accounting Office report, has not made a \njustifiable case for additional reimbursement. We are doing this in \norder to create the facade that by forcing seniors into private HMOs, \nthat would be the means by which they would receive prescription drugs. \nThat in itself is enough of a reason to vote against this proposal.\n  Let me comment on a second reason. Just as the first, prescription \ndrugs, is an area on which the Presiding Officer and I have worked to \ntry to develop a bipartisan, rational means by which prescription drugs \ncan be made available to Medicare beneficiaries, the next area is \nanother on which I, along with many colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, have worked, and that is to reform our pension laws. In my \njudgment, the primary objective of reforming our pension laws should be \nto increase the number of Americans with access to employer-based \npensions.\n  At first glance, the retirement savings section of this bill looks \nvery similar to S. 741, the Pension Coverage and Portability Act, which \nI introduced with my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, which has \nthe support of 17 of our colleagues in the Senate. In fact, there are \nsome very attractive and useful provisions that will make existing \npensions work better. To these, I give my wholehearted support. For \nexample, the bill makes it easier for employees to take their pensions \nwith them as they move from job to job. This is an important \nimprovement to existing law and will help workers accumulate assets for \nretirement.\n\n  On further review, however, it becomes clear that in many ways this \nbill is a wolf in sheep's clothing. The principal goal of the Pension \nCoverage Portability Act is expanding retirement plan coverage to those \nAmericans who currently do not have an employer-sponsored plan \navailable to them. The measure focuses particularly on encouraging \nsmall employers to offer pension coverage.\n  Let me use some examples and statistics from my State of Florida, \nwhich I think are not unrelated to the national scene. Florida has \nbenefited greatly from the strong economic growth in America in the \nlast 8 years. Almost 2 million new jobs have been created in our State \nduring that time. Of those almost 2 million jobs, more than 70 percent \nare in firms that employ fewer than 25 people. The vast growth in \nemployment in my State of Florida--and, I suggest, in America--has been \nthrough small entrepreneurial firms. It is these small employers who \nhave the greatest difficulty offering pension coverage to their \nemployees. A recent report from the General Accounting Office \nhighlights this fact.\n  According to the GAO report, slightly more than half--53 percent--of \nall employed Americans lack employer-based pension coverage. The good \nnews is that that is 5 percentage points more than it was a decade ago. \nSo more Americans than 10 years ago are now getting a pension through \ntheir place of employment.\n  The more troubling finding in the GAO report is that workers' chances \nof having access to a pension plan are strongly influenced by the size \nof the firm that employs them. While 53 percent of Americans, in \ngeneral, lack an employer-based pension, if you happen to work for a \nfirm that employs fewer than 25 people, 82 percent lack an employer-\nbased pension. It is in precisely on those small firms that the Pension \nCoverage and Portability Act targeted its attention. Unfortunately, the \nbill before us today falls woefully short in encouraging those small \nfirms to provide coverage to their workers.\n  The Pension Coverage and Portability Act contained two important \nprovisions to assist small businesses in offering retirement plans to \ntheir employees. One of those was an income tax credit to help small \nbusinesses defray the administrative costs associated with establishing \na retirement plan. Second is an income tax credit for small employers \nwho make employer contributions into pension plans for the benefit of \ntheir employees. So there were two critical provisions in the Pension \nCoverage and Portability Act, both targeted at encouraging, \nfacilitating, and making more likely that small employers would provide \npensions for their employees an income tax credit to help defray the \ninitial establishment of the plan costs; and, second, an income tax \ncredit for the employers who made contributions on behalf of their \nemployees into their employees' pension plan. Both of these important \nprovisions were excluded from the tax bill before us today.\n\n  In addition, to the pension bill that was unanimously reported by the \nSenate Finance Committee included both of those provisions, and another \nimportant element of retirement security encouraged personal savings. \nThis was achieved through a separate tax credit to help low- and \nmoderate-income families save for their retirement.\n  The bill was unanimously reported. Every Republican and every \nDemocrat on the Senate Finance Committee supported the provisions that \nwould have encouraged small businesses to set up pension plans for the \nemployer to contribute to employee pension plans, and it also creates \nan incentive for increased savings for low- and moderate-income \nfamilies.\n  The bill crafted by the Republican leadership contains none of these \nimportant proposals.\n  Finally, the bill even has the potential to actually create \nincentives for small businesses to drop their existing pension \ncoverage. Approximately 18 percent of small businesses with less than \n25 employees might actually be encouraged by this bill to drop that \npension coverage. How can this possibly be?\n  Frequently, the employers in a small business set up pension coverage \nnot only to benefit their employees and attempt to encourage a greater \nsense of commitment to employment with a small firm, but they also do \nit out of self-interest. As long as an employer is willing to cover his \nemployees, he generally can set aside more funds for his own retirement \nthrough an employer-based plan than is possible to be done through an \nIRA, individual retirement account.\n  This bill includes a substantial increase in the maximum contribution \nallowable to an individual retirement account. That amount today is \n$2,000 a year and will be increased to $5,000 a year by the year 2003. \nBy securing a separate IRA for the employer's spouse, effectively \n$10,000 can be tax sheltered for retirement.\n  By making IRAs more attractive to small employers, those small \nemployers might decide that it is in their self-interest to discontinue \nthe employer-based plans which they now sponsor and rely on their own \nand their spouse's IRA as the means of providing for their retirement \nsecurity.\n  Thus, the unintended consequence of increasing IRA limits without \nproviding incentives to encourage small businesses to provide pension \ncoverage and then for the employers to contribute to their employees' \nplan may be to erode the retirement plan coverage for employees in \nsmall businesses. The percentage of those workers in small firms \nwithout coverage--82 percent already--could grow even higher.\n\n[[Page S11290]]\n\n  As disappointed as I am in this legislation as a whole, I am not in \nthe least bit surprised. This legislation is the work of lobbyists--not \nstatesmen.\n  Instead of a strategic vision of what will be required in order to \nconvert Medicare into a wellness program and what will be required to \nassure that the large and growing number of Americans who work for \nsmall businesses will have the benefit of a pension and retirement \nfund--instead of those strategic visions--this is the work of special \ninterest tunnel vision. Instead of balancing the interests of all \nAmericans, this bill goes full tilt towards the luckiest few.\n\n  I suggest when legislation is drafted in the dark this is what we can \nexpect. Behind those closed doors, the drafters seem to forget basic \nmath. That basic math is that every dollar we spend--such as pumping \nexcessive funds into HMOs--is $1 that we take directly out of the \nsurplus.\n  Every dollar spent on tax cuts is one that will not be spent on \nsaving Social Security by paying down the national debt, and will not \nbe spent on modernizing Medicare to make it a wellness program.\n  I have used words such as ``squandering,'' ``flittering,'' and \n``wasting'' before this body more often in the last 2 weeks than I \nwould have liked.\n  I have watched any chance that this body had to create a \ncomprehensive strategic spending plan for our future die a small and \npainful death.\n  I am left with the hope that President Clinton will indeed veto this \nbill as promised, and that a few billion dollars can be spent paying \ndown the national debt before the next Congress gets its hands on the \npurse strings again.\n  I am not surprised that we are at this point. But I must admit I am a \nbit puzzled.\n  Is it really possible that some of my colleagues don't realize that a \nslice here and a snack there will eventually leave nothing but crumbs? \nCan it be that they truly believe we can have our surplus and eat it \ntoo? Or are they feasting on the surplus behind closed doors fully \naware that they are telling the system, starve for reform, that we will \nbe fine, and go ahead, eat cake?\n  Thank you Mr. President.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n         Ad Blitz Erodes Democrats' Edge on Prescription Drugs\n\n               (By Juliet Eilperin and Thomas B. Edsall)\n\n       Buoyed by a massive advertising blitz from business groups, \n     Republicans have managed to erode some of the Democrats' \n     political advantage on the issue of prescription drugs for \n     seniors, according to polling data and independent analysts.\n       Republicans have had some success neutralizing an issue the \n     Democrats had hoped to ride to victory in both the \n     presidential race and many congressional contests across the \n     country, the analysts said. In fact, in a few key races, \n     Republicans have successfully used the issue to skewer the \n     Democrats as big government spenders.\n       Fueling the Republicans have been tens of millions of \n     dollars in ads from the pharmaceutical industry, the U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce and other business groups lauding the \n     GOP's private-sector-oriented approach to providing drug \n     coverage for seniors. Republican ads for Texas Gov. George W. \n     Bush and other candidates have also portrayed Democratic \n     proposals to add a drug benefit to the Medicare program as a \n     potential bureaucratic nightmare.\n       Democrats ``just assumed we would roll over and say, `You \n     know, we are against seniors and for the big drug companies, \n     so come on over and take the House and Senate back with it,' \n     '' said GOP pollster Glen Bolger. ``But Republicans decided \n     not to do what the Democrats wanted.''\n       Just three months ago, Bush had no plan to provide \n     prescription drug coverage for seniors and was badly trailing \n     Vice President Gore on the issue. A Washington Post/Henry J. \n     Kaiser Family Foundation/Harvard University poll in July \n     showed Gore with a strong advantage over Bush, 49 percent to \n     38 percent, when voters were asked which candidate would do a \n     better job ``helping people 65 and over to pay for \n     prescription medicines.''\n       Three months later, after an onslaught of Republican \n     National Committee advertising on the drug issue, the Gore \n     advantage had disappeared: When voters were asked whom they \n     trusted to handle ``Medicare and prescription drug \n     coverage,'' they were evenly split, 45 percent saying Gore \n     and 43 percent Bush.\n       Democratic operatives acknowledge that Republicans have had \n     some success muddying the waters on prescription drugs. In \n     mid-September, the party's own internal surveys showed that \n     Gore's advantage on the issue has slipped to single digits, \n     one top pollster said.\n       But a fall advertising campaign has helped put the issue \n     back into the Democratic column, this pollster said, and Gore \n     and his party now hold a 15-point advantage on the question \n     of who would better address the prescription drug problem.\n       Robert Blendon, a health policy specialist involved in the \n     Post/Kaiser/Harvard poll, said surveys suggest the public, in \n     fact, prefers Gore's proposal to add a prescription drug \n     benefit to Medicare over Bush's plan to encourage insurance \n     companies to provide the coverage.\n       But he added that most voters ``don't exactly understand \n     the nuances between the two policies,'' making it difficult \n     for Gore to gain an advantage.\n       On the congressional level, Republicans have tried to \n     defuse the issue by approving a measure allowing the \n     reimportation of cheaper prescription drugs and, in the case \n     of the House, passing their own drug coverage bill along the \n     lines of what Bush is proposing.\n       And when Republican candidates have had the money to spend, \n     they have been able to tarnish their opponents: Sen. Spencer \n     Abraham (Mich.) saw his numbers surge this summer after he \n     ran a series of unanswered attacks against the drug proposal \n     of Rep. Deborah Ann Stabenow (D-Mich); and both Sen. Conrad \n     Burns (Mont.) and Senate hopeful John Ensign of Nevada \n     improved their standing in the polls after launching similar \n     ads.\n       But according to Michigan-based pollster Ed Sarpolus, older \n     voters who became confused on the drug issue are now \n     beginning to gravitate back to Gore and Stabenow.\n       ``It's human nature. If you're confused, you vote for what \n     you know,'' said Sarpolus, who added that voters tend to \n     trust Democrats more on health care.\n       Individual House Republicans, bolstered by their party \n     committees and business groups, have also aggressively \n     defended their records on drug coverage in recent months. \n     Rep. Heather A. Wilson (R-N.M.) saw her poll numbers rise \n     significantly among seniors once she began running ads on \n     the GOP plan. Ohio Republican Pat Tiberi--who is hoping to \n     succeed his former boss, Rep. John R. Kasich--also \n     expanded his lead in the polls after the National \n     Republican Congressional Committee funded ads attacking \n     his opponent's position on prescription drugs.\n       Former representative Scotty Baesler (D-Ky.), who is hoping \n     to defeat freshman Rep. Ernie Fletcher (R-Ky.), said the \n     Republicans ``muddied the waters very well'' on the question \n     of prescription drugs, prompting him to air ads on gun \n     control instead because ``it's a definite separation between \n     myself and Fletcher.''\n       Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.) has even turned the issue \n     into a liability for his opponent Elaine Bloom, blanketing \n     his district with ads highlighting how she served on the \n     board of directors of a company that makes generic drugs and \n     that received payments from a competitor in exchange for \n     keeping a heart medicine off the market.\n       The party committees are not the only groups touting the \n     GOP's drug plan in recent weeks. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce \n     has run several commercials decrying the Democrats' proposal \n     as a potential bureaucratic nightmare while Citizens for \n     Better Medicare--a group funded by the pharmaceutical \n     industry--has spent $50 million on an ad campaign supporting \n     the position taken by House and Senate Republicans.\n       Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman \n     Patrick J. Kennedy (R.I.) said, ``The $50 million in \n     independent expenditures from the major pharmaceutical \n     companies has validated the Republicans' belief that money \n     can buy anything including their inaction on a real \n     prescription drug benefit for Medicare.''\n       Republican pollster Bill McInturff said that in the \n     battleground states where GOP advertising on prescription \n     drugs has been concentrated, ``these are roughly parallel \n     numbers'' concerning which party and which candidate has the \n     advantage. ``This is clearly a case where advertising has \n     affected people's opinions,'' he said.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is late. We have had pretty candid \ndiscussions on various issues before us. It is a political season. \nThere is a lot of finger pointing, whether we talk about Social \nSecurity, Medicare, or the benefits of care associated with drug plans. \nI think we all share a common commitment to try to have meaningful \nlegislation come out of the process. We simply have different points of \nview.\n  You heard the Senator from Florida comment extensively on the \nRepublican plan to strengthen Medicare. I am not here to comment on the \nRepublican plan on Medicare, although I think it is quite defensible. \nBut I am here to talk about the Democratic plan for an energy policy.\n\n[[Page S11291]]\n\n  You will notice, unlike the Senator from Florida, that I don't have a \nchart to show you what the Democratic energy plan is for the simple \nreason that there isn't any. This administration has absolutely no \nenergy plan as evidenced by the dilemma that we face in this country as \nwe watch our imports from the Mideast climb to approximately 58 \npercent. Fifty-eight percent of the oil that we consume in this country \nis imported.\n  We have seen a dramatic increase in the price of gasoline. Gasoline \nis in the area of $1.75 cents to $1.80, depending on the grade.\n  We have seen heating oil in the country raised to approximately \n$1.56. Here in Washington alone, it has increased 56 cents a gallon in \nless than 10 months.\n  We have seen natural gas on which 50 percent of the homes in this \ncountry are dependent increase from $2.16 for 1,000 cubic feet to \ndeliveries in November at $5.40 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n  We have a situation with our refining industry in which we haven't \nbuilt a new refinery in this country in decades. We have shut down 30-\nsome refineries. We find ourselves at loggerheads because of our \ninability to refine, if you will, enough of the blends to address the \nNortheast heating oil shortage.\n  It is fair to say that we don't have a defined energy policy. We have \nan energy policy that seems to be driven by environmental groups that \ndo not accept the responsibility for realism.\n  Realism dictates that we are not going to move out of here tomorrow \nor the next day on hot air. We are going to move out on kerosene. \nKerosene comes from oil. Kerosene is what you put in the jet airplane. \nI don't attempt to be oversimplistic, but what we continue to need in \nthis country is a balance of all the energy resources.\n\n  The Middle East last week gave us another reminder as to our crisis. \nThat is the fear that we are going to be held hostage to foreign oil \nimports. I have been coming to this floor for many days now warning of \nhow our dependence on foreign oil threatens the national security of \nthis Nation. I certainly don't take any pride at this late hour in \ncoming here and saying I told you so. We know the Middle East is a \ntinderbox. Some of our most impassioned enemies are already lighting \nfires there.\n  What little energy policy this administration has in the sense of \nincreasing reliance on foreign oil has come in conflict, in my opinion, \nwith our foreign policy. How can we pretend to play the role of an ally \nto Israel or even an honest broker when we are now beholden to Israel's \nsworn enemy, Saddam Hussein, of Iraq?\n  Now we are looking to Saddam Hussein to keep our citizens from \nfreezing this winter. We are importing about 750,000 barrels of oil a \nday from Saddam Hussein. Many people forget we fought a war over there \nin 1991 and 1992. We lost 147 American lives.\n  Today, the real wild card is in Iraq and the Middle East. I mentioned \nmy previous concern over Saddam Hussein and the leverage he brings, but \nsome analysts estimate that oil will increase to $40 to $45 a barrel if \nIraq halts oil sales or reduces oil sales. The significance of that is \nthe position that Saddam Hussein and Iraq currently hold.\n  Iraq, we know, has threatened to stop oil exports if the U.N. doesn't \nconvert Iraqi dollars held by the U.N. to Euro dollars for trading. We \nknow Iraqi exports have dropped a little bit, by about 500,000 barrels \na day just last week. It is not clear whether this is the start of an \nominous trend. Even if supply disruptions do not occur, world oil \nmarkets are stretched so thin that even the possibility of a disruption \ncould raise prices even more. And it did so last week.\n  Currently, I think oil closed today around $34 a barrel. We have seen \na high on two occasions of $37 within the last month or so. But the \nreality is that Saddam Hussein controls about almost 2.8 million \nbarrels a day of daily exports, and that is more than the available \nexcess capacity worldwide.\n  What I am saying is that the difference between the world's ability \nto produce oil and the world's consumption is a little over a million \nbarrels--there is a little over a million-barrel capacity--but Saddam \nHussein controls 2.8 million. My point is if Saddam Hussein reduces his \nsales, then we are in an even tighter position and as a consequence we \ncan expect the price to go up. And Saddam Hussein is aware of this.\n  There is no question about his actions of late. He has become more \naggressive in recent months. It is rather interesting to note, after \nevery speech, he concludes it with ``Death to Israel.'' If there is \never a threat to Israel's security, it comes from Iraq. He has a \n$14,000 bounty on each American plane shot down. Thank God there \nhaven't been any. But we have flown over 200,000 individual flights \nover Iraq, enforcing the no-fly zone, an area of blockade since the \n1990s.\n  Last month, Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil. Here \nwe go again. He did this shortly before invading Kuwait in 1990.\n  Last week, nearly 15,000 Iraqi Republican Guard troops moved westward \nin a show of force, obviously toward Israel. Just yesterday, Saddam \nHussein said: Jihad, holy war, is the only way to liberate Palestine.\n  How quickly we forget. Let me remind everyone, before President \nClinton and Vice President Gore took office, we carried out Desert \nStorm and 147 Americans were killed, 467 were wounded, and 23 were \ntaken prisoner. We continue to enforce the no-fly zone. The cost to the \ntaxpayers is about $50 million per month. It is still going on. Yet the \nadministration seems to want to rely more on Iraqi oil.\n  We have had in this country a 17-percent decline in domestic \nproduction, yet the demand has increased 14 percent. In August of last \nyear, we consumed more oil in this country than ever before. What is \nthe rationale?\n  We are traveling more. The economy is growing. We are an electronic \nsociety. We need more energy. Where does it come from? It doesn't come \nfrom thin air. Now 58 percent of our oil comes from overseas. Some \npeople perhaps remember 1973 when we had the Arab oil embargo. We had \nlines around the block. People were indignant. They were mad. They were \noutraged. We couldn't get gasoline at the gas station. At that time, we \nwere 36-percent dependent on imported oil and we created the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve.\n  Here we are today with Iraq, the fastest growing source of U.S. \nforeign oil, 750,000 barrels a day, nearly 50 percent of all Iraqi \nexports. I don't want to be oversimplistic, but we buy Saddam Hussein's \noil, put it in our airplanes, and go over and bomb him. Is that a \nsensible, responsible foreign policy?\n  In a few words, that is what is happening. You can interpret it \nhowever you desire. This administration's inattention to maintaining \nthe U.N. conditions against Iraq has left the sanctions in a shambles. \nWe aren't doing any weapons inspections in Iraq; increased Iraqi \nflights across Saudi airspace in the no-fly zone continue; his \ndevelopment of missile, missile delivery systems, and biological \nwarfare capabilities continues. Russia and France have openly \nchallenged our sanctions. Turkey sends flights to Baghdad despite the \nU.N. ban.\n  It is simply not working. Our friends in Jordan are demanding the end \nto inspections of Iraqi imports through Jordanian ports. Saddam Hussein \nis about to get a free pass to import anything he wishes despite the \nU.N. sanctions. Does anyone doubt he will be able to import what he \nneeds to continue his weapons of mass destruction? We are going to have \nto deal with this one of these days.\n  Let me say again what little energy policy we seem to have is a \nreliance on imported oil, and it has certainly come into conflict with \nour foreign policy, with potentially disastrous consequences for \nAmerican consumers and our national security.\n  I am pleased to say that George W. Bush, and our Vice President \nnominee, Mr. Cheney, have spoken about how to decrease our dependence \non imported oil by developing some of the reserves that we have here at \nhome, open up the overthrust belt--Wyoming, Colorado, Utah--areas where \nwe have great potential, areas where the administration has closed up \nto 64 percent of the public land, exempting that area from development, \nand my State of Alaska, where the administration refuses to allow an \nopening of the area which might have the largest reserves known to \nexist in North America, that small sliver of ANWR.\n  There are a lot of misunderstandings about the area of Alaska known \nas\n\n[[Page S11292]]\n\nANWR. It is 19 million acres, the size of the State of South Carolina. \nCongress, wisely, has taken out of that 19 million acres, 8.5 million \nacres and put it in permanent wilderness. They have taken another 9 \nmillion acres and put it into a refuge, leaving 1.5 million acres for a \ndecision to be made whether to open it. The geologists tell us there \nmight be as much as 16 billion barrels of oil there. That would equal \nwhat we import from Saudi Arabia for a 30-year period. It is a very \nsignificant amount.\n  Some people say that is a 200-day supply. That is totally unrealistic \nbecause that assumes there would be no other oil produced anywhere in \nthe world. Obviously the Russians, the Venezuelans, and the others \nwould produce.\n  So as we look at potential energy sources here at home, I think we \nhave to look to the advanced technology that we have been able to \ndevelop in this country and the record of opening up areas in the \nArctic such as Prudhoe Bay, where we find a contribution of nearly 20 \npercent of the total crude oil produced in this country. That has come \nabout over a period of 23 years. The significance of that speaks for \nitself.\n  You might not like oil fields, but Prudhoe Bay is the best in the \nworld. We could have the same potential by opening up that small sliver \nof the Arctic known as the 1002 area.\n  The interesting thing is that industry tells us, out of 1.5 million \nacres, we would probably utilize as little as 2,000 acres--not much \nbigger than a medium-sized farm--to open up the area.\n  I was rather interested in looking at the Christian Science Monitor \nthe other day. They did a poll across America on what the attitude \nwould be of opening ANWR. The poll was 58 to 34 in favor. That is a \nrather startling result, and I think it surprised some of the folks at \nthe newspaper as well.\n  The point is, charity does begin at home. There are those on the \nother side who simply blame big oil. I remind them, where was big oil \nwhen they were handing out oil a year ago at $10 a barrel? Big oil in \nthis country--Exxon, British Petroleum, Chevron, Texaco--does not set \nthe price of oil. Do you know why? Because we are so dependent on \nimports. Saudi Arabia, OPEC, Mexico, Venezuela--they are the suppliers. \nThey are supplying us with 58 percent. They set the price. We are \naddicted; we pay it; and that is the consequence of becoming so \ndependent when, indeed, we have the technology in this country to open \nup some of these frontiers safely.\n  We have, in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, an unused capacity of a \nmillion barrels a day. As a consequence, the development of that \nportion of ANWR could be done very easily, and it could be done very \nquickly. If we had the conviction of our commitments to simply make a \nstatement that that is our intention, there is no question in the mind \nof this Senator we would see oil drop $10 a barrel. We saw the \nPresident's action the other day when he pulled 30 million barrels out \nof the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The price dropped from $37 a barrel \nto somewhere in the area of $32 a barrel.\n\n  Let me conclude with a little evaluation of the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve and the actions, or should I say the ``mis-actions'' of the \nadministration handling them.\n  As we know, when the Vice President made a recommendation to the \nPresident that we sell 30 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve, the price was nearly $37 a barrel, prices which last month \nprompted the administration, of course, to release this oil from SPR. \nNow word comes from the Department of Energy that initially only 7 \nmillion barrels of that original 30 million barrels would have to go up \nfor rebid. It is kind of interesting because they waived the normal bid \nrequirements. They didn't require normal financial responsibility. They \nsaid they would do that later. Three of the bidders could not meet the \ndemands, and as a consequence they had to bid it again. But they \nrecognized their mistake the next time because they did require the \nbidders meet financial capability for performance.\n  In any event, according to the Department of Energy's own analysis, \n20 million of the 30 million barrels will simply displace foreign oil \nimports. The reason for that is our refineries are running at 96-\npercent capacity. They cannot, basically, take any more oil. They can \nonly get so much out through this process because we have not built new \nrefineries in 10 years. We have simply increased some of our larger \nrefineries. We have also lost about 37 refineries in the last decade. \nIt is not a very attractive business to be in.\n  In any event, the Department of Energy has decided that out of the 30 \nmillion barrels, there are probably going to be only 10 million barrels \nthat are going to be refined into finished product. Currently, U.S. \nrefinery yields are about 8 percent heating oil and 92 percent other \nproducts, whether it be gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and so forth. So if \nwe do the math, while the Department of Energy suggests 3 million to 5 \nmillion barrels of heating oil will result from the SPR release, we \nfind that the testimony from those representing the Department of \nEnergy uses the terminology ``distillates.''\n  What are distillates? They would lead you to believe this was heating \noil and would benefit the Northeast, but it is not. We found out that \ncurrent refinery yields of 10 million barrels of SPR oil will yield \nonly 800,000 barrels of heating oil. That is less than a 1-day supply.\n  When you look at the intent of the administration's effort to open up \nthe SPR, it was to increase the heating oil supply availability in the \nNortheast, a portion of the country that does not have the availability \nof natural gas. Their objective was not achieved. They have less than a \n1-day supply out of this sale. How ironic.\n  What they did is they did manipulate the price because the price did \ndrop, but the supply did not increase. If the administration's intent \nwas to get more heating oil to the market, that certainly was not the \nway to do it. They could have explored thoroughly the offer by the \nVenezuelan state oil company to produce heating oil for direct delivery \nto the United States or they could have made a greater effort to \nconvince companies to voluntarily reduce exports, refine product until \nstocks were at a more comfortable level.\n\n  Again, I refer you to the objective. The objective was not met. \nManipulation of the price was. But I do not think this was the real \nreason for the SPR release. As I have indicated, the real reason was to \nmanipulate the price. They had some success. Prices did dip down to $31 \na barrel. But we have seen that erased, with prices back up to $34 a \nbarrel.\n  Heating oil stocks in the Northeast have actually declined. They have \ndeclined 600,000 barrels since the administration came up with the idea \nof releasing the SPR crude oil, which has to be refined and, \nincidentally, is not going to be made available until November.\n  One of the more interesting things they left out of the sale was no \nprohibition against exporting the SPR oil, so many of the profiteers in \noil simply bid the oil in with the idea of exporting it. There was no \nban on exports and there was no ban on heating oil. The market in \nEurope is higher than the U.S. Some traders will simply refine that \ncrude oil, turn it into heating oil, and export it to Europe because \nthey had no prohibition in their bid.\n  The administration's logic was flawed when it announced this, and it \nseems to have only gotten worse. The bottom line is, rather than \nincrease domestic production of oil and gas to ensure our energy \nsecurity, again the administration falls back to its reliance on \nforeign oil imports, posing significant threat to our national \nsecurity, undermining our foreign policy in the Mideast, and the \nadministration's strategy is also to try to manipulate prices when \nnecessary by releasing oil from SPR.\n  We need a real energy policy, such as that proposed by one of the \ncandidates for President, Governor Bush; one that ensures a clean, \naffordable, secure energy supply for American consumers, one that \nincreases domestic production of oil and gas. Why should we be \nexploring in the rain forests of Colombia where there are no \nenvironmental considerations? Instead, we should be using our \ntechnology to develop the frontier areas in the overthrust belt in my \nState of Alaska. We need to expand the use of alternative fuels and \nrenewable energy, which is part of the Bush-Cheney plan, and we need \nimproved energy efficiency for all kinds of energy uses. I am pleased \nto say that is a position Governor Bush supports as well.\n\n[[Page S11293]]\n\n  The emphasis of this administration has been on natural gas. The only \nproblem is there has been a tremendous increase in the price of natural \ngas. Natural gas was $2.16, as I said, 10 months ago. It is $5.40 per \ndelivery per thousand cubic feet. The emphasis, particularly from our \nutility industry, is that they have nowhere to turn for a source of \nenergy other than natural gas. There has not been a new coal-fired \nplant built in this country since the mid-1990s. We have no new \nhydrodams. In fact, the administration is supporting taking out \nhydrodams in the West. There has been a collapse of our nuclear \nprogram. We cannot address the nuclear waste issue. We have not built a \nnew reactor in 15 to 20 years and none are on the horizon.\n  As a consequence, we need to go back to our energy policy and bring a \nbalance. Bring in nuclear. Obviously, it contributes to the quality of \nour air. Look at hydro, which we can safely develop. Look at clean \ncoal. We have the technology to do it. We can recognize that 50 percent \nof the homes dependent on natural gas are going to be subject to some \nsubstantial price increases if we do not develop more energy at home. \nAs a consequence, what we need here is a balanced energy policy. The \nadministration's energy policy is that there simply is not any.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11293-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NORTH KOREA\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, with the President contemplating a \nvisit to North Korea, I think it is fair to question the logic of that \nkind of a decision at this time. This historic meeting, if it does take \nplace between the two leaders, could have significant implications for \nNorth and South Korea. I will explain a little bit more.\n  The leader of North Korea has hinted at plans to cease missile \ntesting. He has indicated a proposed halt to the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction and North Korea's hermit-like isolation. I \nhave had the opportunity to visit North Korea. I was one of the first \nMembers of this body about 5 years ago to fly in an Air Force plane to \nNorth Korea, the first Air Force plane to fly there since 1943. It was \nan extraordinary lesson in a country that is probably as backward as \nany nation on Earth.\n  In any event, it is fair to say our Secretary of State, in completing \na series of historic meetings with the North Korean leaders in \nPyongyang, has set the stage pretty much for a Presidential visit.\n  The concern I have associated with the development of a rapport \nbetween North and South Korea, I wonder just what the benefit of a U.S. \nintervention could be at this time. Still, while improving relations \ncertainly is a cause for optimism, I do not think it is really time to \ncelebrate.\n  North Korea has a horrendous record. For over 50 years, it has been a \nliving embodiment, if you will, of George Orwell's nightmarish visions. \nThe original Big Brother, Kim Il-Song, has been replaced by his son. A \nlegacy of terror and aggression pervades in that country. Recent \nefforts to recast North Korea's leader Kim Chong-il as a likable fellow \nstrikes me as little out of character. Here is a man whose regime has \nfor years been at the top of America's terrorist watch list. There is \nno question he assassinated South Korean officials in Burma several \nyears ago. They fired missiles across Japanese territory not long ago \nand actively sought to develop nuclear capability. It has been a regime \nwhose policy has resulted in mass starvation of its people, that \ndiverts food and resources of the neediest to feed and house the few \nwho live in splendor, and develop, obviously, their weapons capability.\n  This is a man who utters an offhand remark suggesting that North \nKorea could be convinced to halt its missile program, and the \nadministration seems to hail him as showing ``a willingness to \nundertake reform.'' I guess I am not quite ready to buy that yet. I \nthink that is a naive approach. I am a little more skeptical.\n  At every turn, North Korea's concessions have turned out to be false \npromises made strictly to blackmail U.S. and South Korea into giving \ndirect economic assistance to the bankrupt North.\n  I wonder why we are so eager to believe that North Korea's apparent \nconcessions now are anything other than a pretext.\n  Like my colleagues, I certainly applaud South Korea's President Kim \nDae-jung's sunshine diplomacy efforts to reduce North-South tensions. \nHis efforts have been admirable. I think the Koreans should be taking \nthe lead themselves in rebuilding the trust between the two nations. \nOnly through that direct effort by the two sides, free of outside \ninterference, can tensions truly be resolved.\n  As a consequence, I worry that the administration's bull-in-the-\nChina-shop-like interjection of itself into the dialog threatens to \ndictate, perhaps overwhelm, the delicate process of trust building.\n\n  Already we have seen North Korea delay fulfillment of its commitments \nto South Korea because it ``was too busy'' preparing for Secretary \nAlbright's visit. This suggests to me that the North might shift \nattention to relations with the U.S. and away from South Korea and have \nthe effect of undermining attempts at a true accord between North and \nSouth.\n  I understand President Clinton is anxious for a foreign policy \naccomplishment in light of the difficulties in the Mideast. He \ncertainly worked toward resolution. It is unfortunate that has not \nhappened. In any event, the question of peaceful and secure relations \nwith North Korea would be a valuable legacy, but I question the direct \ninvolvement in the process and whether or not that shifting away from \nthe South Korean dialog with the North to the intervention of the U.S. \nmay be harmful at this time.\n  Not only would efforts to reach a speedy agreement with North Korea \nbe premature, in my opinion, it would seem to reward the North for 50 \nyears of aggression as thanks for 6 months of sunshine.\n  Both the prospects for peace and the President's legacy would be best \nserved if he were to stay, I believe, on the sidelines and allow the \nU.S.-North Korean relations to proceed as they have been, with caution \nand balance. I urge the President to put diplomacy ahead of legacy and \nnot spend the final days of his administration interposing the U.S. \nbetween the two Koreas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11293-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11293-S11294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CARA LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord page 19 of the specific legislation authorizing the CARA \nlegislation, which establishes a program affecting the Outer \nContinental Shelf revenue stream.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       ``(8) The term `qualified Outer Continental Shelf revenues' \n     means all amounts received by the United States from each \n     leased tract or portion of a leased tract lying seaward of \n     the zone defined and governed by section 8(g) of this Act, or \n     lying within such zone but to which section 8(g) does not \n     apply, the geographic center of which lies within a distance \n     of 200 miles from any part of the coastline of any Coastal \n     State, including bonus bids, rents, royalties (including \n     payments for royalties taken in kind and sold), net profit \n     share payments, and related late payment interest.

Mr. President, the purpose of my reference is that I \nhappen to be chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nwhich historically has had jurisdiction over Outer Continental Shelf \nactivities. I was one of the major drafters of this legislation, along \nwith Representative Don Young in the House of Representatives.\n  In moving this legislation through yesterday morning, we found a \nsignificant change had been made in the legislation and that the \njurisdiction had been moved from the Energy Committee to Commerce and \ntaken from Interior and transferred over to the Secretary of Commerce.\n  I know this cannot be seen, but there are handwritten notations at \nthe end that simply say: ``11(a) the term 'Secretary' means Secretary \nof Commerce.''\n\n[[Page S11294]]\n\n  There are extraordinary things done in late times around here. This \nwas done at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning the day before yesterday, and \nno one can identify who did it. But the bill was filed, the order has \nbeen made, and there is absolutely nothing we can do other than \nquestion the authenticity of someone who would simply change the \nlegislation, not initial it, have no identification. I have checked \nwith the Appropriations Committee. I have checked with the Members of \nthe House involved. Nobody owns up to changing the designation of the \nCARA bill from the Energy Committee in the Department of Interior over \nto the Commerce Committee and the Secretary of Commerce.\n  The bill has been filed. As a consequence, the question is, What can \nwe do about it? The President may veto the legislation. We may have \nanother opportunity.\n  On the other hand, we did have a colloquy by Senator Lott, Senator \nDaschle, Senator Byrd, Senator Stevens, and myself. I think it \naddresses the reality that the best thing we can do is get out of here. \nI know the Presiding Officer would agree. But as we look at what we are \ncoming back to tomorrow, a single vote on a continuing resolution for 1 \nday--and another one on Sunday--it seems to be an effort in futility.\n  But in any event, Mr. President, I thank you for being patient, and \nparticularly the staff, as well, who probably had hoped this Senator \nwould not show up when he walked in the door.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/27/senate-section/article/S11294-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
