Mr. President, I learned shortly before Senator Lott came \nto the floor last night that Senator Coverdell had passed away. I felt \nit was in my best interest to leave at that time and not be present on \nthe floor, as I usually am.\n  It was unique, in that I am in the minority--Senator Coverdell was in \nthe majority--that I got to know him as well as I did. I always knew \nthat things were moving along and that we were going to get legislation \ncompleted when I would look over and Senator Coverdell had been called \ninto the Chamber by Senator Lott to help move legislation.\n  As I look back, I remember the bankruptcy legislation. We started out \nwith a little over 300 amendments on that legislation. Everyone thought \nit was futile to even try to pass it, but, of course, Senator Coverdell \ncame in and worked with me and the Senators on his side and my side, \nand we were able to get that legislation cleared and basically \ncompleted. That was the story for many, many different pieces of \nlegislation.\n  I got to know him. He was very calm and deliberate and extremely \ncourteous and polite--a real gentleman. I think it speaks volumes to \nrecognize that Senator Lott's No. 1 person he called on when there was \ntrouble on the floor was Paul Coverdell. I think it speaks volumes to \nindicate that Governor Bush's No. 1 person in the Senate was Paul \nCoverdell.\n  He was someone that the people of Georgia will miss, this country \nwill miss, the Senate will miss. I personally will miss him.\n  I have the honor of working on the minority side to help move \nlegislation along. I personally will miss him. He was very, very good \nat being a legislator, in addition, obviously, to being such a good \nfriend to everyone.\n\n[[Page S7174]]\n\n  I express my sympathy to Nancy and his staff. Speaking for the entire \nminority, we will miss a great legislator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/19/senate-section/article/S7174-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, when my constituents ask me, what is the \nnicest thing about being a Senator, what do you enjoy the most, I have \na ready answer: It is the people, the people we get to meet, the \nopportunities we have to interact with some of the most extraordinary \nindividuals throughout the world.\n  When I say that, my constituents immediately think of the great \nnames: Presidents of the United States, Presidents of other countries, \nfamous Prime Ministers. Schoolchildren look at me and say: Have you \never met President Clinton? They are always a little in awe when I say \nyes. Then others, when I tell them of having met President Gorbachev, \nPresident Mubarak, or Chairman Arafat or some of the other names they \nread about all the time, say: Well, we can understand why you think \nthat the people you get to meet is the fun part of the job and the most \nextraordinary benefit that comes from being a Senator. And that is \ntrue--meeting these famous people is something of a trip and a great \nopportunity.\n  I always explain to them that the great privilege is not only meeting \nthe famous names. It is meeting my fellow Senators. This is an \nextraordinary body, filled with extraordinary individuals, many of \nwhose names never get into the headlines beyond their own States or \noutside of the circle of the beltway, but who bring to this body an \nincredible background of wisdom, experience, humor, perspective, \nbalance, and understanding that makes it a great privilege and blessing \nfor the rest of us to be with them.\n  Paul Coverdell and I came in the same class. We were sworn in on the \nsame day. We went through the experience of being freshman Senators who \ndidn't quite know our way around.\n  We would get together on a weekly basis, those in that class, and \nswap stories about how we had foolishly gone to the wrong room, or lost \nour way in a corridor, or found ourselves buried in the unexpected tide \nof work, mail, phone calls, and requests. We went through all that \ntogether as friends. We decided, in taking advantage of our situation \nas freshmen and serving in the minority, we would use the time that \ncomes with that condition--time which more senior and majority Senators \ndon't have--to educate ourselves and prepare ourselves for the service \non which we were embarking.\n  Paul arranged a trip to Kennebunkport to see his good friends, George \nand Barbara. The rest of us didn't call them George and Barbara. It was \nMr. President and Mrs. Bush. Paul knew them well enough, went back long \nenough with them, that he arranged for the freshmen class of \nRepublicans to go up to Maine and spend a day with the Bushes. It was \nabout 3 or 4 months after President Bush had lost the election. He was \nfull of stories, reflections, and philosophic observations. It was a \nwonderful time. We also went together, under the sponsorship of Senator \nDole, to New Jersey to have a similar day with President Nixon. Paul \nwas one of those who would use that, and any other occasion, to learn \nas much as he could soak up, to prepare himself as much as he could for \nwhatever might come. That was one of the delightful things about it. He \nwas enormously curious, always searching, and always anxious to find \nout how he could be of greater help.\n  We finally stopped meeting every week as we got busier ourselves and \nas we got a little more experienced in the way the Senate works, so \nthat we didn't need to commiserate quite so much about our earlier \nblunders. But our class remained close. We gathered together when Kay \nBailey Hutchison was under fire in Texas and gave a little party for \nher before she left for her trial. We told her we would keep things \nstraight until she could come back fully exonerated, which, of course, \nshe has done. Paul was a moving force in putting together that bit of \nsolidarity among the members of our class.\n  Paul is the one who moved on to a leadership position in our class. \nWe were all proud of him, all happy to support him. It goes without \nsaying that we will miss him terribly. But it is my conviction, Mr. \nPresident, that as we mourn, we do not mourn for Paul. I don't know the \ndetails of what goes on, but I think it is not out of the question to \nthink that John Chafee may be showing Paul the ropes now, suggesting to \nhim that ``it will work a little better if you go this way,'' or, \n``Yes, I tried that when I first got here. Paul, let me show you the \nropes.'' That may not be happening, but I don't think it is beyond the \nrealm of possibility.\n  We do not mourn for Paul; we mourn for ourselves, for the loss we \nhave sustained, not for the problems he faces. The problems he faced \nare behind him now, as far as this life is concerned. And, knowing \nPaul, he will be learning, inquiring, asking questions, trying to find \nout and progressing still further, as he always did as a Member of the \nSenate. It is our loss that moves us to tears--the fact that we will no \nlonger have his companionship and his wisdom and his friendship. But \njust as I suggest John Chafee may be greeting Paul, we can be confident \nthat whenever the time might be for the rest of us, Paul will be there \nto greet us, and that helps lift some of the gloom and sorrow we feel \non this occasion.\n  I extend to Nancy and other members of Paul's family my deepest \nsympathy and condolences at this time. And I express gratitude, once \nagain, for the experiences I have had as a Senator of knowing great \npeople, meeting extraordinary individuals, and partaking of their \nwisdom and guidance. I count Paul Coverdell in the first ranks of that \ngroup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, except for those who knew Paul Coverdell and \nhis constituents in Georgia, I suspect it is very hard for others who \nmay be watching here today or who hear other tributes to Paul Coverdell \nto appreciate the depth of sadness that all of us in this Senate family \nfeel by the loss of Senator Paul Coverdell.\n  Paul Coverdell was a special man. He was so active in nearly \neverything going on in the Senate that it is impossible to believe he \nis gone. The images of Paul smiling, gesturing, counseling, are still \nso fresh. If there was an indispensable Senator, Paul Coverdell was it.\n  Paul was a doer, as we all know. He was successful not because of his \nenergy alone--though that was considerable--but because he was trusted \nby all and he sought no recognition for himself. His judgment was \nsound, his intelligence keen. He was always kind and cheerful, never \ncritical. The word ``helpful'' does not even begin to describe the aid \nand assistance he was always so ready to provide.\n  I have lost a real friend and a confidant. Georgia and America have \nlost a great leader. Paul's family's loss is incalculable, especially \nfor Nancy and his mother. Our sense of grief is tempered only by the \nfaith that the Lord has His own purposes. We take comfort in the wisdom \nof Abraham Lincoln who said:\n\n\n[[Page S7175]]\n\n\n       Surely God would not have created such a being as man, with \n     an ability to grasp the infinite, to exist only for a day. \n     No, no, man was made for immortality.\n\n  Godspeed, Senator Paul Coverdell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as the American Revolution drew to a close \nin 1782, a Philadelphian turned to his friend, Dr. Benjamin Rush, and \nremarked, ``It looks as if the battle for independence has been won.''\n  Dr. Rush replied, ``Sir, you are mistaken. The Revolutionary War may \nbe over, but the battle of independence has just begun.''\n  On the day before he died, as I had the opportunity to spend time \nwith Paul Coverdell and his family, I thought about these words, and \nthey have stayed in my mind over the last 48 hours because that idea--\nthat only constant vigilance can keep the flame of freedom from being \nextinguished--is one that perhaps no one believed in more, at least \nsince I have been in the Senate, or acted upon more decisively than \nPaul Coverdell. With his passing, America has lost one of its most \nprincipled leaders and freedom, one of its staunchest friends.\n  There will be a number of comments made today by people who have \nknown Paul well, who have observed his commitment, his discipline, and \nhis willingness to do jobs that most people leave to others, jobs he \ndid in a way that was humble, gentle, and gave others the credit. We \nwill hear again and again today because they were the hallmark of Paul \nCoverdell's work in this wonderful institution called the Senate.\n  As a Senator from the neighboring State of Tennessee, I had the \nopportunity to work side by side with Paul Coverdell as we addressed \nissues important to both our States. But if there is one idea, one \nword, that best summarizes Paul Coverdell, his commitment to public \nservice, to family and community, the word is ``freedom.'' Paul \nCoverdell was a relentless, tireless champion of freedom.\n  I first met Paul 6 years ago when I was still Bill Frist, the \nphysician who wanted to be a United States Senator. Paul sat down, and \ntalked to me about freedom. He came to help me with a campaign event in \nChattanooga, TN, and his whole talk--while saying, ``Yes, people, come \nout and support this new guy on the block, Bill Frist''--was about \nfreedom.\n  And since I have been in the Senate, he continually fought for \nfreedom. He fought for the rights of individuals to raise, educate and \nprovide for their families free of government intervention and \nexcessive taxation. He fought to protect the privacy of individual tax \nreturns. He fought to free local education from too much federal \ncontrol. Believing freedom to be under genuine attack from the \ncorrupting influence of drugs, he fought to increase funding for law \nenforcement, especially along our borders, and created a program to \ncoordinate resistance to drugs among parents, teachers and communities \nthat became a model for the nation. Understanding, as Jefferson did, \nthat a well-educated citizenry is the surest foundation for freedom and \nhappiness, Paul Coverdell fought to ensure that all children, \nregardless of income, receive the very best education from kindergarten \nto college.\n  Perhaps it was his service with the U.S. Army in Okinawa that fanned \nthe flames of freedom that never seemed to diminish in his heart. \nPerhaps it was his parents' ability--and I got to know his mom over the \nlast 48 hours--to turn a small family business into a successful \nnationwide enterprise that strengthened his belief in the power of the \nindividual to achieve the American Dream. Perhaps it was his experience \nwith emerging democracies as President Bush's Director of the Peace \nCorp that deepened his resolve to ensure that freedom, once planted, \nhas everything it needs to survive. President Bush and I spoke about \nthat shortly after Paul was admitted to the hospital. Or perhaps it was \nhis beloved wife, Nancy, who is going through such a difficult time \nright now, who helped him realize that love and freedom are the great \ngifts God has planted in the human heart, and so we must do all we can \nto preserve them.\n  Whatever the reasons, Paul Coverdell believed in freedom, and he \nbelieved in America--the greatest expression of freedom next to man \nhimself. He fought for both America and freedom because he understood, \nas Justice Brandeis once wrote, that ``liberty is the secret of \nhappiness, and courage, the secret of liberty.''\n  Over the past few years, I had the honor and the privilege of seeing \nPaul Coverdell's courage up close--in the Senate Republican Working \nGroup on Medicare, where his commitment to our seniors was very \napparent; in the Foreign Relations Committee, where he specialized in \nareas of the world not addressed by others; a commitment that obviously \ngrew out of his work with the Peace Corps; in Republican strategy \nsessions, where his expert guidance helped us ensure that the American \npeople, as well as our colleagues, understood the importance of the \nissues before us. It was a quiet courage, characterized not by bluster, \nbut by humility and respect for others.\n  Paul Coverdell knew what was right, and every day on this floor and \nin strategy sessions behind the scenes, he worked for what was right \nwith all his might. Through men like him, the American Revolution is \nconstantly reborn, the reservoir of freedom continually replenished, \nand all that is best America preserved for those who will follow.\n  He was a wonderful husband, a great citizen of Georgia and the United \nStates, an outstanding Senator--as reflected by his position of \nleadership--and a great patriot. He will be sorely missed by all \nMembers of this body.\n  May the Lord God who loves us all, shine His perpetual light upon our \ncolleague, and comfort Nancy, his mother, and Nancy's parents in the \ndays ahead.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from South Carolina \nis recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words regarding the \ndeath of Senator Paul Coverdell.\n  Winding its way to the sea, the Savannah River forms a natural \nboundary between South Carolina and the State of Georgia. Yet the river \nis not a barrier dividing these two states. Rather, its lakes, \ntributaries, and bridges bring the people of these two states together \nas neighbors and friends. As neighbors, we share many fine attributes \nof southern living and culture, agriculture, and the values that \nAmericans hold dear. As friends, we work and play together, raising our \nfamilies and supporting our communities.\n  Today, I rise to pay tribute and respect to my neighbor and friend \nfrom Georgia, Senator Paul Coverdell. Senator Coverdell was my \nneighbor. He was more than just a colleague from a neighboring state. \nFor the past eight years we have walked together and worked in the same \ncorridor of the Russell Senate Office Building.\n  Senator Coverdell was also my friend. Everyday, each of us looked \nforward to his warm smile, kind words, and expressions of care and \nconcern. As I worked with him on regional issues, in the Senate \nRepublican Leadership circle, where he served as Republican Conference \nSecretary, or in more general circumstances, Senator Coverdell always \nwas thoughtful and considerate of others.\n  Senator Coverdell leaves a great legacy. His life was dedicated to \nserving others and his Nation. After serving in the U.S. Army, he \nreturned to Georgia and built the family business into a successful \nnationwide company. Elected to the Georgia State Senate, he was chosen \nby his peers to serve as Senate Minority Leader, a post he held for 15 \nyears. In 1989, President Bush named him as Director of the United \nStates Peace Corps, where he redefined the agency's mission to serve \nthe emerging democracies of Eastern Europe.\n  Since his election in 1992, Senator Coverdell has worked hard in the \nSenate as a defender of freedom. He led the fight against international \nnarcotics and terrorism. Understanding that freedom is nurtured by a \nwell-educated citizenry, he introduced education reforms, and served as \nChairman of the Senate Republican Task Force on Education. Senator \nCoverdell fought to protect the individual economic and political \nliberty of individuals and families.\n  We mourn the loss of Paul Coverdell. We shall miss his companionship,\n\n[[Page S7176]]\n\nbut we will not forget the bond we had with him. Though his voice is \nsilenced, we shall not forget the encouraging words he had for others. \nThough he now rests in peace, the impact of his good deeds will be felt \nfor years to come.\n  Shortly before his death, our former colleague Senator Everett \nDirksen, responded to the question which each person faces. It is found \nin the Bible, in the book of Job: ``If a man die, shall he live \nagain?'' (Job 14:14.) I quote Senator Dirksen's words published in U.S. \nNews & World Report, November 8, 1965, p. 124:\n\n       What mortal being, standing on the threshold of infinity, \n     has not pondered what lies beyond the veil which separates \n     the seen from the unseen? What mortal being, responding to \n     that mystical instinct that earthly dissolution is at hand, \n     has not contemplated what lies beyond the grave? What mortal \n     being, upon whom has descended that strange and serene \n     resignation that life's journey is about at an end, has not \n     thought about that eternal destination and what might be \n     there?\n       If there be a design in this universe and in this world in \n     which we live, there must be a Designer. Who can behold the \n     inexplicable mysteries of the universe without believing that \n     there is a design for all mankind and also a Designer? . . . \n     ``If a man die, shall he live again?'' Surely he shall, as \n     surely as day follows night, as surely as the stars follow \n     their courses, as surely as the crest of every wave brings \n     its trough.\n\n  William Wordsworth, the revered poet, captured in verse a glimpse of \nthis glorious plan and entitled his classic ``Ode to Immortality'':\n\n     Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:\n     The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,\n     Hath had elsewhere its setting,\n     And cometh from afar:\n     Not in entire forgetfulness,\n     And not in utter nakedness,\n     But trailing clouds of glory do we come\n     From God, who is our home:\n     Heaven lies about us in our infancy!\n\n  Paul Coverdell was a bright star in this world. Though it is now out \nof view, it is not dimmed. We take comfort that he has returned home, \nto his eternal destination. This day, my thoughts and prayers are with \nhis wife Nancy, his family, his staff, and his constituents. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Last night, as we began consideration of the Agricultural \nappropriations bill, we were informed of the death of Senator \nCoverdell. The bill officially is still on the floor this morning for \nSenators who wish to speak on the bill but more appropriately for \nSenators who wish to speak about Senator Coverdell, who we all remember \nas an outstanding Senator, a good, a kind, and a decent man, a great \npatriot, and a great American.\n  We will be officially in session on the bill but more appropriately \nhere to listen to remarks by fellow Senators in his behalf.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it has been my honor, and a privilege, to \nknow our distinguished friend and colleague, Paul Coverdell, for a long \ntime. I have had, overnight, the opportunity to think about his life \nand about his death.\n  When a man dies, especially a friend, we are inevitably struck by the \nfrailty of life, the speed of death, and the very painful void that is \nleft behind. With the passing of our friend and colleague, Paul \nCoverdell, we are also struck by the promise of a truly brilliant \nfuture left unfulfilled.\n  Alphonse de Lamartine once said:\n\n       Sometimes, when one person is absent, the whole world seems \n     less.\n\n  Today, that is exactly how I feel. The world seems less today.\n  Paul and I worked together for many years. We were sworn into the \nGeorgia State Senate on the same day, in January of 1971. In Georgia, \nwe sit not as partisans, across the aisle, but we sit by numbers of our \nState senate districts. Fate had it that Senator Paul Coverdell sat \nright in front of me. So even though he was of one party and I another, \nwe shared space on the floor of the State senate. We worked together in \nharmony for 4 years. It was a joyous time. It was a marvelous time to \nget to know this young talent.\n  When I came to the U.S. Senate, Paul had preceded me. Paul stood on \nthe floor of the Senate here with my parents watching from the balcony \nas I was sworn in. After that day, he helped me, he guided me, tutored \nme in the same way we had worked together so beautifully in the early \n1970s in the Georgia senate. From time to time in this body, on \ndifferent sides of the aisle, we were on different sides of the issues. \nBut he helped me learn. He helped me because he was a good man and a \ngreat friend, because he knew it was good for Georgia and for the \ncountry.\n  I watched him work, incredulous--putting in 12- and 14- and 16-hour \ndays. In Georgia, we have a saying: You are either a workhorse or a \nshow horse. He was certainly a work horse. He fought hard for our \nState, for our farmers and businesses and the average taxpaying \ncitizen. He used his deep breadth of knowledge in international \naffairs, which he had gained as Director of the Peace Corps, to fight \nwhat he called the most serious threat to America's freedom today--the \nwar on drugs.\n  Our colleague, Senator Moynihan, yesterday called Paul Coverdell a \nman of peace. I will reiterate that observation. From his time in the \nGeorgia senate to his post as head of the Peace Corps under President \nBush, to his quiet and wonderful leadership in the Senate, Paul had a \npeaceful and resolute efficiency about his work that I think we could \nall try to emulate. He worked hard. He achieved results. And he didn't \ncare who got the credit. To lose a leader of this quality in this body \nin this day of ``gotcha'' politics, and one-upmanship, is a loss for \nthis body and for our country and for Georgia.\n  Paul was a leader. He led in his own quiet, positive way. I never \nheard him speak an ill thought or an ill phrase or a mean-tempered \ncomment about anyone. He was a great legislator and a dear personal \nfriend.\n  I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife Nancy, whom I have known \nfor almost 30 years. I knew them when they first got married.\n  Proverbs tell us:\n\n       Good men must die, but death cannot kill their names.\n\n  I think we can all take great comfort in that. Nothing will lessen \nthe impact that Paul Coverdell and his legacy have had on the State of \nGeorgia and on this country. It is not the time for political thoughts \nor words but only words to remember one of the best U.S. Senators this \nbody has ever known. Paul Coverdell, United States Senator from \nGeorgia, a peach of a guy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, cheerful, fun, accessible, down to \nearth, loyal, friend--those are the words you think of immediately when \ndescribing Paul Coverdell. I am not going to make a long statement \ntoday because I know there will be a time set aside for our memorials \nto Paul Coverdell. I have seen some of our friends today--Paul's \nfriends, my friends--and many of them do not feel capable of talking \nabout him right now. It is not that he wasn't one of our greatest \nfriends. They are not here because they can't talk about him yet.\n  This is a man who served our country in so many ways, all the things \na good citizen should do: He served in the Army; he was the head of the \nPeace Corps; he was a wonderful Senator, one of our leaders in the \nmajority--the fourth highest ranking among us.\n  I do want to say more about him later, but for now I think our \nmajority leader said it very well last night. All of our hearts are \nbroken for the loss of this wonderful man who will have every tribute \nthat we can give him in the future weeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this is a sad day for all of us. It is a \nsad time in\n\n[[Page S7177]]\n\nthe Senate. Paul Coverdell was, first of all, our friend. He was \nsomeone who, if we took a secret poll in this Senate, I think many \nMembers would say, was their best friend. That tells us something about \nthis man.\n  He was a kind, he was a gentle, he was a sweet man. This Senate will \nnot be the same without Paul. It will not be the same because of that \nkindness, because of that spirit, because of that unbelievable energy \nhe brought to any task he took on, and did he take on the task. \nWhatever it was, Paul would do it and do it effectively. He was one of \nthe key people in making this Senate run. Candidly, he was that person \nnot because of his leadership position, which was significant, but the \nleadership position he obtained was a result of the fact that he was \none of the key players in the Senate and he got things done.\n  That effectiveness came because of his energy, because of his drive, \nbecause of his determination, but it also came because he could get \nalong with people on both sides of the aisle. He knew people, he \nunderstood them, he liked people and people liked him back, and that \nmade him effective.\n  He was effective because he did not have a big ego. We all have big \negos in the Senate, but Paul did not seem to have one. He did not seem \nto care if he got credit; another rarity, I suppose, among politicians. \nHe just got the job done. He was always seeking some way to get it \ndone. He did not seek the limelight. He did not worry about who got the \ncredit.\n  Each one of us brings different stories or remembers different things \nabout Paul Coverdell. I worked with him on Central American issues, \nCaribbean issues, and Latin American issues. Paul Coverdell is from \nGeorgia. It was not necessarily logical that he had to concentrate on \nthis hemisphere or worry about this hemisphere, but he did. He did \nbecause he understood it affected the people of Georgia and it affected \nthe people of this country. He brought his passion to deal with the \ndrug problem to that concentration and work on this hemisphere.\n  I worked with Paul when we worked on the Caribbean initiative, when \nwe worked on the initial drug bill we passed several years ago on drug \ninterdiction in this hemisphere, and I worked with him when we were \nable to pass the Colombia aid bill.\n  I remember on both bills going to Paul at different times and saying: \nPaul, this is not going very well. What do we do?\n  Not only did the leadership responsibility go to Paul Coverdell to \nget things done, but people who are not in leadership went to Paul to \nget things done. I remember Paul would look at you, as only Paul could, \nand say: Well, let's do this. And he would tick off three or four \nthings. Basically then I had the plan. We got it done. That is what we \nare going to miss in this Senate.\n  The last time I talked with Paul was as we were leaving for the \nweekend. I said: I am worried about what is going on in Colombia. Why \ndon't you and I go down there.\n  He said: Let's do it. So we were talking about a trip sometime in the \nnext few months to Colombia to look firsthand at the problem.\n  I know all of us at a later date will have more formal comments to \nmake, but I wanted to pause here for a moment with my colleagues to say \nthank you for the life of Paul Coverdell. He is someone who made a \ndifference every single day he was in the Senate. We will miss him very \ndeeply.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to speak about my colleague, \nSenator Coverdell. I know other Senators have. I absolutely have \nnothing rehearsed. There are many Senators who will speak about Senator \nCoverdell probably in a more profound and moving way than I can.\n  There is one moment I want to remember about Senator Coverdell \nbecause this small story tells a large story. We had had a major debate \nabout the Colombia aid package. Senator Coverdell and I were in a \ndebate. We did not agree. It was a pretty good debate back and forth. I \nknow from time to time during the debate I would reach over and touch \nhis hand and say something to the effect: I just cannot believe you \nsaid this; this is wrong--something like that.\n  At the end of the debate, I said, because I believed it and believe \nit: Senator Coverdell is a really good Senator.\n  He smiled and touched my hand and said: Senator Wellstone is a really \ngood Senator.\n  I do not know if the latter part is true, but the point is that is \nthe way he was. That is the kind of Senator he was. We talk about \ncivility. He was just a beautiful person. I really enjoyed him. We need \na lot of Senators like Senator Coverdell: Paul, you are wrong on the \nissues but you are a really good person.\n  The Senate has lost a wonderful person and a wonderful Senator, and \nthe United States of America has lost a wonderful person and a \nwonderful Senator.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, I send my love to Paul's family.\n  I will not forget Paul Coverdell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are all stunned and saddened by the \nsudden death of our friend and colleague. Our hearts and prayers are \nwith Senator Coverdell's wife Nancy, with his parents, with his family \nmembers, his many friends, and, I may say, particularly our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle who have lost not only a close friend \nbut a gifted leader.\n  The great English poet Alfred Tennyson wrote of a dear friend who \ndied suddenly: ``God's finger touched him, and he slept.''\n  Yesterday, God's hand touched our friend. Now he sleeps. And now we \nmourn.\n  Paul Coverdell's life was too short in years, but it was long in \naccomplishment: A husband, a son, a friend, a loyal ally, an honorable \nopponent, an Army veteran, a business owner, a State senator, a Peace \nCorps director, and a U.S. Senator.\n  In his 61 years, Paul Coverdell filled all of those roles--and more--\nwith dignity.\n  He spent half his life, and nearly all his adult life, in public \nservice. He and I didn't see eye to eye on a lot of matters. To be \nhonest, I can't think of too many times we found ourselves on the same \nside of the debate. But I can't think of a single time that he was not \nfair, that he was not decent, and that he was not honest.\n  Paul Coverdell, above and beyond anything else, was a gentleman. He \nwas a reminder to us that we can all disagree without being \ndisagreeable. He is also a reminder, sadly, that none of us knows how \nlong we will be here; how many more opportunities we will have in this \nlife to right a wrong or to advance a peace or to make a difference.\n  Last night, I was reading an interview Senator Coverdell gave a year \nor so ago. He was asked why he worked so hard on so many tasks, usually \nwith very little public recognition. He replied, characteristically: \n``If you have been given a moment here, you shouldn't let the dust grow \nunder you.''\n  Paul Coverdell felt that in the marrow of his bones. He worked hard \nevery day--to advance the causes he believed in and to serve the Nation \nhe loved--until God's finger touched him.\n  Now he sleeps the sleep of the just. We have lost a good and \nhonorable friend. I will miss him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, at this time of shock and loss we tend to \nfocus on Paul's death, but it seems to me that it is really a time that \nwe should focus on his life. As we weigh how our lives and the life of \nour Nation has been diminished by the loss of Paul Coverdell, I think \nit is important that we also reflect on how our lives have been \nenriched.\n  I first--I first met Paul Coverdell when I went to Georgia. He was \ncampaigning for the Senate. And he was doing an event in this dingy old \nsteel mill about industrial renewal. I had\n\n[[Page S7178]]\n\ntalked to him on the phone, I was--I was chairman of the Senatorial \nCommittee, but I had not seen him in action. So I got up and spoke, and \nthen Paul got up and spoke in that squeaky voice, and he sort of had a \nway of jumping up and down when he was speaking and waving his hands, \nso I tried to delicately whisper to him, quit jumping up and down, be \nstill, but little did I know at that moment that with all of his \noutward appearance and the squeaky voice, that this man had the heart \nof a lion.\n  He went on and won in that campaign. As chairman of the Senatorial \nCommittee I was involved in 67 Senate campaigns. And he won the \ntoughest race, defeated an incumbent, was in a runoff after the general \nelection when everybody else would have sat down, given up, gotten \ntired.\n  Paul Coverdell did not sit down and give up or get tired. He came to \nthe Senate and we were immediately involved in the Clinton health care \ndebate, and he and John McCain and I traveled all over America. We did \n147 events in this crusade to defeat the Clinton health care bill. And \nin all those events and all that travel--you all know Paul Coverdell--\nhe never got tired or never let on he was tired or got irritable.\n  In the Senate where we all want glory, we all want to be out front, \nwe all want to see our picture in the paper, Paul was one of those \nremarkable people who simply wanted to get things done. There was no \njob too small for Paul Coverdell. And there is no job too big for Paul \nCoverdell. Paul Coverdell managed in eight short years to become \nabsolutely indispensable to the United States Senate.\n  And I am very happy today about one thing--not much I am happy about \ntoday, but I am happy about one thing. We often feel something about \npeople--we often love people, but, but we don't often tell them that. \nIt's especially hard for men to tell other men that they love them. But \nwhat I am happy about--I can't quite get to it--is the following point. \nI realized over a year ago that Paul Coverdell had become an \nindispensable member of the Senate, that he was the greatest Senator \nfrom Georgia since Richard Russell. And so I always went to great \nlengths to say it. Here, in Georgia, and everywhere I got the \nopportunity to say it.\n\n  This is a hard time for the Senate, and I just would like to conclude \non the two points I tried to open up with but didn't quite get said. In \nthese terrible moments when we are shocked and hurt we tend to think \nabout how someone died. But at these moments it is critical that we \nfocus on how they lived. We tend to look at how our lives and the life \nof our nation have been diminished, but it is important that we focus \non how our lives were enriched by Paul Coverdell. My grandmother used \nto say that as long as anyone remembers you, that you're not dead. As \nlong as I live, Paul Coverdell will be remembered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The distinguished Senator \nfrom California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, yesterday this body lost one of its \nfinest Members. I greet this day with a very heavy heart.\n  Paul Coverdell was not only a good Senator, he was a good and decent \nman. I found him to be a very nice man. I worked with him closely as an \noriginal cosponsor of his Education Savings and School Excellence Act. \nI found him very dedicated and very easy to work with. I found him to \nbe above political correctness; he strived to do what he believed would \nwork and would help people.\n  We shared a common interest. We worked together on many antinarcotics \nefforts. We debated together on certification. I was his Democratic \ncosponsor of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. We talked \ntogether about what was happening. We tried to plan together. I found \nhim to have a deep and abiding knowledge about Mexico, Central America, \nand Latin America.\n  He had a kind of energy, enthusiasm, and dedication well known on \nboth sides of the aisle here in the Senate. He was never one to seek \nthe spotlight, but all of us here know how hard he worked. He wasn't \nthe proverbial ``show horse''--he was a workhorse.\n  He was a man who served the people of Georgia and this Nation with \ngreat distinction. He worked all of his adult life in public service. \nSimply put, Paul Coverdell made this body a better place and a more \ncollegial place. All one really had to do was spend time alone with him \nin an office and listen to him and his thoughts as he sought to frame \nand advance an issue.\n  Senator Harkin was in the elevator as I came up this morning. He \nsaid: ``It's so hard because on Friday he was alive and well in the \nSenate and today he simply is not here.''\n  There is a passage from the Book of Ecclesiastes--Chapter 5, verse \n12--I will leave with the Senate: ``The sleep of a laboring man is \nsweet.''\n  Paul Coverdell, you have labored hard. Your sleep will be sweet.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, it is with profound sadness and the \nheaviest of hearts that I come to the floor today to pay tribute to the \nmemory of a friend, a colleague, and a man who brought honor upon the \nState of Georgia, our country, and the institution of the Senate--Paul \nCoverdell. My deepest sympathies go out to his wife Nancy, Paul's \nfamily, friends and his staff at this most difficult of times.\n  It is tragedies like this that remind us that, beyond the policy and \nthe politics and the tremendous gravity of the issues we deliberate--\nbeyond the grandeur of this Chamber and the history we write on a daily \nbasis--we are at heart an institution of individuals--of people. And \nwhen one of our own is lost to us forever, all of us are diminished by \nthat loss.\n  I first met Paul when I was a member of the House Foreign Affairs \nCommittee and he came before us as President Bush's Director of the \nPeace Corps. I recall being struck not only by his obvious \nqualifications for the job, but by his warmth and his obvious esteem \nfor the mission he was chosen to fulfill. To help foster the ideals of \nfreedom and democracy for people throughout the world was for Paul a \nhigh and noble calling. And it was one he answered with typical energy \nand enthusiasm, optimism and hope.\n  Indeed, when I think about all that Paul was--all that he symbolized, \nall that he meant to those who cared about him and the people he \nserved--the single word that comes to my mind is, ``decency''. Paul \nCoverdell was many things: a devoted husband, a talented legislator, a \nstrong and principled leader--but above all else, Paul was simply one \nof the most decent human beings one could ever hope to know. And any of \nus should be so fortunate to be remembered as that.\n  I well remember when I first came to the Senate from the House in \n1995, Paul had of course been here for 2 years, and he knew how \ndifficult it was to get started, to get your feet firmly planted on the \nground in these foreign surroundings.\n  And so he helped us freshmen--and woman--to find our way around, to \nset up offices, to figure out the basics of how things work around \nhere. While it is perhaps true that none of us have ever really figured \nout that secret, Paul and is staff certainly did their best to give \nadvice and lend a helping hand. But then, knowing Paul as I do now, \nthat really comes as no big surprise.\n  Paul was always helping people, always contributing to the world \naround him. From his service in the U.S. Army to the state legislature \nto Director of the Peace Corps to United States Senator, Paul believed \nthat to serve others was a privilege, not a burden. He truly believed \nthat he could made a difference in people's lives. And he was right.\n  What a a lesson his life can teach an often cynical world. We ask \nourselves, what can one person do? What kind of a positive impact can \ngovernment truly have on the lives of others? What happened to the idea \nof public service as a noble calling?\n  To those questions there is one simple answer--people like Paul \nCoverdell exist in the world: Good, honorable, trustworthy people who \ncall us to\n\n[[Page S7179]]\n\nour better nature, who exemplify what the framers of this Nation had in \nmind when they created what they hoped would one day be the greatest \ndeliberative body on earth.\n  He personified another virtue that often seems in short supply in a \nworld where the volume of one's indignation is all too frequently the \nsole measure of one's passion--and that virtue is civility. Paul let \nthe weight of his arguments speak for themselves, and where there were \ndisagreements he respected those who disagreed with him. Perhaps that \nis why he engendered such deep respect in return.\n  It is little wonder, then, that Paul rose so rapidly through the \nranks of leadership. He had a keen grasp of policy and detail, and \nnobody worked harder on behalf of his constituents and his party.\n  He was truly a ``legislator's legislator''--not only creative in \ndeveloping solutions, but always focused on moving the ball forward, on \nproducing results for the people of Georgia and America whether in the \nareas of education, keeping drugs out of the hands of our children, or \nallowing hardworking Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money.\n  In fact, I remember at one point my staff commented to me that it \nseemed like everything we were considering in the Senate seemed to have \nPaul's stamp on it. But that was typical of Paul. He never stood \nstill--and he never forgot the sacred trust that must exist between \nelected officials and those they are obliged to serve.\n  Just as important, Paul was a man for whom his pledge was his bond--\nand that only counts for everything in this institution. His words had \ncredibility, his ideas merit, and is actions sincerity. He made me \nproud to be a member of the United States Senate. He made us all proud.\n  Once again, my heart goes out to Paul's wife Nancy, his family, \nfriends and all of his staff--whom I know are heartbroken as we all \nare--and to the people of the State of Georgia, who have lost a great \nleader and true friend. He will surely be missed by all of us who were \nfortunate to have known him, but his legacy will just as surely live on \nin all those whose lives he has touched.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, after watching my colleagues and the depth \nof concern and personal passion they have at the loss of Paul \nCoverdell, I want to tell them of an experience I had last night. \nSomething came to me when I was at a dinner and we had just heard the \nnews. It was the seventh Beatitude:\n\n       Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the \n     sons of God.\n\n  It occurred to me that this was really Paul Coverdell; he was the \nultimate peacemaker. It was impossible for Paul to walk into a roomful \nof people, whether Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives--\nhostility, anxiety, it all subsided when Paul came in.\n  I remember when I was first elected from the House into the Senate in \n1994. Paul had just arrived here. He didn't give the first impression \nas being a dynamic person, even an articulate person. You had to know \nhim and know him well. But after you did, he was unlike anyone else we \nhave been exposed to here in this body.\n  I thought last night about all the things we deal with here in the \nSenate. It was articulated in Matthew 9, starting with verse 35. It \nsays:\n\n       Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in \n     their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and \n     healing every disease and sickness. When he saw the crowds, \n     he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and \n     helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.\n\n  This is kind of the way we are. We are dealing with the problems of \npoverty, the problems of crime--a multitude of problems. So somebody \nhas to be the one to take on those responsibilities.\n  I read the following verse:\n\n       Then he [Jesus] said to his disciples, ``The harvest is \n     plentiful, but the laborers are few. Ask the Lord of the \n     harvest, therefore, to send out laborers into his harvest \n     field.''\n\n  When I, last night, thought of that verse, I thought, really, Paul \nCoverdell is the laborer who was sent, was raised up to deal with these \nproblems, and all the problems we deal with on a daily basis, in his \nown unique way. So I would just say our prayer for Paul Coverdell right \nnow is the last verse of the 23d Psalm:\n\n       Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the rest of \n     my days; and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.\n\n  Amen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to express my sadness \nat the passing of a very kind colleague. I want to say to his family \nand to his close friends, in Georgia and here in the Senate, who really \nloved him and who worked with him every day, I send you my strength and \nmy prayers.\n  Paul Coverdell was never afraid to disagree because he came here with \nbeliefs. But he never, ever was disagreeable. I went back through the \nRecord this morning because I remember actually several occasions where \nhe and I were on different sides on issues, tough issues. Gun control, \nfor example, was one of them, where we disagreed on a particular piece \nof legislation; Education, where we disagreed on a particular piece of \nlegislation. We were yielding time back and forth, and every single \ntime it was ``my friend from Georgia,'' ``my friend from California.'' \nThe disagreement was deep on the issue, but it was always collegial; it \nwas a model for what should happen here in the Senate where we \ndefinitely have deep, heartfelt disagreements but we can disagree in a \nway that shows respect for one another and caring for one another. And \nhe did that.\n  I wanted to come to the floor to say that because it is perhaps a \nquality we do not see enough of, and all of us ought to think about \nthat.\n  I do not want to repeat what has been said about his contributions to \nthis country. The record shows they were powerful and strong--from the \nPeace Corps, to serving in the Senate, to helping his party, to helping \nGovernor Bush. He was his key person, as I understand it, in the \nSenate. People trusted him with these responsibilities.\n  I wanted to say as a Member from the other side of the aisle that I \nam stunned and saddened, and I see my colleagues are very impacted by \nthis. I feel for everyone who feels this loss in a very personal way. I \nfeel it in a way of someone on the other side of the aisle who really \ndid respect this man and enjoyed the colloquies and debates we had \nbecause it never was with animus. It was always done with great \nrespect. He will be missed. Again, I send my sympathy to his family and \nhis friends. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is a heavy cloud hanging over the \nSenate Chamber today. A bouquet of flowers with a black tapestry is on \nthe desk of our departed colleague, Senator Paul Coverdell, whose \npresence will be greatly missed.\n  There is a saying that in Washington, in Congress, in the Government, \na great deal could be accomplished if there was less concern--perhaps \nno concern--for who gets the credit. Paul Coverdell epitomized that \nconcept.\n  He was always in the thick of the action. He was always prepared to \nhelp. He did it with conciliation, with good will and accommodation, \nand in the spirit of compromise; self-effacing and never interested in \nthe credit, not interested in the news reports or the television \nacclaim or any of what is customarily associated with the politics, the \npublic relations of the Congress in Washington, DC. That kind of \neffective, quiet Senator behind the scenes is a relative rarity here.\n  He had a very distinguished career in the Georgia Legislature, in the \nGeorgia State Senate, going back to 1970. He was the Republican leader. \nJust this morning I talked with people who knew him in Georgia. It was \nthe same Paul Coverdell 30 years ago whom we saw in Washington heading \nup the Peace Corps, a nonglamorous but a very important undertaking to \nproject America around the world with young people, and then in his \nelection to the Senate in 1992 and the immediate recognition of his \ncolleagues who knew him well, even though he was not so well known with \nthe television cameras but very well known by his colleagues, and \nelected to a leadership position, No. 4, in the Republican caucus.\n  He was the point man for the Republican caucus on education. He \nbrought\n\n[[Page S7180]]\n\nto that very important subject, a subject of priority second to none in \nAmerica today and in the world today, again his quiet effectiveness.\n  I had the opportunity to work with him on the appropriations bills on \nthe subcommittee which I chair which covers, among other Departments, \nthe Department of Education. For the last 2 years, we had a list of a \ncouple hundred amendments, and in the flurry of floor action, Paul \nCoverdell was enormously effective in talking to Senators about their \namendments, saying which ones could be accepted, which ones could be \naccommodated without coming to the floor even for a voice vote, and \nthen narrowing the frame of reference as to which ones had to be \ndebated with time agreements and which ones had to be voted upon.\n  The management of a Senate appropriations bill is a complicated \nmatter, especially when you have a $100 billion-plus budget and you \nhave to worry about Head Start, drug-free schools, the National \nInstitutes of Health, worker safety, and the myriad problems. Paul \nCoverdell was an effective man to get that job done.\n  Senator Bill Frist--Dr. Bill Frist--gave us all a report on the \nmedical aspects of what happened to Senator Coverdell: that it was not \npainful, an extraordinary medical incident with problems which simply \ncould not be contained or controlled.\n  I know every Senator sends sympathies to the Coverdell family, to his \nwife Nancy. He will be sorely missed for the great contribution which \nhe has made.\n  There are tough days in the Senate. Last year, in October, we had the \npassing of our dear friend, John Chafee, and now the passing of Paul \nCoverdell. While we intend to focus on matters of Government and high \nfinance, international affairs and war and peace, nothing is more \nsobering than to see what is really important with the loss of a very \nspecial friend and a really great Senator.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we celebrate today the life of our \nfriend and colleague, Paul Coverdell. On behalf of my wife Elaine, who \nsucceeded Paul in the job as director of the Peace Corps, and myself, I \nextend to Nancy and all of Paul's friends our sincerest condolences.\n  I first met Paul in 1988. I was traveling around the South during the \nRepublican Presidential primaries. I was a supporter of then-Vice-\nPresident George Bush. I happened to find myself in Georgia, and ran \ninto a State senator in Georgia named Paul Coverdell, who was also \nactive in that campaign. Paul, as he often did, made an immediate good \nimpression. I recall the people in the Georgia meeting were all quite \ndeferential to him. It was clear he had achieved a level of respect at \nthat point in his career. Having served in the State senate in Georgia \nfor 18 years, having been the leader of a rather small group of \nRepublicans in that body, he had nevertheless achieved a level of \nrespect at that point.\n  As we all know, Vice President Bush became President Bush, and the \nnext time I met Paul Coverdell, he had been nominated to be director of \nthe Peace Corps. As many Senators have said, he did an extraordinary \njob running that well-known agency.\n  Sometime in 1991, Paul came into my office and said: I am thinking of \nrunning for the Senate. I am going to be running against an incumbent \nDemocrat in the South. I know that is rather difficult to do.\n  We talked about the experience I had running against an incumbent \nDemocrat in the South. We struck up the beginnings of a real friendship \nduring which we talked off and on during his extraordinary quest for \nthe Senate.\n  It was indeed an extraordinary quest. Because of the peculiarities of \nGeorgia law, Paul Coverdell is surely in the Guinness Book of Records \nbecause he won four elections in 1 year. I am not certain what the law \nof Georgia is today. I think it is still the same with regard to \nprimaries. In order to be the nominee of a party in Georgia, you have \nto get 50.1 percent of the vote. Paul had a very contested primary for \nthe nomination. He did not get 50.1 percent of the votes, so he was in \na runoff in order to achieve the nomination. So it took our good friend \ntwo elections to get the nomination.\n\n  Then Georgia had--I believe they have since changed this law--a \nrequirement that in the general election, in order to become a U.S. \nSenator, you had to get 50.1 percent of the vote.\n  Election day came and went, and neither Paul nor his opponent, the \nincumbent, had achieved 50.1 percent of the vote. So there was a runoff \nfor the general election--a hotly contested, spirited contest--in which \nPaul came out on top, I believe, in early December of 1992.\n  So he had won four elections in 1 year in order to find his way to \nthis body. Paul was indeed tested right from the beginning in his quest \nto become a Senator.\n  I remember in the early stages of that campaign, people did not take \nPaul very seriously. As I watched his growth and development, almost \nfrom the beginning it seemed he was consistently underestimated. But in \nhis extraordinarily effective and friendly manner, he managed to make \nhimself a force in the Senate very quickly, to the point, as many have \nsaid already, that he was elected as one of our leaders in his first \nterm.\n  One of his staffers lives in my neighborhood. I noticed on the back \nof the car the Coverdell bumper sticker, which says: ``Coverdell \nWorks.'' There may have been another bumper sticker somewhere in \nAmerica that said: ``Someone Works,'' but I can't think of a bumper \nsticker or, for that matter, a better way to sum up our friend and \ncolleague Paul Coverdell than ``Coverdell Works.''\n  He was ubiquitous. He was everywhere. As all of us who work in the \nSenate know, in order to make anything happen, you have to develop \nlittle groups to work in an area to try to advance the ball in the \nmiddle of these 100 substantial egos, each of which has its own goals \nand aspirations. Paul was literally ubiquitous, all over the place, in \na group here, in a group there, always advancing the cause. He did it \nin a friendly, effective, and intelligent manner.\n  No one is irreplaceable. The Senate continues to function. We are \nfunctioning today, although probably not very effectively. But if I \nhave ever met somebody about whom I could say he was almost \nirreplaceable in the Senate, it was Paul Coverdell.\n  So it is with extraordinary sadness, not only personally but in terms \nof the loss in this institution, that we say goodbye to our good \nfriend, Paul Coverdell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to recognize and celebrate the \nlife of Paul Coverdell, as many of my colleagues have today, a \nbeautiful, warm-hearted, deep-souled man who was constantly encouraging \nand engaging people. I know he is hearing these comments. I wish I \nwould have said them to him physically as well, but we know he is here, \nas we celebrate a life well lived.\n  It is a very sad day for us in the Senate. I caught the comments of \nSenator Gramm earlier wherein he said that instead of staring at the \ndeath, we should stare at the life; instead of staring at our loss, we \nshould stare at our gain from having known Paul Coverdell. That is a \nvery appropriate way for us to look at and think about it.\n  Paul touched so many of us in the Senate in many wonderful ways. One \nof the things he did for my family that I most remember was sending us \na book by a Georgian author. The title of the book was ``Lights Along \nthe Way.'' It was a collection of vignettes of people of faith, acts \nthey had performed--many of them very obscure, some of them well \nknown--to help people along the way. For example, one person had \nadopted 10 children, and the light this person had been along the way; \nsome of the things Abraham Lincoln had done, a clear light along the \nway. My daughter and I would frequently read one, maybe two of these \nstories at night before going to bed. They were uplifting,\n\n[[Page S7181]]\n\nhappy, light, joyous stories of lives well lived, of somebody being a \nlight along the way.\n  That is exactly what Paul Coverdell was, a light along the way. If \nyou saw him during the day, it was never a confrontational meeting. It \nwas always a happy meeting. Even though you may disagree about \nsomething, he was always trying to be helpful. He was a peacemaker. As \nyou would pass through your day, he was one of those lights along the \nway. That is why our grief is so great. When you lose part of that \nlight, it makes it very difficult. He clearly was that. He was one of \nthose people who talked about the scripture of God working through an \nindividual and that it was God working in him to be that light along \nthe way.\n\n  I think Paul was truly that, a beautiful, deeply-caring man. He cared \nfor his country, cared for his friends. He cared for people who were \nnot his friends. I never saw him give a harsh or a cross word to \nanybody. I never saw him hardly give a frown to anybody, let alone a \nharsh word. It is those sorts of vignettes of Paul's life that I \nremember, that stick out in my mind, his being such a light along the \nway.\n  I hope he is a light we don't forget. I hope he is a light we learn \nfrom. Light cleanses. Light shows us the way. Light points to where we \nought to be and where we ought to go. Many times, it is a point of \nlight in the distance that we seek, towards which we aim, whether it is \na lighthouse or a distant shining light.\n  That is what Paul is to us now, one of those lights we seek and aim \ntowards, hoping that in some way, at some time in our life, we will be \nable to draw closer, move towards it, be purer, be a greater light; \nthat when we enter a room, people will react as they did when Paul \nentered a room. You can enter a room and there are shadows that come \nout, frowns, or you can enter a room and people start to smile and be \nhappy, even though they are not exactly sure why you are there. Paul \nwas one of those where the room started to light up rather than get \ndarker when he entered.\n  I hope his is a light we will always remember. As we mourn today, we \ncelebrate that light among us, a light for us to aim towards. He was a \ngreat man.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes today to \njoin in paying tribute to our former colleague, Paul Coverdell. \nMemories of Paul consistently paint a picture of a hard-working, even-\ntempered consensus-builder. He sought results, not headlines. He was \nnot one who basked in a national spotlight, but his quiet influence \nwithin this body has made a profound impact on public policy affecting \nall Americans.\n  My last opportunity to work with Paul was during consideration of the \nEducational Opportunities Act this spring. It is fitting that our final \nwork together addressed the subject of education, as this is an area \nwhere we had many dealings over the years. We did not always agree on \nthe specifics, but the one thing about which we wholeheartedly agreed \nis the importance of education.\n  During the S. 2 debate, Paul made a compelling case for the need to \nassure a good education for all of our citizens. He said:\n\n       From our very founding, we have understood that a core \n     component of maintaining a free society is that the \n     population is educated. To the extent that any among us who \n     are citizens do not have the fundamental skills, the basic \n     education, they are truly not free. They cannot enjoy the \n     full benefits of American citizenship because they are denied \n     the ability to think for themselves, for their families, for \n     their communities, for the Nation.\n\n  In all my work with Paul, I found him to be fair and accommodating. \nHe was always one to search for the areas of consensus, and he was \nenormously successful in finding ways to reach accommodation to move \nthings forward. His persistence and his commitment to making things \nhappen--no matter how many obstacles were placed in the path--earned \nhim the respect of all who had the privilege to work with him.\n  I join in extending my deepest sympathy to his wife Nancy. I also \noffer my condolences to members of his staff, who have lost not just an \nemployer but an inspiring example of the work and rewards of a life \ndevoted to public service.\n  We will miss Paul, but his inspiration to me and to all the others of \nthis body will continue until we are gone from here also. I join all my \ncolleagues in the deep sympathy that we feel at this moment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nexpressing our condolences to Paul Coverdell's wife Nancy and all the \nmembers of his family.\n  I think that anybody who has watched the expressions and condolences \nthat have already been offered would recognize immediately the extent \nto which Senator Coverdell touched all of us in the Senate and the \nextent to which he was a beloved colleague and friend.\n  Paul's life achievement, in so many different ways, obviously \ndeserves the tributes we are paying today. I wish to comment on some of \nthose achievements. First, Paul Coverdell was one of the really \nremarkable leaders of our time. He began his political career in the \nGeorgia Legislature and rose up to the leadership position in the \nRepublican Party in the Georgia State Senate. He then came to \nWashington and made his mark as the Director of the Peace Corps. He was \nvery instrumental in expanding and successfully helping the Peace Corps \nto transition into a new era.\n  Paul was a leader in his party. He served as chairman of the Georgia \nRepublican Party at a time when there weren't a lot of Republicans in \nGeorgia. But thanks to him, the party grew in strength. That is when I \nactually first became acquainted with him, because I chaired the \nRepublican Party in Michigan at that time and we met in the context of \nnational party meetings. Then, of course, Paul was elected to this body \nin 1992. I think everybody here is aware of how effective and how \ncompetent and able he was. He moved into the leadership of this Chamber \nfairly quickly--in, I think, his first term in the Senate. That doesn't \nhappen too often in a place where seniority counts so much. But his \nobservable abilities, talents, and incredible work ethic brought him to \nthe attention of all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. On \nour side of the aisle, it resulted in him being put in a leadership \nrole early in his career.\n  More than being an effective leader, Paul was a tremendous colleague \nwhen it came time to needing some assistance on a project. I can't \nthink of one important piece of legislation that I have worked on in \nthe time I have been in the Senate when Paul Coverdell wasn't helping \nme in some fashion to get it through. I remember coming here in my very \nfirst couple of legislative efforts, on amendments and bills, as a \nfreshman Member who did not know how this place worked and looking to \nhim, who was a slightly more senior Member, for guidance and help; he \nwas always there. He has been there for all of us. That is why I think \ntoday is such a tough day. It would not really matter what the issue \nwas, he was somebody who would try to help you. His staff was built by \nhim to be of similar assistance.\n  Of course, for all of us, probably the principal thing we would \nacknowledge in terms of Paul's attributes was the tremendous friendship \nhe offered to all of us who were his friends. I had a unique \nrelationship with him in the sense that he served as a mentor and \nfriend to me in my first couple of years. When he sought a leadership \nposition, I was proud of the fact that he asked me to place his name in \nnomination for that. I did so on the second occasion he sought to be in \nthe leadership of our party. When you are asked to nominate somebody \nfor one of these\n\n[[Page S7182]]\n\njobs, it obviously means a lot to you and tells you that you are \nwell regarded by that person. I have to say it means an unbelievable \namount to me to think that Senator Paul Coverdell thought of me as \nsomeone who he would want to play that role in his political career.\n\n  As I said earlier, the reaction of his colleagues today demonstrates \nthat others share my high opinion of Paul. So many have given \nstatements already, and I know more will follow that will move us all. \nWe have seen people express themselves in ways we never thought we \nwould see. People who are known to come to the Senate floor and wage \nverbal debates back and forth on serious topics have already come here \ntoday and demonstrated, in the most human way, that they were so close \nto and touched by Paul Coverdell, and that all of the partisanship and \nthe political debate is really second to them in importance to \ndescribing the friendship he provided all of us.\n  So as I close we pray for the best for Paul's wife and family. We \ngive thanks for having been able to share his friendship. On a personal \nlevel, I say: Goodbye, Paul, we will never forget you. You were a key \npart of all we have done here, and you will continue to play a role as \nour memories of you continue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, many years ago William Wordsworth wrote a \nwonderful poem entitled ``Ode On Intimations of Immortality,'' in which \nhe said:\n\n       Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting;\n       The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,\n       Hath had elsewhere its setting,\n       And cometh from afar;\n       Not in entire forgetfulness,\n       And not in utter nakedness,\n       But trailing clouds of glory do we come\n       From God, who is our home. . . .\n\n  I feel particularly bereft today because of the loss of Paul \nCoverdell.\n  I have served here for 24 years and I have seen great people come and \ngo. There are people in this body who are just as great as the Founding \nFathers were. There may not be many, but there are people here who by \nany measure qualify as great leaders.\n  These great people, who are able to cross party lines and bring \npeople together, make this body the greatest legislative body in the \nworld. Paul was one of those people.\n  He was kind, he was considerate, a good listener; he was wise and he \nwas a person with whom you would want to counsel if you had any \nconcerns.\n  But Paul was more than that. He was politically astute. He knew when \nto get tough about matters and stand up for what he believed. But there \nwas also a kindness, a softness, a decency about him that is going to \nlive long after today.\n  I know that ``our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting,'' and that \nwe came ``from God, who is our home.''\n  I know that Paul was one of God's chosen people. He was given the \nprivilege of coming here to be with us in the Senate. We had the \nprivilege of knowing him.\n  William Cullen Bryant once said:\n\n     So live that when thy summons comes to join\n     The innumerable caravan that moves\n     To that mysterious realm, where each shall take\n     His chamber in the silent halls of death,\n     Thou go not, like a quarry-slave at night,\n     Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed\n     By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave\n     Like on who wraps the drapery of his couch\n     About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.\n\n  Paul was like that. We are all going to miss him. The fact that he \ndied such a quick and unfathomable death has made a mournful impression \non all of us.\n  Paul was one of those people who could move mountains because of his \npersonality, because of his intelligence, because of his background, \nbecause of his experience, because of his kindness, because of his \nlove, because of his fairness, and because of his leadership.\n  I could go through all of his leadership qualities, all of the things \nhe was working on and the accomplishments he made. Right now, I am \nthinking more of the mourning and the sense of loss we feel in losing \nPaul Coverdell.\n  Tennyson wrote this wonderful poem called ``Crossing the Bar.''\n\n     Sunset and evening star,\n     And one clear call for me,\n     And may there be no moaning of the bar,\n     When I put out to sea.\n\n     But such a tide as moving seems asleep,\n     Too full for sound and foam,\n     When that which drew from out the boundless deep\n     Turns again home.\n\n     Twilight and evening bell,\n     And after that the dark!\n     And may there be no sadness of farewell,\n     When I embark,\n\n     For tho' from out our bourne of time and place\n     The flood may bear me far,\n     I hope to see my Pilot face to face\n     When I have crossed the bar.\n\n  I have no doubt that Paul is going to see his pilot face to face. I \nhave no doubt that he doesn't want any moaning of the bar as he put out \nto sea. I know he doesn't want any sadness or farewell now that he has \nembarked on this next phase of eternity.\n  Let us today concentrate on all the good that Paul stood for on all \nhis amazing accomplishments, not only as a Senator, but also as a man.\n  We all know about Paul's love for education--he led our caucus on \nthat issue--and all the work he did as chairman of the Senate \nRepublican Task Force on Education to encourage learning opportunities \nfor America's schoolchildren.\n  Paul worked hard to make sure that every parent, every child, and \nevery teacher could devote enough time throughout each year to \neducational matters. He made encouraging a love of reading his special \npriority for students, pupils, and teachers alike. He was a leader in \nformulating ``A+'' tax free accounts for education. His landmark Safe \nand Affordable Schools Act has been widely regarded as a model program \nto improve our country's education policies. Paul authored bills to \nmake sure we appreciate the hard work of our Nation's teachers, \nsomething we tend to forget so easily when formulating education \npolicy.\n  Paul must also be memorialized for his steadfast work to lower taxes \nand make our tax policies more fair. Many times Paul reminded us of his \nbelief that the freedom and means to raise, educate and care for our \nfamilies are threatened by a government that takes more than 50 percent \nof an average family's income in taxes and cost of government. Paul was \nvery proud of his work on tax issues and in particular, of the law he \nauthored to stop unscrupulous IRS workers from rummaging through the \ntax files of private citizens. It is many ways so ironic that the last \nvote he cast was on repealing the death tax, an important policy change \nhe had worked so hard to advocate.\n  I worked closely with Paul on his antidrug efforts, on his work to \nstop narcotics trafficking, and on his efforts to make the workplace \ndrug free. All of these things Paul did, and he did them well.\n  Paul never forgot the needs of his home state, whether it were \nthrough his work as chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on \nMarketing, Inspection and Product Promotion, or through his work as a \nmember of the Finance Committee and the Small Business Committee. His \nrecord is replete with accomplishments that benefited his constituents \nback home.\n  Of course, there were so many other legislative things I would like \nto mention, but let me leave it at that.\n  Another side of Paul was his love for baseball. He was as excited as \nanybody I have ever seen when Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's Major League \nhome run record as a beloved Atlanta Brave.\n  I am deeply saddened by his passing. I am going to miss him very \nmuch.\n  One of my favorite poets is a poet named Sara Teasdale who wrote an \ninteresting poem. Although this was surely a love poem, I think it \napplies to our memories of Paul as this poem is called ``The Beloved.''\n\n     It is enough of honor for one lifetime\n     To have known you better than the rest have known,\n     The shadows and the colors of your voice,\n     Your will, immutable and still as stone.\n\n     The shy heart,\n\n  Which Paul had--\n\n     so lonely and so gay,\n     The sad laughter and the pride of pride,\n     The tenderness, the depth of tenderness\n     Rich as the earth, and wide as heaven is wide.\n\n  I like that. Even though it was meant for someone else, I think it \napplies to a large degree to Paul Coverdell.\n\n[[Page S7183]]\n\n  Paul was a good man. He did the right things. He set a good example. \nHe was a good colleague here. He was one of the most respected Senators \nin this body for all of these qualities, qualities that very few people \ncan come close to matching.\n  I wish Paul the best in his afterlife.\n  My sympathy and heartfelt feelings to Nancy, his wife, and to the \nrest of his family who are mourning him.\n  I thank God for the privilege of knowing Paul, working with Paul, \naccomplishing things with Paul, laughing with Paul.\n  I am grateful for our colleagues in this body on both sides of the \nfloor. We do learn that these people are here for a very important \nreason. They have been selected by their respective constituents to do \ngood things. I can say as one who has been here long enough to know \nthat Paul Coverdell did good things while he was here and that his \nlegacy will be that all of us need to do better in the things we have \nbeen and are doing. All of us need to follow and emulate his example so \nthat we can hopefully be as good as he was.\n  My sympathy and my best to Nancy and other members of his family, and \nto my fellow colleagues who are mourning Paul Coverdell this day.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join with all of my fellow Senators today \nto express our feeling and mourn the death of our colleague, Senator \nPaul Coverdell.\n  I always find these kinds of circumstances difficult to speak to, to \nfind the appropriate words to reflect my emotions or to in some way \nexpress my love for a man such as Paul Coverdell and the way he worked \nfor all of us and for his country.\n  I grew up in a ranching environment in the State of Idaho. Oftentimes \nI think back to those experiences when I am caught in emotion or when I \ncause myself to sit down and contemplate how to deal with an issue or a \nsituation. My experience with Paul was largely a part of our time in \nthe Senate, a leadership time.\n\n  I was one of four Senators elected by the Republican majority to lead \nthem in the 106th Congress; Paul Coverdell was a part of that \nleadership team. He was secretary of what we call our Republican \nconference, or all Members on the Republican side. It was through that \nrelationship that I grew to know Paul and to appreciate the tremendous \ntalents that he had. We all know he was an activist on the floor on \nmany occasions, in pursuit of what the leadership team and ultimately \nthe Republican conference decided was a direction we ought to head in \nor an issue we ought to debate. He did it with phenomenal energy and \ntalent.\n  When I think of that relationship, I can only come to this analysis; \nI think it so well fits Paul: A team approach, as in a western ranching \nenvironment. We all remember the great cattle drives that used to come \nout of the Southwest into the plains of the West to graze, thousands of \nhead of renegade cattle moving all in one direction. The reason they \nwere moving in one direction was because there was a trail boss who \nheaded up this drive. There were a group of wranglers on horseback who \nwere out there working day to day to keep that drive shaped and headed \nin the direction in which the trail boss wanted them to head.\n  There is no question that in the Senate Trent Lott is our trail boss. \nHe decides the direction with the consent of the herd, if you will, and \nhead Members. There is a group who are the wranglers, who work with \nthat herd, to help shape it and keep it moving. Paul Coverdell was one \nof those wranglers and probably the best among us. He was constantly \nout there from daylight until dark and, if it were on the range, we \nwould say in all kinds of weather because he was doing what he was \nasked to do but more importantly because he believed in what he was \ndoing and he was very passionate about it.\n  All of us are here for a reason; some of us for larger reasons than \nothers. Clearly, to be here with the kind of passion and energy that \nPaul Coverdell from the State of Georgia came here with is unique. As a \nresult, he was selected to be one of those wranglers, to follow the \nleadership, to follow the directions of the trail boss, to make sure \nthat we all stayed headed in the right direction.\n  I will miss him. I will miss his talents as a wrangler. He was a \ngreat American and history will record that. He has made his mark. But \nnever once in the business of making that mark, or leading, shaping the \nherd, or wrangling the herd, did he ever do it for Paul. He did it for \nhis country and for what he believed was the right cause and the right \nbelief.\n  Paul, I think God has called you to a different trail herd. He \nobviously needed a hell of a good wrangler, and He's got one. We will \nmiss you. We love you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in rising to \noffer my sympathies and condolences to Nancy and the Coverdell family.\n  Today, we all grieve Paul's passing, but we also celebrate his life. \nWhat a life it was; a life of achievement, a life of incredible service \nand accomplishment.\n  I did not know Paul Coverdell until I came to the Senate in 1996. I \nfollowed his career, as many Americans did. I followed with interest \nand admiration his campaign for the Senate and his election to the \nSenate from Georgia. It was only when I arrived at this institution \nthat I got to know Paul Coverdell, the man.\n  Much has already been said this morning and yesterday and has been \nsaid well. He was ubiquitous. It seemed Paul was everywhere. The \nbreadth and number of issues he was involved in takes your breath away. \nIt was amazing how much he knew and how much he was willing to invest \nhis time and energy. He was incredibly hard working and willing to do \nwhat others didn't want to do, didn't have time to do. He made time and \nhe was willing to take on the nonglamorous jobs. He didn't seek glory \nand he didn't seek adulation. He gave credit away freely because he \ndidn't seek it for himself. He was a consensus builder; he was a doer. \nIf you wanted it accomplished, you gave the task to Paul Coverdell.\n  One quality which I as a junior Member of the Senate especially \nappreciated and admired was his deep respect for his fellow man and his \ndeep respect for his colleagues, regardless of their rank or status. I \nserved on the education task force with Paul. We had a lot of strategy \nmeetings. We had meetings in Senator Lott's office in which we would \ntalk over the education issue and discuss not only how we would \ncommunicate our message but how we would pass legislation. There were a \nlot of senior Members on the task force. They were always quick and \nbold to speak out and give their opinion. What I noticed about Paul \nCoverdell was that he was always observing who had spoken and who \nhadn't, who had expressed their opinion and who hadn't. At every \nmeeting he said: Tim, you haven't said anything yet. What are your \nthoughts? Do you have an opinion?\n  Or he would see Susan Collins and say: Susan, how do you feel about \nthis issue?\n  He always included junior Members. He included everyone because he \nrespected not only their opinion, but he respected them as human \nbeings.\n  He epitomized what service is all about. I think that Paul Coverdell \nprovides the lasting role model of what a U.S. Senator should be, what \na public servant should be.\n  Many of my colleagues have struggled to find words and to find \nscripture and verses to express what they felt about Paul Coverdell. I \nhave found a verse that I think applies most appropriately to Paul. It \nis Mark 10:31. Jesus said:\n\n       But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.\n\n  Paul was a leader. But he was a leader among us because he was \nservant of all of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \npaying tribute to the life and legacy of a man I considered a friend \nfirst, a Senator second, and a great American above all.\n  Senator Coverdell was everything that those of us who were blessed to \nserve with him strive to be:\n\n     effective, committed, compassionate, and tenacious when it \n     meant doing right by the\n\n[[Page S7184]]\n\n     people of Georgia and the American taxpayers he revered.\n\n  Paul was a voice for families, for children, for the nation's \nworkers, and every individual seeking to build a better life for \nthemselves, their family, and generations to come.\n  Of all my colleagues, I think I spent more of my working hours with \nPaul Coverdell, in meetings, strategy sessions, and casual \nconversations.\n  I considered him to be the ``sparkplug of the Senate'' because of the \nlife and energy he brought to this body.\n  As others have said, very little went on here that Paul wasn't \nsomehow involved in, and he was the man I went to when I needed a \nfriendly ear. I didn't always hear what I wanted to hear, or get the \nsympathy I thought I needed, of course, but I always received the \ncounsel of a man who spoke from the heart.\n\n  He leaves behind a remarkable legacy of service, and not just here in \nthe Senate. Other colleagues have spoken of his leadership of the Peace \nCorps, his 16 years in the Georgia State Senate, his military service, \nhis real-world experience in business.\n  In this Chamber, he will be especially remembered for his unyielding \ndedication to working Americans, whether through his work on education, \nand in particular his education savings accounts, leading the fight \nagainst illegal drugs, promoting volunteerism, and lifting up America's \nfarmers.\n  I think, though, that Paul will be remembered foremost as an ardent \ndefender of freedom.\n  The highest tribute one can pay to a colleague is to say that, day in \nand day out, they got the job done. Senator Paul Coverdell got the job \ndone, with humility, with enthusiasm, and always with good humor.\n  With Paul's passing, the State of Georgia has lost a leader, the \nSenate has lost its sparkplug, many of us have lost our best friend, \nand the Coverdell family has lost a truly exceptional man. My prayers, \nand the prayers of our colleagues and our staffs, are with Nancy and \nher entire family during this difficult, difficult time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I join my many colleagues here in the \nSenate today expressing my sympathies to the Coverdell family and \ntelling them our thoughts and prayers are with them during this \ndifficult time. A poet once said:\n\n       There is no joy life gives like that it takes away.\n\n  I expect the Coverdell family and all who loved Paul and understand \nthe hurt and anguish at his passing, today know well what that verse \nmeans.\n  This is an unusual place, this Senate. There are 100 of us, men and \nwomen from all parts of the country. We have days where we have pretty \naggressive debates and fights about public policy. Paul Coverdell was \nin the middle of many of those. I never heard Paul Coverdell say a mean \nword to anyone in the Senate. I told him one day at the end of a rather \nlengthy debate in which I was on the other side and the vote was called \nand we were standing in the well:\n\n       You and I don't agree on this issue, but you are a very \n     good Senator.\n\n  We served in different political parties. We, in many cases, believed \ndifferently about issues. But Paul Coverdell was a very good Senator \nand served this country well.\n  The important part about Paul was, though he felt great passion about \npublic policy and the issues he brought to the floor of the Senate, \nagain, he never uttered a mean word about anyone in debate. You can \nalways disagree in this country without being disagreeable. Paul \nCoverdell demonstrated that every day in his pursuit of the public \npolicy he believed was important for this country.\n  We are so busy and our schedules have us on our way here and there \nand everywhere all week, and then often to our respective homes in the \n50 States on weekends, so it is hard to get to know each other very \nwell. But each day, as we move around in this Capitol, all of us in the \nSenate exchange greetings and words, occasionally a story or two. Last \nweek, I was in the elevator with Senator Coverdell. We laughed a bit \nabout his being compared, from time to time, in his presentation, to \nGeorge Bush. I always used to kid him about that, that sometimes he had \na cadence that reminded me of the ex-President.\n  He sort of kidded me and said someone told him he was doing Dana \nCarvey who was doing George Bush, so he was two steps away from the \nimpression. We laughed about that.\n  Last Friday, as we were having a long series of votes, towards the \nend of the votes I visited with Senator Coverdell because Georgia has \nbeen a State hardest hit by drought. I told him we had been hit so \nseverely with respect to floods. On behalf of our farmers, I was trying \nto see if we could put together a piece of legislation that would deal \nwith crops that had been flooded out, destroyed by flood, and crops in \nGeorgia and elsewhere that were being destroyed by drought. On Friday \nmorning, Paul indicated he wanted to join me in an amendment to this \nbill, the Agriculture appropriations bill that is being considered in \nthe Senate, to provide some assistance for family farmers who were \nvictims of the drought that was occurring in his State and throughout \nthe South.\n  He was always available to talk about public policy and what was \nhappening; always especially available and concerned to talk about the \npeople of his State of Georgia. I wanted to come today to say the \nSenate will miss Paul Coverdell. He was not only a good Senator, but he \nserved this country very well. He was a friend to all of us. My \nthoughts and prayers go to his wife and his family. We say thank you to \nhis memory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the 211-year history of the Senate, the \nState of Georgia has one of the richest and most storied legacies. \nSince the formation of the Senate, and that was in 1789, Georgia has \nsent to the Senate 62 individuals as Senators. I have had the distinct \nprivilege of serving with 6 of them, including our beloved Paul \nCoverdell. When the people of Georgia elected Paul Coverdell to \nrepresent them here in the Senate 8 years ago, they sent to Washington \na unique, especially talented, and gracious gentleman; a gentleman of \nthe South, I say to those of us who are privileged to come from that \nregion.\n  Paul began his service to the Nation nearly 30 years ago when he \nserved his Nation in the U.S. Army, stationed in Okinawa, Taiwan, and \nKorea, and he never stopped in his quest to serve the people. He was \ntruly a public servant.\n  He gave almost half his life to serving the Nation and the State of \nGeorgia. It is no overstatement to say that his presence in public life \nhas made this Nation more prosperous and more secure. He was a leader \nin the fight against drugs and the fight for better education and the \nstruggle to keep this Nation strong, both economically and militarily.\n  We have a saying around the Senate: There are show horses and \nworkhorses. We know for sure Paul was no show horse; He was a \nworkhorse. He worked hard and often he worked behind the scenes. He did \nnot seek the headlines. Paul Coverdell did not seek the headlines. He \nwould seek results--he wanted to get the job done, let others take the \ncredit--and always results that were in the best interests of our \nNation. That was his guide; that was his compass.\n  All of us here, before we cast the first vote, before we discharge \nthe first responsibility, take the oath of office. We solemnly commit \n``to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies.'' We \ncommit ``to bear true faith and allegiance.'' We undertake ``to \nfaithfully discharge'' our duties.\n  Paul Coverdell fulfilled each of those constitutional obligations \nunder the oath of office. He was a man of his word and he has lived his \nlife in the Senate true to his principles and true to that oath.\n  He was a quiet man. His office was right across the hall from mine in \nthe old Russell Building. How often we would meet walking to and from \nthe votes. Those are the moments when\n\n[[Page S7185]]\n\nSenators do not have staffs around them, constituents are waiting \nsomewhere, and you share those private thoughts, comments, and ideas. \nHow often I shared them with this giant of a Senator.\n  The Nation lost a true patriot, a true gentleman, a true statesman. \nBut his memory and his legacy will remain with us forever.\n  May God bless his family. God blessed America with this man's \nservice.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle who have come today to express sorrow and deep regret over the \nloss of a treasured friend and colleague. I have watched many of the \ntributes that have been made to Paul Coverdell this morning. There is \nvery little I can say to add to some of the wonderful comments that \nhave been made about this truly remarkable American.\n  I want to talk for a minute about my personal relationship with Paul \nCoverdell.\n  When he was running for the Senate for the first time, he was running \nagainst an incumbent Senator who was popular in his State. I came to \nthe State of Georgia and campaigned for him. Before I arrived, I \nthought I was doing what a lot of us in politics do, and that is doing \nwhat is necessary for a losing cause. But after spending a few days \nwith Paul Coverdell, I could see this man was going to win his election \nbecause he was a man of integrity; he was a man who knew the issues, a \nman who was dedicated to the concept and belief of public service, a \nman who had served his country in other capacities and had prepared \nhimself over many years of public life to serve the Nation as a Senator \nfrom the State of Georgia.\n  As we all know, he won a very close race, perhaps one of the closest \nraces in the history of certainly the State of Georgia, if not the \nentire Senate, which required a runoff election. Then he was reelected \nrather handily.\n  Again I went down to Georgia to help him in his reelection, and I saw \nthat during his first term, Paul Coverdell had established a unique \nrelationship with his constituents. Everyplace I went with him, they \nrecognized him, they showed their appreciation for him, and whether \nthey were Republican or Democrat, they respected him for his strongly \nheld values and views.\n  As I talked to his citizenry around the State of Georgia, it was \nclear, whether they were going to support his candidacy for reelection \nor not, they held him in the highest regard because they knew, as we \nwho have had the privilege and honor of working with him and serving \nwith him in the Senate know, that he was a man who worked incredibly \nhard, a man of firmly established values and ideals, and one who \nbelieved and acted in the public interest.\n  As all of us experience deep emotion and sorrow over the loss of a \ndear friend, I am sometimes reminded that we should also celebrate the \nfact that we were blessed to have the opportunity to know and \nappreciate a man of such enormous and wonderful qualities, and the \npeople of his State and the people of this Nation, including my own \nState of Arizona, were honored to be in the presence of and have the \nservice of this dedicated, wonderful American.\n  As our best wishes and condolences go out to the Coverdell family and \nfriends, we also offer our hardiest celebration for a life well lived \nand one which is written in the pages of America's history, in the \nhistory of the Senate, bright pages filled with the Coverdell name in \nthe State of Georgia with glory.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as I enter the Chamber and look to the \nrear to the seat occupied by our dear friend, the late Senator Paul \nCoverdell, it reminds me of the reality of the fragility of the lives \nwe lead. The message is one of taking stock of what our real priorities \nare. Life is so short, so fragile, and our period on Earth is so \ntemporary.\n  At this time we join together in grieving with the family of our \nbeloved colleague who passed away Tuesday evening. Our thoughts and \nprayers are certainly with his wife Nancy and the family during their \ntime of extraordinary grief.\n  We all share in the reality that this was a tragic and unexpected \nloss. We all feel it in this Chamber, in the halls of the Senate office \nbuildings and, of course, in Paul's beloved State of Georgia. But we \ncannot be blinded by grief to the point that we fail to recognize and \ncelebrate the life of this outstanding public servant.\n  He was an extraordinary public servant. I listened to some of the \ncomments made last night after we learned of his passing. The Senator \nfrom New York said he was a man of peace. Reflecting on Paul's public \nservice, he served his country in the Army, with deployments in \nOkinawa, Korea, and the Republic of China, came home to Georgia, joined \nthe family business, helped it thrive and grow and then, beginning in \n1970, served his State in the legislature, serving as minority leader \nfor a period of 15 years. In 1989, he continued his commitment to peace \nas Director of the Peace Corps. In this capacity, Paul saw the fall of \nthe Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War. He seized the opportunity to \nplace Peace Corps volunteers in former Eastern Bloc nations in an \neffort to speed their transition to democracy and peace.\n  The wise people of Georgia, in 1992, elected Paul to the U.S. Senate. \nI vividly recall that this genuine, quiet man made an immediate \nimpression upon all of us. As we got to know Paul, we found him to be \ndeeply thoughtful, hard-working, and utterly unconcerned about the \nlimelight. His Republican colleagues recognized his efforts and \nselected him to the leadership post of Republican Conference Secretary.\n  As a U.S. Senator, Paul did superb work in the issues of education, \nfood safety, protecting our children from drugs, promoting \nvolunteerism, lowering the tax burden on working families and small \nbusiness, and protecting the rights of citizens in their dealings with \nthe Internal Revenue Service.\n  We were all privileged to know Paul. He enriched our lives. My \nprayers and thoughts are with Paul's family, especially his wife Nancy. \nThe Senate will miss his work ethic and thoughtfulness. The Nation will \nmiss his ideas and his example.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise, as have some of our colleagues \ntoday, to express my deepest sympathy to Senator Paul Coverdell's \nfriends, family, and to his wife Nancy, as others throughout the State \nof Georgia as well as throughout this country mourn the passing of one \nof our colleagues who, indeed, was a very special person.\n  I think when we reflect on the times we had and the opportunity we \nhad to spend with Paul Coverdell, we will certainly remember him as a \nSenator's Senator; by that I mean a person who was really interested \nnot so much in the message of the day but, rather, in actually working \ntogether to bring to this floor and to the American people legislative \nproducts that were appropriate to get the job done.\n  I think all of us, when we see our legislative branches becoming more \nand more partisan and more and more separated by imaginary aisles that \nseparate us, can think back and remember Paul Coverdell as a person who \nwas willing to work with anyone who was willing to work with him in \norder to accomplish legislation that was in the interest of this whole \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S7186]]\n\n  I had the opportunity, as so many of our colleagues did, to work with \nhim on education. I think his approach to that major legislative effort \nwas one from which we can all learn a great deal--how he handled the \nproduct he was trying to get passed into law.\n  What I mean by that was he was willing to sit and talk with Democrats \nas well as his Republican colleagues to try to fashion a compromise \nthat could accomplish the reform of our legislative system. Far too \noften, that is sort of unique and different in the way things are \ndone--both in this body and in the other body across the Capitol.\n\n  I think as we remember the experiences and good times we had with \nhim, we can take with us the admiration and respect all of us have \nexpressed of him, but also, at the same time, the lesson he taught us \nby his actions. That lesson, in my mind, was how we work together to \naccomplish good things for the American people. He did that. We can \nremember and we can learn from his actions. That is how I want to \nremember the good times I had and the privilege of experiencing it with \nhim during the legislative process.\n  He will be missed, of course, by his family and close friends back \nhome. He will be missed by the people of Georgia. He will, indeed, be \nmissed by the people of America--those Americans who think that the \nfunction of this body and our Congress in general is to do whatever we \ncan, working together, to make lives better for all American citizens. \nThat is what Paul Coverdell attempted to do as he was able to \naccomplish so many things in that fashion.\n  He will be particularly missed by this institution and by everyone \nwho wants to make government work better for the American people. Paul \nCoverdell represented that type of Senator. He, indeed, was a Senator's \nSenator. He will be sorely missed but very fondly remembered.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, as have so many of my \ncolleagues, I rise today to pay tribute to a friend, Paul Coverdell.\n  It is very difficult to look at those flowers, which are silent. As \nmy colleagues do, I find it difficult to deal with. It is something \nthat is very hard for all of us to understand.\n  We are here to pay tribute to Paul Coverdell and to express our \nsincerest condolences to Nancy and his entire family.\n  They say true friends are there when you need them most. We know Paul \nCoverdell was there when we needed counsel. I remember about a year ago \nI went through some rather difficult times on the floor of the Senate. \nPaul was there to counsel me and to give me a lot of advice through all \nthat--for which I will always be grateful--in a political world often \npoisoned by partisanship. Paul was always there for counsel and \nfriendship. He was there for all. He was not a partisan person. He \ncould be partisan when he had to be. There is a difference between \nbeing partisan and being mean.\n  The Atlanta Journal Constitution said it best when they said: There \nis a lot of meanness in politics. But he wasn't one of the mean people. \nI don't think it can be said much better than that. He was a fierce \npartisan on the battlefield of ideas but not among friends. We are 100 \npeople here who are friends. Even though we have our partisan \ndifferences from time to time, we don't take it off the floor. Paul was \ncertainly a stalwart in leading the way in that. He knew what \nfriendship was and what it meant. Friendship to Paul couldn't be \nobscured by any party label or disagreement or an argument.\n  That is why so many of our colleagues have been here today to make \ntributes. It is also one of the reasons why history will record Paul \nCoverdell as a great Senator. I remember vividly the first time I came \nto the well and signed the book, being joined with a very distinguished \nfew individuals, a little over 2,000 people throughout the course of \nour country who have become U.S. Senators. Senator Robert Byrd came \nover to me and said: Don't ever forget that. That is something that \nthey can never take away from you.\n  When you think through the years of all those people, Paul will be \nremembered in that way as one of the best in terms of friendship, in \nterms of his own issues he felt so passionately about--drugs, what \ndrugs were doing to our society, especially to our young people, and \neducation for which he fought so hard.\n  He was a passionate man, a caring man. I don't believe anyone who has \never served here who wasn't compassionate and didn't care could ever be \nconsidered an outstanding Senator. Paul was the best when it came to \nthat.\n  He had the disarming personality, the humor, the quick mind. He had \nrock solid philosophical groundings. These are traits that made for a \ngreat and potent legislator. Most importantly, if he gave you his word, \nthat was it. You could trust his judgment. You could trust his \ninstincts. Most of all, you could trust his motivations were right. \nThey were heart felt; they were sincere; they were honorable. I think \nthat is the most important.\n  There is a campaign slogan that Senator Coverdell had: Coverdell \nworks. Those who worked with him every day knew he was tireless. He was \nworking on the day that he was stricken. He was a hard worker. He \nworked hard for his State and he worked hard for his country and the \npeople in whom he believed.\n  In 1732, when the colonists came to Paul's great State of Georgia, \nthey came on shore, touched the shore, they kneeled down and said: Our \nend in leaving our native country is not to gain riches and honor but \nsinglely this--to live in the glory of God.\n  I think Paul Coverdell has lived up to that about as well as any \nhuman being could, certainly as well as any Georgian could. You can \ncertainly be proud of this Georgian.\n\n  Abraham Lincoln, on the passing of Henry Clay, said about the ardent \npatriot and profound statesman: He had a quality possessed by few of \nthe gifted on Earth. His eloquence has not been surpassed in the \neffective power to move the heart of man. Paul Coverdell was without an \nequal. I think I agree with Abraham Lincoln on that.\n  We all have vivid memories of the last time we spoke to Paul \nCoverdell. I remember on the Senate floor, with all the confusion of \nthe votes on Friday, all the things going on, and although I can't \nrecall a specific conversation, you can always remember Paul engaging \nsomebody in a conversation.\n  The worst part for me, when I reflect on a sudden death, is if I had \nthe chance to say goodbye, what would I have said? I also find myself \nwishing I had known so I could take the time to say goodbye. I didn't \nget that opportunity to say goodbye to a friend that I loved and \nrespected, but if I had the chance, I would have thanked him for his \nfriendship because it means more than anything else here. I would have \nsaid: Thanks, Paul, for being there for me.\n  In his letter to Mrs. Fairbanks, Mark Twain wrote about friendship:\n\n       . . . I remember you and recall you without effort, without \n     exercise of will; that is, by natural impulse, undictated by \n     a sense of duty or of obligation. And that, I take it, is the \n     only sort of remembering worth having. When we think of \n     friends, and call their faces out of the shadows, and their \n     voices out of the echoes that faint along the corridors of \n     memory, and do it without knowing why save that we love to do \n     it, we can content ourselves that that friendship is a \n     Reality, and not a Fancy, that it is built upon a rock and \n     not upon the sands that dissolve away with the ebbing tides \n     and carry their monuments with them.\n\n  That is how I feel about Paul Coverdell today.\n  The second thing I would have thanked Paul for, if I had had the \nchance to say goodbye, was his sense of humor. He had a great sense of \nhumor. Lord knows, one needs a sense of humor serving in this place. It \ngets intense from time to time. I remember two cases, one recent and \none a long time ago, which I will recall. I will take the long time ago \nfirst.\n  Some of my colleagues will remember Paul had a very interesting \nelection. Georgia, at that time, had a law that candidates had to get \n50 percent of\n\n[[Page S7187]]\n\nthe vote to win. Paul got a little less than that. His opponent got a \nlittle bit more than Paul but less than 50 percent. So Paul was here \nand he was talking to Members, saying: I want to join you guys, but I \nneed a little help, a few contributions. We need to have another \nelection and I have to face this guy again with the third guy out.\n  I said: I will help you, but I am not sure that law is right. Maybe \nthe other guy should have won; he got more votes than you the first \ntime.\n  Paul said: Well, it is all right to change but not yet.\n  I remember that. Paul said that in his gregarious way, not meaning \nanything malicious.\n  The second memory I have of his humor was more recent, about 2 or 3 \nweeks ago. Paul, who is the conference secretary, came out with this \nlittle card. He held the card up proudly. He wanted people to have this \nfor the Fourth of July recess. It proudly boasted ``The Republican \nPriorities for the Surplus,'' and he want down through the list. We all \nlooked at them and after he finished, Senator after Senator stood up \nand said: I don't know where you got that, that is not my priority. Who \ngave you this. And on and on and on for 10 minutes. Paul took it well.\n  After it was over, I walked up to him and I said: Do you regret you \nprinted the card?\n  He said: Were those guys drinking something; what was going on here?\n  It was a fond memory, but so typical. There was no animosity, no \nanger, just rolling with the punches.\n  He said: Next time, I will check with a few people before I print the \ncard.\n  If I had the chance to say goodbye, I would have thanked Paul for \nthat.\n  Let me close by referring to comments that were made several years \nago on this floor by our distinguished colleague, Robert Byrd, who was \ntalking about the death of William Fulbright. He quoted Longfellow. In \nquoting Longfellow, Senator Byrd said:\n\n     There is no death! What seems so is transition;\n     The life of mortal breath\n     Is but a suburb of the life Elysian,\n     Whose portal we call death.\n\n  Then he went on to say about William Fulbright the same thing I would \nsay right now about Paul Coverdell:\n\n       Life is only a narrow isthmus between the boundless oceans \n     of two eternities. All of us who travel that narrow isthmus \n     today, must one day board our little frail barque and hoist \n     its white sails for the journey on that vast unknown sea \n     where we shall sail alone into the boundless ocean of \n     eternity, there to meet our Creator face to face in a land \n     where the rose never withers and the rainbow never fades. To \n     that bourne, from which no traveler ever returns, [Paul \n     Coverdell] has now gone to be reunited with others who once \n     trod these marble halls, and whose voices once rang in this \n     Chamber--voices in this earthly life that have now been \n     stilled forever. Peace be to his ashes!\n\n  Paul Coverdell loved his God; he loved his country; he loved his \nnative Georgia; he loved Nancy and his family. He served them all, and \nhe did it well. I am proud to be called a friend of Senator Paul \nCoverdell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, often the most difficult moments we have on \nthis floor are not when we're trying to advocate a political \nphilosophy, or debate a legislative initiative, but when we pause to \nremember friends and colleagues who have left us. Words, which come \neasily on most occasions, seem suddenly inadequate to express the \nfeelings we have stirring in our hearts--the fond recollections, the \nabiding respect, and the sudden, overwhelming feelings of loss.\n  Paul Coverdell was a friend to each of us, a leader with a spirit \nthat was as buoyant as it was inspiring. His vision and ability to get \nthings done elevated him quickly into increasingly more important roles \nin this distinguished body. As a leader, he was unwavering in this \ndedication to freedom, his support for the bedrock of liberty--family, \ncommunity, education, and personal responsibility.\n  I fondly remember the many occasions we worked together, the \ndiscussions we had, and the ever-increasing sentiment that in Paul I \nhad found something of a kindred political spirit. In fact, I was in \nAtlanta on Monday, at an event he sponsored on my behalf. As always, it \nwas tremendously successful, indicative of how well Paul is regarded by \nthose he serves.\n  It is easy to understand why. From efforts to make education more \naffordable, to reforming the Internal Revenue Service, to working to \nroll back the tax burden, Paul has been a leader, as articulate and \nconvincing as he was constant and unwavering.\n  He intuitively understood the values that bless America. His \nbackground and upbringing groomed him to understand the importance of \nfamily, the concerns of small business owners, the value of learning, \nand the ability of government to promote an environment that supports \nthese areas. Just as important, Paul understood the necessity of \nservice and the blessings that come through service.\n  Not only was he a distinguished soldier, but after the Army--as Paul \nsucceeded in business--he gave back through his service in the Georgia \nState Senate, where he served for many years as the minority leader. \nHis service continued as he led the Peace Corps under President Bush \nand focused that important organization on building and sustaining the \nfundamentals of freedom in the emerging democracies of Central and \nEastern Europe.\n  Because of his service, Paul was well prepared when he came to the \nSenate in 1993. He knew what he would do here, and I can think of no \none with whom I have served who accomplished more than he did in the \ntime he spent among us. His work will remain his legacy. His memory \nwill continue to inspire. And the successes he achieved here will bless \nthe lives and brighten the futures of families and children for years \nto come.\n  At this time I express my appreciation for Paul and his leadership, \nand I want to express my condolences to Nancy and the family, along \nwith my gratitude for their willingness to share a great man with all \nof us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in paying \ntribute to our departed friend and colleague, Paul Coverdell.\n  The Senate today is a very sad place, it is a shaken place, because \nof the suddenness of Paul's death. It is also a day on which I think \nwe, by this tragic event, are reminded that underneath the headlines \nand the great debates and the partisan divides and all the rest of the \nsound and the fury, ultimately this institution, as so many others \nacross America, is 100 people coming to work every day, trying to get a \njob done. It is the hundreds and hundreds of others who work with us \nhere, our staffs and support personnel, who constitute what to me has \nalways seemed to be a small town.\n  Today we are saddened and we are shaken by the loss of one of the \nprominent people in this small town of ours on Capitol Hill, \nWashington, DC, United States of America, Senator Paul Coverdell.\n  My wife said to me once: Remember that being a Senator is just your \njob; it's not you. It's a great job. It's an honor to hold it. It is an \nextraordinary opportunity. But ultimately there is a ``you'' there.\n  That personal side of all of us comes home today as we confront, and \ntry to absorb and deal with, the death of our friend, our colleague, \nour coworker, Paul Coverdell.\n  It reminds us, of course, of the limits of human understanding and \nhuman capacities. As great as we are as a species, as high as we have \ngone, as exciting as the reaches of technology are today, ultimately we \nreach a point of human limitation. It is the point where we meet up \nwith faith in God that, hopefully, transcends those limits, capacities, \nand doubts and moves us forward.\n  Thinking about Paul Coverdell's death and his life, there are two \nquite disparate thoughts that came to my mind--but both of them, I \nthink, fit him. I remember when I first came to Washington--this is an \nold expression--somebody said to me: Remember that there is no limit to \nwhat you can accomplish in Washington if you are not looking for \ncredit. In so many ways that have been testified to here on the Senate \nfloor today, that wisdom fits the career of Paul Coverdell. He was a \nquiet and gentlemanly person, not looking for headlines but committed \nand anxious to be part of making this place work.\n\n[[Page S7188]]\n\n  The second sentiment is something I heard from my own beloved mother, \nand I will bet everybody heard it from their mother, which is, when I \nwas growing up, she always said to my sisters and me: You know, it \nnever hurts to be kind to people. You gain nothing by being harsh.\n  That, too, is a very apt description of Paul Coverdell: a very fine \nhuman being, a very kind human being. In the normal interactions of \nthis extraordinary place where we work together trying to get things \ndone, Paul always had a smile, always a kind word. Even in the partisan \nmoments we all are involved in on the floor, they never seemed to \nbecome personal with him. That, in both senses, is the way it should \nbe.\n  It is, of course, sad but always true: We tend to appreciate people \nmore when they are gone and speak more openly of them when they are \ngone. I think that is the case of this quiet, strong, decent, \nproductive man. I have a sense, in listening to the comments made, of \nthe critical role he played in this Chamber within the Republican \ncaucus, to transcend the divisions that exist in any group of people, \nparticularly any group of political people, and the critical role he \nplayed helping the Senate majority leader in trying to keep the place \nmoving and getting some things done.\n  I can testify, of course, to the fact that Paul was clearly a proud \nRepublican loyal to his party. He was not hesitant to reach across \nparty lines to look for support for something in which he believed or \nto offer support to someone on our side of the aisle for something in \nwhich he believed and felt was right and necessary.\n  I had the greatest opportunity to work side by side with Paul \nCoverdell as a cosponsor of the pioneering, progressive, very important \neducation savings account proposal he made which would have taken the \nbasic idea of higher education savings accounts and expanded them to \ncover K-12 education to help parents support the improvement of their \nchildren's education. There is nothing we can do in this Chamber that \nis much more important than facilitating a better education for all of \nour children.\n  It was easy to work with Paul. He was obviously very bright, he was \nunderstanding, and he was energetic and steadfast. It is an idea I hope \nthose of us on both sides who support it will carry on because it is a \ngood idea, but it is also a tribute to him.\n  I was thinking, earlier this year on a proposal that became \nassociated with the Clinton administration; namely, the aid package to \nColombia to deter and diminish the problem of drugs coming in from that \ncountry, Paul stepped forward and gave sturdy, steadfast, effective \nsupport which ultimately resulted in its adoption with bipartisan \nbacking of a problem that is obviously complex and indeed cannot but \nhelp us as we go forward.\n  We all think of Nancy today and Paul's family. We extend to them our \ncondolences, and we hope, of course, that they are strengthened and, in \nsome measure, comforted at this difficult time by good personal \nmemories of their time too short with Paul, and I am sure they are \nstrengthened and comforted by the pride they should feel and the \nextraordinary record of public service that was Paul Coverdell's life, \nand hopefully given ultimate strength by their faith in God. The Lord \ngiveth and the Lord taketh. Blessed be the name of the Lord. I thank \nthe Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the State of Georgia and the United States \nof America lost a great, decent leader yesterday. Paul Coverdell was \none of the quiet heroes of this Senate Chamber. He was not showy; he \nwas not proud; he was not here for the credit or the prestige or the \npower. He was a gentle man in every sense of the word and in every \naspect of his being.\n  He was here because he loved his State and loved his Nation. He was \nhere because he wanted to improve education. It was a profound concern \nof his. He was here because he wanted to end drug abuse and the scourge \nof drugs among young people. He was here because he wanted to protect \nour national security and secure our children's future and open \nAmerica's promise to all of those he served. He fought for all these \nthings with a humble dignity and a quiet passion that touched each one \nof us.\n  In a way, Paul was the Senate peacemaker. We get a lot of contentious \nissues around here. We are all human beings. Tempers flare. Voices \nrise. It seems as if you are never going to get together with people \nagain across the aisles. Paul Coverdell could step in and work his way \nback and forth and calm things down.\n  Recently, we had the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education bill \nup. I am the ranking member on that subcommittee. The chairman is \nSenator Specter from Pennsylvania. It seems that every year when that \nbill comes up the debate gets hotter. The decibel level goes up a \nlittle bit. We seemed to be locked in a week-long struggle on that \nbill, and I had a chance, once again, to watch Paul Coverdell at work \nin soothing the tensions on both sides, of reaching across to Democrats \nand his own Republicans to find that common ground and just calm things \ndown. He was really good at that. I watched him work. I said once to \nSenator Specter: I am sure glad we have Paul Coverdell around here \nbecause he was able to keep things calm.\n  He helped us reach the compromises, as we must do around here, and to \nfind a common ground between people.\n  I also served with Paul on the Agriculture Committee. We shared a \ncommon love of farmers and rural people. Again, in his own quiet way, I \nsaw the determination and the grit of Paul Coverdell in fighting for \nhis farmers in Georgia during many deliberations on the Ag Committee \nand especially in the passage of the last farm bill.\n  A lot of people do not know this--but Paul and I talked about it \noften--he was born in Des Moines, IA, not more than 10 miles from where \nI was born and raised.\n  It is an honor that I represent a State that produced someone as good \nand as decent as Paul Coverdell. He was one of the finest leaders this \nbody has ever seen.\n  Standing here and looking over at his desk and looking at the black \ncloth and the flowers on the desk cannot help but remind each of us of \nthe transitory nature of human life. Just last week--it seems like \nyesterday--I was on the floor talking with Paul Coverdell about an \nissue, asking for some help and seeing if he could work some things \nout. He was as alive and as vibrant and as engaged and committed to the \nsmooth functioning of this institution as anyone else. Four days later, \nhe passed on.\n\n  Looking at his desk, and thinking about seeing him just a few days \nago, being alive and vibrant and full of health, and looking forward, \nnot only makes us think about the transitory nature of human life but \nit also should serve to remind us we should make every day count--make \nevery day count in emulating the kindness and the gentleness and the \ncaring nature of a Paul Coverdell.\n  One of my political heroes, Hubert Humphrey, once said: ``To be a \nleader means a willingness to risk--and a willingness to love. One must \nask: Has the leader given you something from the heart?''\n  Paul Coverdell had the guts and the courage to take risks. He had a \ngreat will to love. And to that question by Hubert Humphrey, I can say \nyes about Paul Coverdell. He gave us all something from that wonderful \nheart of his.\n  So I join with my friends and colleagues in extending to Nancy and to \nhis family our profound sorrow. We share your sorrow. But we hope you \ntake comfort, as we do, in knowing that the kind and gentle and caring \nlife of Paul Coverdell is now rewarded by the kind and gentle and \ncaring hand of Almighty God.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I, like most of my colleagues today, have \nlistened carefully to the remarks made about our colleague, Paul \nCoverdell. What it has been is a weaving together of a magnificent \ntapestry representing the life of a unique and complete human being--\nPaul Coverdell.\n  Paul Coverdell was a complete human being. We are all judged by many \nfacets of our lives. In the end, what is really most important is: Did \nyou leave the world better than you\n\n[[Page S7189]]\n\nfound it? That question has been answered rather assuredly today in the \ncase of our friend Paul Coverdell.\n  I found part of a speech that President Ronald Reagan gave. As a \nmatter of fact, it was his last speech that he gave before the United \nNations in September of 1988, before he left office. I think it \ncaptures, rather well, Paul Coverdell--a man who served his country in \nuniform, a man who served his country as head of the Peace Corps, who \ntruly touched the world and made the world better, who served his \ncountry as a Senator, who helped all of us as a friend, and who was a \nfaithful and wonderful and loving husband.\n  These words--that I would like to recite in closing my remarks about \nPaul Coverdell--truly capture the essence of this remarkable colleague \nand friend of ours. As President Reagan ended his speech to the United \nNations on September 26, 1988, he said--and we hear the echo of Paul \nCoverdell in these words--\n\n       . . . when we grow weary of the world and its troubles, \n     when our faith in humanity falters, it is then that we must \n     seek comfort and refreshment of spirit, in a deeper source of \n     wisdom, one greater than ourselves.\n       And so if future generations do say of us that, in our \n     time, peace came closer, that we did bring about new seasons \n     of truth and justice, it will be cause for great pride. But \n     it shall be a cause of greater pride still, if it is also \n     said that we were wise enough to know the deliberations of \n     great leaders and great bodies are but overture; that the \n     truly majestic music--the music of freedom, of justice, of \n     peace--is the music made in forgetting self and seeking in \n     silence the will of Him who made us.\n       Thank you for your hospitality over the years. I bid you \n     now farewell. And God bless you.\n\n  We bid farewell to Paul Coverdell. And God bless Paul Coverdell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to deliver my remarks seated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, none of us knows precisely when the \nhereafter begins, when the life of one of the Lord's servants ends. I \nmyself have lost an unusually large number of good friends during the \npast few weeks. But I find it helpful to imagine that I can visualize \neach of them sitting on some sort of Cloud Nine up there, listening to \nthose of us who are mourning the loss of good friends.\n  Yes, I do have a hunch that Paul Coverdell is up there, cheerfully \nand busily lending a hand to Saint Peter. For me, it serves the purpose \nof reassuring that Paul is all right--in fact, better off than he has \never been before.\n  We all remember a hundred different personal vignettes at times like \nthis. In Paul's case, my first acquaintance with him was very early in \nthe morning the day after he was first elected to the Senate in 1992.\n  I had gone quietly into the den of our Raleigh home and turned on the \ntelevision set--the volume very low, so as not to awaken Mrs. Helms. I \nwanted to catch up on the late returns from the election the day \nbefore.\n  I heard a voice; and I was intrigued and impressed by that voice. \nThen I looked carefully. I did not recognize the young man who was \nspeaking. It was Paul Coverdell. I saw the picture of him that appeared \non the screen. It was a live interview. Paul had not yet gone to bed. \nHe had been up for about 36 or 40 hours.\n  There he was fielding questions politely, intelligently, and with \nthat inevitable smile on his face.\n  That was the moment my respect and admiration--and affection--for \nSenator Coverdell began.\n  Now fast forward: Like most, if not all, other Senators, I realize \ntoday that I will forever have special memories of Paul Coverdell. He \nwas a good man, an honorable man, a dedicated man with whom I shared a \ngreat affection for today's young people--the responsible ones, the \nones who understand their good fortune of living in this country--those \nwho, as Paul Coverdell once put it, understand that the strength and \nthe goodness and the very future of America will shortly be in their \nhands.\n  I have sat and listened to other who have spoken so eloquently today \nof the Senator's rapid rise in the leadership of the Republican Party \nin the Senate. That happened because Paul believed in the Senate. He \nbelieved in the meaning of the U.S. Senate, and he believed that we \nhave a duty to endeavor to achieve a spirit of cooperation and \nunderstanding--including the realization that we have the duty to make \nthe tripartite system work.\n  So, Paul, if that's you whom I think I'm looking at on Cloud Nine, \nyou know that we are missing you and that we are so dearly grateful for \nthe years that we enjoyed working with you. I have a notion that the \nLord will be blessing you for being His good and faithful servant while \nyou were amongst us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Helms. He asked if he \ncould speak before me. I said, of course, and that permitted me to hear \nwhat he had to say. It was beautiful, and I was privileged to hear it.\n  Most of us are privileged to believe in a hereafter. Frankly, it is \ndifficult for me to conceive of an adult human being with a mind and a \nheart, difficult for me to see how they do not all believe there is a \nhereafter. But there is no doubt in my mind that what I believe by \nfaith is true, and there is no doubt in my mind that Paul Coverdell is \nin the hereafter.\n  I didn't come to the floor today to speak about matters of great \ndepth or of religion or faith or hope. I came to talk about the Paul \nCoverdell I knew day by day.\n  Let me first say, it is very difficult to put the flowers and the \ncloth where they actually belong, because Paul Coverdell is not known \nas much for being at that desk as he is being in this aisle and taking \nsomebody's place in this chair. For most of his time in the Senate, he \nwas either putting together a group of Senators to address an issue or \nhe was trying to get the Senate's work done, because he was asked \neither by a chairman or by the leader to do it. The more difficult the \ntask, the more it was given to him.\n  When you had an education bill with 200 amendments or a Labor-Health \nand Human Services appropriations bill with, at one point, 270 \namendments, somebody quietly asked that one of our Senators help. It \nwas almost always Paul Coverdell who was asked. He was so good at it \nand so friendly and could bring people together so well that the \nchairman willingly accepted his help. I can see the last time he pulled \nup his coat and was given, after he accepted the assignment, a list \nwith hundreds of amendments on it. The task was: Narrow them down. By \nthe end of the day, they were talking optimistically about finishing. \nAnd by the next day, Paul Coverdell, not at that desk but walking these \naisles and sitting with Senators everywhere, was getting the work done, \nalways being considerate, kind, and understanding.\n  Sometimes we herald Senators because they have been here a long time. \nI suggest that Paul Coverdell and his wife Nancy and those who knew \nhim, those who elected him, and those who supported him must know by \nnow that he was a wonderful Senator. That was not measured by his \nhaving four or five terms as Senator, as I have been lucky to do, or my \nfriend, Thad Cochran, who sits here, from the State of Mississippi. But \nhe, in a few years, captured all of our hearts and all of our hopes for \nsuccess. We would transplant them over to him.\n  I came with no speech but with a letter. Two days, 3 days before he \ndied, I arrived at my desk and found a letter. My staff had taken it \nout of the mail and put it on my desk. Frankly, I left it there not \nknowing he would die. I was going to read it in due course. Surely, the \nday that he died, I sat down at my desk and read his letter.\n  The letter is not profound. The letter is Paul Coverdell. It is the \nPaul Coverdell who is so considerate that after coming to my office and \nspending an hour and a half of his time with a staffer of his and two \nof mine, where he had asked me if I would be of help, he willingly \nsaid: I will come to your office. We talked with a couple of my staff \nwho were assigned to him. He did a job for the Republicans in preparing \nsomething we needed, and then he wrote a letter on top of all that \nwhere he was doing the labor, the work. He wrote this letter:\n       Dear Pete: Thanks again for meeting to discuss our recess \n     communication efforts. As always, your insight has been quite \n     helpful in determining how to craft a credible short term \n     message on the surplus. Bill Hoagland\n\n[[Page S7190]]\n\n     and Jim Capretta of your staff were of invaluable assistance \n     to us as well. Thanks again.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Paul D. Coverdell.\n\n  I submit there are not too many of us who would be so considerate \nthat when we wrote a Senator to say it was good to be with you, would \nmention the staff people who really got the work done because they knew \nmore about it than we did. But here is Paul Coverdell, the last \nsentence of his letter, thanking Bill Hoagland and Jim Capretta by \nname. He puts it in here. How many Senators are that considerate as to \nwhat the names of staffers are who they meet in another Senator's \noffice? Some of us are not considerate enough to say: Would you please \nrepeat your name because I would actually like to know your name.\n  I believe this is typical of Paul Coverdell. I surmise that for his \nwhole life, certainly while he was in the Peace Corps, and the public \nservice part of his life, he was always considerate.\n  Let me suggest that being considerate does not mean being weak. Being \nconsiderate does not mean you don't get something done. Being \nconsiderate does not mean you cave in. Being considerate is being like \nPaul Coverdell.\n  As I indicated, I will never remember him in that seat that we honor \nhim by today because that is his assigned seat. I will remember him as \nmore the epitome of a Senator who worked on the floor of the Senate. \nThat is a very special kind of Senator. First of all, most of us don't \nknow how to do it. Secondly, most of us are not asked to do it. He was \nasked. He knew how to do it in terms of helping people bring difficult \nmatters to a head, to solutions, and helping his party with great \ninsights on strategy.\n  Mr. President, I say to his wife Nancy and his beloved: We don't know \nhow to explain this to any of you. We are incapable of doing that. But, \nclearly, if you don't know it now, in very short order you will \nunderstand that he lived a very great life as a Senator, and the \nrespect and admiration that has been shown, and will be shown, is \nprobably an indication that he was as close to all of us as any Senator \naround.\n  With that, I say good-bye, Paul; God bless you and your family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, our colleagues have spoken so well about \nPaul Coverdell as a gentleman, as a person who was thoughtful and \npersuasive. As Senator Domenici said, he worked the aisles \nindefatigably with the ideals that he held.\n  First of all, it is fundamental that Paul Coverdell was elected to \nthe Senate. It was a very difficult contest--one not decided on \nelection day, the day of his first election. He was an extraordinarily \nexperienced politician and statesman in the State of Georgia, with \nremarkable legislative experience as a leader throughout much of his \ntenure. But those from our party in Georgia have a very difficult time \nwith that, and that was the case for Paul. It was a very close contest. \nHe won graciously, came to the Senate, and had a difficult reelection \ncontest for which he began to prepare early and in which he asked many \nof us to participate. But he did it all so gracefully, so thoughtfully, \nso constructively, that we rarely think of Paul Coverdell as a very \ntough political competitor and someone who was in a difficult arena. It \ntook great courage to make those races to begin with and remarkable \ntenacity to follow through to success.\n  My own first impressions of Paul Coverdell came during the often \ncommented period in which he served as head of the Peace Corps. Paul \nCoverdell was in Latin America and various other places where some of \nus tried to work for democracy in those days. They were remarkable \ndays--the 1980s--in which all of the countries of our hemisphere \nfinally landed on their feet with democratic institutions. That was \ntrue of countries in Asia and countries elsewhere around the world. \nPaul Coverdell's tenure in the Peace Corps is distinguished by the fact \nthat the Peace Corps had matured, literally.\n  Many members of the Corps were now very mature individuals, not young \npersons out of college, or in some type of transition before they went \ninto another professional career. As a matter of fact, under Paul's \ntenure, the Peace Corps evolved into a group of teachers, \nenvironmentalists, and farm experts, in addition to, still, a very \nstrong component of young idealistic people. It was this combination of \npeople that gave sustenance to democracy, helped the economy, helped \nthe pushing forward of intellectual pursuits, and likewise forged an \nincreasing friendship and reverence for the United States and for our \ntraditions.\n  Therefore, it was with great excitement that I welcomed Paul \nCoverdell to the Foreign Relations Committee. That is a committee on \nwhich he belonged. He made huge contributions on that committee. We \nfocused frequently on Latin America, Central America, South America, \nand the Caribbean--areas with which he was well acquainted from \nprevious times when he had really been there in the beginning of the \nevolution of many democratic propositions. I sat next to him in the \ncommittee through the markups, through the hearings. He was always \ncheerful. He was always thoughtful in exchanging views in a very \nforthright way. I admired and I listened to Paul. He made a very strong \ncontribution day by day in the work of the committee.\n  But my close association with Paul came in the Agriculture Committee. \nI will mention that Paul was chairman of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, Subcommittee on Marketing, Inspection, and Product \nPromotion. He did a great job. We have just four subcommittees in the \nAgriculture Committee. These are committees that have opportunities to \nhold hearings independently, or to contribute to the body as a whole as \nthey may wish. Paul Coverdell had a broad philosophical view of \nagriculture that included freedom--freedom for the farmers whom he \nrepresented to make decisions with regard to management of their land \nand their crops and their livestock, and the prospects for their \ncommunities. He championed that idea without apology. But he also was \nvery much in tune with the very specific problems of Georgia farmers.\n\n  They included an interest in peanuts. Paul and I had disagreements \nabout the peanut program. In fact, it has either been my fate or \nprivilege for many years to suggest reform. Paul always feared that \nthose reforms would come during his time, and he tried to dissuade me \nand, having failed in that respect, to at least bring me up to date on \nwhat the actual problems of peanut farmers were, how they could be \nhelped, and how the legislation I was suggesting could be brought \nbefore the committee and modified, and ways to be helpful to the \noverall policy and to the constituents whom he saw very much in need of \nhis support.\n  Mr. President, he prevailed in that area. We made reforms. But I \nthink they were reforms that were very heavily influenced by the hand \nof Paul Coverdell. Due to the fact that he did his homework, he was \npersuasive, and he knew the farmers. He spoke for them.\n  In addition to the peanut situation, which was always with him, in \nrecent years, severe drought--and this is one of those years in \nGeorgia--occupied much of Paul Coverdell's time, working with specific \nlandowners and communities, with much of his State in the throes of a \nvery difficult predicament. As I looked at the weather map just last \nweek, I saw how the drought problem has shifted just in a very few \nweeks in our country from patches that covered much of the area of the \nUnited States to very isolated situations. Unfortunately, Georgia is \none of those situations. It is especially cruel because the rains have \ncome to the Midwest and to many of the plains States with isolated \nproblems still--in some parts of Nebraska, Iowa, and the Dakotas.\n  But Paul, in his own way, always made certain we knew about Georgia \nand the very specific problems there. So when we had the large debates \nthat we were privileged to have on the floor, dealing with risk \nmanagement, dealing with payments to farmers to supplement their income \nin a very difficult year, and with specific emergencies, Paul was very \nactive in that debate. He was successful in that debate.\n  As Senator Domenici pointed out in his beautiful statement, Paul \nCoverdell was always one who thanked everybody involved and made \ncertain\n\n[[Page S7191]]\n\nthat they knew of his care and attention and appreciation. It was my \nprivilege to receive one of those notes after the debate which we had \nhere. It is very difficult to try to think about the representation of \nthat State without thinking of Paul Coverdell. He was so good, so \nfaithful and, really, so effective and articulate. He was such a good \nfriend. We will miss him. Our thoughts are with him and with Nancy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in expressing \nmy sadness over the loss of a valued colleague. I think we have lost a \ngreat friend.\n  I was looking over some of the correspondence I had with Senator \nCoverdell. He sent me some Vidalia onions and told me they had a punch. \nHe had a way of writing that was very interesting, in fact.\n  I think Senator Coverdell grew in stature every year he was here.\n  I remember so well when he came to us. We had known him as part of \nthe Peace Corps group. I believe his wife was a Delta stewardess at the \ntime. He came around to visit each one of us. He came around to visit \nme and told me a little bit about some of his background. I knew then \nthat we had a person who was going to be outgoing because not many \nSenators do that. He took time to visit with each one of us as he came \nto the Senate.\n  I think the skills he developed as a mediator will be missed in this \nSenate. I remember some of the bills he worked on even just this year--\nthe Health and Human Services bill, for instance--bills with so many \namendments, and it took committed work on the floor of the Senate.\n  Paul Coverdell was a volunteer. He volunteered himself for the task; \nhe worked with Senator Reid from Nevada. I think he assisted members of \nour committee on an enormous number of disputes. Without his help and \nwithout his skills, I think we would still be involved in some of those \nbills.\n  He also came to us with some educational background from his life in \nGeorgia. He brought us some educational concepts that are going to \nlast, I hope, for years to come. His education savings account program, \nfor instance, is one.\n  He also helped us in the field of general education because of his \napproach. He prodded us, I think Senator Specter would agree, to not \nonly meet but to exceed the President's request this year on \neducational funding.\n  He was a very interesting and complex man. He was an advocate for \nkeeping drugs out of the hands of children. He saw the appropriations \nprocess--as Senator Cochran and others who work with me on \nappropriations know--as a means to try to solve problems through the \nproper use of public funds.\n  As chairman of the Defense Subcommittee of our Appropriations \nCommittee, I met with him often on problems of military families in his \nState. I know of no person who was a more vigorous advocate for \nproduction from a State than Paul Coverdell. When it came to the C-130 \naircraft, he was a workhorse and not a show horse. I don't remember \nseeing Paul Coverdell's name in the paper in terms of some who sought \npublicity, but I saw in him a great deal as a man who sought results.\n  I say to the Senate that we lost a great friend and a valued \ncolleague. I join in expressing my sadness over his loss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to join my \ncolleagues in expressing my sadness and my condolences in behalf of the \nfamily of Paul Coverdell.\n  In the more than 3 years that I have had the privilege of serving in \nthe Senate, he was someone who was respected for his work, for his \neffort, and for his sincere commitment to ensuring that all the \nviewpoints were heard, and that we moved forward and acted for the \npeople of this country.\n  He was particularly protective, obviously, of his State of Georgia \nand his constituents because he felt deeply for their needs. He worked \nhard to achieve benefits for his constituents. He had talent, \npersonality, and character. You could disagree with him, but he was not \na disagreeable person. He was a consummate gentleman. He was polite. He \nwas civil. He was approachable. He had those personal qualities that \nendeared him to all who serve in this body. He was someone respected by \nall of us. We all admired him.\n  Other colleagues have talked about his many efforts in educational \npolicy, such as his efforts to ensure appropriate response for our \nmilitary posture around the world.\n  I had the occasion just briefly in the last debate about Colombia to \nwork with him and speak with him. He was committed to ensuring that our \npolicy in that part of the world was not only consistent with our \nideals as a democratic nation but also helped decisively stem the tide \nof drugs that has weakened this country. He did it in his typical \nfashion--quietly, diligently, without a lot of fanfare but with great \nsuccess and great results.\n  We shall miss his temperament. We shall miss his commitment to this \nprocess. We shall miss his character and his contribution to the \ncountry.\n  To his family I offer my sincerest condolences.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise with my colleagues to express my \ndeepest sympathy for Nancy and Paul's family.\n  I had the great good fortune to come to the Senate with Paul \nCoverdell, as did the Senator from North Dakota, who I see sitting \nacross the aisle.\n  Paul was a special individual. He brought to this Senate an \ninfectious enthusiasm and gracious energy which dominated the \ninstitution and those of us who worked with him. He always had a smile. \nHe always had an idea. He always had a purpose. The purpose was tied to \nmaking this country a better place to live--for all of us and for our \nchildren.\n  He used to wander around this institution with a styrofoam cup that \nhad ``Waffle House'' on it. That was one of the great mysteries to me \nin this institution--how Paul Coverdell managed to get Waffle House \ncoffee sent all the way from Georgia.\n  It was a great promotor of Georgia. He never missed an opportunity to \npromote Georgia. That was only one of the minor ways he did it.\n  He was a great friend, also. I had lots of discussions with him. We \nworked on lots of issues--our concerns about the original health care \nproposal put forward by this administration, to when we set up the \nfirst aggressive, active task force that I got involved in and that he \nwas also involved in. Even at the time we were both new to this \ninstitution, he had an incredible amount of ideas and initiatives on \nways to address the issues. He was always tactically two or three steps \nahead of the rest of us. He understood the way the institution worked \nlong before some of us--I put myself in that category--who didn't fully \nunderstand the institution. He had an intuitive sense about the \nSenate--a feel for it and a love of it. He knew how to work an issue, \nto address an issue in order to produce better policy and better \ngovernment for our country. I worked with him on that.\n  It seemed almost all of the time we were working on an answer with \nPaul Coverdell because he was involved in about every issue that came \nthrough the institution that had significance. The last major issue I \nworked with him on, of course, was education. We had a task force on \nour side to put forward what I thought was an extremely positive \neducational agenda, much of which came from his thought processes, \nwhich I was proud to support.\n  We worked a lot, of course, on Governor Bush's campaign. I had a \ndiscussion last Friday with him about that. He was working hard on an \nissue having to do with that campaign, and we was very hopeful that \nGovernor Bush would become the next President.\n  He also had, as I mentioned, a deep regard for this body.\n  I think one of the discussions I will remember fondly occurred last \nweek when we were sitting in my office. Some of the offices in the \nRussell Building have unique marble fireplaces. Many offices have \nunique desks. He was very concerned that we didn't really have a \nhistorical database of where these desks came from, who had these \ndesks, and we didn't have a historical database of where the marble, \nfor example, of the fireplaces came from; We had not, as a Senate, done \nour job of maintaining our own traditions and our own history as well \nwe\n\n[[Page S7192]]\n\nmight. We got to talking about that and the history of the Senate. His \nlove of the institution was exuberant.\n  What a huge impact he had in such a short time. We only came 8 years \nago--the two of us. At that time, I think there were 11 after the class \nfinally got settled in. He took a while to get here because he \nconfronted a number of races, but with his perseverance he was totally \ncommitted and won them all. In that time, he left a huge mark.\n  One of the true strengths of our democracy is that it totally exceeds \nany individual. This institution includes Daniel Webster, Calhoun, \nClay; people in our century who had a huge impact, including Taft, Bob \nDole. When they leave, the institution goes on; it functions. It \nfunctions extraordinarily well for a democratic body--as well as a \ndemocratic body can function. It produces governance for our people \nwhich is fair and honest and committed to a better life.\n  Recognizing that the institution goes on, there are still people who \nleave a mark. There are still people whose memory will be there, and \nwill be there for a considerable amount of time. Paul certainly falls \nin that category. It will be hard for me to turn and look at that door \nand not see Paul standing by it, working on some issue. That is where \nhe usually worked from, the pillar back there, addressing some concern, \nplanning some initiative, all of which was directed at one single \npurpose: Preserving and keeping our democracy.\n  We will miss him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the life and \nlegacy of Senator Paul Coverdell. His passing has shocked and saddened \nus all. It has left a void in the Senate and in our nation.\n  For Senator Coverdell, public service was his profession and his \npassion. After serving in the Army, he began his public life as a \nmember of the Georgia State Senate where he served as Minority Leader. \nAfter working in the private sector, he was appointed Director of the \nPeace Corps. In this important position he worked to spread American \nvalues around the world. This experience helped him when he later \nserved on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he was a leader \nin our international effort to strengthen our anti-drug efforts.\n  In the Senate, Senator Coverdell was known as a hard worker who often \nreached across the aisle to build coalitions. Senator Coverdell fought \nhard for his principles. We didn't always agree on policy--but he \nalways treated those on the other side with dignity and respect. He \nknew that despite our different views, we all shared a common goal. We \nall want to do what's best for our constituents and our nation. He \nunderstood that we can get more done with civility than with \ncontention.\n  Senator Coverdell will be greatly missed. My thoughts and prayers are \nwith his family.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to address the terrible \nloss the Senate suffered yesterday, when Paul Coverdell left this \nEarth. I was truly shocked by the news. Just last week, Paul was on the \nfloor of the Senate, working in his quiet and non-assuming way. \nYesterday, I was writing him a get-well card. Today, he is gone.\n  Paul was a dedicated public servant. He served the state of Georgia \nand this nation in the Army, the legislature, as a businessman, as the \nhead of the Peace Corps and in the U.S. Senate. The respect he had \nearned from his colleagues here is evident in his appointment to \nnumerous task forces and his election to a leadership position. His \npassing is a major loss to this body and this great country.\n  Since I am also from a state where agriculture is an important part \nof the economy, Paul was a valuable ally in ensuring the family farms \ndo not disappear. I also admired his work to keep our children safe \nfrom drugs and crime, a priority he and I shared. Paul represented the \nbest of America: a belief that people flourish when they have the \nfreedom to work and make their own decisions.\n  Paul will truly be missed. He stood out in the Senate for the simple \nreason that he never drew attention to himself. In a business where \negos can run rampant, Paul did not display one. He preferred to get \nthings done.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Nancy, and their family. \nThey have some tough days ahead of them. I hope they can look back, as \nI do, at the impressive record of Paul's work with a sense of pride. I \nam thankful for the chance to know such a man.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nmourning the sudden and untimely death of our colleague from Georgia, \nPaul Coverdell.\n  Senator Coverdell had a long and distinguished career of public \nservice, capped by his dedicated service in the United States Senate. \nSenator Coverdell served his country in the United States Army in \nJapan, Taiwan and Korea. In 1970, he embarked on a career in politics \nin his native Georgia, serving as a state Senator and chairman of the \nstate Republican party. In 1989 he was selected by President Bush to \nlead the Peace Corps.\n  We here in the Senate, though, knew Paul Coverdell as a friend and as \na real gentleman. We did not always agree on the issues, but Paul \nCoverdell never took policy disagreements personally and never let them \naffect his relationships with other Senators. Senator Coverdell was \nalways very positive, very upbeat. On every issue, even when we \ndisagreed, I found Paul to be fair, decent, and, above all, honest.\n  In this body, some Senators are known as ``work horses.'' Others are \nknown as ``show horses.'' There is no question that Paul Coverdell was \na work horse. He was not flashy. He did not seek the media spotlight. \nPaul Coverdell worked tirelessly with the leadership on his side of the \naisle on some of the toughest issues facing the Senate. He was \ninterested in getting results, not credit. His focus, his \ndetermination, and his willingness to bring other Senators together to \nget things done served the Senate well, served Georgia well, and served \nour country well. His spirit and energy will be sorely missed in this \nbody.\n  Put simply, I liked and respected Paul Coverdell. We will miss him. \nMy thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Nancy, his family and \nfriends, and his staff.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I join all of my colleagues, the staff \nof the Senate, the people of Georgia, citizens across America and \naround the world in morning the death of Paul Coverdell.\n  A thoroughly decent human being, he worked long and hard for what he \nthought was right. His career reflected the combination of principle \nand effective leadership that were characteristic of the way he did \nbusiness. In his quite way, he managed to navigate some very difficult \nwaters, keeping his equanimity and dignity intact, while gaining not \nonly his goal, but the respect of all who associated with him.\n  Many in the Senate can claim friendships with him that extend to \nseveral decades. I met him only after he was elected to the Senate in \n1992, but from the first, I was impressed by the same things his \nfriends loved and admired in him--his kindness, his sense of humor, and \nhis work ethic. A skilled legislator, he was often asked by the \nleadership to help move matters along. He did this in concert with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, always managing to ``disagree \nwithout being disagreeable.'' He was a public servant of the highest \norder.\n  His family, friends, staff, constituents, and colleagues certainly \nknow what has been lost for we know what he was and what he did with \nhis life. He will be missed in so many circles, but his influence and \nhis good works will continue.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to join with my colleagues in \nexpressing my deep sorrow at the loss of our friend and colleague, Paul \nCoverdell. During this difficult time, I want to extend my thoughts and \nprayers to Nancy and all of his family.\n  Paul and I both came to Washington, D.C. in January of 1993. In the \nyears that I've know Paul, I've always been impressed by his \nthoughtfulness and his work ethic.\n  I always had the upmost respect for him because of his quiet \ndemeanor. He did not seek headlines, and he did not seek credit. \nWhether it was fighting illegal drugs or working on education or tax \npolicy, he simply did his work with a quiet determination, an open \nheart,\n\n[[Page S7193]]\n\nand a kind word for anyone who crossed his path.\n  My predecessor in the Senate, Warren Magnuson, had a phrase for \nsomeone like that-- ``a workhorse not a showhorse.''\n  Paul Coverdell was a workhorse in the finest sense.\n  Paul earned the respect of everyone here because he treated everyone \nelse with respect and dignity.\n  Paul's work here in the United States Senate was really just an \nextension of a lifetime of service. Whether it was serving his country \nin the U.S. Army, serving the people of Georgia as a state senator, or \nhelping people around the world through his work as director of the \nUnited States Peace Corps, Paul brought his generous spirit and his \ndetermination to everything he undertook.\n  Mr. President, the people of Georgia are fortunate to have been \nserved by a person of Paul's character and skills.\n  Those of us who worked with him here in the U.S. Senate were \nfortunate to have him as a friend and colleague. His passing is a loss \nto our Senate, to Georgia and to the Nation. I will miss him as a \nfriend and colleague.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nhonoring a distinguished public servant and a valued Member of the \nUnited States Senate, Senator Paul Coverdell, who died Tuesday evening \nat the Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.\n  Senator Coverdell was elected to the United States Senate in 1992 and \nserved as the Republican Conference Secretary since December, 1996. He \nwas a member of the Senate Finance, Foreign Relations, and Small \nBusiness Committees and chaired the Agriculture Committee's \nSubcommittee on Marketing, Inspection and Product Promotion.\n  Before entering public life, Senator Coverdell served in the U.S. \nArmy in Okinawa, Taiwan and Korea. He earned a Bachelor's degree in \njournalism from the University of Missouri before returning to Georgia \nto work in his family's business.\n  Paul Coverdell's political career began in 1970 when he was elected \nto the Georgia State Senate serving as Minority Leader for 14 years. In \n1989, he accepted President Bush's appointment as Director of the Peace \nCorps, where he refined the agency's mission to serve the emerging \ndemocracies of Eastern Europe.\n  While Senator Coverdell and I rarely agreed on the many issues that \ncame before the Senate for consideration, I greatly respected his hard \nwork and his unfailing courtesy and civility. He was a modest man who \nvalued results more than he valued headlines. Indeed, Paul Coverdell \nwas well-respected by every member of this body, engendering the \naffection of all those with whom he served.\n  Senator Coverdell served the citizens of Georgia and the Nation well \nand we are all deeply saddened by his untimely death. I would like to \ntake this opportunity to pay tribute to him and to extend my deepest \nand heartfelt sympathies to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/19/senate-section/article/S7193-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7193-S7216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n          RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3925\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank Senators for their eloquent words about the \npassing of Paul Coverdell. I see no one else seeking recognition for \nthat purpose, so at this time I move back to the bill. If there is \nanything Paul Coverdell disliked, it was quorum calls and delaying the \nprocess. We worked together on the education bill, and I know he was \nproud when it moved expeditiously and the debate was lively.\n  In that spirit, I think we must return to the business before the \nSenate.\n  Therefore, I call up amendment 3925.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], for himself, Mr. \n     Wellstone, Mr. Dorgan, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Johnson, \n     Mr. Levin, and Mr. Bryan, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3925.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow \n                    importation of covered products)\n\n       At the end of title VII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, I will now discuss a problem we have \nrelative to the cost of prescription drugs.\n  I am joining several of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in \noffering an amendment that will take a giant step toward providing \naccess to affordable prescription drugs for Vermonters, and all \nAmericans.\n  Our amendment will allow pharmacists and wholesalers to import safe, \nU.S.-made, FDA-approved lower-cost prescription drugs from other \ncountries. We maintain the gold standard of safety in this country, but \nhope to rein in the platinum standard we have for prices.\n  Prescription drugs have revolutionized the treatment of certain \ndiseases, but they are only effective if patients have access to the \nmedicines that their doctors prescribe. The best medicines in the world \nwill not help a person who can not afford them.\n  Americans pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription \ndrugs, and for many the price is just too high.\n  What's worse is that those Americans who can least afford it are the \nones paying the highest prices. Americans who don't have health \ninsurance that covers drugs are forced to pay the ``sticker price'' off \nthe pharmacist's shelf.\n  In short, the practice of price discrimination hits the uninsured and \nlow-income Medicare beneficiaries the hardest.\n  It is sad that during a time when the United States is experiencing \nunprecedented economic growth, it is not uncommon to hear of patients, \nlike we heard in my committee's hearing yesterday, who cut pills in \nhalf, or skip dosages in order to make prescriptions last longer, \nbecause they can't afford the refill.\n  The question that we must ask is, can we put politics aside and work \nin a bipartisan manner to deal with this national crisis? I say we \nmust. And I am hopeful that today we can.\n  This bipartisan amendment I am offering is based on legislation I \nintroduced, S. 2520, the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act, or the \nMEDS Act. Joining me in introducing that legislation were Senators \nWellstone, Snowe, and Collins and joining as cosponsors are Senators \nDorgan and Gorton. The hearing I held yesterday allowed all of the \nparties to fully examine and articulate their views on this \nlegislation.\n\n  Our bill, which we have revised and are offering as an amendment, \ngives pharmacists and wholesalers the ability to negotiate more \nfavorable prices with manufacturers. They can do so because they will \nhave the ability to purchase in other countries--this is important--\nwhere exactly the same drugs are sold for far less. These are areas \nthat have been approved by the FDA. There is no question about that \naspect.\n  The drug industry has argued that this amendment compromises safety. \nAs chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, \nsafety is my first concern. That is why these imports will be limited \nto FDA-approved drugs that are made in the United States or FDA \ninspected facilities. And that is why this amendment reflects weeks of \ndiscussions with the people who enforce our drug safety laws.\n  The amendment before us is a revision of the MEDS Act based on input \nfrom government experts who raised issues of public health and safety. \nSpecifically, I asked FDA for technical assistance on this bill, and \naddressed each safety concern that the agency raised.\n  I also point out to my colleagues that this amendment specifically \nauthorizes FDA to incorporate any other safeguard that it believes is \nnecessary to ensure the protection of the public health of patients in \nthe United States.\n  This amendment is about free trade. Why should Americans pay the \nhighest prices in the world for prescription drugs? All this amendment \ndoes is allow international competition to bring rational pricing \npractices to the prescription drug industry. It introduces competition \nwhich is the hallmark of our success in this Nation.\n  I point out this bipartisan amendment also drops a provision in our \noriginal bill that would have allowed personal imports, which I would \nhave liked to retain because I think it is important.\n  We dropped the personal use provision in order to answer concerns \nthat some raised about safety. I was willing to compromise on that \npoint at this time in order to get a bill that raises no safety \nconcerns at all.\n  I want the record to clearly reflect that I still feel strongly that \nVermonters should not be in violation of federal law if they go a few \nmiles across the border into Canada to get deep discounts on \nprescriptions. We do nothing in here to indicate they should not be \nallowed to do so.\n  This amendment will provide equitable treatment of Americans, \nparticularly those who do not have insurance, or access to big \ndiscounts for large purchases like HMOs. As I said before, this is not \nthe only solution. I strongly believe we need a prescription drug \nbenefit in the Medicare system for those people who are eligible for \nMedicare. But it is a commonsense measure that we can enact now to ease \nthe burden of expensive prescription drugs on our people, for those on \nthe borders, and all Americans. I ask for the support of my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n[[Page S7195]]\n\n                Amendment No. 3927 to Amendment No. 3925\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for himself and \n     Mr. Kohl, proposes an amendment numbered 3927.\n       At the end of the amendment insert the following:\n       ``(g) This section shall become effective only if the \n     Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services \n     certifies to the Congress that the implementation of this \n     section will: (1) pose no risk to the public's health and \n     safety; and (2) result in a significant reduction in the cost \n     of covered products to the American consumer.''\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the purpose of this second-degree \namendment is to try to help ensure the result of the change in this \nlaw, in the authority for importing drugs into the country or selling \ndrugs to American consumers from Canada, which I think this amendment \nthe Senator has offered is targeted to address, will not result in any \nnew dangers to the consuming public, and would require the Secretary to \ncertify that that would be the case for any new regulatory regime \nimplementing the amendment if it is adopted.\n  One problem we need to bring to the attention of the Senate in \nconnection with this amendment is the added cost that is going to \nresult from this, in terms of added appropriations for the Food and \nDrug Administration. It is estimated by that agency that $92 million \nwould have to be appropriated to provide the funding necessary to \nimplement and carry out the obligations of that agency in connection \nwith supervising this amendment.\n  The distinguished Senator is chairman, as Senators know, of the \nlegislative committee that has jurisdiction over this overall subject \narea in the law. I regret this is an issue being brought to the Senate \nas an amendment to the Agriculture Department's appropriations bill. It \nwould be more appropriate, in my view, for the legislative committee \nwhich the Senator chairs to deal with this, to report out legislation, \nand in the usual way of managing changes in the law, have the Senate \naddress it on a freestanding bill. The body is put at a disadvantage to \ntry to understand all the nuances, the implications of the legislation, \nwhat the practical results will be. It has become very controversial. I \nthink the Senator from North Dakota, in opening remarks as we brought \nthis legislation up yesterday or the day before, talked about the \nadvertising that was being run in the newspapers by the pharmaceutical \nindustry. I think that is on this subject. It is related to this \nsubject.\n  So there is a great deal of attention being focused on this highly \ncontroversial issue. All the States along the northern tier that border \non Canada have a great interest in this. It has become a hot button \npolitical subject for debate in senatorial campaigns and, I guess, all \nthe congressional elections and the Presidential campaign. So this is a \nbig political item here we are called upon to understand, to sort \nthrough, and then to make sure we legislate in a fashion that serves \nthe public interest--not somebody's private political interest, not \nsomebody's private financial interest, but the broad public interests \nof the United States. That is our responsibility.\n  So what I am seeking to do with this second-degree amendment is \nensure that is the result; that we are not putting in jeopardy, by \nchanging this law, if this survives the process here in the Senate and \nconference with the House--we are not putting in jeopardy the well-\nbeing of American consumers and we also prepare to add to the funding \nrequirements of the Food and Drug Administration to enable them to \ncarry out their obligations under the law.\n  With those words of explanation as to where I see this and how I see \nthis playing out, I am not going to prolong the debate.\n  Let me point out one other thing. Some might say this is legislation \non an appropriations bill; Why don't you just raise the issue in that \nway? Make a point of order under rule XVI.\n  The point is the House has included language in its Agriculture \nappropriations bill and this amendment, as it is drafted--as I am \nadvised by the Parliamentarian--is not subject to a rule XVI point of \norder but, rather, it is germane and would not fall if a point of order \nis made. That may be tested by somebody if they want to argue with the \nParliamentarian about it, but that is what my staff advises me.\n\n  With that information about this situation I am prepared to let \nothers talk about it. Let me say, before I yield the floor, just as a \nmatter of general information now that we are on the bill, Senator Kohl \nis the cosponsor of this second-degree amendment. I have offered the \namendment with him.\n  Also, as we began consideration of the appropriations bill, he did \nnot have an opportunity to make his opening remarks. At some point this \nafternoon, we will give him that opportunity or he can take that \nopportunity when he gains recognition from the Chair.\n  I hope this will not be a long, drawn-out debate. It is not \nnecessary. We have heard a lot of speeches about this. We have had a \nlot of information sent to our offices on this issue of reimportation \nand selling drugs and pharmaceutical products across the borders, \nimporting from manufacturers, the rights of pharmacists--all the other \nrelated issues. It is a serious matter. But we do not need to have a \nlong, drawn-out filibuster of it in my view. We need to vote on it. If \nthe votes are here to adopt this amendment, so be it. We will take it \nto conference and try to resolve the issue in the way we always do, \ngive and take, trying to understand what is best for the country.\n  Also in connection with the broader picture of the bill itself, we do \nnot have a lot of troublesome issues in this bill, in my view. I have \nnot heard from Senators. We have asked Senators to let us know if they \nhave amendments, to bring them to the floor and offer them, and let's \ndispose of them and complete action on this bill. I was heartened today \nby conversation, as we were getting started, from the Senator from \nNevada, the assistant Democratic leader, Mr. Reid, who suggested we \ncould finish this bill today. He saw no reason why we could not. I see \nno reason why we could not finish it today.\n  I hope as we proceed we will keep that goal in mind. Let's finish \nthis bill today. I hope we can have third reading at about 6 o'clock. I \ndo not see any reason why we cannot.\n  There are some Senators who want to offer amendments. We want to hear \nthem. We want to consider them and consider them fully and fairly, but \nit should not take an unnecessarily long amount of time to do that. So \nI encourage the Senate to act with dispatch, deliberation, but all \ndeliberate speed. That is a Supreme Court phrase that has been used \nfrom time to time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I respectfully disagree with my \ndistinguished chairman and also the ranking member on the amendment \nthey have proposed. This amendment is worded in such a way as to \nprevent the proposal from ever taking effect because they know it will \nbe impossible, certainly so difficult as to be unworkable, to prove \nprospectively that all savings will be passed on to the patients. There \nis no way that can happen. This is just in there to clean this bill up. \nI strongly oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the legislation offered \nby the Senator from Vermont. But before I speak on that let me just \nmention to the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from Wisconsin \nwho have brought this bill to the floor, I am a member of their \nsubcommittee on appropriations. I certainly respect the work they have \ndone. They do an outstanding job, they and their staffs, putting \ntogether the Agriculture appropriations bill. It is not an easy bill to \nconstruct and to bring to the floor.\n  One amendment that I will offer at a later time will deal with the \ndisaster now facing farmers who have flooded lands and especially those \nfarmers whose crops are burning up day after day in the deep South.\n  Last Friday morning, as we were taking a series of votes, I talked \nwith Senator Coverdell. He and I were prepared to offer an amendment to \nassist farmers dealing with flooded lands in my part of the country and \ndrought-stricken lands in Georgia. Georgia is the hardest hit State \nwith drought\n\n[[Page S7196]]\n\nproblems, and family farmers there are suffering substantially. Senator \nCoverdell intended to join me in offering an amendment offering them \nsome emergency assistance. I will want to address this issue on this \nlegislation. I will certainly talk with the chairman and the ranking \nmember to do so in a way that relates to the needs of the Senate, but \nespecially in a way that meets the needs of those family farmers who, \nthrough no fault of theirs but through natural disasters, have seen \ntheir crops disappear and are suffering some very significant problems.\n  I will save further discussion of this problem for a later time in \nthis debate.\n  With regard to the amendment offered by the Senator from Vermont, I \nstrongly support this amendment. Several bills have been introduced in \nCongress on this subject. I introduced a piece of similar legislation \nalong with Senator Wellstone and Senator Snowe. I am also pleased to \njoin as a cosponsor of the legislation authored by the Senator from \nVermont.\n  All of these bills relate to the same issue. That issue is very \nimportant and one we should address. The reason it is being addressed \nhere and now is that the House of Representatives has already addressed \nit on its Agriculture appropriations bill, and it is important that the \nSenate also weigh in on this issue. The Senator from Vermont certainly \nhas a right, and is protected with respect to germaneness, to offer \nthis amendment to this bill.\n  Let me describe the issue before us in terms that people can better \nunderstand, using a couple of different medicines as examples.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to use these medicine \nbottles in my presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have here bottles of 3 different prescription drugs \nthat are ranked among the top 20 in the United States in the number of \nprescriptions filled and sales volume. All of these drugs, \nincidentally, are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n  I have here the actual bottles for these medicines. This one happens \nto be Zoloft, which is used to treat depression. The company that \nproduces these pills and puts them in different size bottles then sells \nthem all around the world. It is exactly the same medicine produced by \nthe same company, sold in different places. Buy it, for example, in \nEmerson, Canada, and you will pay $1.28 for a pill. Buy it 5 miles \nsouth of there in Pembina, ND, and you will not pay $1.28 for the same \npill. Instead you will pay $2.34. It is the same pill in the same \nbottle, made by the same company in the same manufacturing plant. The \nonly thing different is the price. The pill costs $1.28 in Canada, and \n$2.34 for an American consumer.\n  Or what about Zocor? Zocor is a very popular prescription drug. Pick \nup any Newsweek or Time magazine and see the multipage ads for this \ndrug. I have here two bottles of Zocor made by the same company, with \nthe identical manufacturing process. One bottle is sent to Canada where \nit costs $1.82 per tablet; the other is sent to a U.S. consumer who is \ncharged $3.82: $1.82 for someone living in Winnipeg, $3.82 for someone \nliving in Montpelier.\n  Norvasc is a prescription drug that is used to lower blood pressure. \nThe bottles are almost identical--again, both bottles are by the same \nmanufacturer, and contain the same pill. Norvasc costs the Canadian \nconsumer 90 cents. It costs the U.S. consumer $1.25 per pill.\n\n  Or to look at this price disparity another way, the cost of a 1-month \nsupply of Zocor--the same pill, by the same company, in the same \nbottle--is $54 when it is sent to a Canadian. When it is sent to an \nAmerican, it costs $114.\n  Or Zoloft--again the same pill, by the same company, made in the same \nmanufacturing plant--costs the Canadian $38 for a 1-month supply; the \nAmerican pays $70.\n  Norvasc costs Canadians $27 for a one month supply and the same \nquantity costs Americans $37. I can show you medicine where the price \ninequity is 10 to 1.\n  The question our constituents in the States of Vermont, North Dakota, \nMinnesota, and Washington ask is: How can this be justified? This is \nthe same product. If this is a global economy, why must I go to Canada \nto try to buy a prescription drug that was manufactured in the United \nStates in the first place in order to buy it for half the price? That \nis what Americans all across this country are asking.\n  The companies that produce these medicines are able to access all of \nthe ingredients they need to produce prescription drugs from all around \nthe world in order to get the lowest prices. If the pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers are able to benefit from the global economy, why then can \nthe consumer not also access that same drug made in a plant approved by \nthe FDA when it is being sold in Winnipeg for half the price?\n  What is the answer to that? Many of us believe American consumers \nshould be able to also benefit from the global economy. My colleague \nfrom the State of Washington, Mr. Gorton, has sponsored his own \nlegislation to address this issue and he is also a cosponsor of this \namendment. All of us have to respond to our constituents.\n  This is not just a Canada-United States issue. Americans pay higher \nprices than anywhere else in the world. How much more do we pay? If \nAmericans pay an average of $1 for a pharmaceutical product, that same \nproduct has a much lower average cost in every other industrialized \nnation. We pay $1; the Canadians pay 64 cents. We pay $1; the English \npay 65 cents. We pay $1; the Swedes pay 68 cents. We pay $1; the \nItalians pay 51 cents. We are charged the highest prices for \nprescription drugs of any country in the world. The American people ask \nthe question: Why?\n  Senior citizens are 12 percent of our population, but they consume \none-third of the prescription drugs in America. I come from a State \nwith a lot of senior citizens. They have reached the years of their \nlives where, in most cases, they are no longer working and are living \non a fixed income. Last year, they saw, as all Americans did, \nprescription drug spending in this country go up 16 percent in 1 year. \nPart of that is price inflation, part is driven by increased \nutilization. Nonetheless, older Americans saw a 16-percent increase in \nprescription drug spending in this country in 1 year.\n  Those of us who have held hearings on this issue and who have heard \nfrom senior citizens know what they say. They tell us they are forced \nto go to the back of the grocery store first, where the pharmacy is, to \nbuy their prescription medicines because only then will they know how \nmuch money they have left to pay for food. Only then will they know \nwhether they are going to get to eat after they have purchased their \nprescription drugs.\n  This is an issue for all Americans, not just senior citizens, but it \nis an especially acute problem for senior citizens.\n  In January on one cold, snowy day, I traveled with a group of North \nDakota senior citizens to Emerson, Canada.\n  First we visited the doctor's office--because it is required in \nCanada--where the North Dakotans who wanted to buy prescription drugs \nin the Canadian pharmacy showed the doctor their prescription from a \nU.S. doctor, and the Canadian doctor wrote a prescription for them. \nThen we went to a very small, one-room pharmacy just off the main \nstreet of Emerson, Canada, a tiny little town of not more than 300 or \n400 people. Emerson is 5 miles north of the North Dakota border.\n  I stood in that pharmacy and I watched the North Dakota senior \ncitizens purchase their prescription drugs, and I saw how much money \nthey were saving on the prescription drugs they were buying.\n  As is often the case, senior citizens will take 2, 3, 4, or 8 \ndifferent prescription drugs. It is not at all unusual to see that.\n  I watched these North Dakotans compare what they were paying in the \nUnited States to what they were paying at this little one-room pharmacy \nin Emerson, Canada. It was staggering.\n  They asked me the question: Why do we have to come to Canada to do \nthis? Why can't our pharmacists come up here and access this same \nsupply of drugs and pass the savings along to us?\n  The answer is that there is a Federal law in this country that says \nthat only the manufacturer can import prescription drugs into the \nUnited States.\n  The amendment we are considering, offered by the Senator from \nVermont,\n\n[[Page S7197]]\n\nproposes to change that. He does not propose to do so in any way that \nwould jeopardize the safety of medicines that are available in this \ncountry. He does not propose to in any way suggest that we should not \nmaintain the chain of custody needed to assure a safe supply of \nprescription drugs.\n  But he does propose that we amend that law and replace it with a \nsystem that assures the safety of the medicine supply, while allowing \npharmacists and drug wholesalers to go to Canada and go to other \ncountries and access that same prescription drug, provided that it was \nproduced in a plant that was approved by the FDA. This amendment \nassures not only the safety of the manufacturing process but also the \nchain of custody of the supply. In this way we will allow U.S. \nconsumers the full flow and benefit of the global economy.\n  Why can't American pharmacists and drug wholesalers shop globally for \nprescription drugs, provided it is the same pill, put in the same \nbottle, manufactured by the same company in a plant that is approved by \nthe FDA?\n  The answer is that they ought to be able to do that. There is no \nexcuse any longer for preventing them from doing that.\n  Zocor, Prilosec, Zoloft, Vasotec, Norvasc, Cardizem--you can go right \non down the list of the medicines most frequently used by senior \ncitizens and compare what they cost here with what they cost in Canada \nand Mexico. Then ask the question: Why? Why are we in America charged \nso much more for the identical prescription drug?\n  The answer is simple: It is because the big drug companies can do it \nhere. The pharmaceutical industry charges what the market will bear in \nthe United States. The U.S. consumers are prevented from being a global \nconsumer.\n  Let me say this about the pharmaceutical industry. I want them to do \nwell. I support them on a range of things. I want them to be \nprofitable, and I want them to be able to do substantial research. I do \nnot wish them ill. I applaud them and thank them for the research they \ndo to create lifesaving, miracle drugs. They only do part of the \nresearch, of course. A substantial part is also done through the \nNational Institutes of Health, through publicly funded research. And we \nare dramatically increasing our investment in NIH.\n  But some will say to the Senator from Vermont: What you are doing \nwill dramatically reduce research and development by the drug \ncompanies. These prices are what support research and development.\n  Hogwash. Nonsense. The fact is, a larger percentage of the research \nand development is done by the drug companies in Europe than is done in \nthe United States. Let me say that again. More research and development \nis done in Europe than in the United States. And that comes from the \npharmaceutical industry's own figures.\n\n  Take a look at the billions and billions of dollars the drug industry \nspends on promotion and compare that to what they spend on research and \ndevelopment.\n  In fact, if you pick up a weekly magazine, such as Newsweek, you will \nsee the multipage ads for prescription medicine. They are spending \nbillions of dollars on direct-to-consumer advertising. They are going \ndirectly to the consumer and saying: We want you to go to your doctor \nto demand that he or she write a prescription for this medication for \nyou.\n  That just started a few years ago. It is now rampant. Doctors will \ntell you that patients come to their offices, saying: I read about this \nmedicine in an ad in Newsweek. I want you to prescribe that. That is \nwhat is happening.\n  Billions of dollars are spent to try to induce consumers to demand \nmedicine that can only be given to them by a doctor who believes it is \nnecessary.\n  While all of this is going on, the Senator from Vermont offers a \npiece of legislation that I fully support. If I were writing the \nlegislation offered by the Senator from Vermont, I would prefer that it \nnot leave out the provision that allows personal use importation. I \nhope at some point we can allow for that.\n  But I just say this. I know that literally $60 or $70 million has \nbeen spent by the pharmaceutical industry because it is scared stiff \nthat we are going to pass this legislation.\n  In fact, in the Washington Post the pharmaceutical industry has been \nrunning a full-page ad for the last several days. I do not know what a \nfull-page ad costs in the Washington Post, but I know it is not cheap. \nHow many citizens, who support our bill, have the ability to go to the \nWashington Post and buy a full-page ad?\n  This full-page ad is just totally bogus. It says: One of these pills \nis a counterfeit. Can you guess which one? Congress is about to permit \nwholesale importation of drugs from Mexico and Canada. The personal \nhealth of American consumers is unquestionably at risk. Counterfeit \nprescription drugs will inevitably make their way across our borders \nand into our medicine cabinets. Counterfeit prescription drugs can \nkill. Counterfeit prescription drugs have killed.\n  This is from the pharmaceutical industry, which wants to scare people \ninto believing the legislation that we are now debating is somehow bad \nfor our country's consumers. That is totally bogus. We are proposing an \namendment that assures the safety of the drug supply but finally \nassures the American consumer that they can access drugs that are \npriced reasonably.\n  If someone in another country is paying half the price or a third or \na tenth of the price being charged the American consumer for the same \ndrug that is produced in a manufacturing plant approved by the FDA, why \ncan't the American consumer have access to those drugs in a global \neconomy?\n  The answer is: They ought to be able to do it.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I commend the Senator for his work and commend Senator \nJeffords for his work on this issue. In relation to the advertisement \nin the Washington Post, I wonder if the Senator from North Dakota would \nshare with us the sponsor of that advertisement as it appears on the \nad?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes. The sponsor is Pharmaceutical Research and \nManufacturers of America. The drug industry obviously wants to keep \nthings as they are.\n  Let me just make one additional point. It is not my intention to have \nthe American people go to another country for their prescription drugs. \nIt is my intention to force the pharmaceutical industry to reprice \ntheir drugs here in the United States. If our pharmacists and our drug \nwholesalers are able to access the same drugs at a much lesser price in \nCanada or England or elsewhere, and bring them back and sell them at a \nsavings to our consumers, it will force the industry to reprice their \ndrugs in this country.\n  That is my goal. It is not my goal to put people in minivans and send \nthem outside this country to access prescription drugs. I want \npressures brought through the global economy to equalize prescription \ndrug prices in this country vis-a-vis what they are being sold at in \nother countries.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, let's paint a picture, or set the stage, \nfor this debate.\n  Most of the research and development and manufacture of prescription \ndrugs goes on here in the United States, in a highly constructive \nfashion. Drug companies, and their research and development staffs, \nhere in this country experiment and work, literally for years, to \ndevelop new and effective prescription drugs.\n  They are magnificently successful in that quest. And at least one of \nthe reasons we are debating this issue today is that they are so \nsuccessful that every year the share of our health care dollar that \ngoes to prescription drugs increases because we now have conditions \nthat can be treated by prescriptions that previously required \nhospitalization, if indeed they could be treated at all.\n  The process of taking an idea through its basic and applied research, \nits testing and its development to licensing by the Food and Drug \nAdministration is long and arduous and is aimed both at safety and \neffectiveness. During that period of time, these companies spend a \ngreat deal of money with no return. It is clear, both to the proponents \nand opponents of both the first- and second-degree amendments,\n\n[[Page S7198]]\n\nthat these companies are entitled to recoup those long and large costs \nof research and development. They are not only allowed, properly, to \nrecoup the costs of those drugs that are actually brought to market, \nbut the cost of all of the dead-end streets they run into with some of \nthis research and development. To that point, there is agreement.\n  We are also dealing with a business, as any other in the United \nStates, that spends a good deal of its time and effort in developing \nnew products. Even at the early stage, there are some factors that \nfavor the pharmaceutical industry because of its importance to the \nUnited States. It, as other companies, is entitled to a research and \ndevelopment tax credit, but it, unlike most other industries, also \nbenefits hugely from research conducted by the National Institutes of \nHealth, as the primary sponsor of this amendment well knows. So \napproximately half of all of these research and development costs are \nalready underwritten by the taxpayers of the United States, either \nthrough tax credits or through our direct appropriations to the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n\n  It is at this point that the wonderful line from ``Alice in \nWonderland'' comes to mind, and the situation becomes ``curiouser and \ncuriouser.'' At the point at which these pharmaceutical products have \nbeen licensed, the actual manufacturing cost for that pill is, \ngenerally speaking, not very high. And so much of the price structure \nis to cover the research and development, the very large advertising \ncosts to which the Senator from North Dakota referred, other marketing \ncosts, the lobbying those companies do in the Congress, and a \nreasonable and, I may say, in most cases generous profit. But these \nU.S.-based, often U.S.-owned, pharmaceutical manufacturing companies \nconsistently charge their American customers--not the individual \npatient in this case but the huge regional drugstore chains as well as \nindividual pharmacies--far higher prices than they charge for the \nidentical product overseas or across our northern and southern borders.\n  One would think in a normal market that prices would be \nnondiscriminatory or, if anything, the manufacturers would be grateful \nenough for the tremendous aid and assistance they receive from the \ntaxpayers of the United States perhaps to give at least a small price \nbreak to American purchasers. But, no, as has been pointed out, they \ncharge Americans pretty close to twice as much as they charge anyone \nelse. These wholesale prices, obviously, are reflected in retail prices \nfor the drugs.\n  My experience in the State of Washington is very much similar to that \noutlined both by the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from North \nDakota. We ran a little test; we went up to Canada, priced identical \ndrugs in the State of Washington and in British Columbia, and found a \n62-percent difference. In other words, it was way less expensive to buy \nthem in Canada. So busloads of Americans go from Seattle and other \nparts of the State of Washington across the border to buy drugs and \nbring them back.\n  Why, one asks oneself, would American companies do this? Why would \nthey discriminate against Americans?\n  They say: There is a simple answer to that. The Canadian Government, \nthe Mexican Government, the Government of the United Kingdom, fix the \nprices of drugs. They want their citizens to get these pharmaceutical \nproducts less expensively than Americans do. So they, by government \nfiat, set the prices. And so we sell them, the drugs, for a lower price \nfor a simple reason: We have already manufactured and sold lots of them \nin the United States. And when you go from the ten-millionth pill to \nthe twenty-millionth pill, it doesn't cost you very much to manufacture \nthose new pills, so we can still make a profit, even though we are \nselling them at half price in other countries.\n  Gee, isn't that unfair? Yes, I guess so, but that is the way the \nworld is.\n  Now, that particular argument that price-fixing countries do much \nbetter for their consumers than a free market does in the United States \nis really a two-edged sword. It is one heck of an argument for price \nfixing in the United States. The junior Senator from Minnesota, a \ncouple weeks ago, put up a proposal that would do exactly that, fix the \nprice of drugs in the United States. This is a point at which I agree \nwith the drug companies. They say: You fix prices and you will dry up \nresearch and development. I am not sure how far down we look for the \nvalidity of that argument, given the great excess of advertising costs \nover research and development costs, but let us assume that it is \ntotally and completely valid as an argument. Then under those \ncircumstances, we shouldn't be fixing prices here in the United States. \nBut that doesn't mean we should continue to allow Americans to suffer \nthe immense discrimination that goes on consistently year after year, \nproduct after product in this country.\n\n  When I discovered the extent of this problem, basically out of a \ncover story in Time magazine--I believe it was last November--it seemed \nto me, as a former State attorney general who for an extended period of \ntime was in charge of consumer protection, fine, you just tell them by \nlaw to stop discriminating. Don't charge Americans any more than you \nare willing to charge Canadians or Italians or citizens of the United \nKingdom.\n  That is price fixing, the companies say. That is a terrible thing.\n  Well, it is not price fixing to say you don't discriminate. If you \ncan't make a profit at a given price, you don't have to sell the drug \nin Canada or in any other place.\n  But they have a lot of money to spend trying to sell that bill of \ngoods to people. So we discovered--again, I think this was as a result \nof my history as a State attorney general--that we have a statute in \nthe United States that prevents price discrimination. It is called the \nRobinson-Patman Act. It was passed in 1936. It was a sweeping \nantidiscrimination bill. It prevents price discrimination in the sale \nof any commodity in interstate commerce, with certain exceptions for \nactual cost savings from quantity sales and the like. So we said, fine, \nand the bill we introduced just said interstate and foreign commerce, \nwith respect to prescription drugs.\n  It is interesting; the drug companies paid no attention to that \ndistinction at all, and they still use these millions of dollars to say \nit is price fixing. Well, if so, then we have fixed the price of every \ncommodity in the United States for 64 years, which I think surprises \nmost people who believe in and have benefited from the truly free \neconomy in the United States.\n  The argument that this is price fixing is fraudulent--purely and \ntotally fraudulent. But I am not wedded or married to one solution to \nthis problem of excessive prices imposed on American consumers for \ntheir prescription drugs because while we ban importation by law--by \ncustom at least--we have permitted for an extended period of time \nAmerican citizens to cross our borders--northern or southern or, for \nthat matter, across the ocean to Europe--and to return to the United \nStates with a 3-month supply of any prescription drug they are using, \nwithout being bothered by any of the governmental agencies of the \nUnited States. Both of my other Senate colleagues in this regard have \npointed out that that happens in their State, and I have already \npointed out that it happens in mine.\n  So the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from North Dakota came up \nwith the idea that if an individual can do it for himself or herself, \nwhy not let our pharmacists do it and bring these prescription drugs \nback to the United States, which are often manufactured in the United \nStates and then shipped north or south of the border--bring them back \nand offer them for sale, presumably at a lower price.\n\n  I am sure the Senator from Vermont doesn't mind my saying, in a \nsense, this solution is truly bizarre--that somehow or another it \nshould be less expensive for a pharmacist to buy from a middleman than \nit should be from a manufacturer in the first place, and then have to \nship the product across a national border twice in order to get the \nlower price. But the bizarre nature of the proposal is a simple and \ndirect result of the outrageous discrimination that is practiced in the \nfirst place, and nothing else.\n  So the Senator from Vermont has written a bill and proposed an \namendment to allow the retail seller, or the wholesaler, to engage in \nthis reimportation. But concerned as he and the FDA are about making \nsure you\n\n[[Page S7199]]\n\nget the real thing, most of the words in his amendment have to do with \nthe safety of the product, of making certain you are getting what it is \nthat you thought you purchased. In fact, it doesn't allow this \nreimportation unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services \npromulgates regulations permitting that reimportation that meet \nnecessary safeguards.\n  OK, that is where we are at this point. And then, instead of simply \nopposing the proposal, my good friend from Mississippi puts up a \nsecond-degree amendment that says the Secretary has to certify to \nCongress that it would pose no risk to public health and safety and \nwill result in a significant reduction in the cost. It is either \nabsolutely unnecessary, because we are talking about something the \nSecretary has already done, and the price part of it is unnecessary \nbecause if there isn't a significant savings in the price, nobody is \ngoing to go up and buy them in the first place or it is an attempt--and \nI regret to say this--to kill the amendment of the Senator from Vermont \nin its entirety and see to it that it doesn't happen. The drug \ncompanies and their sponsors are not really wanting to justify the \nsituation that exists in the United States today because it can't be \njustified, so they use an argument for safety that is already far more \nadequately covered by the amendment proposed by the Senator from \nVermont in any event.\n  Now we are able to deal with this issue as part of this \nappropriations bill, of course, because the House of Representatives \ndid. So it is properly before us. But the other matter that I find \nextraordinarily odd with respect to the second-degree amendment is just \nthis: The distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, the manager of \nthe bill, knows perfectly well that individuals can go across our \nborders and come back with a 3-month supply of prescription drugs. If \nhe and the Senator from Wisconsin are so concerned about safety that \nthey have to pile on with a second-degree amendment, why aren't they \nbanning totally and completely personal reimportation? The Senator from \nVermont isn't even touching that subject in his amendment. I wish he \ndid. The House of Representatives did. He is setting up a way for \nreimportation to take place at the wholesale level, where safety is far \nmore protected than it is with respect to these individual purchases.\n  But the individual purchases have not created a great problem. If \nthey had, people would stop engaging in those policies. Whatever else \nwe may say about Canadians, they are not in the business of poisoning \ntheir own citizens.\n  This reimportation can take place with perfect safety under the \namendment as proposed by the Senator from Vermont, and anything added \nto it is simply an attempt to kill it and to maintain the status quo.\n\n  Let me go back to the stage I have set and simply say this: The \nstatus quo is American manufacturers using American taxpayers' money to \nproduce products in the United States of America, which they then sell \nat prices that discriminate outrageously against American purchasers. \nThat is really all there is on the stage today--discrimination by \nAmerican companies against American purchasers, in spite of the support \nof American taxpayers.\n  The first-degree amendment takes at least a modest step toward curing \nthat situation. The second-degree amendment is designed to keep it in \nplace forever.\n  I have one final point, Mr. President. I agree with each of the \nSenators who have previously spoken on the desirability and the \nimportance of a Medicare drug benefit. There is some debate over to \nwhom it should apply, how much it should cost. But Medicare covers \nabout 40 million Americans. We have 250 million Americans altogether. \nNone of the rest of them will be helped at all by even the most \ngenerous Medicare drug benefit. All of them will be helped by this \namendment, to the extent that it is actually effective, because it will \nin fact end up lowering the price of prescription drugs in the United \nStates of America. That is why the first-degree amendment should be \nadopted and the second-degree amendment that attempts to gut it should \nbe rejected.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce to the Senate \nthat we have been able to secure an agreement on a unanimous consent \nrequest to limit debate on the pending Cochran amendment and the \nunderlying Jeffords amendment. I understand it has been cleared.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to vote in relation \nto the pending Cochran amendment, No. 3927, at 5 o'clock p.m., and the \ntime between now and then be equally divided in the usual form. I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that following that vote, the Senate \nproceed to vote immediately in relation to amendment No. 3925, as \namended, if amended, the Jeffords amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chair. I remind Senators that this doesn't \nmean we have to use all the time between now and 5. I encourage Members \nto make brief statements. We can vote before 5 and then move on to \nanother subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nGregg be added as cosponsor to amendment No. 3925.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Vermont be good \nenough to yield 12 minutes?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 12 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 12 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this amendment and I commend \nthe sponsors for their efforts to address the high cost of prescription \ndrugs.\n  I support this amendment, and I commend its sponsors for their \nefforts to address the high cost of prescription drugs. The American \npublic wants affordable medicines, and I believe we should do all we \ncan to reduce the financial burden imposed on our citizens by high drug \ncosts.\n  It is worth emphasizing that imports of prescription drugs from other \ncountries must be accompanied by strict precautions to protect the \npublic. Federal standards require that all prescriptions sold in the \nUnited States must be safe and effective. The public health protections \nguaranteed by the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act do not end at the gates \nof the manufacturer's plant but extend all the way to the doorstep of \nthe consumer. Congress has promised the American people that the \nmedications they use will be effective and be free of contaminants.\n  In 1988, President Reagan signed into law the Prescription Drug \nMarketing Act to protect Americans from counterfeit, contaminated, and \nother unsafe medications. Today counterfeit drugs continue to plague \nthe citizens of many countries, including our own. In 2000, at least 30 \npeople in Cambodia died from fake malaria medications. 60,000 people in \nNiger were vaccinated against a deadly epidemic of meningitis with \ncounterfeit vaccines, and received water injections instead of real \nmedicines. This past year the United Kingdom broke up a smuggling ring \nto import counterfeit drugs into the U.K. from India. According to a \nDEA official, 25% of the prescription drugs brought by consumers into \nthe U.S. from Mexico are fake. From 1989 to 1994 a counterfeit \nantibiotic from China was sold in the U.S. through legal distribution \nchannels resulting in almost 2,000 adverse events, including 49 deaths. \nIn spite of an Import Alert issued by the FDA in September 1999, the \nfake medication may still be entering the U.S.\n  I raise these problems to emphasize that without adequate \nprotections, legalizing importation by pharmacists and wholesalers will \nincrease the risks already posed by fake and contaminated drugs. This \namendment deals with these safety concerns primarily by placing the \nresponsibility for assuring the quality of imported products on the \nimporter, subject to FDA oversight--and it gives FDA broad authority to \nimpose additional requirements necessary to protect public health.\n  The FDA needs adequate tools to combat counterfeit or adulterated \ndrugs. Adequate funding for the FDA is essential to ensure the safety \nof imported prescription drugs. FDA currently inspects less than 1% of \nall drug shipments from other countries. Clearly, additional resources \nwill be necessary to implement this amendment.\n\n[[Page S7200]]\n\n  As we all know, the real issue is providing an effective and \naffordable prescription drug benefit to senior citizens and the \ndisabled under Medicare.\n  That is the basic and fundamental issue. We wouldn't be having this \ndebate if we were providing an effective prescription drug program to \nthe seniors under the Medicare program. It wouldn't be necessary. We \nwouldn't have to be taking these additional risks. This is not a \nsubstitute for the Senate taking action on that important measure.\n  The President has reiterated the fact that he would be glad in \nworking with our Republican friends to sign their marriage penalty \nlegislation if it included a prescription drug program. It is \nabsolutely essential. This legislation is no substitute for it.\n  The cost of the drugs these patients needed far exceeded their \nability to pay, even if the cost was deeply discounted. A patient with \nhigh blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, and an enlarged prostate \nwould pay $3,100 annually for drugs.\n  This particular chart indicates the general patient profile for some \nof the most common kinds of concerns, particularly for the elderly. \nThey are the ones who have the highest utilization of the prescription \ndrugs. They are the ones who need the protections under Medicare. They \nare the ones who, hopefully, we are going to take action on in this \nCongress to protect.\n  We are talking about osteoporosis, or heart trouble with a typical \ncost of $2,412--that is 20 percent of the pretax income; high blood \npressure, irregular heartbeat, enlarged prostate, $3,100, 26 percent of \npretax income; severe arthritis, ulcers, gastric reflux, depression, \n$3,696, 31 percent; ulcers, high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma, \n$4,800, 40 percent.\n  This basically shows not only the access but the enormous costs of \nthe prescription drugs to address these particular items.\n  A patient with heart disease and severe anemia, $26,500, and 22 \npercent.\n  If we look at this chart, most senior citizens have very moderate \nincomes. Look at this. Fifty-seven percent are under $15,000; 21 \npercent are under $24,000. We have virtually 80 percent below $24,000.\n  We are talking about a handful of senior citizens in the upper areas. \nEighty percent of our seniors are people of extremely modest means. The \ncost of these drugs are going absolutely out of sight.\n  That is why we have to have a program that is going to provide \ncoverage, and that is going to be universally affordable for our \nseniors and for the Federal Government as well.\n  This is a drug crisis for our seniors. The coverage is  going down, \nand the costs are going up.\n\n  I will take just a moment of the Senate's time to point out what is \nhappening to our senior citizens.\n  Twelve million--effectively a third--of our seniors have no coverage \nwhatsoever. Eleven million of them have employer-sponsored coverage. We \nare going to show a chart in just a moment that shows employer-\nsponsored drug coverage is collapsing.\n  Some three million have Medicare-HMO, and we will find what is \nhappening in the HMOs where they are putting limitations of what they \nare going to be prepared to reimburse under prescription drugs.\n  The next is Medigap costs which are going right up through the \nceiling and becoming less and less affordable.\n  The only group of Americans who have dependable, reliable, affordable \nprescription drugs are the 4 million Americans under Medicaid.\n  It is a national disgrace when we know the commitment that was made \nhere in the Congress in 1964 and in 1956 that said to our senior \ncitizens, work hard, we will pass Medicare, and you will not have to \nworry about your health care needs in your golden years. We didn't \ninclude a prescription drug program because the private sector didn't \nhave it then. Only 3 cents out of every dollar was expended on \nprescription drugs. Now it is up 20 cents, and in some places even 30 \ncents, in terms of the costs of the health care dollars. Health \nbenefits have dropped by 25 percent. That is between 1994 and 1997. \nThis arrow is continuing to go right down.\n  The other chart showed where you have 11 million seniors getting \ncovered by employer-based programs. This chart indicates that they are \nrapidly losing coverage at the present time.\n  We have 11 million who do not have any coverage, and 12 million who \nhave employer-sponsored coverage. But that is going down.\n  This shows what is happening if they get Medicare HMO drug coverage. \nWe see 75 percent will limit coverage to less than $1,000. They are \nputting limitations on what they will pay for. The chart shows the five \nmajor illnesses affecting and impacting our senior citizens cost vastly \nhigher than $1,000. Therefore, our seniors, even if they have coverage \nunder an HMO, are still paying an unaffordable amount of money if \n$1,000 is the limitation. Mr. President, 32 percent have imposed caps \nof less than $500. We are seeing the collapse of coverage that is out \nthere for our senior citizens.\n  This chart shows what is happening in the medigap coverage--which is \neffectively becoming unaffordable--in the sample premium for a 75-year-\nold person in various States. This is virtually unaffordable.\n  This chart shows the costs of drugs compared to the Consumer Price \nIndex over recent years, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999. In 1995, 2.5 \npercent; in 1996, 3.3 percent; in 1997, 1.7 percent; in 1999, 2.7.\n  The top of the chart shows the actual drug costs in terms of the \nexpenditures being made by seniors to get the drugs they need. We see a \nvery modest increase in the Consumer Price Index. Yet for senior \ncitizens who use three times the amount of drugs as the rest of the \npopulation, we find out this is continuing to increase, placing \nextraordinary pressure on seniors. In many instances, they are \ncompletely unaffordable.\n  As mentioned earlier in the debate, the Pharmaceutical Research \nManufacturers say:\n\n       Private drug insurance lowers the prices 30 percent to 39 \n     percent.\n\n  That says it all. It is saying you could go ahead and have a \nreduction in the costs of these prescription drugs anywhere from 30 \npercent to 39 percent, and they can still make an adequate and generous \nprofit. This is from the industry itself. The seniors are hearing this \nand living it, as pointed out by the Senator from North Dakota and my \nfriend, the Senator from Vermont. They are seeing this. They know this \nhas happened. They have to go abroad in order to try to get these vital \nprescription drugs.\n  The unanswered question is, If we can go across and buy them, why \ncan't we do this in a way that is going to be more accessible and \navailable not only to those able to go over but also to our friends and \nneighbors and fellow senior citizens?\n  It is out of that enormous frustration and these facts that this \namendment comes to the floor. That is why I believe it should be \nsupported. I think it is essential, but it is not going to address the \nfundamental issue, which is the Medicare program that will cover all of \nour senior citizens and effectively do it in a way that will see a \nsignificant reduction of costs.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for \nyielding.\n  I was thinking about the argument that we had on the Senate floor \nabout importing medical supplies in terms of prescription drugs from \nforeign countries into the United States because they might be cheaper. \nI could get open-heart surgery in Mexico for a lot cheaper than at \nOschners in New Orleans or at the Mayo Clinic or at Johns Hopkins or \nany other fine institution in the United States. It would be half as \nexpensive. I doubt many Americans want to put their lives in the hands \nof people they know are not regulated.\n  I could buy many items in countries around the world, and many Third \nWorld countries, which would be a lot cheaper. I remember one time \ngoing to Hong Kong. I saw some of the Lacoste shirts with the little \nalligator. My wife and I were shopping in Hong Kong and they had all \nthese Lacoste shirts. They were $5. I said: That is incredible, a heck \nof a deal. I will buy a Lacoste alligator shirt for everyone I know for \ngifts for Christmas. We bought one\n\n[[Page S7201]]\n\nafter another. I bought one or two myself. We came home and the first \ntime I washed the shirt, the alligator fell off. The alligator fell off \nbecause it was a counterfeit shirt. The shirt nearly dissolved after \nthe first washing and the alligator drowned in the washer. The product \nwas totally worthless. It was a counterfeit product.\n  It is one thing when you are buying a knit shirt. When someone is \nsending me drugs that have been either manufactured in a foreign \ncountry or even manufactured here and sent to a Third World country and \nstored in a warehouse, God knows where, under conditions that may be \ntotally contrary to the safety of that drug, who knows who deals with \nthose products in that country in the privacy of that warehouse. Who \nknows how many times somebody might go into that warehouse and take the \nproduct, and instead of saying we will have 100 pills, if I cut it in \nhalf, I could have 200 pills. If I could cut it into fourths and end up \nnot with 100 pills but 400 pills, look how much money I can make if I \ndo it that way.\n  If I can take that type of quality control, which is nonexistent in a \nforeign country, and say that is how I will make my money, what kind of \nproducts will we be giving to the American consumer? This is not a \nLacoste shirt that an alligator might fall off of. This is medicine \nthat is important to the safety and the life of our constituents.\n  Why do we have a ban on the importation of foreign drugs passed by \nCongress in 1987? In order to protect U.S. consumers, to make sure that \nthe drugs were not improperly stored, or improperly handled, or \nimproperly shipped, or perhaps made to be like my Lacoste shirt, \ntotally, absolutely counterfeit.\n  How many Federal bureaucrats are we going to put in 150 countries \naround the world to ensure those products in those countries are safely \nstored, safely handled, and not diluted? And how many more \nbureaucracies are we going to create to make sure those problems don't \ndevelop?\n  We can get a lot of things cheaper in a lot of other countries. How \nabout buying cheaper wheat from China? They have a controlled economy \nwhere the Government runs everything and sets the prices. Could we not \nbuy a lot of wheat from China and give it to our constituents a lot \ncheaper? We don't do that because it is not a level playing field. In \nthat sense, we are competing with a micromanaged economy overseas that \nthe Government participates in and helps their farmers. Our people \ncan't compete against that. It is not a good idea.\n  This is the bottom line--actually two things. No. 1, there is no \nguarantee we are not going to create a boondoggle with this for all the \nwholesalers. There is no guarantee, without the Cochran amendment, that \nanybody who is a consumer is going to have any of the benefit of any of \nwhat we are trying to do by importing cheap Third World drugs into this \ncountry. Nobody has a guarantee the savings would be passed on to the \nconsumer. I can see a wholesaler who wants to get the drug for $20 \nselling it for $40 over here and making one heck of a profit. There is \nno guarantee without the Cochran amendment.\n  The final point is that this is not the answer to the problem. The \nanswer to the problem is to find a way to guarantee to Medicare \nbeneficiaries that they get the best deal, that we have some ability to \nprovide them with the coverage they need at the price they can afford. \nThat is the real answer.\n  People say we do not want price controls in this country; that is \nanti-American. But we are going to buy the price controls from other \ncountries around the world. We will let them impose price controls, and \nthen we will buy from them. Why don't we just put on price controls in \nthis country and call it what it is? We are saying essentially we don't \nlike price controls but we like other countries' price controls and so \nwe will buy it from them with absolutely no ability to guarantee the \nproduct coming over here is the product that left this country.\n  Here is the problem. If a Medicare beneficiary walks into the \ndrugstore and has no insurance because Medicare doesn't cover him, the \npharmacist tells him: It is $100 for your prescription. That Medicare \nbeneficiary has to take it out of his pocket or gets his children to \npay for it, or, if they are very destitute and poor, Medicare pays for \nit and they pay $100. If you don't have any coverage, you pay $100 for \nthe prescription.\n  If, however, you work for the Federal Government, if you are a \nSenator or one of the staff people here who happens to have the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Plan, and you go into the drugstore and buy \nthe same prescription, you don't pay $100, No. 1, because there is \nvolume purchasing because they are purchasing for all the FEHBP people \nwho are covered by FEHBP. The discount by volume purchasers for the \ninsurers gets it down to about $70, a 25-plus-percent discount. That is \nthe average by volume purchasing. But none of us or our staff even pays \nthe $70. We will probably pay a coinsurance of about $35, for some \nplans even a copayment which could be $15 or $20.\n  So that is the answer to the problem. The answer is not to import \nThird World countries' price controls. Talking about Canada is one \nthing. I guarantee if this passes, we are not going to be importing a \nlot from Canada. We are going to be buying from countries whose \nhandling of these drugs we have no ability to control. If it were \ncoming from Canada, it would not be a bad deal. We know how they \noperate. But this amendment is not limited to Canada. Any Third World \ncountry will be able to handle the drugs, dilute them, do anything they \nwant, store them where they want, and we will not be able to guarantee \nthe validity of that drug.\n  This is the answer to the problem: Not importing from other \ncountries, but to try to ensure that all Medicare beneficiaries have \nsome type of coverage that allows them to get the benefits of volume \npurchasing and also to have some type of insurance where the Federal \nGovernment assumes part of the responsibility, part of the risk, and \nthe providers compete and also assume some of the risk to get the price \nto the Medicare beneficiary down to half or less. That is what we \nshould be working on.\n  This is a Band-Aid type approach. Really, it is worse than a Band-Aid \napproach because Band-Aids help; this doesn't help. It puts the \nAmerican consumer at risk. We passed this law to prevent all the things \nthat are likely to happen if this amendment passes. We should not go \nback to our constituents and say: We are letting you get cheap drugs \nfrom foreign countries because they have price controls. It is the \nwrong approach, and we should recognize it as such.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the underlying \namendment to allow reimportation of prescription drugs. I have been \nfollowing the debate for the last couple of hours. I want to bring up a \nnew issue, an issue which I believe is a fundamental issue but which \nhas not been discussed, to the best of my knowledge, at all over the \nlast 2 hours--and that is safety.\n  The problem has been very clearly identified; and that is, cost. The \nsituation of prescription drugs costing too much in this country, \ncausing people to drive to Mexico and Canada, is a real problem. It has \nbeen vividly described. It has been described accurately by almost \neverybody who has talked today, holding up the bottles and the \ndescriptions on the charts. Today a senior who goes into a drugstore \nmust pay full retail price for a drug because Medicare does not include \nprescription drug coverage, versus traveling on a bus to Canada, and \nbuying it there for much less.\n  The answer--and this is absolutely critical--is not reimportation. \nThe answer is not, to my mind, price controls. Price controls get \ncloaked in all sorts of ways in policy and in various proposals. But \nthe answer is, I believe, not in the amendment we are talking about \ntoday but through improved access by offering coverage and utilizing \nthe large purchasing power to provide affordable prescription drugs.\n  The issue that most bothers me is that fundamentally I believe the \nunderlying amendment puts at risk the safety of these drugs. I say \n``puts at risk'' because clearly the authors of this bill\n\n[[Page S7202]]\n\nhave tried to construct a bill that has safety first and foremost. But \nlet me just say, having read the bill and having a pretty good \nunderstanding of the capability of the Food and Drug Administration \ntoday, they simply cannot police the world in making absolutely sure \nthese are not counterfeit drugs coming back in and because of this, I \nfind it very hard to support the underlying bill.\n  If you take a look at the history of reimportation, from 1985 to 1987 \nin the U.S. Congress, there were a series of nine hearings and three \ninvestigative reports regarding this whole concept of reimportation of \npharmaceuticals. It is interesting, if you go back and look at what \nhappened and also at what the findings were. As a result of these \nhearings and investigations, in 1987 the Prescription Drug Marketing \nAct passed. It was designed to specifically protect Americans' health \nand safety against the risk of adulterated or counterfeit drugs from \nbeing imported into the U.S. Let me quote one of the conclusions from \nthe committee report:\n\n       Reimported pharmaceuticals threaten the American public \n     health in two ways. First, foreign counterfeits, falsely \n     described as reimported U.S.-produced drugs, have entered the \n     distribution system.\n       Second, proper storage and handling of legitimate \n     pharmaceuticals cannot be guaranteed by U.S. law once the \n     drugs have left the boundaries of the United States.\n\n  I believe, we are obligated to go back and address these two critical \nconcerns, because we are talking about the potential for counterfeit or \nadulterated drugs. We are talking about life-or-death issues. We are \ntalking about the ability to thin one's blood to prevent a heart attack \nor a stroke, and if that drug has been altered, if it is counterfeit, \nit means life or death to the people who are listening to me today.\n  What they have tried to fashion in this bill is to have the Food and \nDrug Administration oversee and be responsible for these laboratories \nwhich are not in the United States of America. Remember, this is a Food \nand Drug Administration that, right now, admits they are unable to even \ninspect the food coming into this country. I argue, whether it is \ntomatoes or lettuce coming in, the inspection of drugs coming in is \nmuch more important to the health of Americans. It is partly because I \nam a physician, so I deal with patients and I know for the most part \npatients believe it is much more important as well.\n\n  Is the Food and Drug Administration equipped? If you ask the people \nwho have run the FDA you will find the following. Dr. David Kessler, \nformer head of the Food and Drug Administration, in a letter to \nRepresentative Dingell this past year, stated the following when we \ntalk about reimportation. I quote Dr. David Kessler:\n\n       In my view, the dangers of allowing re-importation of \n     prescription drugs may be even greater today than they were \n     in 1986. For example, with the rise of Internet pharmacies, \n     the opportunities of illicit distribution of adulterated and \n     counterfeit products have grown well beyond those available \n     in prior years. Repealing the prohibition on re-importation \n     of drugs would remove one of the principal statutory tools \n     for dealing with this growing issue.\n\n  We know the cost of prescription drugs is a problem. But ultimately \nyou don't want to do anything that jeopardizes the safety of these \ndrugs and ultimately the health and welfare of patients.\n  Let's turn to Dr. Jane Henney, who is the current Commissioner of the \nFood and Drug Administration. In front of the Senate appropriations \ncommittee March 7 of this year, she said, in expressing severe \nreservations regarding the importation of drugs:\n\n       The trackability of a drug is more than in question. Where \n     did the bulk product come from? How is it manufactured? \n     You're just putting yourself at increased risk when you don't \n     know all of these things.\n  Her words--``increased risk.''\n  It is the risk of this legislation that bothers me in terms of safety \nfor our seniors. The question is whether the FDA is equipped to \nimplement the safety precautions necessary? Right now we are hearing \nfrom the leaders they cannot be responsible for the safety and efficacy \nof reimported pharmaceuticals. Let me point out what is going on today \nin terms of how effective their inspections are.\n  Of the 6,030 foreign manufacturers shipping bulk drugs to the United \nStates since 1988, approximately 4,600 were never inspected. When we \nsee people holding up these two bottles and one bottle was reimported \nfrom overseas and you are depending on the FDA--which clearly does not \nhave the capability to guarantee the safety of these pills--and then \nyou put that pill in your mouth, I believe, based on at least the \nleaders at the Food and Drug Administration today and in the past, that \npill could very well be unsafe and not only cause severe illness, but \neven death.\n  I mentioned the food issue, but as you recall, the Food and Drug \nAdministration is responsible for overseeing the safety of food in this \ncountry. In our hearing at the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee last month, some said: We can safely import lettuce from \nother countries, so why can't we do the same for medicines?\n  The analogy of lettuce versus medicine is, as a physician, very hard \nfor me. Last year, I joined Senator Collins in introducing the Imported \nFood Safety Improvement Act because of all of the outbreaks of illness \nassociated with imported food products.\n  We introduced the food safety bill predominantly because of the FDA's \nown admission--just like I believe the FDA is admitting today in terms \nof reimportation of drugs--that they cannot insure the complete safety \nof food coming into this country. If we cannot insure the safety of \nfood coming into this country, as a physician, as someone who has that \ndoctor-patient relationship, who has taken an oath of doing no harm--I \ncannot promise my patients that the prescription medicines they may be \ntaking are guaranteed to be safe and effective, especially when I have \nthe leadership of the FDA telling me they are ill-equipped and cannot \nguarantee the drugs have not been altered.\n  Again, the authors of this legislation basically said it is going to \nbe safe because the FDA can do it. I will take it one step forward and \nsay based on current evidence, I do not believe the FDA can do it.\n  Former Carter FDA Commissioner Dr. Jere Goyan said it best:\n\n       I respect the motivation of the members of Congress who \n     support this legislation. They are reading, as am I, stories \n     about the high prescription drug prices and people which are \n     unable to pay for the drugs they need. But the solution to \n     this problem lies in better insurance coverage for people who \n     need prescription drugs, not in threatening the quality of \n     medicines for us all.\n\n  The underlying amendment, although well-intended, is inadequate in \nassuring the safety of potential recipients, beneficiaries, and \npatients who receive pharmaceuticals that have been reimported. \nTherefore, I will not vote to repeal the important consumer safety \nlegislation that we put in place over 10 years ago without much further \ninvestigation to answer that critical question of safety.\n  Medicines today are affordable when there is coverage for them. I \nbelieve we have to do something to help those unfortunate seniors \nacross the country who do not have good prescription drug coverage \ntoday.\n  Senator Breaux and I have worked aggressively to develop a bipartisan \nprescription drug coverage plan and have introduced such a plan.\n  This plan is above politics and it is above partisanship. It is time \nto take the very best minds, the very best doctors, the very best \nhealth care experts, and elected representatives and bring them \ntogether to deal with these challenges facing Medicare in offering \naffordable prescription drug coverage.\n\n  The Breaux-Frist 2000 plan, known as the Medicare Prescription Drug \nand Modernization Act of 2000, takes the necessary first steps to \nprovide universal outpatient prescription drug coverage and strengthen \nand improve the Medicare program overall. First, it restructures the \n1965 model of Medicare by establishing a competitive Medicare agency to \noversee competition under Medicare+Choice and the addition of a new \ndrug benefit.\n  It establishes voluntary universal outpatient prescription drug \ncoverage which I believe is the answer to the cost issue.\n  It provides comprehensive prescription drug benefits.\n  It guarantees catastrophic protections so a senior is protected from \npaying high drug costs out of their own pocket beyond $6,000.\n\n[[Page S7203]]\n\n  It guarantees price discounts off prescription drugs so seniors never \npay retail prices for prescription medicines again.\n  It guarantees affordable drug coverage by offering all beneficiaries \na 25-percent subsidy off their premiums.\n  It protects low-income beneficiaries by providing beneficiaries with \nincomes below 150 percent of poverty subsidies for premiums and \ncopayments for prescription drug benefits.\n  Finally, it improves benefits and health care delivery under Medicare \nby stabilizing the Medicare+Choice program and introducing much needed \nreforms.\n  The Breaux-Frist 2000 bill addresses the cost issue. Reimportation of \ndrugs does not. I urge my colleagues, for the safety of health care and \nhealth care delivery today, to defeat the underlying amendment on \nreimportation of drugs.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. How much time is remaining on this side of the issue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nUtah, Mr. Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is a very important amendment. There \nis a lot of sincerity behind it.\n  I rise today to offer some concerns about the Jeffords-Dorgan \nAmendment to the Agriculture Appropriations bill and to support the \nCochran amendment.\n  I have many questions about the Jeffords-Dorgan amendment.\n  Let me make something perfectly clear from the start--I do not \nquestion the good intentions of this amendment. I know that my \ncolleague, Senator Jeffords, is sincerely seeking to address this \ndifficult matter of high prices for pharmaceuticals in the United \nStates.\n  As I traveled across my state and around our country this election \nyear, I found that many Utahns and many Americans, particularly our \nsenior citizens, are having difficulty in affording prescription \nmedicines. Some are going across the borders to Canada and Mexico. We \nhave all seen the news broadcasts of those cross-border bus trips to \nbuy the cheaper foreign drugs. And, it may seem obvious, particularly \nto two Senators who represent States on the Canadian border, that the \nsolution is simply to allow the importation of prescription drugs into \nour country.\n  There is something of a cruel dilemma at play here: right at the \nmoment when scientists seem poised to invent an unbelievable new array \nof diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines, many Americans are \nencountering difficulties in affording these new and sometimes costly \nmedications.\n  There are many issues at play in this debate.\n  One issue that policymakers face is to see whether a balance can be \nconstructed whereby we retain the necessary investment to produce the \npromised wonder cures while at the same time maintain our ability to \ndeliver these new products to the patients at affordable prices.\n  This is part of what is shaping the debate over the fashioning of a \nprescription drug benefit for the Medicare program.\n  This balance between new drugs and affordable drugs is what shaped \nthe debate 16 years ago when the Congress passed the Drug Price \nCompetition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. I am proud to have \nplayed a leadership role in this law that helps, according to CBO, \nconsumers save $8 billion to $10 billion annually through the purchase \nof generic drugs.\n  But, in our understandable and highly populist zeal to make drugs \nmore accessible, we must not kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. \nThat is to say, we must be able to continue to attract the private \nsector investment into the biomedical research establishment that has \nmade the American drug development pipeline so promising.\n  While it is true enough that, at this time, the drug industry is the \nmost profitable sector of the economy, I do not think that success \nshould be a license for us to over-regulate this industry. Sometimes \nwell-intentioned, but ill-advised, governmental policies have hastened \nthe decline of American business to the detriment of American workers \nand consumers alike.\n  But, another consideration with respect to the advisability of this \namendment is the premium that we place on our citizens receiving safe \nand effective products, free from adulteration and misbranding.\n  Dating from the 1906 Pure Food and Drugs Act, through the 1938 \nFederal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the 1962 efficacy amendments, and \nthe 1988 Prescription Drug Marketing Act, our Nation has devised a more \nor less closed regulatory system that ensures that drug products will \nbe carefully controlled from the manufacturer to the patient's bedside.\n  If we are to open up our borders to a new plethora of drug \nreimports--I am talking about reimports--we need to be absolutely \ncertain that we have not undermined the integrity of this regulatory \nsystem by admitting products improperly manufactured, transported, or \nstored. A pill may look like the real item but not contain the active \ningredient in the right concentration, or it may simply not contain the \nmedication at all.\n  Similarly, we must not allow the American public to fall prey to \ncounterfeit so-called ``gray market'' products. These are products \nwhich could be made to look exactly like the real thing and may comply \nwith, or attempt to comply with, the requirements of the actual \napproved product, but do not comply with the legal requirement of a \nlicense from the patent holder--in short, a pirated product.\n  While there is a clear and obvious health danger in an adulterated, \nnon-conforming pirated product, there is also great detriment to the \nAmerican public if the unscrupulous are allowed to reimport America's \ninventions back into America without compensating the inventor. Few \nwill be willing to invest the upfront capital--hundreds of millions of \ndollars--to develop a drug if another party can make and sell the drug \nwhile it is under patent protection.\n  It takes an average of 15 years and a half a billion dollars to \ncreate one of the blockbuster drugs. So we have to be careful. Keep in \nmind, too, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have a \nspecial obligation with respect to our intellectual property laws that \nwe not go down any path that can be seen as inviting the development of \na gray market for prescription drugs.\n  After all, a fake Rolex may be right twice a day, but a bad copy of a \ngood drug can kill you. This is something we have to be more concerned \nabout around here. We can't just do what appears to be good but, in \nessence, could kill people.\n  As we move further into the information age, protection of American \nintellectual property becomes more and more vital to our national \ninterest. For example, if the latest computer software can be taken \nwithout proper licensing arrangements, our national leadership in high \ntechnology will be threatened.\n  Where is the pharmaceutical industry in Canada? They have price \ncontrols, and nobody is going to invest the money into developing these \nlifesaving and cost-saving drugs over the long run in those countries \nwith price controls.\n  We have had many debates over price controls. I remember those days \nwhen Senator Pryor and I were on this floor arguing back and forth \nabout price controls. Fortunately, the Senate, in its wisdom, decided \nnot to go for price controls. This is another step toward price \ncontrols that will stultify one of the most important industries in \nAmerica at a time when we just mapped the human genome, and we are at \nthe point where we can actually create more lifesaving drugs--perhaps \nat even a greater cost but nevertheless at a greater health care cost \nsavings than ever before.\n  So that is why intellectual property protections are so necessary.\n  In fact, one of the great accomplishments of the 1995 GATT Treaty was \nto put intellectual property protection front and center in our trade \nrelationships with the developing world. Many countries are notorious \nfor the lax policing of patent and copyright violations by their \ncitizens.\n  When the value of American inventions is expropriated, it is American \ninventors and American consumers who suffer. The United States cannot \nand\n\n[[Page S7204]]\n\nshould not allow free riders around the world essentially to force the \nAmerican public to underwrite a disproportionate amount of the research \nand development that results in a next generation breakthrough product.\n  One has only to read a collection of the section 301 reports the \nOffice of the United States Trade Representative to get a feel of just \nhow prevalent such intellectual property theft is worldwide.\n  I took the time to present this background because I think the \nJeffords-Dorgan amendment requires such analysis.\n  And I will be the first one to admit that the amendment, at first \nblush, seems quite simple and appealing. What could be the matter with \na rule that essentially says drugs obtained from outside the United \nStates at prices lower than U.S. prices can be resold in the U.S., \npresumably in a manner that places pressure to lower prevailing U.S. \nprices? Yet, I recall H.L. Mencken's sage observation, ``There is \nalways an easy solution to every human problem neat--plausible, and \nwrong.''\n  I, too, join many of my constituents in Utah and others across the \ncountry, in questioning why our citizens are paying higher drug prices \nthan those who live in other countries.\n  And while I recognize that there are complex economic, political, and \nsocial factors at play that partially explain why a drug company would \ncharge less for a drug in a destitute region in sub-Saharan Africa, it \nis more difficult to understand why drug costs less in Tijuana, Mexico, \nor Alberta, Canada than in San Diego, California. This is a policy I \ncannot totally defend. And I do think the pharmaceutical companies need \nto address this more.\n  But I can say that where nations impose price controls, a flawed \neconomic theory which we have proven does not work in the U.S., there \nare negative consequences which among other hazards could imperil the \nflourishing research and development we count on to bring us miracle \ncures.\n  I am very apprehensive about government price controls, particularly \non our most cutting-edge technologies like pharmaceuticals. Price \ncontrols function in an economic environment the way a lid works on a \nboiling pot. Price controls may temporarily keep prices down, but they \nare certainly no long term solution to the problem. As soon as the lid \ncomes off, the pot boils over.\n  And, why not just keep the lid on indefinitely? Because price \ncontrols also have a stifling effect on the incentives to conduct \nresearch. Without the prospect of recouping a substantial, multi-\nmillion dollar investment, there is little reason for pharmaceutical \ncompanies to undertake such research on the next breakthrough drugs. It \nwould not take long for our nation's pharmaceutical industry to \natrophy.\n  How can we guarantee that foreign government price controllers will \nnot set an artificially low price on some new Alzheimer's drug? And can \nwe be sure that this won't have the unintended, but real, ripple effect \nof convincing company officials to forgo research on this new class of \ndrugs for fear that, in conjunction with the new liberal re-import \npolicy, they will not be able to recoup their investment?\n  I support those who wish to instruct the United States Trade \nRepresentative to be even more aggressive in promoting and protecting \nintellectual property rights in all of our bilateral and multilateral \ntrade negotiations.\n  It seems to me that rather than importing the effects of foreign \nprice controls back into the U.S., a strong case can be made that we \nshould be using our Trade Representative to attack the foreign price \ncontrols that many countries have enacted so that a better balance \nbetween U.S. research costs and foreign borne research costs might be \nachieved. Let's stop the free riders and cheap riders overseas while \nAmerican citizens are paying the full freight of R\n  I have to confess that one part of me likes the feature of this \namendment that creates the challenge to the entrepreneur of bringing \ngoods sold cheaper abroad back to the United States at presumable \nsavings to U.S. citizens. Yet, the amendment provides no guarantee that \nthose wholesalers and pharmacists importing the products would pass \ntheir savings on to the consumer. And so, we could be trading public \nsafety for middleman profits, an outcome not contemplated by proponents \nof the amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have debated the issue, as I say, of price controls many \ntimes, so I will not spend any more time on the issue of price \ncontrols. But it does not make sense. That is what we are headed \ntowards.\n  The greatest industry in our country, that has the greatest potential \nto do the greatest amount of good to bring health care costs down in \nthe end--even though it is tremendously expensive to develop these \ndrugs--is going to be flattened by this type of legislation which is \nwell meaning, well intentioned, and absolutely destructive to our \ninnovative industries in this particular country.\n  We have to find a way around this drug price problem in this country \nwithout creating a gray market in these particular goods and services. \nThere has not been 1 day of hearings on this particular language. How \ncan we guarantee that foreign government price controllers will not set \nan artificially low price on some new Alzheimer's drug? And can we be \nsure this will not have the unintended but real, ripple effect of \nconvincing company officials to forgo research----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to take 1 \nadditional minute, with an additional minute given to the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Can we be sure this will not have the unintended, but \nreal, ripple effect of convincing company officials to forego research \non this new class of drugs for fear that, in conjunction with the new \nliberal reimport policy, they will not be able to recoup their \ninvestment?\n  Let us hope that the future does not come down to a choice between \ntwo lousy alternatives, what economists call a Hobson's Choice: great \ndrugs that are not widely affordable or potentially great drugs \nabandoned due to minimal projected revenues.\n  And I can tell you given my work in the area of the AIDS epidemic, as \nbetween expensive drugs and no drugs, expensive drugs is a better \nproblem to have.\n\n  My conservative instincts are always against government price \ncontrols, and I don't think that this principle should be limited to \nU.S. government price controls if a by-product of this well-intentioned \nre-import bill is to import some other government's price controls into \nU.S. market dynamics.\n  Frankly, this does not seem the type of far reaching legislation that \nwe should rush into without pausing to try to think through all of its \nramifications.\n  It just seems to me that if there are areas where governments world-\nwide must tread carefully in enacting legislation, if indeed they must \ntread at all, it is in areas like biotechnology.\n  It is clear from absolutely stunning developments like the early \ncompletion of the mapping of the human genome that there is an \nincredible synergy taking place between information technology and \nbiotechnology. The high-speed sequencing machines that mapped the \ngenetic code and almost instantaneously made this information available \non the Internet represent this confluence of technology.\n  In our valid and justified quest to help make drugs more affordable \nto the American public, we should be mindful not to unwittingly retard \nthe development of the next generation of innovation.\n  Having described the general angst I feel in relation to the possible \neffect that this legislation may have on the pace of and investment in \npharmaceutical research and development as well as challenges it will \ncreate in terms of respect for intellectual property rights, I want to \nfocus next on the important concerns that I have about the public \nsafety aspects of the amendment.\n  I want to commend Senators Jeffords and Dorgan for perfecting some of \nthe gaps and shortcomings related to drug safety contained in the \nHouse-passed legislation.\n  But let me say that, as Chairman of the Committee with jurisdiction \nover the Controlled Substances Act, I am not convinced that the \nAmerican public is adequately protected by this amendment.\n\n[[Page S7205]]\n\n  Now, I know that drafting and redrafting is an unglamourous part of \nthe legislative process and that you and your staffs, and if the \nreports are correct many in the Administration, have been working hard \nto refine this amendment.\n  But let's be fair, legislating on an appropriations bill is not the \noptimum way to change some central provisions of the Food, Drug and \nCosmetic Act.\n  I was involved in redrafting the Import and Export Chapter of the \nFood, Drug and Cosmetic Act both in 1986 and in 1996.\n  While I recognize the HELP Committee had a hearing yesterday, I think \nthat everyone would agree with me that it is helpful to have a \nlegislative hearing on legislation when the ink is at least dry.\n  I would like to see what the FDA, the DEA, General McCaffrey and the \nPatent and Trademark Office have to say about the bill when they have \nhad time to give thoughtful consideration to a sufficiently finalized \ndraft.\n  While it is true that the bill is drafted generally to the FDC Act, \nit will be particularly important to see how this liberalized re-import \nmay affect controlled substances. Can't we take the time to hear from \nthe Drug Enforcement Administration?\n  Also, I don't know if this is the case, but I have heard second hand \nreports that the White House has more or less limited FDA to a ``let's \nmake the best of this'' role and is not encouraging the agency to look \nat this bill more globally.\n  Also, I cannot help but note that in the latest draft that I have \nseen, the language covers only drug products and not biologics, which \nare in the vast majority of cases perceived and used by consumers as \ndrugs in the non-legalistic definition.\n  And since it is also the case that many times it is precisely these \nnew generation biologics that are the most costly on the market, the \nquestion must be asked why Americans should not get the advantage of \nlower priced biologics as well as drugs?\n  Frankly, it is evident that each successive draft attempts to address \nthe many shortcomings with respect to assuring the American public that \nthe imported drugs are the safe and effective and unadulterated.\n  Clearly, this drafting would be better served if it were down in the \npublic forum of a mark-up.\n  I just don't think that we know enough about this language to be \nreasonably certain that we could be sowing the seeds of a future \ntragedy but I certainly don't want to take that chance. I worry that a \nday will come when either a under-potent or over-potent batch of \nimported drugs will leave a trail of avoidable carnage.\n  Yes, we can have certifications and regulations and foreign \ninspections and every other thing you can think of, but the fact \nremains we are opening a door that Congress carefully closed in 1988 \nwhen it enacted the Prescription Drug Marketing Act. The history of \nthis bill is that it was enacted after a series of serious adverse \nevents due to improperly stored, handled, and transported imported \ndrugs. It also addressed the issue of the import of counterfeit and \nunapproved drugs such as the presence of counterfeit antibiotics and \ncontraceptives.\n  These were serious threats to public health and safety. These \nincidents were the subject of extensive hearings of the House Energy \nand Commerce Committee. These incidents were the impetus of the 1988 \nlegislation that this amendment would unravel.\n  Look, I know that there is a certain attractiveness to accept this \namendment and that some members may be inclined to vote for this \nmeasure with the expectation that the language, which is still in flux, \nwill be cleaned up in Conference.\n  But I am concerned that opening up this import loophole is either \nfixable or will do more good than harm.\n  As interested parties study this measure, objections are beginning to \nbe registered. And they are not only from the big drug companies who \nare the true, and, to some extent, justified target of this provision.\n  I am mindful that a similar provision passed the House by a wide \nmargin. But one vote that this legislation did not get was of that the \nDean of the House, Representative John Dingell of Michigan.\n  Now you would think that if ever there was a group that stood to \nbenefit from legislation it would be the wholesale druggists because \nthey are the natural middlemen in the new, liberalized import system. \nInstead they call the amendment ``unworkable'' because ``(w)wholesalers \ndo not have the expertise, equipment or personnel to undertake such \ncomplicated tasks''.\n  I will say in public right now that I fully expect that the DEA, FBI, \nand other components of DOJ will weigh in when this correspondence is \nanswered.\n  I am particularly interested in learning from the DEA and FBI to what \nextent importation of counterfeit and adulterated controlled substances \nis a current problem and to what extent, if any, this legislation, \nwould likely affect the current state of affairs?\n  But before my colleagues vote on this measure I would ask each of you \nto review the Dingell correspondence together with any response from \nthe administration. Here are some of the questions that were included \nin Congressman Dingell's letter to FDA:\n\n       1. Please provide a detailed analysis on how (H.R. 4461 and \n     H.R. 3240) would affect FDA's present operations regarding \n     efforts to prevent misbranded or potentially dangerous drugs \n     from entering the U.S. Specifically, please provide: (a) a \n     description of how the present system now used by FDA works; \n     (b) what the present system is intended to accomplish; and \n     (c) what changes would be required (and the potential effects \n     of those changes) if this legislation passes in its present \n     form.\n       Please include a discussion of how these amendments would \n     affect the activities of other agencies, such as the U.S. \n     Customs Service, with responsibilities for assuring the \n     safety of imported prescription drugs.\n       2. Please determine if either of these amendments would \n     have any effect on FDA's ability to enforce good \n     manufacturing practices (GMPs) in any foreign firms that ship \n     drugs to the U.S. If so, please explain any potential effect \n     on consumer health and safety.\n       3. Please provide a full description regarding what a \n     ``warning letter'' is and how it is typically used by the \n     FDA. Please compare this with correspondence that is sent by \n     Customs.\n       4. It appears that these amendments would directly affect \n     the ability of FDA to send warning letters to consumers that \n     purchase drugs over the Internet. As you know, some web sites \n     appear to be covertly linked to foreign drug suppliers. When \n     a consumer orders from such a site, it is not always obvious \n     that they are dealing with an offshore supplier, and thus a \n     potentially non-FDA approved facility. Often, warning letters \n     may be the only indication that the Internet-ordered drugs \n     originated from a foreign (and potentially dubious) source. \n     Please indicate how this legislation could affect FDA's \n     ability to protect consumers who purchased drugs in this way.\n       5. Please detail any other potential effects this \n     legislation could have on FDA's ability to protect consumers \n     from potentially dangerous drugs that originate aboard.\n       6. Finally, please provide technical assistance in the form \n     of specific suggestions for legislative or regulatory changes \n     that would be needed in order to facilitate the safe \n     importation of prescription drugs by individuals, \n     wholesalers, or retailers.\n\n  Only if you are convinced that FDA has the resources and \ninternational presence to enforce the myriad of new regulations and \nprocedures required by the amendment should you vote for this measure.\n  Ask yourself how confident you are that more word-smithing during a \nclosed conference committee meeting is likely to prevent one or more of \nyour constituents from being seriously injured down the road by unsafe \ndrug products brought into the U.S. as a result of this amendment?\n  Do we really want to turn back the clock and essentially re-open a \ndangerous door that was closed by the Prescription Drug Marketing Act \nof 1988?\n  Why the rush to open a potential Pandora's box of public health \nproblems?\n  I hope that this well-intentioned amendment, offered by two highly-\nrespected co-sponsors, does not place Congress and the public in the \nposition of the old adage, those who do not understand the past are \ndoomed to repeat it.\n  I respect the men and good intentions behind this amendment.\n  We all want to increase access to pharmaceuticals for all Americans. \nI do not think that the benefits of the Jeffords-Dorgan amendment \noutweigh its downsides, and that is why I am supportive of the \nalternative offered by the Senator from Mississippi.\n  I have to say, when this debate happened in the House, my dear \nfriend, Congressman John Dingell, who has\n\n[[Page S7206]]\n\nplayed a tremendous role in health care all these years I have been in \nthe Congress, stood up and argued against this. He lost in the House, \nbut he should have won.\n  During the House debate, Congressman Dingell said the following, ``We \nnow find ourselves in the regrettable position of confronting the \npossibility that the easing of the law with regard to food and drug and \ncosmetics, which is going to be done here under this legislation, will \nin fact reduce the safety of the American consuming public.''\n  Mr. Dingell was Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee \nwhen the PDMA passed in 1988. He was a key mover and shaker behind the \nbill. As the bill was being developed the Energy and Commerce Committee \nissued a report that concluded that ``the very existence of a market \nfor reimported goods provides the perfect cover for foreign \ncounterfeits.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that his letter be printed in \nthe Record, as well as the National Wholesale Druggists' Association \nletter, where they beg us not to pass this type of legislation because \nof the harm it could cause to the American public and to the American \nconsumer.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 14, 2000.\n     Hon. Jane E. Henney, M.D.,\n     Commissioner, Food and Drug Administration,\n     Rockville, MD.\n       Dear Dr. Henney: Recently, the House of Representatives \n     adopted two amendments, one by Rep. Crowley (D-NY) and one by \n     Rep. Coburn (R-OK), to the Agricultural Appropriations bill \n     which could have a profound effect on how the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) protects consumers from imported \n     prescription drugs of uncertain safety and effectiveness. I \n     am concerned that these amendments could seriously undermine \n     the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), and thus \n     adversely affect public health.\n       During the 1980's, the House Energy and Commerce Committee \n     conducted a lengthy investigation into the foreign drug \n     market that ultimately led to enactment of the PDMA. That \n     investigation discovered a potentially dangerous diversion \n     market that prevented effective control over the true sources \n     of merchandise in a significant number of cases. The \n     integrity of the distribution system was found to be \n     insufficient to prevent the introduction and eventual retail \n     sale of substandard, ineffective, or even counterfeit \n     pharmaceuticals. As the resulting Committee report stated, \n     ``pharmaceuticals which have been mislabeled, misbranded, \n     improperly stored or shipped, have exceeded their expiration \n     dates, or are bald counterfeits, are injected into the \n     national distribution system for ultimate sale to \n     consumers.''\n       The PDMA was designed to restore the integrity and control \n     over the pharmaceutical market necessary to eliminate both \n     the actual and potential health and safety problems before \n     injury to the consumer could occur. Again, the Committee \n     report was clear on why the PDMA was needed: ``[R]eimported \n     pharmaceuticals threaten the public health in two ways. \n     First, foreign counterfeits, falsely described as reimported \n     U.S. produced drugs, have entered the distribution system. \n     Second, proper storage and handling of legitimate \n     pharmaceuticals cannot be guaranteed by U.S. law once the \n     drugs have left the boundaries of the United States.''\n       Alarmingly, I find little now that suggests that the \n     problem with misbranded, adulterated, or even counterfeit \n     foreign drugs has been solved. I reiterated these concerns \n     with respect to the Crowley and Coburn amendments (see \n     enclosed remarks). In fact, the evidence suggests the problem \n     is getting worse. I am concerned that in our haste to find a \n     way to bring cheaper drugs to seniors and other needy \n     Americans--a clearly important and laudable goal--we risk \n     making changes to key health and safety laws we may later \n     regret. I am thus requesting that you quickly provide me with \n     the following information:\n       (1) Please provide a detailed analysis on how (H.R. 4461 \n     and H.R. 3240) would affect FDA's present operations \n     regarding efforts to prevent misbranded or potentially \n     dangerous drugs from entering the U.S. Specially, please \n     provide: (a) a description of how the present system now used \n     by FDA works; (b) what the present system is intended to \n     accomplish; and (c) what changes would be required (and the \n     potential effects of those changes) if this legislation \n     passes in its present form.\n       Please include a discussion of how these amendments would \n     affects take activities of other agencies, such as the U.S. \n     Customs Service, with responsibilities for assuring the \n     safety of imported prescription drugs.\n       (2) Please determine if either of these amendments would \n     have any effect on FDA's ability to enforce good \n     manufacturing practices (GMPs) in any foreign firms that ship \n     drugs to the U.S. If so, please explain any potential effect \n     on consumer health and safety.\n       (3) Please provide a full description regarding what a \n     ``warning letter'' is and how it is typically used by the \n     FDA. Please compare this with correspondence that is sent by \n     Customs.\n       (4) It appears that these amendments would directly affect \n     the ability of FDA to send warning letters to consumers that \n     purchase drugs over the Internet. As you know, some web sites \n     appear to be covertly linked to foreign drug suppliers. When \n     a consumer orders from such a site, it is not always obvious \n     that they are dealing with an offshore supplier, and thus a \n     potentially non-FDA approved facility. Often, warning letters \n     may be the only indication that the Internet-ordered drugs \n     originated from a foreign (and potentially dubious) source. \n     Please indicate how this legislation could affect FDA's \n     ability to protect consumers who purchased drugs in this way.\n       (5) Please detail any other potential effects this \n     legislation could have on FDA's ability to protect consumers \n     from potentially dangerous drugs that originate abroad.\n       (6) Finally, please provide technical assistance in the \n     form of specific suggestions for legislative or regulatory \n     changes that would be needed in order to facilitate the safe \n     importation of prescription drugs by individuals, \n     wholesalers, or retailers.\n       I would appreciate a full response to this letter by \n     Friday, July 28, 2000. Please do not delay.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John D. Dingell,\n     Ranking Member.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                National Wholesale\n\n\n                                       Druggists' Association,\n\n                                        Reston, VA, July 18, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing on behalf of the National \n     Wholesale Druggists' Association (NWDA) to request that you \n     oppose the pharmaceutical importation amendment Senator \n     Jeffords is expected to offer to the Fiscal Year 2001 \n     Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, \n     and Related Agencies appropriations bill.\n       NWDA is the national trade association representing \n     distributors of pharmaceuticals and health care products. \n     NWDA active members operate over 200 distribution centers \n     throughout the country, distributing over $77 billion in \n     these products to every state, the District of Columbia and \n     U.S. territories.\n       From NWDA's perspective, the Jeffords' amendment is \n     unworkable. It would require wholesalers to statistically \n     sample the products, test them for authenticity, develop \n     extensive record keeping and documentation and relabel \n     products from the country of origin to U.S./FDA approved \n     labels. In their new role, wholesalers would also now likely \n     have to also prepare professional package inserts to \n     accompany each bottle or vial. These new requirements may \n     reclassify ``wholesalers'' as ``relabelers'' and/or \n     ``repackagers,'' which, under FDA regulations, would trigger \n     different and significant additional regulatory requirements. \n     I am not aware of any wholesalers who have these capabilities \n     and I strongly doubt that they would undertake them due to \n     the considerable expense.\n       Wholesalers do not have the experience, equipment or \n     personnel to undertake such complicated tasks. Our expertise \n     is in distributing pharmaceuticals in an efficient, timely \n     and cost-effective manner on a daily basis. An ``average'' \n     NWDA-wholesaler purchases product from over 900 different \n     manufacturers, stores over 25,000 different health care items \n     at any one time and distributes them to its hundreds of \n     customers, including independent pharmacies, chain drug \n     stores, hospitals, HMO's, integrated health systems, clinics, \n     home health providers, physicians and government sites.\n       The measure also imposes numerous new reporting \n     requirements on wholesalers. While it is questionable if \n     these reports actually will help to ensure the health and \n     safety of Americans, they will be very burdensome and costly \n     for the wholesalers who must compile and maintain them. \n     Furthermore, as a result of the testing and reporting \n     requirements, lability exposure for the wholesaler is \n     increased dramatically. All of these new requirements and \n     liabilities will, in our opinion, add significant costs to \n     imported products.\n       NWDA-wholesaler members have a razor thin net profit margin \n     of just 0.62%. Operating in a highly competitive marketplace, \n     wholesale drug distributors have passed these savings from \n     lower operating costs through to our customers. All of these \n     additional responsibilities, regulatory burdens and liability \n     exposure will, in our opinion, ultimately be passed along to \n     consumers. Wholesalers simply do not have the margins to \n     absorb these types of added costs. Indeed, the financial \n     viability of some wholesalers could be jeopardized if the \n     Jeffords measure were to be enacted.\n       In closing, NWDA, as indicated in previous communications, \n     is concerned about the potential threat to the public health \n     posed by the importation of products that have been produced, \n     stored and/or handled in a manner that is inconsistent with \n     U.S. quality standards. Notwithstanding the language in the \n     amendment relating to documentation, the Jeffords amendment \n     does not ensure the safety and integrity of imported \n     prescription drugs. However, NWDA stands ready to work with \n     Senator Jeffords and others to devise an approach that will \n     ensure the safety and integrity of pharmaceutical products as \n     well as provide access to them for all Americans.\n       If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to \n     contact me or have your staff\n\n[[Page S7207]]\n\n     contract Robert Falb, NWDA Director of Congressional Affairs, \n     at 703-787-0020 or rfalb@nwda.org.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                 Ronald J. Streck,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Given the reported White House activity on this bill, I \nwould not be surprised that FDA will quickly respond to and brush aside \nthe questions this letter raises.\n  Mr. President, in sum, we are in danger of losing a tremendously \ninnovative and effective and productive industry that has made the \nAmerican Nation the leader in health care throughout the world.\n  I think this type of an amendment will undermine everything we have \ndecided to do all these years, that has really benefited the whole \nworld.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I point out, we held a hearing on this \nyesterday. I wanted to correct my good chairman on that.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the courtesy of \nmy friend from Vermont because I rise to support the views of my friend \nfrom Utah, who spoke so carefully about the matter of price controls.\n  Sir, I do not expect to have any considerable influence on what we do \ntoday. But I would like, in a very short order, to try to put what we \nare doing in a perspective.\n  This began, for me, during the period of the Finance Committee \nhearings on the health care legislation submitted to us by the \nadministration in 1993.\n  At one hearing, a professor, Charles Fahey, of Fordham University, \nspeaking for the Catholic Health Association, said: What we are \nwitnessing in the country is the commodification of medicine.\n  And down the table, the head of the UCLA hospital said: Can I give \nyou an example? In Southern California, we now have a spot market for \nbone marrow transplants.\n  This thought stayed with me, that market forces were beginning to \nshape decisions in health matters as they had not done before.\n  It was particularly poignant that the first institutions that would \nhave trouble in this new situation would be the medical schools and the \nteaching hospitals, which, as economists say, are public goods. \nEverybody benefits from public goods so no one has an incentive to pay \nfor it--and we are seeing this all over the country in a short 6 years.\n  Now, today, we are seeing another phenomenon of a market that comes \ninto being as railroads did, as oil refineries did, oil producers, as \nhas been going on through the history of free markets and free \nenterprise, which is price controls. There is something about our \npolitical systems in the West that responds to the creation of new \nmarkets and the seeming rise in prices in those markets--when, in fact, \nquality rises--that says perhaps we could control this by controlling \nthe price.\n  It always fails, Mr. President. It is the one thing you can say with \na large degree of confidence that in the 20th century this effort \nalways fails. Sometimes it fails by producing black markets where the \nlaws are not obeyed; others by simply depressing the quality of the \nproducts in the market. That is what we have to watch for here in the \nmain.\n  We are dealing with thoroughly responsible organizations. The Pfizer \nCorporation, from my city of New York, began work in Brooklyn in 1849, \ndeveloped the first treatment for parasitic worms in the mid-19th \ncentury when that was a rampant endemic disease. It has since gone on \nto do other extraordinary things. It was the first major producer of \npenicillin in the United States, which was a drug of such enormous \nconsequence in the Second World War, the first time we were able to \ndestroy one cell in a body without destroying others.\n  Today Pfizer has 12,000 researchers with a budget of $4.7 billion, \nlarger than the budget of the National Science Foundation. I say, sir, \nimpose price controls, which always seems like a good idea at the time, \nand in a short order there will be no such budget. A period of enormous \ninnovation, very recent in the history of medicine, will come to a \nclose.\n  I see my time has come to a close. I ask unanimous consent to print \nin the Record the paper I gave at the 42nd annual Cartwright Lecture as \nreprinted in ``Academic Medicine,'' the journal of the Association of \nAmerican Medical Colleges.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[Reprinted from Academic Medicine, 1998 by the Association of American \n                           Medical Colleges]\n\n                   On the Commodification of Medicine\n\n                      (By Daniel Patrick Moynihan)\n\n\n                                Abstract\n\n       The author reviews key themes of medicine and medical \n     education in the 20th century, such as the revolution in \n     therapies and the consequent and continuing changes in the \n     economies of health care; workforce issues, including the \n     controversy over the optimum number of residency slots; and \n     the impact of managed care on teaching hospitals and medical \n     schools. This impact is part of ``the commodification of \n     health care,'' in which health care is beginning to be bought \n     and sold in a market, where prices determine outcomes, and \n     where the not-for-profit, service orientation of health care \n     providers is threatened.\n       He discusses in detail the pressures this new health care \n     environment places on medical schools and teaching hospitals, \n     and recounts the first Senate Finance Committee hearing in \n     April 1994 on the subject of academic health centers under \n     health care reform. Soon after, the Committee approved \n     legislation to create the Graduate Medical Education and \n     Academic Health Center Trust Fund, to be financed by a 1.5% \n     tax on private health care premiums in addition to Medicare \n     Graduate Medical Education payments. The provision was later \n     dropped from a similar bill that came before the full Senate, \n     but has since been introduced as the Medical Education Trust \n     Fund Act of 1997.\n       The author concludes by cautioning that matters will grow \n     more difficult in the near future, since the threats to \n     academic medicine's institutions have not yet become part of \n     the national political agenda.\n       Acad. Med. 1998; 73:453--459.\n       I must begin by expressing great gratitude to the Dean's \n     Advisory Committee on Honors and Awards for inviting me to be \n     the recipient of the 1997 Cartwright Prize. I will not, \n     however, dissemble my anxiety at being, evidently, the first \n     lay person to receive this prize in its 116-year history. I \n     take comfort in one respect only, which is that I propose to \n     address the same subject, the condition of our medical \n     schools, that Abraham Flexner addressed in 1910, and whilst a \n     historic figure of the first order, Flexner, too, was a \n     layman!\n       He was, of course, concerned with quality. Yet the text of \n     his celebrated Report to the Carnegie Foundation for the \n     Advancement of Teaching is filled with financial details and \n     economic terms:\n       ``In the entire United States there is already on the \n     average one doctor for every 568 persons . . . in our large \n     cities there is frequently one doctor for every 400 or less.\n       ``Over-production is stamped on the face of these facts.\n       ``A century of reckless over-production of cheap doctors \n     has resulted in general overcrowding.''\n       Flexner's view was that there were then too many inadequate \n     medical schools producing too many inadequate doctors. He \n     would raise quality by reducing the number of institutions \n     and increasing the quality of the graduates. He had his way.\n       In 1910, the year of his report, there were 155 medical \n     schools in the United States. By 1932, there were 76, with \n     but a single addition by 1950. In 1910, there were 4,400 \n     medical graduates in a population of 92.2 million, or 4.8 \n     graduates for every 100,000 people. In 1996, there were  \n     15,907 medical graduates in a population of 268.6 million, \n     or 5.9 graduates for every 100,000 people.\n       I risk speaking beyond my knowledge, but it appears to me \n     that we can see in all this a combination of disinterested \n     behavior not without a trace of self-protection. At the time, \n     all manner of folk were becoming ``professional.'' Lawyers \n     and accountants and engineers, and, heaven forbid, professors \n     of government. Gatekeepers were put in place and access was \n     restricted. The public got the benefits of quality; the \n     professions of, well oligopoly.\n       It is striking how echoes of this early debate could be \n     heard in the course of the debate over President Clinton's \n     1993 health care proposal, an exchange which, of course, \n     continues.\n       The new administration had announced its intention to send \n     Congress a bill that would establish universal health care. \n     The work of drafting the legislation was assigned to a group \n     of some 500 persons. By the time the first session of the \n     103rd Congress was coming to a close, we still had not \n     received a bill. On November 23, the day before we ``went \n     out,'' as our phrase has it, I finally was able as chairman \n     of the Senate Finance Committee to introduce, ``on request,'' \n     a 1,362 page bill. I suspected it was not quite complete--it \n     was not--but it saved the honor of the task force to have got \n     its work done in one year.\n       Not incidentally, introducing the bill finally focused my \n     mind. It was time surely\n\n[[Page S7208]]\n\n     that I got some rudimentary education on this subject. \n     Accordingly, I asked Paul A. Marks of Memorial Sloan--\n     Kettering if he would put on a seminar for me. Just basics. \n     We met in their lovely Laurance S. Rockefeller Board Room at \n     10 a.m. on the morning of Wednesday, January 19, 1994. At \n     about 10:20 a.m. my education commenced. One of my tutors--a \n     dean of great distinction--remarked that the University of \n     Minnesota might have to close its medical school.\n       Hold it! Minnesota is where all the Scandinavians went. \n     They don't close medical schools in Minnesota; they open \n     medical schools in Minnesota. This is true, surely, of our \n     whole northern tier of states. It happens I take some pride \n     in having demonstrated in 1992 that while the correlation \n     between per-pupil expenditure on education and average score \n     on the national eighth-grade math exam was a derisory .203, \n     the strongest correlation, a negative .522, was the distance \n     of a state capital from the Canadian border. In the place of \n     all the nostrums being bandied about concerning national \n     education policy, I proposed a simple one-step program: move \n     states closer to Canada. I would tend to assume that some \n     similar relationship obtains as regards health care, and so \n     was the more shocked at the idea of a medical school being \n     closed in Minnesota.\n       On further enquiry, one learned that, being progressive \n     folk, Minnesotans had been joining health maintenance \n     organizations. HMOs, as we would learn to call them. Paul \n     Ellwood had been trying to tell us this. Being cost-\n     conscious, HMOs do not readily send patients to teaching \n     hospitals; lacking patients, teaching hospitals falter; \n     lacking teaching hospitals, medical schools close.\n       Clearly, we were in a new age of medicine that had come \n     upon us suddenly. In a wonderful brief essay written in 1984, \n     Lewis Thomas described ``medicine's second revolution.'' The \n     first revolution began with 2nd century A.D. Galen, a Greek \n     physician practicing in Rome who introduced bleeding and \n     blistering, mercury and the like. Also anatomy.\n       This first revolution persisted--witness the passing of our \n     first president--into the early 19th century, when ``serious \n     questions were raised about this kind of therapy.'' Slowly, \n     but successfully, doctors learned Hippocrates' injunction, \n     primum non nocere. Thomas described a celebrated Victorian \n     painting, The Doctor:\n       ``The picture . . . illustrates what used to be the popular \n     conception of medicine and is, to this day, a romantic \n     version of the way the profession likes to view itself. The \n     scene is a Victorian living room where a young child, \n     stricken by an unspecified mortal illness, lies in a \n     makeshift bed; at her side sits the elderly doctor in an \n     attitude combining, all at once, concern, compassion, \n     intelligence, understanding, and command. He is the \n     painting's centerpiece. The child's parents are in the \n     background, the father looking at the doctor with an \n     expression of total trust.\n       ``The doctor in the painting is engaged in what was, for \n     that period in medicine, the only course available at this \n     stage of serious illness: He is monitoring the patient. He \n     has already, presumably, arrived at the diagnosis. He knows \n     the name of the child's illness, he has a solid working \n     knowledge of the pathology, and from his lifetime of \n     professional experience he is able to predict how the disease \n     will run its course and what will happen at the end. He has \n     explained all this to the parents in language that they can \n     understand, and now, at the moment of the picture, he is \n     engaged in the ancient art of medicine. This means, at its \n     essence, that he is there contributing his presence, \n     providing whatever he can in the way of hope and \n     understanding.\n       ``The illusion of the scene is that he is in control of the \n     situation. He is not, of course. Beyond taking the pulse, \n     examining the tongue, listening to the chest, palpating the \n     abdomen, and making sure that what was then regarded as good \n     nursing care is available, there is nothing whatever that he \n     can do to alter the course of the illness or affect its \n     outcome.''\n       Thomas records that ``this was the kind of medicine I was \n     taught in Boston 50 years ago, which would have been 1934. \n     (When, come to think, we were treating our president for \n     poliomyelitis by seating him in what Gibbon called \n     ``medicinal waters,'' writing of the therapies of Rome in \n     the Age of Caracalla.) He recalls that the terms medical \n     science and medical research were not much used and the \n     term bio-medical, implying that ``medicine and biology \n     were all of a piece,'' was not yet invented. Then this: \n     ``As I recall, 50 years ago we believed that medicine had \n     just about come its full distance.\n       Before that decade of the 1930s wound out, antibiotics made \n     their appearance in medical practice and everything changed. \n     Changed utterly. To cite Thomas a last time, ``The news that \n     infectious bacteria could be killed off without harm to the \n     cells of the host came as an astonishment to physicians \n     everywhere. American medicine took off.\n       The transformation of medical science brought profound \n     changes in the economics of medicine. We would associate this \n     with Say's law, the work of the early-19th-century French \n     economist who reached ``a conclusion that may at first sight \n     seem paradoxical, namely, that it is production which opens a \n     demand for products.'' Supply creates its own demand. Say's \n     law began to take hold in medicine. As the supply of \n     efficacious treatments grew, demand grew. In 1929, real per-\n     capita national health expenditures (1996 dollars) were below \n     $300. By 1989, they exceeded $3,000--a ten-fold increase. In \n     1940, 4.0% of the Gross Domestic Product went to the health \n     care sector. In 1960, 5.1%. But now the trend took hold. The \n     proportion had more than doubled by 1991, when Richard \n     Darman, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, \n     presented this testimony before the Senate Committee on \n     Finance:\n       ``Total public and private health spending is on a growth \n     path that would take over the Gross National Product--if that \n     were not a practical impossibility. Total health spending has \n     grown from less than 6% of GNP three decades ago to about 12% \n     today. It is currently projected to reach 17% by the year \n     2000 and 37% of GNP by 2030. [Emphasis in original.]''\n       In Washington, where health care costs were now assuming an \n     ever-larger portion of the federal budget owing to programs \n     such as Medicare and Medicaid, begun in 1965, the issue was \n     increasingly seen in budgetary terms. This was a profound \n     shift. I was a witness to and something of a participant in \n     the development of the Medicare and Medicaid legislation. \n     Money was the least of our concerns. We had the money. Health \n     care was what we cared about. The venerable Robert J. Myers, \n     who was actuary to the House Committee on Ways and Means at \n     that time, has recently reviewed our subsequent experience. \n     In 1965, it was estimated that the outgo for the hospital \n     insurance (HI) portion of Medicare by 1990 would be $9 \n     billion. As it turned out, the actual figure was $66.9 \n     billion. Thus, he writes, ``the actual HI experience was 639% \n     above the estimate.'' Myers notes that in the interval the \n     program was continually expanded in one way or another such \n     that the comparison is not entirely valid. No matter, the \n     issue succumbed to a fair amount of alarm given what, in \n     Myers's words, ``at first glance . . . seems to be a \n     horrendous variation.'' Political attention turned to the \n     issue of demand.\n       This was a central theme of President Clinton's 1993 health \n     care proposal. One issue identified was what economist Alain \n     Enthoven had earlier called the question of ``physician \n     oversupply.'' Writing in the Journal of the American Medical \n     Association in 1994, Richard A. Cooper of the Medical College \n     of Wisconsin would state that a ``consensus'' had developed \n     that there needed to be a ``better balance'' in the \n     proportion of primary care physicians to specialists. He was \n     careful, however, to note that where the one was determined \n     by demography, ``the driving force behind much of specialty \n     medicine was science.''\n       This was not a matter of concern to the Clinton task force. \n     Working in secret, an abomination where science is concerned \n     and no less an offense to democratic governance, the task \n     force came up with this formulation:\n       ``Problem: An increasingly overabundant number of medical \n     graduates are entering specialty fields instead of primary \n     care fields (family practice, general pediatrics, general \n     internal medicine).\n       ``Provide [by Federal law] that at least 50 percent of \n     residency graduates enter primary care practice.\n       ``Limit Federal funding for first-year residency positions \n     to no more than 110 percent of the size of the graduating \n     class of U.S. medical schools. This would further support the \n     action to limit specialty residency positions. [Emphasis in \n     original.]''\n       As I have described elsewhere, a dissenting paper dated \n     April 26, 1993, by ``Workgroup 12'' of ``Tollgate 5,'' [sic] \n     written by a physician in the Veterans' Administration, \n     began:\n\n\n                        ``for official use only\n\n       ``Subject: Proposal to cap the total number of graduate \n     physician (resident) entry (PGY-1) training positions in the \n     U.S.A. To 110 percent of the annual number of graduates of \n     U.S. medical schools.\n       ``Issue: Although this proposal has been presented in toll-\n     gate documents as the position of Group 12, it is not \n     supported by the majority of the members of Group 12 (listed \n     below).\n       ``REASONS NOT TO CAP THE TOTAL NUMBER OF U.S. RESIDENCY \n     TRAINING POSITIONS FOR PHYSICIAN GRADUATES.\n       ``1. This proposal has been advanced by several Commissions \n     within the last two years as a measure to control the costs \n     of health care. While ostensibly advanced as a man-power \n     policy, its rationale lies in economic policy. Its advocates \n     believe that each physician in America represents a cost \n     center. he not only receives a high personal salary, but \n     is able to generate health care costs by ordering tests, \n     admitting patients to hospitals and performing technical \n     procedures. This thesis may be summarized as: TO CONTROL \n     COSTS. CONTROL THE NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS.''\n       It went on the state that the proposal would require ``a \n     vast regulatory apparatus.'' Then this:\n       ``13. To end on a philosophic note, when the proposal to \n     cap training slots was presented to the presidents of the \n     major U.S. universities last weekend, they were incredulous \n     that the U.S. government would advance as sound social policy \n     a proposal to limit access to one of the three learned \n     professions with its millennial history of achieving social \n     good. They further recognized that in America open access to \n     careers in these professions has been a traditional path for \n     immigrant social mobility.''\n       Leaving aside the politically correct last sentence--No \n     White Protestants Need Apply--this was surely an honorable \n     response. The university presidents were right to have been \n     incredulous at this proposal. It\n\n[[Page S7209]]\n\n     was, in the words of Walter Reich, a proposal for the \n     ``deliberate dumbing down of medicine.'' And yet, it was all \n     kept too much in the family. The administration hardly drew \n     attention to it. A 136-page White House publication on the \n     health care plan had 11 lines on the subject of ``Doctors in \n     the United States: An Unhealthy Mix.'' The press scarcely \n     mentioned the matter, even here in New York where the 110% \n     limit on residencies would have nearly eliminated foreign \n     medical graduates in our hospitals, with the real possibility \n     of many having to close. (The number of residency slots has \n     for some years now been at about 135% of the number of \n     graduates of American medical schools. Imposing a 110% cap \n     would have resulted in a reduction of almost a fifth in the \n     number of residencies nationwide. In that almost half the \n     medical residents in New York City are graduates of foreign \n     medical schools, it would have been very difficult to staff \n     the city's hospitals if such a supply constraint had become \n     law.)\n       Nor did the workforce issue emerge in the House and Senate \n     hearings on the health care legislation. However, early on \n     the Finance Committee began to sense that the notion of \n     uncontrollable costs was open to question. Indeed, the \n     interval between 1993, when the administration health care \n     plan was proposed, and 1994, when it failed in the Congress, \n     was something of a break point. Average health insurance \n     costs for large employers, including government, declined \n     from $4,117 in 1993 to $4,040 in 1994. (They have since more \n     or less stabilized.) Something was going on, and in the \n     Finance Committee, at least, we began to sense what could \n     only be described as market forces. This sense, at least for \n     this Senator, was of a sudden brought into focus on April 26, \n     1994, when Monsignor Charles J. Fahey of Fordham University, \n     testifying on behalf of the Catholic Health Association of \n     the United States, said that what we were seeing was the \n     ``commodification of health care.'' Which is to say that \n     health care was beginning to be bought and sold in a market, \n     where prices would determine outcomes. This was not a \n     development Fahey found altogether congenial.\n       ``We want to alert the committee that the not-for-profit \n     mission in health care is being seriously threatened by the \n     increasing commercial environment in which we find ourselves \n     operating; a real commodification of health care, if you \n     will.''\n       Still, as we pursued the matter, it became ever more clear \n     that something such was happening.\n       Again, Paul Ellwood did his best to tell us this. At a \n     March 1, 1994, hearing in the Finance Committee, he was asked \n     about projections that health care spending would reach 20% \n     of GDP by the year 2000.\n       ``Dr. Ellwood. The problem with building these models that \n     project costs is, if you are going to go with a model, the \n     more compulsory, the more intrusive the system of determining \n     what the numbers are in there, supposedly the more accurate \n     they are.\n       ``What we are having to do here is speculate about how \n     consumers will behave if they are faced with lower-cost \n     health plans versus how providers will behave if there is a \n     ceiling on it.\n       ``My feeling is--I may come to regret saying things like \n     this--we are never going to hit 20%.\n       ``Senator Packwood. That we are going to get what?\n       ``Dr. Ellwood. We are never going to hit 20% of the GDP.\n       ``The Chairman. Write that down. Everybody take notes.''\n       What Mr. Darman had described--37% of GNP by the year \n     2030--was an unsustainable trend. It is years now since \n     Herbert Stein, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers \n     under President Nixon, offered the epiphanic observation that \n     ``an unsustainable trend cannot be sustained.'' We should \n     have known, and began to sense.\n       Here are the numbers. In 1993, health care absorbed 13.6% \n     of GDP. The administration projected that without reform, the \n     proportion would rise to 18.9% by the year 2000. (Pretty much \n     along the Darman trend line.) With reform--1,362 pages of \n     it--we could hope for 17.3% of GDP by said year 2000. For \n     what it is worth, the Congressional Budget Office now \n     projects that by the year 2000 health care costs will be \n     14.3%. As they would say in the age of Thomist medicine, the \n     crisis has passed.\n       But another crisis awaited. That of medical schools and \n     teaching hospitals. Slowly, beginning with Fahey's testimony, \n     the connection emerged. And it has been all over the press \n     ever since, if one reads the headlines with this in mind. \n     Here is a sample from the superb reporting of Milt \n     Freudenheim in The New York Times:\n\n\n     ``hospitals are tempted but wary as for-profit chains woo them\n\n       ``Richard Scott has made deals to take over 137 hospitals \n     in the last year, and he wants more. Now, his Columbia--HCA \n     Healthcare Corporation has its eye on some Catholic hospitals \n     in Chicago.\n       ``Stay away, says Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago, one \n     of the most powerful clerics in the nation. The Roman \n     Catholic Church has an obligation to poor people and to the \n     Catholic way of health care, the Cardinal recently warned the \n     20 hospitals in his archdiocese, and selling to a for-profit \n     chain would be a betrayal. He reminded them that the \n     archdiocese could withdraw its recognition of any hospital \n     defying him.''\n       For Catholics, of course, read Jewish, Presbyterian, \n     Methodist, what you will. Hospitals once were charities.\n\n\n       ``big hospital chain makes a bid to buy blue cross of ohio\n\n       ``The nation's largest for-profit hospital chain agreed \n     yesterday to buy the main business of Blue Cross and Blue \n     Shield of Ohio, raising concerns among consumers, employers \n     and providers of health care about the enormous influence \n     that such a combination could exert.\n       ``The $229.5 million purchase by the Columbia--HCA \n     Healthcare Corporation would be the first acquisition of a \n     Blue Cross company by a for-profit hospital chain. If \n     approved by state regulators and the national Blue Cross and \n     Blue Shield association, the takeover could open the door for \n     similar deals by a number of nonprofit Blue Cross plans that \n     are struggling to stay in business.''\n       Recall that Blue Cross began as a not-for-profit \n     cooperative, an idea much associated with resisting market \n     forces.\n       A recent lead story of the Business Day section of The \n     Times, by David J. Morrow, began:\n\n\n             ``warner--lambert shares plunge on glaxo move\n\n       ``Shares of the Warner-Lambert Company plunged 18.5% \n     yesterday after Glaxo Wellcome P.L.C. halted British sales of \n     Warner-Lambert's diabetes drug, troglitazone [trade name \n     Rezulin]. . . .\n       ``By day's end, Warner-Lambert's shares had dropped $25.875 \n     each, to $114, with 9.9 million shares traded, the second \n     most active of the day on the New York Stock Exchange. The \n     setback shaved $7 billion off the Morris Plains, N.J., \n     company's market value, prompting analysts at Bear, Stearns & \n     Company to adjust their earnings estimates and Morgan Stanley \n     to lower its rating of Warner-Lambert before noon. At one \n     point, Warner-Lambert's stock tumbled to $112, its lowest \n     point since June 20. . . .\n       Developed by the Sankyo Company Ltd. in Japan, Rezulin was \n     initially heralded as a wonder drug for type-2 diabetes, a \n     chronic disease that affects about 135 million people world-\n     wide. According to Warner-Lambert data, Rezulin reduces or \n     eliminates the daily use of insulin, which has been the \n     predominant treatment for diabetes. Unlike insulin, \n     administered by injection, Rezulin is taken in tablets.''\n       There was a time, surely, when the advent of a new ``wonder \n     drug'' would have been approached in terms of health care. \n     Now it becomes an affair of share prices.\n       But now to our main story. This, once again, by Mr. \n     Freudenheim of The Times, on May 20, 1997:\n\n\n  ``teaching hospitals under the knife; longtime missions pressed by \n                                h.m.o.'s\n\n       ``It began as a charity supported by Paul Revere that sent \n     out doctors to the poor. It evolved into the New England \n     Medical Center at Tufts University, a research powerhouse \n     that ranks among the leaders in New England in liver \n     transplants, breast-cancer research and complex heart \n     procedures.\n       ``But now, the biggest health maintenance organization in \n     Boston threatens to starve New England Medical by refusing to \n     pay for its patients to go there, even though the costs are \n     as low or lower than at other Boston teaching hospitals. . . \n     .\n       ``The squeeze on academic medical centers like New England \n     Medical is particularly brutal in Boston, which has seven \n     prestigious teaching and research hospitals and far too many \n     hospital beds, and where costs per patient are among the \n     nation's highest. But dozens of teaching hospitals across the \n     country face similar challenges, and they are responding by \n     reaching out for business partners.\n       ``Some, like the George Washington University Hospital in \n     Washington, D.C., and state university hospitals in \n     California, Oklahoma and South Carolina, are being sold to \n     for-profit chains; others, like New England Medical, Columbia \n     University's Presbyterian Hospital and the University of \n     Minnesota Academic Medical Center, have merged with stronger, \n     nonprofit local institutions; still others, like Beth Israel \n     and St. Luke's/Roosevelt in New York, are merging into \n     holding companies that will run their finances.''\n       In April 1994, the Senate Committee on Finance held \n     hearings on the subject of ``Academic Health Centers Under \n     Health Care Reform.'' It would appear that these were the \n     first ever on that subject. The testimony was powerful and \n     dispositive. In response to a question from Senators Bob \n     Packwood, our ranking member, Paul Marks described the \n     situation at Sloan-Kettering:\n       ``I think that a price-driven environment is one in which \n     we will have unintended consequences in terms of rationing \n     and quality. You cannot get something for nothing out of the \n     system. And while we can reduce costs substantially, and I \n     think all of us have tremendous pressures to reduce costs, \n     even in high-cost centers, such as the cancer centers, we \n     know right now from our experience because we are being \n     approached by insurance companies, health plans, managed \n     care, and they say how much does a bone marrow transplant \n     cost. And we will say it is $100,000. Well, we will give you \n     all our marrow transplants for $60,000.\n       ``There are two things. Number one, we cannot survive as a \n     quality provider of care doing bone marrow transplantations \n     alone. Even if we got $100,000, we would not want to do it. \n     And at $60,000 we cannot really provide\n\n[[Page S7210]]\n\n     a quality care program in bone marrow transplantation.\n       ``So I would say that at least in our environment there has \n     to be some kind of legislation which takes into account that \n     a price-driven system today will compromise the quality of \n     health care and will be associated with rationing. I do not \n     think there is any question in my mind about that because \n     they cannot compete in any other way if you are going to \n     drive down just price.''\n       It would be fair, I believe, to state that the theme of our \n     hearings was, and here I quote from my opening statement, \n     that ``health insurance is important, but health is more \n     important. It comes out of discovery, and we are in a great \n     age of discovery.'' We were up against the problem of how to \n     provide for what economists call public goods. These are \n     readily described. For most goods and services, if the \n     consumer chooses not to pay, he does not receive the benefit. \n     If he does not buy a ticket, he is excluded from the \n     ballpark. By contrast, consumers are not easily excluded from \n     the benefits of a public good, say national defense or cancer \n     research, because everyone benefits whether or not they pay. \n     As Richard A. Musgrave noted in his classic 1959 text, The \n     Theory of Public Finance, the existence of public goods \n     provides a rationale for the government to intervene on \n     markets and either directly provide the public good--as it \n     does with national defense--or support the provision of the \n     public good through indirect payments.\n       The Finance Committee resolved to do just this for medical \n     schools and teaching hospitals. The chairman's mark, as is \n     our term, of June 29, 1994, provided for a Graduate Medical \n     Education and Academic Health Center Trust Fund to be \n     financed by a 1.5% tax on all private health care premiums. \n     An additional .25% levy, proposed to us by Senator Mark \n     Hatfield, provided for medical research. In all, this made \n     for an average annual revenue to the Trust Fund of $17 \n     billion over five years. To may knowledge, this was the first \n     such proposal of its kind. It did not go unnoticed in our \n     Committee; a motion to strike the 1.75% premium tax failed by \n     13 votes to seven.\n       It would be pleasing to report that there was at least some \n     response to the bipartisan approval by the Senate's tax-\n     writing committee of a trust fund for this purpose. But there \n     was none. The Committee finished its work on Saturday, and \n     there was a long front-page report in The Times. The tone was \n     cool. Our assignment had been to provide universal health \n     care; we had only provided for 95% coverage by 2002. That a \n     bipartisan majority had approved a very considerable measure \n     meant nothing to those who had vowed never to compromise. \n     These included a fair number of journalists, whose \n     disappointment, even distaste, was made plain. In the end, of \n     course, no bill was brought to a vote in either chamber. The \n     Congressional elections that followed were widely understood \n     to mark a repudiation of the whole enterprise, and indeed, \n     the subject has receded, in Congress at least, while health \n     maintenance organizations continue their seeming predestined \n     course.\n       The one exception is this matter of medical schools and \n     teaching hospitals. In the 104th Congress, four bills were \n     introduced. This time the Senate Finance Committee rejected \n     the trust fund on a tie vote, ten to ten. (Tie votes fail.) \n     By contrast, on the House side, in the Committee on Ways and \n     Means, the new chairman, Representative Bill Archer of Texas, \n     proposed and carried a Teaching Hospital and Graduate Medical \n     Education fund that would receive, among other revenues, \n     $13.5 billion in appropriated general funds over a six-year \n     period. This measure became part of the Balanced Budget Act \n     of 1995. It passed both House and Senate, but was vetoed by \n     President Clinton over other matters. In the current, 105th \n     Congress, I have reintroduced S. 21, the ``Medical Education \n     Trust Fund Act of 1997.'' This was a ``first day'' bill, and \n     accorded some prestige, as the first 20 numbers are reserved \n     for the Majority and Minority leaders. For all that, at the \n     end of the year there are no cosponsors and few prospects. \n     The subject has not made its way onto the national political \n     agenda as a singular public good that has been placed in \n     jeopardy by what Columbia's great seer, Robert K. Merton, \n     described back in 1936 as the ``unintended consequences'' of \n     actions arising in other contexts.\n       Expect matters to grow more difficult in the near future. \n     There will be all manner of proposals to regulate managed \n     care, much as a century ago we commenced to regulate the \n     railroads and such like commercial activities. This can be \n     helpful; it can be hurtful. James F. Blumstein of the Health \n     Policy Center at Vanderbilt University suggests that the \n     current federal investigation into various health care \n     providers ``is taking its cues from past task forces on the \n     Mafia.'' Or desert warfare, for that matter, given the formal \n     title, ``Operation Restore Trust.'' Again, expect more. But \n     be of good cheer. Some things take a long time, as Lewis \n     Thomas attested. Most importantly, may a layman urge that you \n     physicians be importunate. You are too precious to let your \n     collective well-being be taken for granted. I close with the \n     words with which Dominic P. Purpura, dean of the Albert \n     Einstein College of Medicine here in New York, on October 5th \n     opened the new Jerome and Dawn Greene Medical Arts Pavilion \n     at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx:\n       ``We are gathered here for several reasons. Most \n     importantly to bear witness to the felicitous marriage of \n     high-spirited philanthropy and good works, now consummated in \n     this . . . Medical Arts Pavilion. We are here for another \n     purpose as well. To dispel the septic rumor oozing from some \n     health policy think tanks to the effect that academic \n     medical centers such as ours are dinosaurs doomed to \n     extinction by the impact of the asteroid of managed care. \n     Look skyward! On this day of noble purpose the sun shines \n     brightly. No ashen clouds obscure the values that have \n     made American medicine a crowning achievement of Western \n     Civilization. And what are these core values? Simply \n     stated: Faith in evidence-based medicine and trust that \n     our superbly trained physicians will translate the basic \n     science of medicine into the art and science of patient \n     care.''\n       The author thanks Dr. David Podoff, minority chief \n     economist for the Senate Committee on Finance, for assistance \n     with this article.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be involved in \nworking on this legislation with the Senator from Vermont and other \nlegislation with Senator Dorgan.\n  To my colleague from Utah, if we read the amendment carefully--all \ncolleagues who are going to vote--we are very clear on protections. If \nsafeguards are not in place, the drugs cannot be reimported. That is \nclear language.\n  These are some of the protections: strict FDA oversight; proof of FDA \napproval of imported medicines; only licensed pharmacists and \nwholesalers can import medicines for retail sale; importers will have \nto meet requirements for handling as strict as those already in place \nfor manufacturers; lab testing to screen out counterfeits; lab testing \nto ensure purity, potency, and safety of medications. It is all clear.\n  I have a letter from the National Community Pharmacists which is in \nfavor of this exact concept of our pharmacists and wholesalers being \nable to reimport these drugs so our consumers can afford it.\n  The only protection we don't have in this amendment is protection for \nthe pharmaceutical industry to continue to make excessive profits. I \nquote from Fortune magazine:\n\n       Whether you gauge profitability by median return on \n     revenues, assets, or equity, pharmaceuticals had a Viagra \n     kind of year.\n\n  We are talking about an industry making enormous profits, profits as \na percentage of revenue up around 18.6 percent. We have all the \nprotection for consumers. We just don't want to protect the \npharmaceutical company from being able to gouge consumers. People in \nMinnesota and in Alabama and in Vermont and in North Dakota are saying: \nWhy can't we have the trade? Why can't we have the competition? Why \ncan't our pharmacists and wholesalers reimport these drugs back to us \nso we can get the drugs we need for ourselves and our families at a \nprice we can afford?\n  This is a real simple amendment. You are on the side of consumers, \nyou are on the side of real competition, or you are on the side of the \npharmaceutical industry. On this one, Senators have to be on the side \nof consumers.\n  I am glad we finally have the chance to bring up legislation that \ncorrects the injustice that finds American consumers the least likely \nof any in the industrialized world to be able to afford drugs \nmanufactured by the American pharmaceutical industry because of the \nunconscionable prices the industry charges only here in the United \nStates.\n  When I return to Minnesota which I do frequently, I meet with many \nconstituents, but none with more compelling stories than senior \ncitizens struggling to make ends meet because of the high cost of \nprescription drugs--life-saving drugs that are not covered under the \nMedicare program. Ten or twenty years ago these same senior citizens \nwere going to work everyday--in the stores, and factories, and mines in \nMinnesota--earning an honest paycheck, and paying their taxes without \nprotest. Now they wonder, how can this government--their government--\nstand by, when the medicines they need are out of reach.\n  But it is not just that medicare does not cover these drugs. The \nunfairness which Minnesotans feel is exacerbated of course by the high \ncost of prescription drugs here in the United States--the same drugs \nthat can be purchased for frequently half the price in Canada or Mexico \nor Europe. These are the\n\n[[Page S7211]]\n\nexact same drugs, manufactured in the exact same facilities with the \nexact same safety precautions. A year ago, most Americans did not know \nthat the exact same drugs are for sale at half the price in Canada. \nToday, you can bet the pharmaceutical industry wishes no one knew it. \nBut the cat is out of the bag--and it is time for Congress to right \nthese inequities.\n  All the legislators speaking today have heard the first-hand stories \nfrom our constituents--in Minnesota, Vermont, North Dakota, South \nDakota, Washington state--constituents who are justifiably frustrated \nand discouraged when they can't afford to buy prescription drugs that \nare made in the United States--unless they go across the border to \nCanada where those same drugs, manufactured in the same facilities are \navailable for about half the price.\n  Senior citizens have lost their patience in waiting for answers--and \nso have I.\n  Driving to Canada every few months to buy prescription drugs at \naffordable prices isn't the solution; it is a symptom of how broken \nparts of our health care system are. Americans regardless of party have \na fundamental belief in fairness--and know a rip-off when they see one. \nIt is time to end that rip-off. While we can be proud of both American \nscientific research that produces new miracle cures and the high \nstandards of safety and efficacy that we expect to be followed at the \nFDA, it is shameful that America's most vulnerable citizens--the \nchronically ill and the elderly--are being asked to pay the highest \nprices in the world here in the U.S. for the exact same medications \nmanufactured here but sold more cheaply overseas.\n  That is why I introduced with Senator Dorgan the International \nPrescription Drug Parity Act, and with Senator Jeffords the Medicine \nEquity and Drug Safety Act, two bills which will amend the Food, Drug, \nand Cosmetic Act to allow American pharmacists and distributors to \nimport prescription drugs into the United States as long as the drugs \nmeet FDA's strict safety standards. Pharmacists and distributors will \nbe able to purchase these drugs--often manufactured right here in the \nU.S.--at lower prices overseas and then pass the huge savings along to \nAmerican consumers.\n  What these bills do is to address the absurd situation by which \nAmerican consumers are paying substantially higher prices for their \nprescription drugs than are the citizens of Canada, and the rest of the \nindustrialized world. These bills do not create any new federal \nprograms. Instead they use principles frequently cited in both Houses \nof the Congress--principles of free trade and competition--to help make \nit possible for American consumers to purchase the prescription drugs \nthey need. Now we have the chance to adopt an amendment that includes \nthe best of both those bills.\n  And the need is clear. A recent informal survey by the Minnesota \nSenior Federation on the price of six commonly used prescription \nmedications showed that Minnesota consumers pay, on average, nearly \ndouble (196%) that paid by their Canadian counterparts. These excessive \nprices apply to drugs manufactured by U.S. pharmaceutical firms, the \nsame drugs that are sold for just a fraction of the U.S. price in \nCanada and Europe.\n  Pharmacists could sell prescription drugs for less here in the United \nStates, if they could buy and import these same drugs from Canada or \nEurope at lower prices than the pharmaceutical companies charge here at \nhome.\n\n  Now, however, Federal law allows only the manufacturer of a drug to \nimport it into the U.S. Thus American pharmacists and wholesalers must \npay the exorbitant prices charged by the pharmaceutical industry in the \nU.S. market and pass along those high prices to consumers. It is time \nto stop protecting the pharmaceutical industry's outrageous profits--\nand they are outrageous.\n  Where the average Fortune 500 industry returned 3.8 percent profits \nas a percentage of their assets, the pharmaceutical industry returned \n16.5 percent.\n  Where the average Fortune 500 industry returned 15 percent profits as \na percentage of shareholders equity, the pharmaceutical industry \nreturned 36 percent.\n  Those record profits are no surprise to America's senior citizens \nbecause they know where those profits come from--they come from their \nown pocketbooks. It is time to end the price gouging.\n  We need legislation that can assure our Senior Citizens and all \nAmericans that safe and affordable prescription medications at last \nwill be as available in the United States of America as they are in all \nthe other countries of the industrialized world. This amendment which I \nam introducing along with Senators Jeffords and Dorgan accomplishes \nthat end.\n  And contrary to the campaign of false information being promoted by \nthe pharmaceutical industry, the Amendment includes all the safety \nprecautions needed to protect the American public. This amendment \nincludes the specific protections--which were not included in the \nHouse-passed amendments--to make sure we are not sacrificing safety for \nprice.\n  The only things that are not protected in this amendment are the \nexcessive profits of the pharmaceutical industry. My job as a United \nStates Senator is not to protect those profits but to protect the \npeople. Colleagues, please join in and support this thoughtful and \nnecessary amendment that will help make prescription drugs affordable \nto the American people.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend Senator Jeffords and Senator \nDorgan for this amendment. There is no reason why American consumers \nshould not have access to lower-priced medicines, while assuring the \nsafety of those medicines that are imported.\n  I quote from an editorial from the Detroit News. This is an editorial \ndepartment which is very outspokenly conservative, avowedly \nconservative in its editorial policy. It says:\n\n       . . . Congress should remove the prohibition because the \n     federal government ought not to restrict the purchasing \n     options of Americans.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       . . . using government coercion to prevent Americans from \n     purchasing drugs from abroad is not the way to go.\n\n  That is what this issue is all about. This is whether or not we are \ngoing to use the free market. This has nothing to do with setting \nprices. This has to do with using a free market to allow the \nreimportation of something manufactured in the United States after it \nhas been certified by the FDA that it is safe to do so.\n  It is incredibly galling as well as incredibly expensive for my \nconstituents in Michigan to go across the border to Canada in order to \nbuy drugs at about half the price of what they are charged for those \nsame drugs in Michigan. Again, these are drugs manufactured in the \nUnited States and exported to Canada. All this amendment says is that \nit ought to be possible for our wholesalers and our pharmacists to \nimport something back into the United States manufactured in the United \nStates and having been approved by a process of the FDA to make sure \nthat it is safe.\n  We have done a survey in my home State. We have compared the prices \nof these drugs. They are quite extraordinary. We have many people who \ncannot afford these drugs. These are often lifesaving drugs, life-\nextending drugs. These are drugs which reduce pain, which make it \npossible for people to be more mobile than they otherwise would be.\n  We looked at seven of these most popular drugs because there were \nthree on which we could not make a comparison because they were over-\nthe-counter drugs in Canada or otherwise unavailable to get prices, but \nseven of the most popular drugs. Premarin is an estrogen tablet taken \nby menopausal women. It costs $23 in Michigan, $10 in Ontario. \nSynthroid--this replaces a hormone which is normally produced by the \nthyroid gland--costs over $13 in Michigan, under $8 in Ontario. We \ncould go through the next five drugs on this list, and I have done this \nalready in the Record in previous remarks I made on the Senate floor.\n  We cannot afford to be subsidizing the consumers in other countries. \nWe ought to use the free market that we are all so proud of to allow \nthe import of something which is, by the way,\n\n[[Page S7212]]\n\nmanufactured in the United States and, by the way, in some cases had \npreviously received financial support from the taxpayers of the United \nStates through either the Tax Code on research and development or, in \nsome cases, direct grants from the National Institutes of Health to the \nscientists who developed these drugs.\n  It is really an intolerable situation when we have people in our \nStates who can't afford these critically important drugs and are simply \nprohibited from having a wholesaler or a pharmacist import that drug \nfrom another country. Since the amendment provides for safety through a \nprocess which has to be approved by the FDA, it seems to me this is a \nsensible thing to do.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there is nothing worse than losing an \nargument you are not having. We had four or five opponents talk about \nthis legislation, and they were making arguments about a bill that \ndoesn't exist. So they win. What is the argument? Listen carefully and \nyou will hear the scare tactics, suggesting that somehow in an old \ngarage with a dirt floor on a dusty street somewhere in Haiti, someone \nis going to produce a counterfeit drug and ship it to the U.S. We \nshould not do that, they say. Well, I agree. But that has nothing to do \nwith this legislation. They are winning an argument we are not having.\n  This legislation establishes very strict controls and pertains only \nto prescription drugs that are produced in manufacturing plants \napproved by the FDA, with strict FDA oversight and proof of FDA \napproval on all imported medicines. Only licensed pharmacists and \nwholesalers can import the medicine for resale, and there is lab \ntesting to screen out counterfeits. That is what this is about. Risk? \nThis isn't about risk.\n  One of our colleagues said what we need is more insurance coverage \nfor prescription drugs. Well, I agree that we need to add a \nprescription drug benefit to Medicare to help our senior citizens pay \nfor their medications.\n  But we also need lower prices for prescription drugs. There is a \nfamous football coach who is on television just about every night in an \nadvertisement for a drug called Zocor. He is one of America's better \nprofessional football coaches and, I gather, a wonderful man. He says \nthat Zocor reduces his cholesterol. I am sure it does; it is a \nwonderful drug. Zocor is advertised widely on television. If you buy it \nin the United States it is $3.82 per tablet. If you buy it in Canada--\nthe same pill by the same company--it is $1.82 per tablet.\n  I ask anybody who spoke today in opposition to this amendment, how \ndoes one justify that? Do you support it? Do you think it is right? Do \nyou want to tell the American consumer we have a global economy for \neveryone except for them? The compounds and chemicals used in this pill \ncan be accessed globally by the companies that produce it, and that is \nfine. But the global economy isn't for you, American consumers. The \ndrug companies can price their products any way they want here in the \nUnited States, and the American consumer has no business accessing them \nat a lower price anywhere outside the United States.\n  I ask all those who oppose this, do you support this pricing \nstrategy--$1.82 for the person in Winnipeg, Canada, and $3.82 for the \nU.S. consumer?\n  The Senator from Vermont offers a very simple piece of legislation. \nThe amendment allows for the importation only of products approved for \nsale in the United States by the FDA and manufactured in FDA-approved \nplants.\n  At a hearing before the HELP committee earlier this year, Dr. \nChristopher Rhodes, a professor of applied pharmaceutical sciences at \nthe University of Rhode Island, who has 30 years of experience on the \ndevelopment and evaluation of drug products, said this:\n\n       It is my considered professional opinion that the process \n     of using re-imported prescription drugs in the United States \n     need not place the American public at any increased risk of \n     ineffective or dangerous products.\n\n  I understand what is at work here. The pharmaceutical industry wants \nto protect what they have. They have a pretty good deal. They can price \ntheir products at whatever price they want. But this is about fair \nprices for American consumers. I heard a colleague say: If we don't \nprice products like this in the U.S., there won't be research and \ndevelopment for new drugs.\n  Oh, really? Every European country receives lower prices for the same \ndrugs. Yet a larger percentage of research and development on \nprescription drugs takes place in Europe than in the United States. \nExplain that.\n\n  This is a good piece of legislation. I hope my colleagues will see it \nfor what it is. It doesn't pose any risk. It says to the American \nconsumers that they have rights as well.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time on our \nside to the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Helms.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may deliver \nmy remarks while seated at my desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I don't question the sincerity of those who \nadvocate this amendment which is intended to repeal the law that \nprohibits the wholesale reimportation of potentially unsafe drugs from \nCanada or Mexico. While they may scoff at the opposition, I predict \nthat one day, somewhere down the line, they will regret sincerely their \nsupport of this proposal which is fatally flawed.\n  Most Americans never doubt the safety of the drugs in our pharmacies \nand hospitals. That is because they understand that no drug can be sold \nin America without manufacturers first making enormous investments in \nresearch and development, the compound passing rigorous testing and \nreview by the FDA, and then being distributed through a supply system \nthat ensures that drugs must pass through a reliable and verifiable \nchain of custody.\n  No country in the world does as much to ensure the safety and \nefficacy of drugs used by its citizens.\n  FDA Commissioner, Dr. Jane Henney, recently warned that the United \nStates demand for Canadian drugs could cause Canada to ``be used as a \nfront for counterfeit or contaminated products becoming available.''\n  Some Senators have said: Forget that; it is not going to happen. \nWell, I predict that it is going to happen. Commissioner Henney went on \nto emphasize: ``One has to be concerned about a safety issue here.''\n  Echoing Commissioner Henney's concerns, the former FDA Commissioner \nand current Dean of the Yale Medical School, Dr. David Kessler, warned \nlast year: ``with the rise of Internet pharmacies, the opportunities \nfor illicit distribution of adulterated and counterfeit products have \ngrown . . . Repealing the prohibition on reimportation of drugs would \nremove one of the principal statutory tools for dealing with this \ngrowing issue.''\n  Mr. President, current law has protected American consumers from the \nimportation of substandard, impotent, adulterated, contaminated, and \ncounterfeit pharmaceuticals--problems that have plagued many other \ncountries. There is simply no good reason to undermine the integrity of \nour pharmaceutical supply system and to expose American consumers to \ncorrupt middlemen and counterfeiters.\n  Foregoing the benefits of free markets and innovation for the false \npromise of cheaper, price-controlled drugs will lead not to improved \nhealth care but rather to a proliferation of unsafe and counterfeit \ndrugs, a reduction in incentives and investment to develop new life-\nsaving and life-improving medications; and ultimately, if this proposal \npasses, disastrous and fatal consequences for countless Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to join Senators Dorgan and \nJeffords in support of the prescription drug amendment being offered to \nthe Agriculture Appropriations bill currently pending before this body. \nI commend my colleagues for their steadfast commitment to addressing \nthis critically important issue. Like all of my colleagues, I deplore \nconditions that lead to Americans choosing between buying food for \ntheir family or medicine for their illnesses which is a choice that \nmillions of consumers in this country are forced to make every day. \nThis is a travesty and one that I am committed to put an end to.\n\n[[Page S7213]]\n\n  The discussion of prescription drug pricing, accessibility, \naffordability, and safety has been elevated to new heights in the last \nyear as we in Congress work to develop a practical and cost-effective \napproach to providing relief to combat escalating prescription drug \nprices for consumers throughout the United States.\n  Numerous studies have been conducted that highlight the price \ndifferentials existing between the United States, our neighbors to the \nNorth and South, and countries in the European Union. Several reports \nconfirm that pharmaceutical prices are substantially higher in the \nUnited States than other countries.\n  Consider how drug prices charged to Americans differ from the drug \nprices paid by people living in other areas of the world as reported \nfrom a study done by the PRIME Institute at the University of \nMinnesota.\n  The study found that if Americans pay an average of $1.00 for a \npharmaceutical product, that exact same product with the exact same \ndosage would have a much lower average cost in other industrialized \nnations. On average, that $1.00 product in the United States would cost \n.64 cents in Canada, .68 cents in Sweden, .65 cents in England, .71 \ncents in Germany, .57 cents in France, and .51 cents in Italy.\n  This amounts to price-gouging of Americans. It's wrong, and it has to \nstop.\n  So you ask, why don't Americans just buy it over the border and bring \nit back to the U.S.? Well, some individuals are being forced to take \nsuch drastic measures. South Dakota, though it does not share a border \nwith another country, has an increasing number of individuals willing \nto make the drive to either Mexico or Canada, knowing full well that \nthe savings are great enough to more than offset any expenses occurred \nin the process.\n  Presently, anecdotal evidence suggests that thousands of Americans \ncross the border to see a doctor and get their prescriptions filled for \n25-50% less in cost for many popular prescription drugs. Here are a \ncouple stories that have been shared with me over the last year:\n  A 72 year-old woman in Arlington, SD who spends $243 a month on \nprescription drugs wrote to me and said, ``The meds are so high in \nSouth Dakota. I try to get as much of them in Mexico as I can. I don't \nunderstand why there has to be such a difference in price.''\n  A 41-year-old man suffering from a disease that requires daily \nmedication at a cost of more than $400 per month wrote to me and said, \n``I want you to know that while I recognize that seniors are \nparticularly hurt by unfair prescription pricing due to their fixed \nincomes, other Americans also feel the pinch. The same medication that \nI take is available in Mexico at less than half the price that it costs \nme in the U.S. Unfortunately, I can not afford to travel to Mexico \nperiodically to obtain my prescription.''\n  Under current federal law, however, pharmaceutical companies are the \nonly ones allowed to import drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration into this country. Yet, if an American pharmacist or \ndistributor wants to purchase these FDA-approved drugs at the lower \nprices available in other countries and pass the savings along to their \ncustomers, they are prohibited by law from doing so.\n  On July 10, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed two \namendments to the Agriculture Appropriations bill that would allow \nwidespread importation of prescription drugs without any FDA oversight. \nThe overwhelming bipartisan support for these amendments clearly shows \nthat Congress no longer wants to deny American consumers access to FDA \napproved medications that are available in other countries at much \nlower prices. I support that position and, in fact, have sponsored \nlegislation introduced by my colleagues Senators Dorgan and Jeffords \nregarding international pricing disparities.\n  While I agree with the intent of the House action, I have concerns \nthat the House provisions do not include the safety mechanisms \nnecessary to ensure that only safe and effective FDA approved \nmedications cross our borders. Perhaps the number one concern mentioned \nin regard to the reimportation of prescription drugs is the safety of \nthe consumer. As with any product that passes through multiple \ndistribution channels, it is important that a baseline be established \nto ensure proper handling and storage. This is particularly crucial in \nmaintaining the therapeutic equivalence of prescription drugs.\n  The amendment we are offering today, which would amend federal law to \nallow pharmacists, distributors and licensed wholesalers to legally \nimport U.S. FDA approved prescription drugs, addresses this concern by \nimplementing assurances that any prescription drug reimported under \nthis proposal be manufactured, packaged, and labelled according to FDA \nstandards. It includes the essential safety provisions that will allow \nAmerican consumers to benefit from international price competition for \nprescription drugs in the safest manner possible.\n  Many pro-consumer groups such as Families USA, Public Citizen and the \nNational Community Pharmacists Association endorse this amendment \nsaying it is a positive step towards leveling the playing field for \nprescription drug prices and would save U.S. consumers billions of \ndollars by allowing the safe reimportation of American-made, FDA-\napproved prescription drugs.\n  Of course, the pharmaceutical industry presents many economic and \nproprietary rationales for price disparities. From price controls to \nR to currency exchange rates, arguments are made that the prices \ngarnered by some pharmaceutical companies are justified in a world \nwhere price is a measure of willingness to pay and price elasticity, \nnot compassion or empathy.\n  Industry representatives have stated it would be profoundly fatal to \nallow for the reimportation of pharmaceutical drugs from other \ncountries who purchase them at a much lower cost than our nation's \nsenior population as this will create instability in the world's \npharmaceutical markets. Personally, I can think of nothing more tragic \nthan charging Americans prices for prescription medications that cost \nfar more than the majority of Americans are able to pay without \nsacrificing one or more basic needs in their lives.\n  In my home state of South Dakota, I am conducting prescription drug \nmeetings where constituents are able to communicate their concerns \nregarding prescription drug prices and express their ability, or \nperhaps inability, to pay for therapeutic regiments prescribed by their \nphysician. Many of them ask, ``Why are citizens of other countries able \nto purchase their prescriptions at such lower prices?'' After all the \narguments I have heard from the industry on why this is the case, \nI have yet to hear an acceptable response that I could give.\n\n  Perhaps the most disturbing argument that I have heard in the past \nyear came from an industry representative during an Alliance for Health \nReform briefing last year. Our colleague, Senator Rockefeller, read a \nquestion from the crowd that asked why this individual's brother-in-law \ngot the same medication from the same U.S. manufacturer for a \nconsiderable amount less. What I heard in response was shocking. The \nfollowing quote is taken verbatim from the transcript of that briefing:\n\n       Price discrimination is an economic concept that merely \n     means different people in different markets are charged \n     different things. In this particular case, price \n     discrimination exists between the Canadian market and \n     American market, for lots of reasons: differences in medical \n     practice, how much of the product is sold, difference in \n     exchange rates, different kinds of patent protections, the \n     length and cost in time of distributing drugs and the \n     marketing of drugs, and differences in living standards.\n       [You] could have used Mexico as your example and would have \n     found that it is less than a third of the price potentially \n     and that's in large part because the standard of living is \n     substantially lower and they can afford so much less. Beyond \n     that, and the other income differences, there is the \n     difference in willingness to pay.\n\n  The idea that Americans are charged what they are because they are \nwilling to pay for it, is perhaps the most insensitive of all \narguments. Can you imagine measuring the value of someone's life by \nwhether or not they are willing to fill their prescription to control \ntheir cholesterol level or pay their rent? As well, the standard of \nliving that exists for most elderly in the United States is precisely \nthe reason\n\n[[Page S7214]]\n\nwhy we are having this hearing today. The simple fact is many seniors \nare not able to meet all of their basic needs and adhere to their \nprescription regiment. The number of South Dakotans who, due to their \nstandard of living, can not afford their prescription drugs suggests \nthat the pricing of pharmaceutical goes far beyond reasons based on \nstandard of living and willingness to pay otherwise South Dakotans \nwould have no problem affording their prescription drugs.\n  Mr. President, I am reminded of a popular fast food chain motto some \nyears back that proclaimed, ``Make a run for the border.'' Who would \nhave ever thought that we would be applying this same motto to the \ncitizens of our country with regard to their prescription drug needs.\n  The amendment before us is an appropriate response to the \ndiscriminatory pricing practices engaged in by much of the \npharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry, year after year, \nsits at the top of the Fortune Magazine list of most profitable \nindustries in the country. The latest report covering 1999 showed the \nindustry maintained top rankings from previous years: No. 1 in return \non revenues, No. 1 in return on assets, No. 1 in return on equity. And \nthe prices they charge to the uninsured in America remain the highest \nin the world.\n  For years, Americans have paid the price in more ways than just at \nthe pharmacy counter for the cost of their prescription drugs. Improper \nprescription drug usage results in thousands of deaths a year though \nthe exact number of seniors included in this number may never be known. \nHow many seniors skip a day's pill or cut them in half in order to \nstretch their prescription just one more day? I would argue that even \none is too many.\n  We are all working to address the concerns of not only our \nconstituents in our respective home states but for citizens across this \nnation that rely on prescription drugs for their health care needs. I \nbelieve that every Senator here today is deeply concerned about the \nrising out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs and hopefully we can \naddress many of these concerns here today with passage of this \namendment.\n  I am pleased to join Senators Dorgan and Jeffords in cosponsoring \nthis crucial amendment and urge all of my colleagues to support its \nimmediate passage.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of the sponsors of \nthis amendment.\n  As a Senator from a border State, I recognize the frustrations that \nhave brought us to this point.\n  American consumers must have access to safe, affordable prescription \ndrugs.\n  Mr. President, I intend to vote for this amendment because I believe \nwe must move this debate forward.\n  I know that many Americans are facing serious problems because of the \ncost of prescription drugs.\n  I hope this amendment will have some impact on the market forces and \nthat we will see some savings as a result.\n  But, Mr. President, while I will support this amendment, I do have \ntwo serious concerns.\n  First, we must be careful that we don't weaken the high safety \nstandards for drugs in this country.\n  And second, we should not think for a moment that passing this \namendment will mean we have helped senior citizens get access to the \ndrugs they need.\n  We still must pass a Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  I'm concerned that this amendment could draw attention away from the \nmuch larger issue of providing a prescription drug benefit through \nMedicare.\n  Mr. President, I've spent a lot of time working on this issue.\n  In fact, back in 1997--as a member of the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee--I examined the drug approval process so \nthat we could enact a responsible and balanced FDA reform bill.\n  The one lesson I took away from that process is that, while some of \nthe rules for drug approval in this country can be lengthy, they have \nbeen successful in ensuring that America's prescription drugs are safe \nand effective.\n  We've worked hard to ensure we have safe pharmaceuticals in this \ncountry, and I don't know any American who would accept anything less \nthan the safety we have today.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment does not guarantee that those standards \nwill remain as strong as they must be. That's because other countries \nhave lower standards.\n  In fact, a recent hearing in the House Commerce Committee clearly \nillustrated a number of lapses in safety inspection at facilities \noutside the United States.\n  I'm concerned that even with ``importation restrictions'' we can't be \nas confident as we should be of the manufacturing standards used \nabroad.\n  This amendment gives us no assurance about the conditions under which \nthe products were packaged, stored, handled, or shipped.\n  Consumers have no way to determine the potency of the individual \nunits.\n  We know there are these types of problems with imported drugs today, \nand I'm concerned that unless this amendment is implemented very \ncarefully, we could magnify those problems.\n  While I am pleased that the sponsors have made significant \nimprovements from the House-passed amendment on drug reimportation, I'm \nstill concerned that implementation could undermine our faith in the \nsafety of all prescription drugs.\n  Mr. President, I'm also concerned that there is no guarantee that \nconsumers would reap the benefits that are being suggested.\n  There is no requirement that the wholesaler or distributor pass the \nsavings on to consumers.\n  Today, each consumer today often pays a different price for a \nprescription drug depending upon whether or not they have insurance \ncoverage.\n  This amendment could simply enrich drug wholesalers at the expense of \nconsumers.\n  In fact, back in 1999 David Kessler, the former FDA Commissioner, \nmade this point regarding the effect on the consumer when he said:\n\n       . . . prices to ultimate consumers are generally not \n     lowered. . . . Rather, the profits go to the various \n     middlemen, here and abroad, while consumers bear the risk.\n\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that drug re-importation does not \nguarantee any savings for the consumer.\n  Mr. President, I have heard many of my colleagues talk about the need \nfor a prescription drug benefit for seniors to ensure affordable access \nto prescription drugs.\n  If any of my colleagues think this amendment will meet this \nobjective, they will be disappointed.\n  This amendment will simply not provide affordable, continuous, \ncomprehensive access to prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  A prescription drug benefit is not just something to be ``tacked-on'' \nto Medicare. It has to be a fundamental change in how we provide health \ncare to seniors and the disabled.\n  Today, prescription drugs are the doctor's office visits of 20 years \nago and that must be considered as we work on adding a prescription \ndrug benefit.\n  Mr. President, I do plan on supporting this amendment with the \nreservations I've mentioned.\n  I am hopeful that the regulatory process can address some of these \nrisks, and I believe this amendment will--at the least--address some of \nthe issues of fairness that have been raised.\n  I just hope that America's seniors are not fooled by this amendment.\n  No one should claim that--with this amendment--we have addressed the \nissue of prescription drug costs for seniors.\n  It is still a job we must undertake, and I hope that this amendment \nstrengthens--rather than weakens--the resolve of the Senate to provide \na prescription drug benefit through Medicare.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we have heard long arguments today about \nthe bill. I think there is general agreement, however, that if it is \nsafe and possible, we should allow our people in this country to be \nable to take advantage of international competition to bring the cost \nof pharmaceuticals down to a reasonable rate and to that which other \npeople in this world are able to receive.\n\n[[Page S7215]]\n\n  Keep in mind, that is what the goal is. Right now, the bill requires \nthe FDA to ``contain such additional safeguards as the Secretary may \nspecify in order to ensure the protection of the public health of \npatients in the United States.''\n  I would like to pose a question to the chairman on his amendment. The \namendment requires that the section may not operate unless it poses \n``no risk.'' Am I correct in assuming that the author's intent is that \nthere be ``no risk'' above that which prevails today?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, to respond to the question of the \ndistinguished Senator, I answer in the affirmative. Yes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I accept the amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, time has been used on this side.\n  Does the Senator yield back his time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nCochran amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(The UC is as follows: That all after the enacting clause of \nH.R. 4461 be stricken and the text of S. 2536 with a modified division \nB be inserted in lieu thereof, and that the new text be treated as \noriginal text for the purpose of further amendment, and that no point \nof order be waived.)\n  At the request of the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) the following \nstatement was ordered to be printed in the Record.\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, because of the sudden death of the \nformer mayor of Wilmington, Delaware, who was a close friend of mine, I \nhad to return to Delaware today directly after the funeral for Senator \nPastore. Consequently, I was necessarily absent for the roll-call votes \non Senate amendments No. 3925 and No. 3927 to the Agriculture \nAppropriations bill. Had I been present, I would have voted yes on both \namendments.\n  The high cost of pharmaceuticals in this country relative to the cost \nof the same drugs in nearby countries, such as Canada and Mexico, is a \nmajor irritant to many seniors struggling to make ends meet in the face \nof fixed incomes and high expenses for medications. Reimportation of \ndrugs from foreign countries, although it may lower prescription drug \ncosts for Americans, should not be permitted if it will jeopardize the \nhealth of this country's citizens. The potential effect of these \nprovisions to reduce pharmaceutical research and development in the \nU.S. is an unknown but important factor. The controversy over these \nprovisions serves to emphasize once again the need to expand Medicare \nto provide prescription drug insurance coverage for seniors and the \ndisabled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to join some of my fellow \nSenators in remembering the extraordinary life and service of our \nfriend and colleague, Paul Coverdell.\n  It is a somber day in the Senate Chamber, as we deal with this loss. \nPaul Coverdell served the people of Georgia with distinction for over \n30 years. His passing leaves a significant mark on the many lives he \nhas touched over his lifetime. On behalf of myself and my wife Annette, \nI offer my condolences to Paul's wife Nancy and his family.\n  Anyone who dealt with Paul Coverdell over the years came to respect \nhim. He was honest, loyal, and dedicated to public service. It was \nthese characteristics that Paul brought to the table every day in his \nlife. Paul's vision as a legislator and commitment to the principles \nand values for which he truly believed were demonstrated time after \ntime in this Chamber. His commitment to improving education in the U.S. \nsets a high standard for all public officials. His hard work in the \nRepublican leadership and his vision of a prosperous future for all \nAmericans deserves tremendous praise.\n  Personally, it was truly my privilege to know and work with Paul over \nthe years. We sat next to each other recently in the Senate, as can be \nseen.\n  He will be remembered as a dedicated American who gave much of his \nlife in service to his Nation. I offer my thoughts and prayers to those \nclose to Paul in this difficult time, especially to his family.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to deliver some remarks \nupon the death of our beloved colleague, Paul Coverdell.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that the whole Senate is in a state of \nshock that we no longer have Paul with us. Just last week, Senator \nCoverdell was among us on the Senate floor debating legislation, \nvisiting with us in the Cloakroom, speaking up in our weekly Republican \nconference. And now, only a short period later, he is no longer with \nus. To my knowledge, Paul never seemed to have had any health problems. \nHe certainly seemed fine last week.\n  My last remembrance of him is just how happy he was when we adjourned \non Friday afternoon after we passed that landmark legislation repealing \nthe death tax. I guess the fact that Paul is no longer with us reminds \nus all that we need to keep life in perspective.\n  I first met Senator Coverdell when I was first campaigning for the \nSenate 2 or 3 years ago. From that first time I met him, I came away \nwith a very powerful impression that he was a most sincere and decent \nand friendly person. In all my dealings with him in my year and a half \nin the Senate, that impression never changed. Paul was always in a \ngood, cheerful mood. He was always positive and upbeat. I never once \nsaw him raise his voice or get angry at anybody. He was unfailingly \npolite and courteous at all times and to everyone. He was the \nquintessential southern gentleman and a delight to know.\n  In the Senate, we debate issues of great moment to our country: war \nand peace, the economy, education policy. I guess it is sometimes the \nlittle, personal, seemingly inconsequential gestures of friendship that \none remembers. I used to sit next to Senator Coverdell every week in \nour Wednesday Republican luncheons. I got to know Paul that way, not \nonly as a colleague but as a person. Every week Paul would gently rib \nme for eating my main course before I ate my salad. Week after week he \nwould comment on that. I think finally he just concluded that that was \na peculiar habit of midwesterners.\n  I will always remember the smile and the twinkle in Paul Coverdell's \neyes, and I won't easily forget him or my friendship with him.\n  Paul, I am proud to have served with you. I am going to miss you. We \nare all going to miss you. You enriched this Senate, the State of \nGeorgia, and the whole country by your service. Our thoughts and \nprayers are with you and your wonderful wife Nancy and your family. May \nGod bless you and keep you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Illinois in \npaying tribute to our fallen colleague, Senator Paul Coverdell.\n  I have been in the Senate for 4 years and have worked with many \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. I agree completely with Senator \nFitzgerald: Senator Coverdell brought to this floor a certain dignity \nand demeanor to which we all aspire. He was a person of good humor. I \nthink it may be difficult for many people who follow the debates in the \nSenate to believe that a Democrat who believes very strongly in his \nparty and a Republican who believes very strongly can be engaged in a \nhot debate on the floor of the Senate and then, as soon as the debate \nis over, meet each other in the corridor or the well or at another time \nand be friends. That was the case with Paul Coverdell.\n\n[[Page S7217]]\n\n  We disagreed on many issues, but I never found him to be lacking a \nsmile and always looking for some common ground where we might come \ntogether. The last conversation I had with him several weeks ago, he \nwalked all the way across the floor to the Democratic side of the aisle \nand came right up to me. I was wondering what this could be.\n  He said: I need your help.\n  I said: What is it, Paul?\n  He said: I want to try to secure a gold medal for Ronald and Nancy \nReagan; will you help me?\n  I know he was from Illinois. I said: Of course, I will.\n  I signed onto it. That is the kind of person he was. As different as \nwe might be politically, he was always trying to reach out and find \nsome common ground. I think when we get caught up so much in the \npolitical debate and the furor here, we  forget many times how \nimportant it is to have a person such as Paul Coverdell here to remind \nus time and again that after the debates are finished, we are all \nbasically human beings trying to do our very best in the Senate.\n\n  I agree with my colleague from Illinois: It is hard to imagine that \nonly a few days ago he was standing in the well and smiling and walking \naround as he always did as a member of the Republican leadership team \nand then stricken on Sunday, operated on on Monday and passed away. It \nis a sad day for the Senate.\n  I have noted, interestingly enough, today, as many of my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle have come to the microphone, some have known \nPaul Coverdell for a long time. Some have known him in many different \nroles in life, some for a very short time. Everyone from both sides has \na very positive take on what Paul Coverdell meant to each of us and \nmeant to this institution.\n  It is a great loss, not only for the Senate but for the State of \nGeorgia and for the Nation which he served in so many different ways so \nwell.\n  I extend my sympathies to his wife Nancy and all his family and \nfriends in this moment of grief. The Senate has lost a fine Senator. I \nam honored to have called him a friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues to pay tribute \nto Paul Coverdell. I have listened to a lot of tributes today. There \nhave been so many themes, including cheerfulness, optimism, a welcome \nhand, no rancor, no bitterness. We all know that to be Paul Coverdell. \nI want that to mention one incident which, for me, encapsulates it all. \nIt is going to be the incident that is defining for me. Whenever I \nthink of Paul, I will always think of this incident, and I always will.\n  This outfit--the Senate--tends to be a little partisan. Over the \nyears, it has become too partisan, almost as two armed camps, one over \nthere and one over here. It is regrettable, but that is something that \nhas occurred and evolved up here in the Senate.\n  Not too many years ago, I was in Atlanta, GA, speaking at an event. I \nneglected, as is a common courtesy, to tell Senator Coverdell I was \nthere. Sam Nunn was a Senator at the time. I didn't tell Paul I was \nhaving an event in Georgia, his home State. I felt kind of bad about \nit. But like a lot of us, I kind of pushed it to the side and \nrationalized that it was not that important.\n  Lo and behold, at that same hotel, Paul was speaking about three or \nfour rooms away, and I heard about it. I said to myself: Oh, my gosh, \nMax, how stupid you are; why didn't you tell him? How guilty I felt. \nOh, my gosh, here I am in Paul's home State and he doesn't even know I \nam here. I am in his State and he is just down the hall. I thought: You \nblew it, Max.\n  When I finished, I was walking out in the hall and Paul happened to \nbe coming up. He bounced up to me and said, ``Hey, Max, how are you? \nWelcome to Georgia. I hope you're having a good time.''\n  That was Paul--positive, upbeat, cheerful, with a smile and a good \nattitude and a gleam in his eye. That made me feel even smaller and \nmore guilty, but it made me feel even better about Paul. That is the \nPaul Coverdell I will always remember.\n  Mr. President, Wanda and I send our deepest sympathies to Nancy and \nthe family. Life is fickle, unpredictable. There but for the grace of \nGod go any of us. People with the personal qualities of Paul Coverdell \nare the ones we will treasure here. I know the people of Georgia will \ntreasure the same qualities in Paul Coverdell. He was a great man.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed as in morning business for 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join with all of my colleagues today in \npraising the life and celebrating the life and grieving the loss of \nPaul Coverdell. He was a friend and someone whom I trusted. I think we \nall trust each other here because we are family. But I had a special \nfondness and a special trust for Paul Coverdell. He was a man of \ntremendous integrity, directness, and modesty.\n  There are many instances over our time period together that come to \nmind. But one in particular is perhaps the most recent one. I had a \nmatter that was of great personal concern to me. It was an issue where \nhe and I differed philosophically but where I needed his help in order \nto get my position heard. He agreed it should be heard, even though he \ndisagreed with it. I went to him and asked him whether or not he might \nassist me in that process, and he said, ``Carl, I don't agree with you \non this issue, but this is a matter of great import for this country \nand your views clearly should be considered by the decisionmaker here. \nI am going to do everything I can to make sure that in fact those views \nare considered.''\n  That said a lot about this man and about this place. Although we \ndisagreed on an issue, he believed that the principle of having both \nsides heard was more important than the specifics of the issue. His \nintegrity was indisputable and undoubted. We came to rely on him in so \nmany ways. His background made him particularly able to make a special \ncontribution to this Senate. He had great skills as a legislative \ncraftsman and tactician. He, of course, had a wonderful background in \nthe Peace Corps, and there were so many other ways he was able to \ncontribute as a very special force in the deliberations on this floor.\n  Paul Coverdell rose to leadership in a very short period of time, \nwhich reflected the deep respect and regard that he had among his \nRepublican colleagues. That special affection and regard was matched on \nthis side of the aisle. The death of this very fine and gentle man is a \nterrible loss to the people of Georgia. I consider it to be a great \nloss to the people of Michigan and all of America, and a great personal \nloss to me as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments by my friend \nand colleague from Michigan regarding the death of our friend and \ncolleague, Paul Coverdell.\n  Yesterday was a very, very sad day for the Senate. I was at this desk \nwhen the majority leader announced that Paul Coverdell passed away at \n6:10 yesterday. Majority Leader Trent Lott was a very close friend of \nPaul, as was I and many other Senators. This is a tough, trying time \nbecause we lost a very good friend and an outstanding Senator. It is \nsad to see the vacant chair right behind me that Paul Coverdell sat in. \nIt demonstrates an enormous void his death leaves behind here in our \nbody.\n  I had the pleasure of getting to know Paul Coverdell for the last 8 \nyears. He did an outstanding job. Paul Coverdell was the type of \nSenator who would do any work assigned, and often times, work not \nassigned. He was the type of Senator who could enlighten the room, the \ntype who could work with all Members and make things happen. He was the \ntype of person who would be willing to take on tough tasks and always \nsay yes, and\n\n[[Page S7218]]\n\ntake them across the finish line. He was the kind of person you would \nwant to have on your team at all times.\n  Paul was the kind of person who really added a lot to this \ninstitution. It makes me proud to say he was my colleague. He \ncontributed so much in so many ways. His death is an almost unspeakable \nloss for us, for the State of Georgia, and for the country.\n  He showed great leadership on a lot of issues, with a hallmark brand \nof analysis and execution that identified a challenge for our \nconference, pulled out all the views among our colleagues, and built \nconsensus and success to the betterment of not just our party, but our \ncountry. For example, take primary and secondary education--something \noverlooked for many years. He focused on that in the last few years, \nand headed up a task force that cut across committee lines, seniority \nlines, and philosophical lines, to bring us together. He wanted us to \ndo positive things to improve education across the nation. He \nsuccessfully blended our different viewpoints together, and together we \npainted a vision on education that not only do many Americans support, \nbut holds out real hope for change and improvement when it comes to \neducating our kids for the challenges of the 21st century. Further, \nmany elements of his efforts brought along our colleagues across the \naisle.\n  Or, take our war on drugs. Senator Coverdell has worked hard with \ncolleagues to address this challenge, here in the United States, and \nwith the House and the administration to carry the fight overseas. In \nwaging those battles, we came to realize that he was intense, he was \nserious, dedicated, and sincere. He was also successful, and many \nfamilies today and in the future should be gratified in his success.\n  And these are just a few examples of the many areas where Paul placed \nhis tremendous energies. He was so involved in so many different \nissues, I even teased him last year. I said, ``We are enacting all \nCoverdell legislation, all the time'' because he had his name and \nfingerprints all over so many things were doing, because he was so \nproactive in trying to come up with positive solutions to challenging \nproblems in education, or fighting the war on drugs here and overseas, \nor spending the country's money wisely, or returning the tax surplus to \nthe people.\n  Paul also didn't hesitate to join us in standing up on behalf of the \nConstitution, our system of checks and balances, of keeping the order \nwe stand to defend. From the beginning to the end of his time in the \nSenate, rarely a day went by when he did not cast a thoughtful eye on \nthe activism and activities of the executive, cognizant of the vision \nof our Founders who believed in a limited central government.\n  When you got to know him, you would discover that he had a real \nintensity, a keen curiosity to learn, understand, grapple with issues \ngreat and small. And he had such a great, congenial working spirit that \nmade all of us better, that built us all up. His personality was \ninfectious, his energy was admirable, his thoughtfulness was \nconsiderable, and his friendship was valuable.\n  We want to let Paul's wife Nancy know that she is very much in our \nthoughts and prayers. We are comforted by the fact and have great \nconfidence in the fact that Paul Coverdell now resides in a wonderful \nmansion, eternally. Our sympathies and prayers go with Nancy, and to \nthe Coverdell family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nhis comments. We celebrate the wonderful life of Paul Coverdell. I have \na heavy heart, and I miss him. He was a great Senator. He contributed \nto this Nation in extraordinary ways.\n  He was a good friend to me, and a good friend to many others.\n  Yes, he was modest, self-effacing, encouraging, positive, and \nunifying--all of those things. But he was a courageous and positive \nleader for values that this Nation holds dear. He advocated them with \nsuch a winsome and effective way. We will miss him. I will miss him.\n  I say to the family and to Nancy particularly how sorry we are, and I \nexpress my sympathy. Maybe next week I will be better able to express \nmy admiration and feelings for Paul Coverdell. I feel his loss deeply. \nSo many of us do. I wanted to share those thoughts at this time.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday the Senate passed legislation \nproviding tax relief for married couples. We passed a bill that \nbasically eliminates the marriage penalty tax for most married couples. \nThe cost of the bill was $55.6 billion over 5 years and over ten years. \nThe cost of the bill was incorrectly reported in several newspapers \ndespite the fact that on the floor of the Senate and in a press \nconference later, we stated clearly that the bill that we passed was a \n5-year bill, and the cost of the bill was estimated by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation to be $56 billion. You wouldn't know that if you \nread the New York Times.\n  In today's paper: ``Senate Approves Tax Cut To Help Married Couples. \nClinton Threatens Veto.'' That much is correct, but the next line says, \n``$248 billion measure would aid even those who do not pay marriage \npenalty.'' I\n\n[[Page S7219]]\n\ndispute that claim, because it is absolutely false. The $248 billion \ncost they attribute to our bill is false. It is not correct.\n\n  In the article, the second paragraph says the vote was 61-38; eight \nDemocrats joined Republicans to approve the measure which would reduce \nincome taxes for nearly all married couples by a total of $248 billion \nover 10 years.\n  The facts are, the bill that we passed was $56 billion over the next \n5 years and the next 10 years. Maybe some people didn't know that. \nMaybe if some Senators knew that they would have voted differently. I \ndon't know. I want accuracy. I want people to know the facts.\n  The Washington Post had an article as well, and it had a chart that \nbothers me. The Washington Post headline said the ``Senate Votes \n``Marriage Penalty' Relief.'' That statement is true. Then it says, GOP \ncontinues tax cutting drive and the President threatens to veto it. It \ntalks of the bill being $248 billion and included a chart from the \nCitizens for Tax Justice. The chart asks the question: Who would \nbenefit? It says the benefit for couples who make between $50,000 and \n$75,000 is $344. That is not correct.\n  The Citizens for Tax Justice has a reputation of being quite a \nliberal group. Regardless, they are entitled to their own opinion, but \nthey are not entitled to their own facts. I want my colleagues and the \nAmerican people to know what the facts are. Under the Senate-passed \nbill, people who have taxable incomes from zero to $43,000 could get a \nmaximum tax benefit from earned income credit changes of $527, and a \nmaximum tax benefit from the standard deduction adjustment of $218, for \na total maximum tax cut of $745. For couples with taxable income \nbetween $43,000 and $52,500, they also have a standard deduction tax \ncut worth $218, and because of changes to the 15 percent income tax \nbracket they could also get a maximum tax cut of $1,125, for total \nmaximum tax relief for married couples earning up to $52,500 of $1,342. \nThese are facts about the bill we passed.\n  The Washington Post chart says people who make $40,000 to $50,000 \nhave tax relief of $148. I believe the facts are that it could be as \nmuch as $1,342. There is a big difference.\n  Citizens for Tax Justice happens to be wrong. I don't know if they \nare using some unreasonable type of income classification that greatly \ninflates income so that everyone seems rich. That's what the Clinton \nadministration does when it wants to attack our tax cuts. I don't know \nwhat they are doing. It bothers me. Maybe it shouldn't. Maybe I am a \nstickler for facts. We should stick to the facts.\n  We passed a tax bill yesterday that I believe will become law. If the \nPresident will sign it, married couples with taxable income of $52,500 \nwill get $1,342 worth of tax relief. That is a fairly significant tax \ncut. For the local paper the next day to say that couples making \nbetween $40,000 and $50,000 get $148 is wrong, way wrong. It is $1,000 \noff.\n  The Washington Post tries to imply that the real benefits of this tax \ncut go to people making $200,000 or more. That is not the case, either. \nI will have printed in the Record a table for the information of our \ncolleagues and the information of the press, if they happen to be \ninterested in what we passed. This table shows the maximum tax benefit \nthat anyone would receive under our bill by provision and by taxable \nincome. A couple with taxable income of approximately $127,000 gets the \nmaximum benefit, which is $2,165. People who made over $127,000 get \nless, and that amount would be $1,759.\n  One might say, why? The difference is because they lose the standard \ndeduction. Under the law that passed in 1990, they lost a standard \ndeduction after their income is above a certain level. We didn't change \nthat. Maybe we should have, but we didn't.\n  Citizens for Tax Justice says, and the Washington Post says, people \nmaking over $200,000 get a much bigger benefit. They missed it by a \nmile. They imply that those over $200,000 get more of a benefit than \nthose with income between $75,000 and $100,000. They missed it again. \nThey are wrong. Factually incorrect. They ought to know better. If they \nare going to put this information in one of the largest newspapers in \nthe country, they ought to do a better job and let the American people \nknow what we voted on. Then maybe they can make the appropriate \njudgment: Was this a good bill or a bad bill?\n\n  I happen to think it is a good bill. I am delighted we had 61 votes. \nI wish we would have had 99 votes. Unfortunately, we didn't. I hope the \nPresident will sign this bill. He should sign this bill. I will predict \nhe will sign the bill.\n  We are working in conference and we will come out with a bill that \nwill be between the House bill and the Senate bill. The House passed \npermanent marriage tax relief that cost $180 billion over 10 years. The \nSenate bill was sunset at 5 years, and cost $56 billion over 5 years \nand 10 years. We are very close to working out a compromise somewhere \nbetween the House and the Senate. We will make that announcement \nprobably at some point tomorrow.\n  I urge the President: Do not just issue veto threats; provide tax \nrelief for American families. The President can help eliminate the \nmarriage penalty by signing this bill. He should sign this bill. This \nbill will provide tax relief in the neighborhood of $1,300 for married \ncouples making up to $52,000. He should sign that bill and give them \ntax relief.\n  I also urge the media to look at their reports. They are distorted. \nIn the case of the chart in the Washington Post, it is totally, \nfactually incorrect.\n  When we announce our conference agreement tomorrow, I hope people \ntake another look at it and see that it is fair tax relief that should \nbecome law. My prediction is it will become law. My prediction is the \nPresident will sign it. If not, I hope there will be an overwhelming \nvote in the House and the Senate to override his veto.\n  I believe in accuracy. We should have accuracy in reporting. We, in \nthe Senate, should be accurate when we present our case. I don't think \nit is necessary to embellish one's case by using inaccurate statements \nor inaccurate figures.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \nchart included in the Washington Post, a table of the revenue impact of \nthe Senate bill, and also a table that I have assembled showing the \nmaximum tax benefit under the Senate bill by taxable income.\n  If the Washington Post wants some help, maybe they should take a look \nat this information. It might be more informative for their readers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have all three printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               MAXIMUM MARRIAGE PENALTY BENEFIT POSSIBLE BY PROVISION AND BY TAXABLE INCOME GROUP\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               Maximum benefit possible by provision\n                                 ----------------------------------------------------------------\n         Taxable Income                              Standard                                        Total \\1\\\n                                        EIC          deduction      15% bracket     28% bracket\n                                                  adjustment \\1\\    adjustment      adjustment\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n$0 to $43,850...................             527             218               0               0             745\n$43,850 to $52,500..............               0             218           1,125               0           1,342\n$52,500 to $127,200.............               0             406           1,125             635           2,165\n$127,200 to $161,450............               0               0           1,125             635           1,759\n$161,450 to $288,350............               0               0           1,125             635           1,759\n$288,350 and over...............               0               0           1,125             635          1,759\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Taxpayers who itemize deductions, and those taxpayers above the deduction phase-out threshold would receive\n  no benefit from the standard deduction adjustment.\n \nNote: Staff estimates based on year 2000 tax parameters--Provided by Senator Don Nickles, 07/19/2000.\n\n\n[[Page S7220]]\n\n\n        ESTIMATED REVENUE EFFECTS OF A MODIFICATION TO THE CHAIRMAN'S MARK OF THE ``MARRIAGE TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2000''--SCHEDULED FOR MARKUP BY THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE ON MARCH 30, 2000\n                                                                        [Fiscal years 2001-2010, by billions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                Provision                            Effective              2001      2002      2003      2004      2005      2006      2007      2008      2009      2010     2001-05   2001-10\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. $2,500 increase to the beginning and   tyba 12/31/00.................

The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 20 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I just listened carefully to my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma correcting the press, and of course I would join him on \nmany days in that effort. As a public figure, I am often quoted enough \nand read things that I think are a little bit different than what I \nbelieve are the facts. I would say in this instance perhaps his \ncharacterization of the information presented by the Washington Post at \nleast deserves to be discussed for a moment. He made reference to the \nCitizens for Tax Justice, a group with which I have worked. He referred \nto them as, I believe, a left wing or left leaning group. His \ncharacterization is his own and he is entitled to it. But I suggest to \nthe Senator from Oklahoma and to anyone who is following this matter, \nwhen we assess how much it will cost for the so-called marriage penalty \ntax relief, we usually make assessments on a 10-year basis. Though the \nbill may say 5 years, it really strains credulity to suggest at the end \nof 5 years we are going to reimpose the tax once we have taken it off.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I just inform my colleague from Illinois, I had printed \nin the Record the joint tax statement that had the 5-year cost at $56 \nbillion and had the 10-year cost at $56 billion, my point being we \nought to be accurate. For some people to imply the bill we passed was \n$248 is factually incorrect.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I want to show a chart \nto the Senator from Oklahoma, and anyone else following this, that was \nnot prepared by Citizens for Tax Justice. It was prepared by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation which is an official body that works for the U.S. \nCongress. It is bipartisan, as I understand it. They were asked to try \nto determine how much tax relief of the marriage penalty tax relief \nbill proposed by the Republicans would be going to certain income \ngroups in America. It is starkly different than what the Senator from \nOklahoma has said.\n\n  If he will take a look at the comparison between the Democratic plan \nin yellow and the Republican plan in red, he will see different income \ncategories. There is a substantial difference in the tax relief \navailable. In the lower income categories, we find substantial relief \navailable for those making $20,000 a year--under the Democratic plan \nabout $2,000; under the Republican plan about $500. At $30,000, it is \nsubstantial help--about $4,000 under the Democratic plan; about $800 \nunder the Republican; At $50,000 a year in income, $1,900 in tax relief \non the Democrat plan, $240 on the Republican.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. When I finish, I will be happy to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I don't have all day. I need to run, but I would like to \nmake a comment. I don't know where the Senator got his chart, but I am \ntelling him that factually any couple that made $52,000 under the bill \nwe passed yesterday, the Republican bill, with 8 or 9 Democrats who \nvoted with you, would get tax relief exactly--exactly as I announced on \nthe floor or I will eat the paper. It is $1,125, plus $212, and that is \n1,300 and some odd dollars, not $300. So the Senator's chart is \nfactually incorrect.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for his comments. I thanked him \nbefore leaving. I don't want him to take this paper with him for this \ndinner hour, but I will stand by the comments of the Joint Committee on \nTaxation. This is not a political group, not a partisan group. It is a \ngroup authorized by Congress to make these evaluations. The Senator \nfrom Oklahoma is entitled to his opinion. I am going to stick with the \nfacts given to me by an organization we rely on all the time.\n  If I can finish the presentation, though, you note when we get to the \nhighest income categories, the Democratic bill does not provide relief \nunder the so-called marriage penalty tax relief, and the Republican \nplan does, about $1,000 of tax relief for people making $250,000 a \nyear.\n  The important thing to keep in mind, too, in putting this in \nperspective, is not too many years ago we were laboring with a national \ndeficit and worries about how we were going to pay it off and balance \nour books. Some suggested we needed a constitutional amendment, a \ndramatic revision in the budgetary policy here in Congress.\n  There are many of us who believe there is another way to do it, with \nsound fiscal policy and leadership, not only in the White House but \nalso in Congress. With the leadership of President Clinton and Vice \nPresident Gore, we now find ourselves talking about spending surpluses.\n  I would like to speak for a moment about the tax bills we have \nconsidered over the last 2 weeks, but before I do that, I would like to \nyield to my colleague from the State of Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate that very much. I am sorry my friend from \nOklahoma is not here. I have here from the Joint Committee on Taxation, \n``Estimated Revenue Effects of Modification to the Chairman's Mark of \nthe Marriage Tax Relief Act of 2000.'' This we received from the Joint \nCommittee. It says the net total impact of this tax over a 10-year \nperiod is $247.8 billion.\n\n[[Page S7221]]\n\n  Is that what the Senator from Illinois was saying as I walked into \nthe Chamber?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is exactly my point. Before he rushed off for \ndinner, the Senator from Oklahoma suggested if that was the case, he \nwould eat the paper. I suggest my friend from Nevada save that. Perhaps \nwe can send it along for lunch tomorrow for my colleague because I \nstand by that estimate. I have no reason to believe it is not true. For \nhim to suggest the cost of this program is $56 billion whether it is 5 \nyears in length or 10 years in length really does not square with my \nunderstanding.\n  It certainly is going to cost us taxpayers more over a 10-year period \nof time than it did over a 5-year period of time. I believe that is \nwhat the Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us.\n  Mr. REID. If I could ask my friend one more question, this is not a \nquestion of the Democrats being opposed to the marriage penalty tax \nrelief; is that true?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is true. In fact, what we have done is present a \nproposal that says if you are in a situation where two wage earners get \nmarried and their joint income raises them to a higher tax rate, we \nprotect them. Basically, we voted, if I am not mistaken, to say to \nthose taxpayers: Take your pick. You can file a joint return. You can \nfile a single return. We have a proposal that will protect you from \nbeing penalized for your marriage. The Republicans, unfortunately, go \none step beyond solving the problem and create a problem. They create a \nproblem because they not only remove what they consider to be the \nmarriage penalty, although their approach is only half hearted--they \nprovide a marriage bonus. In other words, those couples who get married \nand don't pay higher taxes because of combined joint income receive a \ntax break under the Republican plan. So it goes far beyond solving the \nadditional problem that was identified. It creates a new problem \nbecause it creates a new expense, a new drain on the Treasury, a new \nexpenditure of our surplus.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, also in the form of a question, I hope \nthat he has the opportunity to finish his description here of what the \ndifference is between the two approaches. I also say to my friend, this \nissue is not over. People can yell and scream and declare victory, but \nin our Government, I think the Senator would agree, we have something \ncalled the Constitution. This tiny little document here establishes \nthree separate but equal branches of Government. One of those branches \nof Government is called the executive branch. He is going to veto this \nand then it is going to come back. Then the legislative branch is going \nto sustain that veto.\n  Then they will have an opportunity, if they in good faith want to do \nsomething to help remove this marriage penalty tax, to work with the \nadministration and the Democrats and come up with a compromise that \nwould give true marriage penalty tax relief. In fact, what it would do \nis, instead of taking away three of the references where there is a \npenalty in our Tax Code, it would take care of all 67. Am I right, I \nsay to my friend from Illinois?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Nevada is correct. What the Republicans \nsuggest is they end the marriage penalty. We know there are somewhere \nbetween 62 and 67 provisions in the Tax Code that penalize a couple \nwhen they are married and have a higher joint income. We on the \nDemocratic side address every single one of those penalties and remove \nthem for those who are truly penalized. The Republicans, unfortunately, \nonly addressed three of them. They leave all the other taxes on this \nmarried couple. So they not only don't solve the problem, they create a \nnew problem by taking the surplus away for people who are not being \nprejudiced by being married, and they don't address it in a \ncomprehensive way.\n\n  President Clinton should veto this bill, and in vetoing it send it \nback to Congress and say if it is your goal to eliminate the marriage \npenalty, do it in an honest way; do it in a complete way. What we had \nbefore us yesterday was very incomplete and, I am afraid, not a very \ndirect way of dealing with this problem.\n  Take a look, if you will, at the impact of the Republican marriage \npenalty tax cut by income because I am going to return to this theme in \njust a moment. If you take a look at who will benefit from the \nRepublican tax relief plan, you will find that, as usual, those who are \nin the richest fifth, top 20 percent of wage earners in America, \nreceive 78.3 percent of all benefits under this Republican tax relief. \nIn fact, the top 5 percent of wage earners receive 25.7 percent of all \nof this tax relief. This, unfortunately, has become a recurring theme \nwhen the issue of tax relief comes before the Republican-controlled \nSenate. Time and again they believe the people who are best off in this \ncountry, the people who are doing well, are the ones who need a helping \nhand.\n  Many of us come from States and communities where the folks who are \nmaking a lot of money are doing very well. They are very comfortable. \nThey have had a very profitable time for the last 7 or 8 years of the \nClinton administration. We have seen dramatic increases in the Dow \nJones, the NASDAQ. When President Clinton was sworn into office as \nPresident, the Dow Jones was about 3,000 or 3,300. Today it is over \n10,000. The value of those stocks has more than tripled. In the same \nperiod of time, the NASDAQ indicators went up from about 800 when the \nPresident was sworn in to around 5,000 today.\n  There is a suggestion there for everyone that if you happen to be \ninvested with savings accounts and retirement accounts in the stock \nmarket, you have had a pretty good time of it over the last 7 or 8 \nyears. I am glad that has happened, and I am happy for all the families \nwho profited and businesses and retirement funds that have seen better \ntimes because of this improvement.\n  It strikes me as strange, if not odd, that when we talk about tax \nrelief then, the Republicans seem to want to focus on the people who \nhave really done the very best in income and net worth over the last 10 \nyears.\n  Take a look at this chart of Republican tax breaks under both the \nestate tax reform and the marriage tax penalty reform, and you will \nfind again a dramatic difference in the money that is available. For \nthose in the lowest 20 percent--these are people making the minimum \nwage or slightly more--the Republican idea of tax relief turns out to \nbe $24 a year in reduced taxes, about $2 a month.\n  Now go up to the top 1 percent, people making over $300,000 a year, \nand the Republican idea of tax relief is $23,000, almost $2,000 a \nmonth. I suggest that anyone making $300,000--which, if my quick \ncalculations are correct, comes out to about $25,000 a month in \nincome--may not notice $2,000 a month. I guarantee the people at the \nlowest end who are struggling at minimum wage jobs are not going to \nnotice $2 a month.\n  It is far more important for us, when we talk about real tax relief, \nto keep our eyes on those in the lower- and middle-income groups who \nare struggling mightily to do well in this economy. They have had some \nhelp. The economy is doing well, but they could use some tax relief, \nand if we are going to take the surplus of the United States and give \nit to families across America, should we start at the top? Should we \nstart with the wealthiest or should we start basically with the lower- \nand middle-income families who really need it?\n  Take a look at this chart, too. This chart summarizes it. It shows \nthe Republican tax plans we have debated over the last 2 weeks, and the \nimpact it has, as I described on previous charts. The top 1 percent of \npeople making over $319,000 a year, people with an average income of \n$915,000, receive a $23,000 tax break, which represents 43 percent of \nall of the tax relief that was included in those bills. We are taking \nthe surplus generated in our economy for tax relief and 43 percent of \nit goes to people who have an average income of $915,000 a year.\n  There is a better way to do it. I hope the President vetoes the \nestate tax bill and the marriage tax penalty bill suggested by the \nRepublicans because these bills are fundamentally unfair. That we would \ngive tax breaks to the wealthiest among us and ignore families who work \nhard every single day is not fair.\n  If we are going to start a line of people most deserving of \nassistance in\n\n[[Page S7222]]\n\nAmerica, I hardly believe we should start that line with Donald Trump \nand Bill Gates and folks who are making millions and millions of \ndollars. Better yet, let us try to bring to the front of that line \nthose who are struggling every single day with the basic challenges \nthat American families face.\n  Tax cuts should be directed. First and foremost, we need a \nprescription drug benefit. We just had an interesting debate. \nPharmaceutical companies cannot be too happy with this debate because \nwe said on a bipartisan basis that we are so upset with drug pricing in \nAmerica that we are now going to allow companies, pharmacists, and \ndistributors to import drugs from overseas at lower prices so they can \nsell them to Americans. These are drugs that are basically made and \ninspected in America, sent to foreign countries, and sold at a fraction \nof the price.\n\n  It happens in Canada. It happens in Europe. It happens in Mexico. We \nall know the story. People are getting in buses in some States and \ndriving across the border to Canada to buy American drugs at a fraction \nof the cost.\n  The Senate said there has to be a better way. Absent addressing this \nproblem of pricing drugs head on, we are going to allow the \nreimportation of these American drugs that have been made in inspected \nlaboratories into the United States so that they can be sold to \nAmericans at a reduced cost. I guess it is obvious from this vote that \nwe know families are suffering because of drug prices, and yet before \nwe have enacted any kind of a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, \nthe Republicans have insisted we spend half of our anticipated surplus \nin tax breaks for the wealthiest in America.\n  It makes more sense to me to create a prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare, a universal guaranteed drug benefit accessible to every \nAmerican who chooses to be part of it, one that allows a doctor to \nprescribe a drug that a person needs to stay strong and healthy in \ntheir home for as long as they want to be and be able to pay for the \ndrug.\n  I have seen cases in Illinois and certainly in hearings across the \ncountry and in this city have heard from people who are struggling to \npay for prescription drugs. That is the highest priority we should deal \nwith, and we should do it before we break for the August conventions so \nthat both parties can go to their conventions and say: We did something \nfor the families across America. For those who are concerned about the \nelderly and disabled who are stuck with high drug prices, we did \nsomething for fathers and grandfathers, mothers and grandmothers, who \nreally cannot afford the drugs their doctors prescribe.\n  We did not do that. Instead, we decided people with an average income \nof $915,000 a year need an additional $23,000 in tax breaks from the \nRepublicans. I will bet a nickel there is not a person making $915,000 \na year who cannot afford prescription drugs. These people know how to \npay for virtually everything if they are making that much money, and we \ngave them more money.\n  Before we directed our attention to those who were struggling to get \nby on fixed incomes--people on Social Security taking home a check of \n$800 or $1,200 a month looking at drug bills of $200, $500, $600--we \nlearned from a public hearing in Chicago of a woman who had gone \nthrough a double lung transplant. It was a miracle she stood there \nbefore us and looked very healthy. Years after that transplant, she \nstill worried because she needed to take immunosuppressant drugs that \ncost over $2,000 a month. There was no way on her fixed income she \ncould afford it.\n  Frankly, if she stopped taking them, she could have irreversible lung \ndamage. She faced that prospect, she made that decision, she stopped \ntaking the drugs for a period of months because she could not afford \nthem, and did face irreversible lung damage. She got back on the \nwelfare rolls long enough to resume prescriptions and living month to \nmonth trying to afford the drug she needed to stay alive. That is \na real story of a person whose income is little more than $12,000 a \nyear who literally worries from month to month as to whether or not \nthey will be able to buy the drugs to keep them alive.\n\n  Did we remember that lady when we talked about tax relief here? No. \nWe focused 43 percent of our attention and 43 percent of our surplus on \npeople making over $300,000 a year, people making $915,000 average \nincome. For those in the category above them, $130,000 to $319,000, we \ngave them another 14 percent of the surplus as well.\n  There is another group we forget, and when we had an opportunity to \nvote for an amendment, unfortunately, we could not muster a majority to \nsupport them: families who are paying for college education expenses \nfor their kids.\n  We believe--the Clinton administration and Democrats believe--that \nfamilies who want to put their kids through school should be able to \ndeduct their college education expenses up to $12,000. It means a \nhelping hand from the Government in the range of $3,000 a year. Most \nfamilies would welcome that so they could pay the tuition expenses and \nthe room and board for the kids who finally are accepted at good \ncolleges and universities. It is a strain for a lot of families, and a \nlot of kids go deeply into debt to pay for college.\n  We believe tax relief should be directed to those families so they \ncan send their kids to college. We brought it up for a vote, and it was \nrejected by the Republican side. That is not their idea of tax relief. \nTheir idea of tax relief is $23,000 a year in tax breaks for people \nmaking over $900,000 a year.\n  We wanted to address another problem. What about day care? So many \nworking families worry about where their kids are going to be during \nthe course of a day--whether they will be in a place that is safe, \nclean, and healthy, someplace where a child might have a chance to \nlearn--and they struggle to find that place they can afford. Day care \nis a real human, family problem. We came up with a proposal to increase \nthe credit that a family can claim for the cost of day care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, that was rejected as well. The idea of \nhelping families through the Tax Code to pay for day care was rejected.\n  I can tell you with no doubt in my mind, with an absolute degree of \ncertainty, that if you are making $915,000 a year, you probably do not \nworry too much about the weekly day care costs, but that is the group \nthe Republican majority decided needed help, not the working family, \nstruggling to find a safe, clean, affordable day-care center for their \nkids. No.\n\n  The group making over $900,000 a year will get $23,000 in tax breaks \nfrom the proposals on the Republican side of the aisle.\n  This list includes an effort by the Democratic side to provide tax \ncredits to businesses offering health insurance to their employees. You \nknow as well as I do that 40 million Americans do not have health \ninsurance. We believe the best way to help them afford health insurance \nis to help the small business employers provide that benefit. Of \ncourse, that insurance is more expensive. Those who buy it in smaller \ngroups, such as the small businesses, have to pay more for the health \ninsurance premiums and their employees are in lower income categories.\n  So I proposed an amendment that said we would give a tax credit to \nbusinesses, a tax credit for those who would offer health insurance not \nonly to the owners of the businesses but also to those who work there. \nThat was rejected by the Republican side of the aisle. That is the kind \nof tax relief they just do not think is necessary.\n  I can tell you, you will not find a single person working for a small \nbusiness in America making over $900,000 a year--the people we were \ntrying to help with that amendment.\n  I can guarantee you, as well, that people making over $900,000 a year \nprobably don't lose a single moment's sleep each night worrying about \nwhether there will be health insurance.\n  So it comes down to this. The President has proposed he is going to \nveto these proposals by the Republicans because, once again, as they \nhave done historically, the tax cuts proposed on the Republican side of \nthe aisle have gone overwhelmingly to the wealthy. It happened in \nAugust of 1999; again, in May of 2000 under George W. Bush's plan; it \nhappened with the House action recently in March of this year; and\n\n[[Page S7223]]\n\nit happened again on this estate tax repeal that the Republicans \nsupport.\n  Time and time again, the vast majority of relief goes to the \nwealthiest people in America. When will this Congress and this Senate \nlisten to the 98 percent of the families in America who are hoping that \nwe share their concerns about their future and their kids' future? \nWhether it is college education expenses, prescription drugs for their \nparents, prescription drugs for the disabled and their families, an \neffort to pay for child care, an effort to make certain they have \nhealth insurance on the job, when will this Congress put that as a high \npriority?\n  The Republican leadership said: Those people can go to the back of \nthe line. We will wait for some other day, if ever, to discuss their \nneeds. First we have to take care of the wealthiest. First we have to \nmake sure that those making over $900,000 a year get about $2,000 more \na month so they can be a little more comfortable in their lifestyle.\n  I think that is wrong. The President's veto is right. Let us provide \ntax relief and target it for the people who really need it. If there is \na surplus in America, let working families, 98 percent of whom were \nignored by the Republican tax cut plan, be first in line.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this evening, along with my \ncolleagues, as we talk about and remember and celebrate the life of \nPaul Coverdell. He was born in Des Moines, IA. He was a graduate of the \nUniversity of Missouri. That is where I went to school. Paul Coverdell \nwas a person who came to the Senate with a history of being a doer. He \nwas a workhorse in this Senate.\n  Early on, he demonstrated that he could be relied upon to take on the \nessential but unspectacular tasks for the good of the Senate and this \nNation. He was rewarded for that when he was elected by his fellow \nSenators to be the Secretary of the Senate Republican Conference. I \nknow something about that because he beat me. I could not have lost to \na better man.\n  He had his little mannerisms. He could put you in a box, put a cap on \nyou, do a lot of things. But his quiet demeanor and lack of fuss in \ntackling whatever tasks were assigned to him belied his effectiveness.\n  He served President Bush as Director of the Peace Corps. He was a man \nof peace. He served as leader of the Republican Party in the Georgia \nSenate for 15 years, from 1974 to 1989, skillfully guiding that body \nthrough some difficult but rewarding years.\n  His leadership really surfaced when he came to the Senate. We have \ntalked about him being a stalwart on national defense and on taxes, but \nI think he had his best vision and his best grasp of this business in \nreforming public education because he always referred back to his \nvision for the next generation. The next generation was always on his \nmind. As a proponent of equal educational opportunities, he introduced \nsweeping education and tax reform bills. The list of his achievements \nin the Senate is substantial, indeed.\n  Paul Coverdell holds a special place in our hearts as we say goodbye \nto a brother, a Member of this body, who has shown us the way in the \ntradition of the Senate. We are all better just for having known him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/19/senate-section/article/S7223-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of the FY \n2001 Defense Appropriations Act Conference Report. This bill provides \nthe much needed funding for our deserving men and women in the \nmilitary. After years of declining military budgets, this Defense \nAppropriations bill does the right thing by putting more of our \nresources toward our Armed Forces.\n  While I strongly support the overall bill, I would like to make note \nof one serious omission--the cut in funding for the Discoverer II or \nDII program. I know that Senator Stevens and the Defense Appropriations \nstaff fought hard for the DII program, but that they ran up against an \nentrenched opposition from the other side.\n  Discoverer II is a key element in assessing the utility, feasibility, \nand affordability of Space Based Radar (SBR). SBR will provide all \nweather, 24 hour, 7-day a week global surveillance coverage. The \nDepartment of Defense has stated that SBR will satisfy many unfilled \nrequirements, such as Long Range Endurance Reconnaissance, Surveillance \nand Target Acquisition, Improved Ground Moving Target Indicator \nTasking, Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination Interoperability, \nand provide simultaneous access to multiple theaters worldwide.\n  The program not only had the wide support of many Members of \nCongress, but also from the Secretary of the Air Force, the Director of \nthe National Reconnaissance Office, the Under Secretary of Defense for \nAcquisition, Technology, and Logistics, the CINC of US Space Command, \nthe CINC of US Central Command, and the Chief of Staff of the Air \nForce.\n  While I cannot understand the reasoning for such opposition, I do \nwant to thank Senator Stevens and his staff for fighting for this \nprogram and only hope that we can revive this important program in the \nfuture. The capabilities it will provide are too important to let it go \nquietly in the night. As the Chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee on \nthe Armed Service Committee, as a member of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, and as a member of the Commission on the National \nReconnaissance Office, I have heard from our military and intelligence \nleaders that this capability is needed and that we must demonstrate the \nspace based radar. That is why I will continue to fight for this \ndefense capability.\n  Again, Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Stevens for all his \nhard work and for producing such a strong bill for our military men and \nwomen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/19/senate-section/article/S7223-4", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

PASTORE\n\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President. I rise today to speak of a man who, \nduring 42 years of public service, left an indelible mark on \ngenerations of Rhode Islanders. Like thousands across the Ocean State, \nI am saddened by the passing of that great American statesman, John \nOrlando Pastore. Senator Pastore's life and career was one of \ndiligence, accomplishment, integrity and distinction. Senator Pastore \nset a high standard for all who have followed him in the United States \nSenate, and while he will be missed, his contributions to our state and \ncountry will not be forgotten. My heartfelt condolences are extended to \nhis family and friends in this difficult time.\n  The Nation's first Italian-American governor, and then U.S. Senator, \nJohn O. Pastore was rightfully proud of his\n\n[[Page S7224]]\n\nheritage and humble roots--and all of Rhode Island was proud of him. \nNot only did he embody the contributions made by Italian-Americans to \nour state and nation, his life and career were a source of pride and \nhope for immigrants from all nations.\n  A child when his father died, leaving his mother and siblings \nimpoverished, the future Senator and Governor struggled to overcome the \nmany daunting obstacles that life had laid in his path. Indeed, the \ntrue meaning of Senator Pastore's later personal and political \nachievements can only be understood when highlighted against the \nbackground of his own poignant memories of his childhood, which I would \nlike to quote.\n\n       We lived in the ghetto of Federal Hill. We had no running \n     water, no hot water. I used to get up in the mornings and \n     have to crank the stove, to go out in the back yard and sift \n     out the ashes and come back with the coal that I could \n     recoup. I had to chisel with the ice pick the ice in the sink \n     so that I could wash up in the mornings. And that was \n     everybody in the family. That wasn't me alone. That was my \n     wife's family, that was everybody's family.\n\n  A man who never forgot these humble beginnings, Senator Pastore \ncaptured the hearts and minds of Rhode Islanders in his conviction that \nif one worked hard enough and long enough, one's dreams would come \ntrue. As one who lived the American Dream, had risen from poverty to \npolitical prominence, Senator Pastore strived to extend those same \nopportunities to all in this country.\n  While Senator Pastore was a gentleman in everything he did, his \nconvictions were equally strong. Whether he was standing up for the \nrights of the underprivileged, or warning of the dangers of nuclear \nproliferation, Senator Pastore was not afraid of a political fight. \nThis was a man who, if asked an honest question, always provided an \nhonest answer.\n  Perhaps for his family there is some comfort in knowing that Senator \nPastore's career in public service has made the world a better place. \nHe helped guide our state and nation through some of our most \ntumultuous times--from his pivotal role in the struggle for civil \nrights legislation to his efforts to protect mankind from the threat of \nnuclear weapons. Indeed, many in our nation may have marvelled at how a \nstate so small could produce a man so great.\n  As the floor manager for the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Senator Pastore \ndemonstrated his deep devotion for maintaining and promoting the rights \nof all people, regardless of their race, color or background. As a key \nplayer in the negotiation and ratification of the Nuclear Proliferation \nTreaty and the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, Senator Pastore helped \nsignificantly reduce the dangers of thermonuclear war. On issues as \ndiverse as civil rights and nuclear proliferation, Senator Pastore \nworked successfully to tighten the sinews of peace against a background \nof conflict.\n  On a personal note, my father, John Chafee, who followed John Pastore \nto the Senate in 1976, held his predecessor in the highest esteem. \nTheir relationship consisted of mutual respect, admiration, and a \nnever-ending series of personal kindnesses, great and small.\n  Upon his retirement in 1976, Senator Pastore addressed the Senate one \nfinal time. He expressed his love for this great institution and laid \nout the philosophy that had guided his career.\n\n       Whatever you do, keep that torch of opportunity lighted. \n     Protect that flag. Maintain our institutions. Debate your \n     differences if you have them. But always realize what that \n     insignia says, ``E pluribus unum''--from the many there are \n     one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/19/senate-section/article/S7224-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today I would like to offer a \nspecial tribute to the oldest university student exchange forum between \nJapan and the United States, the Japan-America Student Conference \n(JASC). Founded sixty-six years ago at the initiative of a group of \nJapanese students who were concerned about deteriorating U.S.-Japan \nrelations, the month-long Conference has since convened on fifty-two \nannual occasions, alternating between the two countries.\n  This year, the Conference will open on July 21st at Tokai \nUniversity's Honolulu campus, then move on to the University of North \nCarolina, Washington, DC, and New York City, and will conclude at the \nReischauser Institute for Japanese Studies at Harvard University on \nAugust 21st. The sixty-two delegates, half from each country and, \nrepresenting some thirty-four university campuses, will address such \ntopics as: business practices, environmental issues, philosophy and \nreligion, historical perspectives, and third world policies, against \nthe thematic backdrop of ``Developing New Approaches to Promote Social \nChange.''\n  JASC is completely designed and implemented by students. Delegates \nelect Japanese and American Executive Committees at the conclusion of \neach Conference who manage, plan, and select delegates for the next \nyear's event. Many alumni of the conference have gone on to distinguish \nthemselves in the business, academic, and governmental arenas of their \nrespective societies. Most notable among them is Kiichi Miyazawa, \nformer Prime Minister and current Finance Minister of Japan, who \nparticipated in the 1939 and 1940 Conferences, and Henry Kissinger, \nformer U.S. Secretary of State, who participated in the 1951 \nConference. A common denominator among the highly diverse delegate \ncommunity is a deep interest in knowing more about the U.S. and Japan, \nwhich can lead to careers relevant to the bilateral relationship.\n  Thirty intense days of travel and dialogue with each other foster \nbetter understanding and trust between the cultures, and, more \nimportantly, friendships that endure for decades. As one delegate \nobserved, ``JASC is not a destination; it is a journey that does not \nconclude.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/19/senate-section/article/S7224-3", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7224-S7225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ON THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CROMWELL CHILDREN'S HOME\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, for 100 years the Cromwell Children's \nHome in Cromwell, Connecticut has provided a nurturing and supportive \nenvironment for children. Although the Home has evolved from its \ninitial origins as an orphanage, its dedication and devotion to helping \nchildren in need has not wavered. I am proud to rise today to recognize \nthis praiseworthy institution and, on behalf of the people of \nConnecticut, extend a heartfelt thank you on its centennial \nanniversary.\n  On any one day in Connecticut, there can be over 5,000 children in \nneed of the services so selflessly provided by institutions like the \nChildren's Home. Those children staying at the Children's Home benefit \nfrom a positive environment created by the dedicated and skilled staff. \nFrom my experience of working on children's issues in the United States \nSenate, I know how important it is to provide a constructive and \ntherapeutic atmosphere for children.\n  The Children's Home is special because it is a comprehensive \nresidential\n\n[[Page S7225]]\n\ntreatment center that can help many children who are emotionally \ndisturbed, behaviorally challenged or socially maladjusted. Through the \nresidential component of the treatment regiment, children develop \nsocial skills and learn to positively interact with others. Children \nalso benefit from the educational opportunities provided by the \nLearning Center because every student's educational experience is \ndesigned to personally suit his or her needs and to complement his or \nher learning style. The extensive outdoor learning opportunities, \ncoupled with access to computers, help to provide balanced, quality \nlearning. In addition, family therapy is a prominent feature at the \nHome because it is crucial to facilitate effective interaction between \nchildren and their families.\n\n  All of these wonderful features contribute to the successful \ncompletion of the Children's Home goal of ``returning each child to his \nor her community with a more positive attitude.'' For 100 years, the \nChildren's Home has succeeded in its endeavor and has positively \ncontributed to the lives of its residents.\n  One such former resident who symbolized the success of the Children's \nHome was John Russell Bergendahl. Known to his friends as Russ or \n``Red,'' John Bergendahl honored the Cromwell Children's Home, the \nstate of Connecticut and our nation by his service in World War II. An \nonly child whose parents died when he was a boy, Russ became a resident \nof the Cromwell Children's Home in 1932. The supportive environment at \nthe Home enabled him to overcome his tragedy and live with a positive \nattitude. Russ quickly developed an outgoing personality that was \ncomplimented by his physical and mental discipline. As Russ matured, he \nbecame a model resident of the home, owing much to the caring \nenvironment and dedicated staff.\n  During high school, Russ excelled in athletics at Middletown High \nSchool and even played on the Cromwell town baseball team. Upon \ngraduating from Middletown High School, he enlisted in the military to \nfight for his country in World War II. John entered military training \nand was assigned to the 504th Parachute Infantry Unit (PIR) of the 82nd \nAirborne Division. His unit fought courageously throughout Northern \nAfrica and Italy during the early years of the War. The 504th's ranks \nwere so depleted from these battles that they were retained as a \nreserve unit and did not participate in the D-Day invasion.\n  However, John was one of only 50 volunteers of the 504th to serve as \npathfinders on D-Day . His 50-man unit courageously preceded the main \nairborne divisions behind enemy lines to protect the vulnerable beach \nlandings and to prevent an enemy counterattack. John did not survive \nthis hazardous mission and died serving his country on June 6, 1944. \nHis death was undoubtedly heroic although the exact circumstances can \nnot be verified. He is buried alongside his fellow pathfinders at the \nUnited States Military Cemetery at Omaha Beach.\n  On this, the 100th anniversary of the Cromwell Children's Home, it is \nonly right that we recognize this special institution. As the story of \nJohn Russell Bergendahl demonstrates, the Cromwell Children's Home has \nnurtured a number of remarkable Americans, many of whom have served \nwith distinction in the U.S. Armed Forces. But whether its residents go \non to become heros or just good neighbors and positive members of the \nCommunity, the Cromwell Children's Home is making an important \ndifference. I hope the case of John Russell Bergendahl serves as an \ninspiration to the past and future residents of the Cromwell Children's \nHome and that they understand that their lives and their potential are \nlimitless. Once again, I congratulate the Cromwell Children's Home on \nthis 100th anniversary and I encourage them to carry forward the good \nwork for another 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/19/senate-section/article/S7225-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN RECOGNITION OF REVEREND NICK HALL, JR.\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nremarkable person from my home state of Michigan, Reverend Nick Hall \nJr. On July 23, Rev. Hall will retire after 48 years of service to the \nBethesda Baptist Church in Saginaw.\n  Reverend Hall's history of pubic service is truly deserving of \nrecognition. After serving his country in the Navy during World War II, \nhe received his Bachelor of Theology from the Chicago Baptist Institute \nin 1950. He then moved to Saginaw, Michigan and organized the Bethesda \nBaptist Church in 1952, where he has ministered there for nearly five \ndecades. In 1990, he furthered his studies in Theology by earning his \nDoctor of Divinity from Urban Bible College in Detroit. In addition to \nhis career in the ministry, Rev. Hall has dedicated himself to civic \nleadership through his work with many community organizations. From \ncivil rights activist to County Commissioner, he has won many hats in \nhis long public career, but all of them have shown a true dedication to \nhis community. For the last 48 years, Rev. Hall has served with \nintegrity and compassion.\n  Rev. Hall's departure from Bethesda Baptist Church will certainly \nmark a new chapter in his life. I can only hope it is as successful as \nthis previous one. Though I am sure he will remain active in his many \nchurch and community activities, I hope that he will be able to spend \nmore time with his wife, Marie, and their children and grandchildren. I \nam pleased to join his family, congregation, and friends in offering my \nthanks for all he has done.\n  Mr. President, Reverend Nick Hall, Jr. can take pride in his long and \nhonorable career to Bethesda Baptist Church. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in saluting Rev. Hall's commitment to his community and \nreligion, and in wishing him well in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/19/senate-section/article/S7225-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7225-S7226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      OUTSTANDING COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP IN FRANKLIN COUNTY, VERMONT\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my \ncongratulations to Franklin County, Vermont, one of five counties \nrecently honored with the 2000 Community of Excellence Award from the \norganization Communities Can!\n  Franklin County is a small, sparsely populated area in northwestern \nVermont. This county's close proximity to Lake Champlain and its \nrolling hills make it ideal for agriculture. In fact, the county has \nlong been known as a state leader in dairy and maple syrup production. \nAs with many rural areas, Franklin County has limited resources, but \nwith the innovation and sense of community responsibility that has \ncharacterized Vermonters for centuries, leaders in the community have \nestablished a comprehensive network of educators, health care \nproviders, and mental health workers to coordinate vital services for \narea children.\n  Communities Can! is a network of communities committed to ensuring \nthat all children and families, including those with disabilities and \nspecial needs, have the services and support they need. Franklin County \nhas been a part of this exemplary collaboration since its inception. \nEach year the organization recognizes five counties from across the \ncountry with the Community of Excellence Award. In order to be eligible \nfor this prestigious award, a county must show that it identifies young \nchildren and families in need of services; provides affordable, \nconvenient assistance; and includes family members in all levels of \ndecision making. Receiving this award is a significant achievement.\n  It takes strong teamwork to bring all of these essential human \nservices together to improve the lives of children and their families \nin a community.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey relative to the Voting Rights Act of \n     1965; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                       Assembly Resolution No. 90\n\n       Whereas, On August 6, 1965, United States President Lyndon \n     B. Johnson signed the federal Voting Rights Act (VRA) into \n     law; and\n       Whereas, The purpose of this landmark legislation was to \n     ensure that the voting rights of African-American citizens, \n     as guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments, to \n     the United States Constitution, are preserved and strongly \n     enforced; and\n       Whereas, Prior to the passage of the VRA, many areas of the \n     United States were in the grip of oppressive state laws that \n     purposely hindered and abridged the right of African-\n     Americans to register and vote by imposing demeaning tests \n     and devices that kept them away from the polls on election \n     day and permitted white voters to have control over the \n     electoral process and the candidates for elective office; and\n       Whereas, For example, before the passage of the VRA, only \n     29 percent of African-Americans were registered to vote in \n     Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, \n     South Carolina and Virginia compared over 73.4 percent of \n     whites, and within two years after the passage of the law, \n     more than 52 percent of African Americans were registered to \n     vote in those states; and\n       Whereas, When the VRA was adopted, Section 4 of the law \n     abolished literacy tests and all other similar devices used \n     to discriminate against minority voters; and\n       Whereas, Section 5 of the law was designed to ensure that \n     minority voters would have the opportunity to register to \n     vote and fully participate in this county's electoral process \n     free of discrimination; and\n       Whereas, Section 5 mandated that any change in election law \n     in states that had a history of electoral discrimination--\n     including something as small as moving a polling place--must \n     be precleared, either through the federal Department of \n     Justice or through the federal district court in the District \n     of Columbia, to ensure that the change did not abridge \n     minority voting rights; and\n       Whereas, In the wake of the passage of the VRA, the federal \n     Department of Justice has used it to stop or remove a large \n     number of the discriminatory practices that diluted the \n     voting strength of African-Americans or prevented them from \n     achieving electoral victories; and\n       Whereas, These practice include racial gerrymandering--\n     drawing Congressional or legislative district boundaries with \n     race as the primary consideration--and the use of at-large \n     elections in counties and municipalities, whereby \n     representatives are elected from the political subdivision as \n     a whole, instead of from districts within it, so that a \n     majority of white voters always defeat African-Americans \n     candidates; and\n       Whereas, New Jersey has long had an interest in ensuring \n     that African-Americans are permitted to exercise their \n     constitutionally-guaranteed right to vote, as evidenced by \n     the honor given to Thomas Mundy Peterson of Perth Amboy, the \n     first African-American to vote in the United States after the \n     passage of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution in March 1870; and\n       Whereas, Given that the civil rights community believes \n     that the VRA has allowed African-Americans in this country to \n     fully exercise their right to vote and have an important role \n     in this country's democratic process, it is fitting and \n     proper for this State to acknowledge the year 2000 as the \n     35th anniversary of the VRA; now, therefore be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n\n[[Page S7229]]\n\n       1. This House acknowledges the year 2000 as the 35th \n     anniversary of the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n       2. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the Speaker of the General Assembly and attested by the Clerk \n     thereof, shall be transmitted to every presiding officer of \n     the Congress of the United States, every member thereof \n     elected from this State and to the executive officers of the \n     largest civil rights organizations in the United States and \n     this State.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-605. A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey relative to the proposed ``Justice \n     for Holocaust Survivors Act''; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                       Assembly Resolution No. 58\n\n       Whereas, During the tragic events we now call the \n     Holocaust, in which the Nazi dictatorship in Germany \n     illegally expropriated private property and murdered six \n     million Jews as part of a systematic program of genocide; and\n       Whereas, Five million others were also murdered by the \n     Nazis; and\n       Whereas, There are thousands of Holocaust survivors living \n     in the United States who are being denied restitution for \n     their pain and suffering during the Holocaust; and\n       Whereas, This situation affects many survivors who have \n     come to the United States during the last 50 years, as well \n     as thousands of survivors from the former Union of Soviet \n     Socialist Republics who have arrived here during the last \n     decade and who have experienced a disproportionate refusal \n     rate by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against \n     Germany; and\n       Whereas, Many Holocaust survivors are indigent and in need \n     of financial assistance; and\n       Whereas, Current United States law precludes lawsuits \n     against sovereign governments such as the Federal Republic of \n     Germany; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 271 of 1999, the Justice for Holocaust \n     Survivors Act, would amend the federal Foreign Sovereigns \n     Immunity Act to permit U.S. citizens who are victims of the \n     Holocaust, whether or not they were citizens of the United \n     States during World War II, to sue the Federal Republic of \n     Germany for compensation in U.S. courts; now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. The President and the Congress of the United States are \n     respectfully memorialized to enact H.R. 271 of 1999, the \n     Justice for Holocaust Survivors Act, which would permit U.S. \n     citizens who are victims of the Holocaust, whether or not \n     they were U.S. citizens during World War II, to sue the \n     Federal Republic of Germany for compensation in U.S. courts \n     of law.\n       2. A copy of this resolution, signed by the Speaker of the \n     General Assembly and attested by the Clerk thereof, shall be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives and every member of \n     Congress elected from this State.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-606. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the Commonwealth of Virginia relative to voluntary school \n     prayer; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 71\n\n       Whereas, the framers of the Constitution, recognizing free \n     exercise of religion as an unalienable right, secured its \n     protection with the First Amendment of the Constitution of \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas, statements of belief in a Supreme Power and the \n     virtue of seeking strength and protection from that Power are \n     prevalent throughout our national history; and\n       Whereas, today there are numerous signs of harmonious \n     church/state coexistence, including organized prayer at every \n     Congressional session, the use of the Bible while \n     administering the oath of office, and the imprinting of ``In \n     God we trust'' on the national currency; and\n       Whereas, prayer in public schools existed for nearly 200 \n     years before the United States Supreme Court ruled in Engel \n     v. Vitale that a government-composed nondenominational \n     ``Regents'' prayer recited by students was unconstitutional \n     as a violation of the establishment of the religion clause of \n     the First Amendment; and\n       Whereas, this decision has severely constrained the \n     exercise of religious freedom guaranteed by the First \n     Amendment; and\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of the recent tragic events at \n     Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado and Westside \n     Middle School in Jonesboro, Arkansas, many believe that \n     providing for school prayer would help to prevent these \n     incomprehensible acts of violence from recurring at other \n     schools; and\n       Whereas, several resolutions have been introduced during \n     the 106th Congress, proposing an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States to allow for individual or \n     group prayer in public schools and other public institutions; \n     and\n       Whereas, the proposed amendments would not prescribe the \n     content of the prayer, endorse one religion over another, or \n     require any person to participate in prayer; and\n       Whereas, voluntary prayer is a beneficial practice that \n     provides the opportunity for free expression of religion and \n     rebuilding a moral emphasis needed in a country troubled by \n     outbreaks of unprecedented school violence; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the House of delegates, the Senate concurring, \n     That the Congress of the United States be urged to propose an \n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States to allow \n     for voluntary school prayer; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates \n     transmit copies of this resolution to the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives, the President of the United States \n     Senate, and the members of the Virginia Congressional \n     Delegation in order that they may be apprised of the sense of \n     the General Assembly of Virginia in this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/19/senate-section/article/S7229-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. McCAIN, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation, without amendment:\n       S. 1912: A bill to facilitate the growth of electronic \n     commerce and enable the electronic commerce market to \n     continue its current growth rate and realize its full \n     potential, to signal strong support of the electronic \n     commerce market by promoting its use within Federal \n     government agencies and small and medium-sized businesses, \n     and for other purposes (Rept.

A bill to guarantee for all Americans quality, affordable, \nand comprehensive health insurance coverage; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                 health security for all americans act\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I want to talk about an issue \nthat is of the utmost importance: Health Security.\n\n  First I want to talk about the problem: Health insecurity. Then I \nwant to talk about the solution: The Health Security for All Americans \nAct. And finally I want people around the country to hear what they can \ndo to wake up Congress and make Health Security for All Americans a \nreality.\n  This year has been a hard one for me. Two months ago, we buried one \nof my dear friends, Mike Epstein. Mike's sons came to be with him for \nthe last few weeks of his struggle with cancer. Devoted sons, they \nspoke glowingly about their father at a memorial service for him in the \nCapitol. As any of you who has sat with a dying parent knows, emotions \noverflow, coping is difficult, and the grief is profound. The last \nthing a son or daughter, a parent or spouse, needs is to have the \nadditional burden of wondering where will the next dollar for ever \nmounting health care bills come from; to worry about going into debt; \nto worry about going bankrupt because of a loved ones health care \nneeds. Mike's sons did not have to worry about that because Mike had \nhealth care coverage as good as Congress gets.\n\n[[Page S7230]]\n\n  The wife of my health policy advisor, John Gilman, battled cancer for \ntwo and a half years before succumbing one month ago. She had required \ninnumerable sessions of radiation therapy, plus chemotherapy and \nsurgery. John had his hands full with work plus taking care of his \nwife, both physically and emotionally. It is draining, but can you \nimagine how much worse it would be if John and his wife, June, had no \nhealth insurance. John didn't have to worry about how to pay for the \nnext medical bill because John and his wife had health care coverage as \ngood as Congress gets.\n  People do get ill. As hard as we try and as much as we pray, we can't \nalways cure them. But we certainly can make sure they all have access \nto high quality, affordable care with dignity. There is no reason why \nall Americans can't have health insurance as good as everyone of us who \nserves in the United States Senate.\n  The idea of procuring health security for all Americans is not a new \none. Franklin Delano Roosevelt recognized the need for universal health \ncare in the 1930s when we were in the depths of the depression; Harry \nTruman fought for it in the 1940s when the troops came home from World \nWar II; John Kennedy envisioned it in the midst of the cold war; \nRichard Nixon had it high on his agenda before events overtook his \nPresidency.\n  What these 20th century Presidents all understood is that there is a \nbasic human drive for good health, and the good health of the American \npeople is what drives this country and its economy. By 1992 it was far \npast due for us to recognize that all Americans should have a basic \nright to quality affordable health care. We had the opportunity in 1993 \nand 1994 to confer that right on to all of our people--and we lost it, \nbecause of differences and failures to compromise, and obstructionists \nand nay sayers, and failing to keep our eye on the ball: Universal, \nquality, affordable health care for every American.\n  I began introducing bills to provide universal health care in this \ncountry shortly after I arrived in the Senate in 1991. Back then people \nwere aware of the problems of the uninsured--it wasn't being swept \nunder the rug. Do you remember back in 1992, we were coming out of a \nrecession, unemployment was at 7.5 percent, the national debt was \nincreasing each year and 36 million Americans were uninsured, and \neveryone was talking about some form of health insurance for all.\n  Eight years later, we're told the economy's humming along, \nunemployment is the lowest its been in 30 years, and there is a \nbudgetary surplus. But despite the fact that there are 45 million \nAmericans without health insurance--10 million more than there were 10 \nyears ago--nobody in Washington is talking seriously about doing \nanything about it. Incremental change may keep some people from losing \ntheir insurance, and may insure some people who would otherwise be \nuninsured, but incrementalism has not stopped the steady rise in the \nnumber of uninsured in America which will soar to 55 million people by \n2008.\n  We need to change that. I don't think the fact that 140 million \nAmericans own stocks today should make us forget that 45 million \nAmericans don't have health insurance. And that millions more can't \nmake ends meet because their health insurance is simply too expensive.\n  Make no mistake about it: Not having health insurance has its \nconsequences. And I know some of you know it personally too well. There \nare some myths out there about not having health insurance that need to \nbe debunked:\n  The first myth is that the uninsured can easily get the care they \nneed. But the fact is: Uninsured Americans needlessly suffer because \nthey don't have access to the care they need. For example, the \nuninsured are four times more likely to go without needed medical care \nand to delay seeking care; and are up to four times more likely to \nexperience an avoidable hospitalization and emergency hospital care. \nThe uninsured are more likely to be in fair or poor health and have a \nhigher probability of in-hospital death than the privately insured.\n  The second myth is that the lack of health insurance is usually a \ntemporary condition and that most people get their coverage back \nquickly. But the fact is otherwise: Nearly 60 percent of people who are \nuninsured have been uninsured for at least two years. Or put another \nway: 6 out of 10 people who lose their health insurance this month will \nstill be uninsured in July 2002!\n  Employers used to do more to help assure their workers of coverage. \nIn 1985, nearly two-thirds of businesses with 100 or more workers paid \nthe full cost of health coverage. Last year only one-fourth of \nbusinesses did. In 1988, employers asked workers to pay on average 20 \npercent of the cost through payroll deductions. By 1998, they had \nraised the average worker's share to 27 percent. Three-fourths of the \nworking uninsured are not offered or eligible for any coverage through \ntheir workplace.\n  The third myth is that most people don't have health insurance \nbecause they are not working. But the fact is: 75 percent of uninsured \nAmericans hold down full-time jobs or are the dependents of someone who \ndoes, and nine out of ten come from working families. What's also a \nfact is that low wage workers frequently aren't offered insurance at \nall through their employment or if they are, it is at an unaffordable \nprice.\n  The fourth myth is that most people who don't have insurance could \nafford it but just choose not to buy it. But the fact is: The high cost \nof health insurance premiums is the main reason that half the uninsured \ndon't have health insurance. Only 3 percent of people without insurance \nsay the most important reason is because they don't think they need it.\n  Going without health insurance means living in poorer health. Most \nuninsured adults have no regular source of health care. Most postpone \ngetting care. Three in ten go without needed medical care. A quarter \nforego getting the medicine they need because they cannot afford to \nfill their medical prescriptions. Uninsured children are 30 percent \nmore likely to fall behind on well-child care and 80 percent more \nlikely to never have routine care at all.\n  The uninsured are three to four times more likely to have problems \ngetting the health care they feel the need. Uninsured children are at \nleast 70 percent more likely not to get medical care for common \nconditions--like asthma--that if left untreated can lead to more \nserious health problems.\n  Uninsured Americans are more likely to end up hospitalized for \nconditions--like uncontrolled diabetes--that they could have avoided \nwith better health care. In the end, uninsured patients are more likely \nto die while hospitalized than privately insured patients with the same \nhealth problems.\n  Partly because they are less likely to get regular mammograms, \nuninsured women are nearly 50 percent more likely to die of breast \ncancer. Our system takes its toll in senseless, random pain and \nsuffering.\n  Without insurance, the medical bills mount quickly. More than one in \nthree uninsured adults have problems paying their medical bills. The \nuninsured are three times more likely to have problems with their \nmedical bills than the insured. Eight out of ten uninsured people \nreceive absolutely no reduced charge or free health services. The \ncrushing weight of bankruptcy looms on the horizon. One out of four \npeople filing for bankruptcy identified an illness or injury as a major \nreason for filing; 1 out of 3 had substantial medical bills; and almost \n50 percent had both.\n  Even with insurance, low- and middle-income families frequently find \nthemselves in a financial straight jacket. Families with annual incomes \nof $30,000 or less are spending an inordinate, unaffordable share of \ntheir income on health care expenses. And the average family with an \nincome under $10,000 is paying well over 20 percent of its annual \nincome on health care costs. These families can least afford to make \nthat kind of payment.\n  For families with annual incomes of $30,000 or more, the average \namount of that income spent on premiums, deductibles and co-pays drops \nto below 5 percent on average. But these are just averages: many \nfamilies at every income level spend more than 10 percent of their \nfamily income on health care, especially if someone in the family has a \nserious illness. That is not affordable. That is not fair.\n  Since coming to the Senate, my number one priority has been achieving \nuniversal, affordable, comprehensive, quality care for all Americans. \nThat is\n\n[[Page S7231]]\n\nwhy I am proud to be introducing today the Health Security for All \nAmericans Act.\n  Let me digress and tell you how I arrived at this legislation.\n  When I was first elected to the Senate and Bill Clinton was elected \npresident two years later, I believed the political winds and tides \nwere aligned for a decade of progressive change for America. I thought \nI had been elected at just the right time to be a part of this change. \nWhen President Clinton, in his State of the Union speech, announced he \nwould veto any health care legislation that did not provide universal \ncoverage, that every citizen must be covered, I jumped to my feet and \ncheered. This was why I came to Washington, to make this kind of \nchange, and this was a fight I thought we could win.\n  But I had some quick learning to do. When I spoke about my interest \nin a ``single-payer'' health care plan, similar to the Canadian system \nwhere doctors and hospitals remain in the private sector, but where \nthere is just one insurer or payer, I was told by a senior colleague \nthat my plan might be the best proposal. ``But it does not have a \nchance. The insurance industry hates it and it will go nowhere. It is \njust not realistic.''\n  I was completely disillusioned. I could not accept then, and I do not \naccept now, the proposition that even before the American people have \nthe opportunity to be informed or included, a good proposal is ``dead \non arrival'' because the insurance industry opposes it. That isn't \nsupposed to happen in a representative democracy!\n  In spite of the advice, I did introduce the single payer plan with \nJim McDermott, a congressman and physician from the state of \nWashington. I thought first you start with the most desirable, and \nlater on in the process you'll find out what is politically feasible. I \nrefused to admit defeat before we had even begun to fight. And I was \nhoping that our legislation would pull the debate in a more progressive \ndirection.\n  What happened was just the opposite. The trillion dollar health care \nindustry, led by the insurance companies, went on the attack, not \nagainst our plan which ``wasn't realistic'' but against the President's \nplan which ``was''. ``Harry and Louise'' ads cried out against the \nhorrors of ``government medicine.'' Intensive and expensive lobbying \nefforts expounded on the same theme.\n  Media coverage, which should have been about the nuts and bolts of \ndifferent proposals shifted now to focus on strategy rather than \nsubstance and head counts rather than hard information. So ordinary \ncitizens no longer had a source of knowledge to form opinions and \ninform their elected leaders.\n  But the problems were not limited to the insurance lobby and the \nmedia. The only way we could have beaten the health care industry would \nhave been with dramatic and effective citizen politics. It never \nhappened. Progressives didn't organize a constituency to fight for \nhealth care reform, and the Administration didn't have the political \nwill to stand up to powerful interests and therefore never asked the \nAmerican people to take on this fight. They tried to win with ``inside \npolitics,'' cutting deals and making compromises with different \neconomic interests.\n  With each accommodation to private power, the President's plan became \nhopelessly complicated. As a constituent told me at the time, ``How can \nyou be for something you don't understand?'' What started as a noble \neffort by the President to fill a crucial national need became instead \nan object of derision.\n  Over the years, as I traveled around the country talking about the \nneed for Universal Health Care and the Single Payer model, I found \npeople turning off--not to the need for health insurance for all, but \nto the specific mechanism I favored. They wanted universal health care, \nbut they didn't want a national single payer system or they didn't \nthink one was possible here, so they stopped listening.\n  The mood of the country has changed since the early 1990s. In 1990, \nthere were 34 million uninsured. Ten years later, today, there are 45 \nmillion, and the number is growing by 100,000 people per month. \nNumerous polls show that the large majority of Americans want universal \naffordable comprehensive health care coverage and that they are willing \nto pay higher taxes for everyone to be covered.\n  The people and the States are ahead of the Federal politicians on \nthis issue. The people want a big change; not an incremental change. In \nMassachusetts and Washington state, people are pushing for ballot \nreferendums in the fall on universal coverage. Massachusetts and \nMaryland have already received commissioned cost studies of alternative \nuniversal coverage plans. California this past fall legislated a task \nforce to investigate options for universal coverage.\n  Governor Howard Dean (D) of VT (also a physician), whose state \npresently covers 93.5 percent of its citizens, says it well: ``It is my \nview that health insurance ought to be universal, the right of every \ncitizen in Vermont.'' And there is bipartisan support in Vermont. \n``Health care is not a partisan issue in Vermont,'' state Sen. John \nBloomer (R) said, adding that ``it's a bipartisan goal to expand health \ncare access and affordability.''\n  The Health Security for All Americans Act is a plan for a big change. \nIt builds on the momentum going on in the states of this great Nation.\n  So I decided that rather than trying to tell people how I thought the \nsystem should work, what I needed to do was first, to set out what I \nhave found are the common goals of the American people: universal \naffordable comprehensive health coverage; and second to provide federal \nmatching funds for each state to reach those goals in the way that best \nfits the needs of that state.\n  So, let me tell you about the Health Security for All Americans Act.\n  First, it is based on the premise that every American--not just \neveryone in this chamber, but every American--is entitled to have \nhealth care coverage as good as the Congress gets. Every Federal \nemployee has that right. Why shouldn't every other American?\n  Second, it is based on the premise that good health care must be \naffordable. Americans should not go broke trying to keep their bodies \nfixed. From my experience traveling around the country, Americans all \nacross the income spectrum are willing to be responsible for an \naffordable fair share of the cost of coverage and care, and a growing \nnumber of polls show that a majority of Americans are willing to pay \nhigher taxes so that all Americans will have health coverage. Under the \nHealth Security for All Americans Act, a family's financial \nresponsibilities for health care is based on a percentage of family \nincome. At the lowest end of the income scale, families would be \nresponsible for no more than one-half of 1 percent of family income, so \nthey can have quality health care, and a roof over their head, and 3 \nsquare meals a day. While at the higher end of the income scale, \nfamilies would be responsible for no more than 5 percent or 7 percent \nof family income. For example, under the Health Security for All \nAmericans Act, a family of four with an annual income of $25,000 would \nbe responsible for no more than $11 a month in total health care costs, \nwhile a family of four with $50,000 in annual income would have the \nsecurity of knowing that its total out-of-pocket health care spending \n(premiums and cost sharing) could not exceed 5 percent of family income \nor $2500 per year.\n  Third, it's based on the premise that you have to have access to care \nwhen you or your family needs it. That is why the Health Security for \nAll Americans Act includes the Norwood-Dingell Patient Bill of Rights \nthat has been endorsed by over 300 health care organizations.\n  Fourth, it's based on the premise that good health care delivery \ndoesn't just happen. It depends on a well trained, well compensated \nhealth care workforce that doesn't have to constantly worry about where \nthe next dollar is coming from. And I am referring to doctors and \nnurses and orderlies and home health workers, and nursing home \nworkers--all health care workers. If we are going to deliver humane \ndignified health care to everyone in this country, we need to start by \ntreating the health care workforce with dignity and respect and that \nstarts with affordable health care for all workers. That is why the \nHealth Security for All Americans Act includes health care quality, \npatient safety, and workforce standards.\n\n[[Page S7232]]\n\n  My experience has taught me that Americans agree with these premises. \nThey want high quality, affordable health care as good as Congress \ngets, but they are not sure the best way to get there. That is why the \nHealth Security for All Americans Act is a federal state partnership \nthat says here is what Americans want; you--the states--design the plan \nyou want to get your state there; and we the federal government will \nprovide the majority of the funds you need to reach that goal in the \nmanner you chose.\n  States that submit plans early and achieve universal coverage are \nrewarded with increased federal dollars for their efforts. But all \nstates must have plans in force within four years and coverage for all \ntheir residents within five years. States could reach these goals in a \nvariety of ways: with an employer mandate, with a combination of public \nand private initiatives, with single payer, or some other method. I \nthink this is a good approach because it allows the states flexibility, \nbut it clearly sets out a fair and just goal: Universal coverage; \ncomprehensive benefits as good as Congress gets; quality care \nguaranteed with patient protections; real income protections; and \nhonoring of health care workers. I am proud today to be introducing the \nHealth Security for All Americans Act and I am proud that this \nlegislation has the backing and support of the Service Employees \nInternational Union, America's largest health care union.\n  To my colleagues I say, together we can put universal health care \nback on the front burner where it belongs.\n  We all know that in 1994, the effort to bring health care coverage to \nall Americans failed. All of us have heard the reasons why. But what we \nhaven't answered is why did we give up when we knew this was the right \nthing to do? Why have we become so timid? Why have we only been willing \nto take half steps?\n  We must not shrink from the task at hand! America's doctors and \nnurses know how to cure disease better than anywhere else in the world. \nWell, now it is time to treat America's worst malady--45 million \nuninsured Americans, and millions more underinsured Americans who are \nspending far too much of their monthly pay check on health care costs.\n  Martin Luther King, Jr. rightly said, ``Of all the forms of \ninequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and \ninhumane.'' All the doctors and all the nurses and all the other health \ncare providers in America cannot solve this problem nor right this \ninjustice, but we in the Congress can.\n  This is a problem that isn't going away on its own, but there is a \nsolution. So to my colleagues, I say, ``Join me in sponsoring the \nHealth Security for All Americans Act.'' And to members of the American \npublic who are listening, I ask you to join thousands of your fellow \ncitizens who have already written to Members of Congress, and call and \nwrite your Senators and Representatives and ask them to join in \nbringing quality, affordable health care coverage to all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and additional \nmaterial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2888\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The health of the American people is the foundation of \n     American strength, productivity, and wealth.\n       (2) The guarantee of health care coverage and access to \n     quality medical care to all Americans is a fundamental right \n     and is essential to the general welfare.\n       (3) 45,000,000 Americans, more than 11,000,000 of whom are \n     children, have no health insurance, and that number will grow \n     to more than 54,000,000 by 2007 even if the economy remains \n     strong.\n       (4) Health insurance coverage is unstable; less than \\1/2\\ \n     of all adults have been in their current health plan for 3 \n     years.\n       (5) The average American will hold at least 7 jobs during \n     their life, risking lack of health coverage every time they \n     change or are between jobs.\n       (6) In 1998, annual health care expenditures in the United \n     States totaled $1,150,000,000,000, or $4,094 per person. \n     National health expenditures are projected to total \n     $2,200,000,000,000 by 2008.\n       (7) In 1998, health care expenditures represented 13.5 \n     percent of the gross domestic product in the United States \n     and grew at the rate of 5.6 percent while the gross domestic \n     product grew only at the rate of 4.9 percent. By 2008, health \n     care expenditures are projected to reach 16.2 percent of \n     gross domestic product. Growth in health spending is \n     projected to average 1.8 percentage points above the growth \n     rate of the gross domestic product for the period beginning \n     with 1998 and ending with 2008.\n       (8) Although the United States spends considerably more in \n     health care per person than any other nation, it ranks only \n     fifteenth among countries worldwide on an overall index \n     designed to measure a range of health goals according to the \n     World Health Organization.\n       (9) One of 4 adults, about 40,000,000 people, say they have \n     gone without needed medical care because they couldn't afford \n     it.\n       (10) Nearly 31,000,000 Americans face collection agencies \n     annually because they owe money for medical bills.\n       (11) The average American worker is paying 3 times more for \n     family coverage than 10 years ago, and more than 4 times more \n     for employee-only coverage.\n       (12) Because many individuals do not have health insurance \n     coverage, they may incur health care costs which they do not \n     fully reimburse, resulting in cost-shifting to others.\n       (13) As a consequence of the piecemeal health care system \n     in the United States, administrative overhead costs \n     approximately $1,000 per person annually, while other Western \n     industrialized nations with universal health care systems \n     spend approximately $200 per person annually for \n     administrative overhead.\n       (14) The United States should adopt national goals of \n     universal, affordable, comprehensive health insurance \n     coverage and should provide generous matching grants to\n\n[[Page S7233]]\n\n     the States to achieve those goals within 5 years of the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n\n TITLE I--HEALTH SECURITY FOR ALL AMERICANS--EXPANSION PHASE (PHASE I)\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to amend the Federal Cigarette Labeling and \nAdvertising Act and the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health \nEducation Act of 1986 to require warning labels for tobacco products; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n         the stronger tobacco warning labels to save lives act\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Stronger \nTobacco Warning Label to Save Lives Act. This legislation would replace \nthe current cigarette warning label on tobacco products with larger, \nmore direct messages that will have an impact on current smokers and \npotential smokers who are usually children. The Stronger Tobacco \nWarning Label to Save Lives Act will require a new series of warning \nlabels modeled after new, more effective warning labels in Canada.\n  On January 19, 2000, Canadian Health Minister Allan Rock unveiled new \nand larger health warning labels for tobacco products which include \ncolor graphics and images that illustrate the damage that cigarettes do \nto the health of smokers and those around them. These warning labels \nwill cover 50% of the front and back panels of tobacco products--one \nside in English and the other in French--and provide more information \non the harmful ingredients in tobacco products. These new warning \nlabels apply to all tobacco products. They will take effect on January \n1, 2001.\n  After the U.S. Surgeon General publicly announced the dangers of \ntobacco use in 1965, the U.S. became the first country to impose \nmandatory health warning labels on all cigarette packs. In 1984, the \nU.S. replaced that label with a system of four rotating warning labels. \nSince then, the U.S. cigarette warning labels have become stale and \nineffective. Many smokers have memorized all of the current warning \nlabels. Others never notice the warnings because they are placed \ninconspicuously the side of the pack.\n  Other countries have since taken the lead and required stronger \nhealth warning labels. These labels have been effective in reducing \nsmoking rates. For example, in South Africa, tobacco consumption \ndecreased by 15% between 1994 and 1997 due to a combination of radio \nadvertising campaigns, increased excise taxes on cigarettes, and new \nhealth warning labels. Fifty-eight percent of smokers said that the \ncigarette warning labels made them want to quit, cut down on smoking, \nor at least change to a lighter cigarette. Among non-smokers, 38% said \nthat the warnings made them glad they had never started smoking.\n  The tobacco industry's massive expenditures on tobacco product \npromotion and public relations have ensured that, over time, Americans \nhave seen more positive than negative imagery surrounding tobacco. The \nStronger Tobacco Warning Label to Save Lives Act will ensure that every \ntime someone lights up, the first thing that comes to mind is the \nhealth consequences--not the alluring lifestyle images associated with \ntobacco industry marketing. Too many young people smoke because they \nare led to believe it's cool and glamorous, when the truth is that \ntobacco kills.\n  Because tobacco products are highly addictive for many users, and \nbecause most users start using tobacco at a very young age, the \nstandard of warning for tobacco must be much higher than for other \nproducts. The warning labels should at least be as prominent in selling \nthe health message as the industry's design is effective in promoting \nthe product. This is not about banning or regulating a legal product, \nthis is about providing the consumer with the appropriate information \nso they can make an informed decision.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation to ensure that every time someone lights up, the \nfirst thing that comes to mind are the health consequences--not the \nalluring lifestyle images associated with tobacco industry marketing. I \nask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2889\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Stronger Tobacco Warning \n     Labels to Save Lives Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Chafee):\n  S. 2890. A bill to provide States with funds to support State, \nregional, and local school construction; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n  building, renovating, improving, and constructing kids' schools act\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague, \nSenator Chafee, to introduce a revised version of the ``Building, \nRenovating, Improving, and Constructing Kids' Schools (BRICKS) Act''--\nlegislation that would address our nation's burgeoning need for K-12 \nschool construction, renovation, and repair.\n  The legislation--which is endorsed by the National Education \nAssociation (NEA) and National PTA, and the National Association of \nState Boards of Education (NASBE)--would accomplish this in a fiscally-\nresponsible manner while seeking to find the middle ground between \nthose who support a very direct, active federal role in school \nconstruction, and those who are concerned about an expanded federal \nrole in what has been--and remains--a state and local responsibility.\n  Mr. President, the condition of many of our nation's existing public \nschools is abysmal even as the need for additional schools and \nclassroom space grows. Specifically, according to reports issued by the \nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) in 1995 and 1996, fully one-third of \nall public schools needing extensive repair or replacement.\n  As further evidence of this problem, an issue brief prepared by the \nNational Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in 1999 stated that the \naverage public school in America is 42 years old, with school buildings \nbeginning rapid deterioration after 40 years. In addition, the NCES \nbrief found that 29 percent of all public schools are in the ``oldest \ncondition,'' which means that they were built prior to 1970 and have \neither never been renovated or were renovated prior to 1980.\n  Not only are our nation's schools in need of repair and renovation, \nbut there is a growing demand for additional schools and classrooms due \nto an ongoing surge in student enrollment. Specifically, according to \nthe NCES, at least 2,400 new public schools will need to be built by \nthe year 2003 to accommodate our nation's burgeoning school rolls, \nwhich will grow from a record 52.7 million children today to 54.3 \nmillion by 2008.\n  Needless to say, the cost of addressing our nation's need for school \nrenovations and construction is enormous. In fact, according to the \nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO), it will cost $112 billion just to \nbring our nation's schools into good overall condition, and a recent \nreport by the NEA identified $332 billion in unmet school modernization \nneeds. Nowhere is this cost better understood than in my home state of \nMaine, where a 1996 study by the Maine Department of Education and the \nState Board of Education determined that the cost of addressing the \nstate's school building and construction needs stood at $637 million.\n  Mr. President, we simply cannot allow our nation's schools to fall \ninto utter disrepair and obsolescence with children sitting in \nclassrooms that have leaky ceiling or rotting walls. We cannot ignore \nthe need for new schools as the record number of children enrolled in \nK-12 schools continues to grow.\n  Accordingly, because the cost of repairing and building these \nfacilities may prove to be more than many state and local governments \ncan bear in a short period of time, I believe the federal government \ncan and should assist Maine and other state and local governments in \naddressing this growing national crisis.\n  Admittedly, not all members support strong federal intervention in \nwhat has been historically a state and local responsibility. In fact, \nmany argue with merit that the best form of federal assistance for \nschool construction or other local educational needs would be for the \nfederal government to fulfill its commitment to fund 40 percent of the \ncost of special education. This long-standing commitment was made when \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education (IDEA) Act was signed into \nlaw more than 20 years ago, but the federal government has fallen \nwoefully short in upholding its end of the bargain, only recently \nincreasing its share above 10 percent.\n  Needless to say, I strongly agree with those who argue that the \nfederal government's failure to fulfill this mandate represents nothing \nless than a raid on the pocketbook of every state and local government. \nAccordingly, I am pleased that recent efforts in the Congress have \nincreased federal funding for IDEA by nearly $2.5 billion over the past \nfour years, and I support ongoing efforts to achieve the 40 percent \nfederal commitment in the near future.\n  Yet, even as we work to fulfill this long-standing commitment and \nthereby free-up local resources to address local needs, I believe the \nfederal government can do more to assist state and local governments in \naddressing their school construction needs without infringing on local \ncontrol.\n  Mr. President, the legislation we are offering today--the ``BRICKS \nAct''--will do just. Specifically, it addresses our nation's school \nconstruction needs in a responsible fiscal manner while bridging the \ngap between those who advocate a more activist federal role in school \nconstruction and those who do not.\n  First, our legislation will provide $20 billion in federal loans to \nsupport school construction, renovation, and repair at the local level. \nBy designating that at least one-half of these loan monies must be used \nto pay the interest owed to bondholders on new school construction \nbonds that are issued through the year 2003, the federal government \nwill leverage the issuing of new bonds by states and localities that \nwould not otherwise be made. In addition, by providing that up to one-\nhalf of the monies may be used for state-wide school construction \ninitiatives, the bill provides needed flexibility to ensure that unique \nstate and local approaches to school construction will also be \nsupported, such as revolving loan funds.\n\n  Of importance, these loan monies--which will be distributed on an \nannual basis using the Title I distribution formula--will become \navailable to each state at the request of a Governor. While the federal \nloans can only be used to support bond issues that will supplement, and \nnot supplant, the amount of school construction that would have \noccurred in the absence of the loans, there will be no requirement that \nstates engage in a lengthy application process that does not even \nassure them of their rightful share of the $20 billion pot.\n  Second, our bill ensures that these loans are made by the federal \ngovernment in a fiscally responsible manner that does not cut into the \nSocial Security surplus or claim a portion of non-Social Security \nsurpluses that may prove ephemeral in the future.\n  Specifically, our bill would make these loans to states from the \nExchange Stabilization Fund (ESF)--a fund that was created through the \nGold Reserve Act of 1934 and has grown to hold more than $40 billion in \nassets. The principal activity of the fund--which is controlled solely \nby the Secretary of the Treasury--is foreign exchange intervention that \nis intended to limit fluctuations in exchange rates. However, the fund \nhas also been used to provide stabilization loans to foreign countries, \nincluding a $20 billion line of credit to Mexico in 1995 to support the \npeso.\n  In light of the controversial manner in which the ESF has been used, \nsome have argued that additional constraints should be placed on the \nfund. Still others--including former Federal Reserve Board Governor \nLawrence B. Lindsey--have stated that, for various reasons, the fund \nshould be liquidated.\n  Regardless of how one feels about exercising greater constraint over \nhe ESF or liquidating it, I believe that if this $40 billion fund can \nbe used to bailout foreign currencies, it certainly can be used to help \nAmerica's schools.\n  Accordingly, I believe it is appropriate that the $20 billion in \nloans provided by my legislation will be made\n\n[[Page S7241]]\n\nfrom the ESF--an amount identical to the line of credit that was \nextended to Mexico by the Secretary of the Treasury in 1995. Of \nimportance, these loans will be made from the ESF on a progressive, \nannual basis--not in a sudden or immediate manner. Furthermore, these \nmonies will be repaid to the fund to ensure that the ESF is compensated \nfor the loans it makes.\n  Although the ESF will recoup all of the monies it lends, it should \nalso be noted that my proposal ensures that states and local \ngovernments will not be forced to pay excessive interest, or that they \nwill be forced to repay over an unreasonable period of time. In fact, \nif the federal government fails to substantially increase its share of \nIDEA funding, states will incur no interest at all!\n  Specifically, to encourage the federal government to meet its funding \ncommitment for IDEA--and to compensate states for the fact that every \ndollar in foregone IDEA funding is a dollar less that they have for \nschool construction or other local needs--our bill would impose no \ninterest on BRICKS loans during the first five years provided the 40 \npercent funding commitment is not met.\n  Thereafter, the interest rate is pegged to the federal share of IDEA: \nzero in any year that the federal government fails to fund at least 20 \npercent of the cost of IDEA; 2.5 percent--the long-term projected \ninflation rate--in years that the federal share falls between 20 and 30 \npercent; 3.5 percent in years the federal share is 30 to 40 percent; \nand 4.5 percent in years the full 40 percent share is achieved.\n  Combined, these provisions will minimize the cost of these loans to \nthe states, and maximize the utilization of these loans for school \nconstruction, renovation, and repair.\n  Mr. President, by providing low-interest loans to states and local \ngovernments to support school construction, I believe that our bill \nrepresents a fiscally-responsible, centrist solution to a national \nproblem.\n  For those who support a direct, active federal role in school \nconstruction, our bill provides substantial federal assistance by \ndedicating $20 billion to leverage a significant amount of new school \nconstruction bonds. For those who are concerned about the federal \ngovernment becoming overly-engaged in an historically state and local \nresponsibility--and thereby stepping on local control--my bill directs \nthat the monies provided to states will be repaid, and that no onerous \napplications or demands are placed on states to receive their share of \nthese monies.\n  Mr. President, I urge that my colleagues support the ``BRICKS Act''--\nlegislation that is intended to bridge the gap between competing \nphilosophies on the federal role in school construction. Ultimately, if \nwe work together, we can make a tangible difference in the condition of \nAmerica's schools without turning it into a partisan or ideological \nbattle that is better suited to sound bites than actual solutions.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the letters of \nsupport from the NEA, PTA, NASBE, and Jim Rier, the Chairman of the \nMaine State Board of Education, be inserted in the Record following my \nstatement.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 2000.\n     Senator Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: On behalf of the National Education \n     Association's (NEA) 2.5 million members, we would like to \n     thank you for your leadership in introducing a revised \n     version of the Building, Renovating, Improving, and \n     Constructing Kids' Schools (BRICKS) Act.\n       As you know, our nation's schools are in desperate need of \n     repair and renovation. Too many students attend classes in \n     overcrowded buildings with leaky roofs, faulty wiring, and \n     outdated plumbing. A recently-released NEA study documents \n     more than $300 billion in unmet infrastructure and technology \n     needs, nearly three times the level estimated in previous \n     research by the General Accounting Office.\n       NEA believes the revised BRICKS Act offers a meaningful \n     avenue for assisting schools. The bill would make available \n     $20 billion in guaranteed funding over 15 years to provide \n     low-interest--and in many cases zero interest--school \n     modernization loans to states and schools. According to a \n     preliminary Department of Education analysis, the BRICKS Act \n     would provide schools with a benefit of $465 for each $1,000 \n     in bonds.\n       We are pleased that the BRICKS Act would allow up to 50 \n     percent of federal funds to be used for payment of actual \n     construction costs or the principal portion of loans, as well \n     as the interest costs. We also appreciate the provision \n     allowing those states with laws that prohibit borrowing to \n     pay the interest costs on school bonds to use 100 percent of \n     their BRICKS loans for state revolving loan funds or other \n     state administered school modernization programs.\n       NEA believes it is essential to enact meaningful school \n     modernization assistance this year. We thank you for your \n     leadership in this area and look forward to continuing to \n     work with you toward passage of bipartisan school \n     modernization legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Mary Elizabeth Teasley,\n     Director of Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 National PTA,\n\n                                        Chicago, IL, July 7, 2000.\n     Hon. Lincoln D. Chafee,\n     Hon. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Chafee and Snowe: On behalf of the 6.5 \n     million parents, teachers, students, and other child \n     advocates who are members of the National PTA, I am writing \n     to support the Building, Renovating, Improving, and \n     Constructing Kids' Schools (BRICKS) Act, which you plan to \n     introduce next week.\n       We thank you for your leadership in proposing this \n     initiative, which acknowledges the federal government's \n     responsibility to help schools repair and renovate their \n     facilities. As you are aware, the U.S. General Accounting \n     Office has estimated that the cost of fixing the structural \n     problems in schools across the nation will cost more than \n     $112 billion. If new schools are built to accommodate \n     overcrowding, and if schools' technology, wiring, and \n     infrastructure needs are added in, this estimate would exceed \n     $200 billion dollars.\n       This is a problem schools cannot address without a \n     partnership with the federal government, and National PTA \n     supports a variety of approaches to address this growing \n     crisis. In addition to endorsing the BRICKS bill, National \n     PTA is supporting the Public School Repair and Renovation \n     Act, which would provide tax credits to pay the interest on \n     school modernization bonds and create a grant and loan \n     program for emergency repairs in high-need districts; and \n     also the America's Better Classrooms Act, which would provide \n     $22 billion over two years in zero interest school \n     construction and modernization bonds.\n       Under BRICKS, nearly $20 billion would be available over 15 \n     years to provide low interest, and in many cases zero \n     interest, loans to States for interest payments on their \n     school modernization bonds. We are pleased that the proposal \n     will allow increased flexibility in using the federal funds \n     for interest payments, as well as for other state-\n     administered programs that assist state entities or local \n     governments pay for the construction or repair of schools.\n       National PTA is committed to helping enact a federal school \n     modernization proposal this Congress. We believe the BRICKS \n     Act should be promoted as one of the ways the federal \n     government can assist schools, and we thank you for your \n     leadership in this area. We look forward to continuing to \n     work with you toward formulation and passage of bipartisan \n     school modernization legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Vicki Rafel,\n     Vice President for Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                    State Boards of Education,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 18, 2000.\n     Hon.

Our principal objectives are to strengthen state \n     leadership in education policy-making, promote excellence in \n     the education of all students, advocate equality of access to \n     educational opportunity, and assure responsible governance of \n     public education.\n       We are writing to applaud your efforts to provide federal \n     assistance to states for school construction. The \n     deterioration of America's school infrastructure has reached \n     crisis proportions. At least one-third of all U.S. schools \n     are in need of extensive repairs or replacement and 60% have \n     at least one major building deficiency such as cracked \n     foundations, leaky roofs, or crumbling walls. We cannot \n     expect our children to learn much less excel in such decrepit \n     and unsafe environments.\n       The more than $112 billion needed to renovate and/or repair \n     existing school facilities has simply overwhelmed state and \n     local resources. This national problem demands federal \n     attention and we are encouraged that your office is \n     attempting to address this need by proposing a $20 billion \n     federal loan program.\n       Your legislation, the Building, Renovating, Improving, and \n     Construction Kids' Schools Act (BRICKS), will leverage new \n     school construction expenditures at the state and local \n     levels and provides flexibility to integrate this assistance \n     with the variety of solutions\n\n[[Page S7242]]\n\n     states have already undertaken, such as revolving funds, to \n     enhance the financing of school construction.\n       We appreciate your efforts and attention to address this \n     critical situation. NASBE is encouraged by your actions and \n     we look forward to working with your office to foster a \n     partnership between federal, state and local entities to \n     improve the learning conditions of American children.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Brenda Lilienthal Welburn,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     State Board of Education,\n\n                                      Augusta, ME, April 29, 2000.\n     Senator Olympia J. Snowe,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: The age and condition of our nation's \n     public schools are an expanding crisis and should be of great \n     concern to all. Decades of neglect, unfunded maintenance \n     programs, constrained state and municipal budgets, shifting \n     populations, technology requirements, and programmatic \n     changes have combined to weaken the infrastructure of public \n     education. As you are well aware, a 1995 GAO report estimated \n     that just repairing existing school facilities would cost \n     $112 billion. In addition, building new facilities to met the \n     demands of program and increased enrollments could cost \n     another $73 billion. We have allowed the condition of our \n     schools to deteriorate to a point that there are now critical \n     implications for the health and safety of our students and \n     staff who occupy those buildings. A number of states have \n     launched major efforts to address their school facilities \n     needs. The task is huge and beyond the ability of most local \n     and even state resources.\n       Unfortunately, Maine mirrors the nation. A Facilities \n     Inventory Study, conducted in 1996 by the Department of \n     Education and the University of Maine's Center for Research \n     and Evaluation, identified approximately $650 million in \n     needed facility improvements. Of particular concern was the \n     need for over $60 million in serious health and safety \n     related improvements as well as an additional $150 million in \n     other renovation and upgrades required.\n       In response to Maine's survey of over 700 buildings, \n     Governor King appointed a Commission to develop a plan to \n     address the needs identified. Their report was delivered to \n     the Maine Legislature in February 1998, and the \n     recommendations were enacted in April 1998. Maine has \n     responded to address the identified needs with significant \n     state and local resources. However, even as we develop policy \n     and resources to aggressively address those needs, our \n     concern grows.\n       Progressing from the condition survey to a detailed \n     engineering and environmental analysis of the conditions \n     causes even greater alarm. Roofs that were reported as \n     leaking in the survey are found to have serious structural \n     integrity problems with greater safety risks for occupants as \n     well as more complex and costly solutions. Indoor air quality \n     problems in the survey grow from increased air exchange \n     solutions to more complex ones due to mold and microbial \n     growth in the interior walls. Again, this poses increased \n     health risk for students and staff. As we learn more about \n     the problems, our concerns grow and the necessary resources \n     increase. The critical health and safety needs from the 1996 \n     survey ($60 million) have grown to over $86 million in our \n     latest project estimates. Many more projects are yet to be \n     identified.\n       Applications for Major Capital Construction projects were \n     received in August of 1999 from over 100 buildings throughout \n     Maine. Even with a major new commitment of over $200 million \n     from this Session of the Maine Legislature we will only be \n     able to address approximately 20 of those projects over the \n     next two years. More will be applying in the next two-year \n     cycle that begins in July 2001.\n       Although school construction and modernization is and \n     should remain primarily a state and local responsibility, \n     states and school districts cannot meet the current urgent \n     needs alone. Federal assistance in the form of reduced or low \n     interest loans as you have included in S1992, the BRICKS ACT, \n     responds to the urgent need and could provide a critical \n     component to a comprehensive but flexible approach to address \n     Maine's, as well as the nation's, school facilities needs. As \n     currently proposed, your legislation would allow the \n     flexibility to address the renovation and upgrade of existing \n     facilities as well as provide relief for overcrowding and \n     insufficient program space where major capital construction \n     is required. It creates an effective local/state/federal \n     partnership, while leaving decisions about which schools to \n     build or repair up to states and local school units. In \n     Maine, that would allow us to strengthen our Revolving \n     Renovation Fund (created to aid local units in the upgrade \n     and renovation of existing buildings), and it would enhance \n     our bonding capacity for long term debt commitment to major \n     capital construction projects.\n       Structurally unfit, environmentally deficient, or \n     overcrowded classrooms impair student achievement, diminish \n     student discipline, and compromise student safety. Although \n     not cited often, the learning environment does affect the \n     quality of education and our ability to help students achieve \n     high standards.\n       The National Association of State Boards of Education has \n     identified school construction as one of its priority issues. \n     I serve as Vice-Chair of their Governmental Affairs Committee \n     and would be happy to enlist their help in focusing the \n     nation's attention on the poor condition of our schools and \n     the need for comprehensive federal assistance. If you have \n     questions or need information from NASBE please contact David \n     Griffith, Director of Governmental Affairs at 703-684-4000. \n     As Chairman of the Maine State Board of Education and the \n     governor's School Facilities Commission I am available and \n     would be pleased to participate in any way you think \n     appropriate to outline Maine's innovative and comprehensive \n     school facilities program, and to elaborate on how federal \n     assistance could best complement state and local efforts to \n     address our school construction needs.\n       It was an honor to meet you in March during NASBE's \n     Legislative Conference. I look forward to working with you in \n     support of a federal partnership with state and local school \n     units to provide a safe, healthy, and effective learning \n     environment for all.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               James E. Rier, Jr.,\n                                                            Chair.\n\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Snowe, in introducing a revised version of BRICKS--the \nBuilding, Renovating, Improving, and Constructing Kids' Schools Act. \nThis legislation represents a fresh approach to addressing the \ninfrastructure problems in our nation's elementary and secondary \nschools.\n  Many thanks to Senator Snowe for her commitment to this issue and for \nher leadership; to the National PTA and the NEA, both of whom have \nendorsed the proposal; and special thanks to the Rhode Island \nDepartment of Education and Commissioner Peter McWalters for offering \nsuggestions which I believe helped to improve this proposal.\n  As some of you may know, Senator Snowe first introduced the BRICKS \nproposal at the end of the last session. In January, I joined as a \ncosponsor. We had hoped to offer this revised version as an amendment \nto S. 2 but were unable to do so. As a result, we are introducing the \nrevised version of BRICKS today in a form we hope many of our \ncolleagues will be enthusiastic about cosponsoring.\n  The BRICKS Act would permit the federal government to provide low, or \nno, interest loans to states to address their serious school \ninfrastructure problems. The National Center for Education Statistics \nreports that three quarters of our nation's public schools need to \nbuild, renovate, improve or modernize their facilities. In some cases \nthe need arises from increased school-age population. In other cases, \nschool facilities are simply old and in need of repair. Today's \nestimated cost of modernizing and improving school facilities \nthroughout the United States is $127 billion. There is no argument \nabout whether a serious problem exists. There are differences on how \nbest to solve this terribly serious problem.\n  BRICKS recognizes that our nation faces a grave problem. We worry \nabout whether our children are learning enough to compete in the \ninternational marketplace, yet we send our children to school in \novercrowded classrooms. We tell them to do their best without adequate \nair conditioning, heating and plumbing. We expect them to learn in \nbuildings with leaky roofs and crumbling walls, or we house them in \n``temporary'' classrooms in trailers on school parking lots.\n  In Rhode Island, our schools are old: twenty five percent were built \nbefore 1930; another thirty-six percent were built in the 1940s and \n1950s; twenty-three percent were built in the 1960s; and thirteen \npercent were built in the recent 1980s. Between 1986 and 1990, our \nsmall State spent about $400 million on school construction projects, \naveraging about 11 projects per year, and there is much more to be \ndone. My State isn't asking the federal government to step in and take \nover its school facilities responsibilities or the responsibilities of \nlocal communities. Rather, help is being sought at the federal level to \nmeet a critical and immediate need.\n  The legislation which Senator Snowe and I are introducing today, \naddresses that need by providing twenty billion dollars in federal \nloans to the states. Each state receives funds, based on the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act's Title I distribution formula, at the \nrequest of the Governor. States have until 2003 to request the loans. \nFifty percent of the loans must be used to repay the interest on school \nconstruction bonds. The other fifty percent may be used to support \nexisting state-administered school construction\n\n[[Page S7243]]\n\nprograms. Decisions about the use of these federal dollars are made by \nthe Governor in consultation with the director of the state education \nagency. I am very pleased that the revised legislation encourages the \nloans to go to those school districts with the greatest need, but the \nfinal decisions are made by those closest to the problems.\n  As a former mayor, the person at the local level signing the checks \nto pay for my community's education needs, I am very familiar with \neducational priorities at the local level. I am deeply committed to \nensuring that the federal government meets its overdue goal of paying \nup to forty percent of the cost of educating children with special \nneeds. Since coming to the Senate, I have made fully-funding IDEA--the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act--a top priority. This bill \nlinks the interest states and localities will be required to pay to the \nfederal level of IDEA funding.\n  Until 2006, there will be zero interest on BRICKS loans. After that, \ninterest will be determined by the federal funding level for IDEA. If \nfederal IDEA funding remains, as it is today, below twenty percent, the \nloans will remain at zero interest. If the federal spending on IDEA is \nbetween twenty and thirty percent, interest will be 2.5 percent. If \nfederal spending on IDEA rises to between thirty and forty percent, \ninterest rises to 3.5 percent. Finally, if the federal government meets \nits forty percent goal, interest peaks at 4.5 percent. Taking into \naccount federal funding of IDEA seems completely appropriate to me. I \nhope this linkage of IDEA and spending on school facilities is another \nstep which encourages Congress to meet the goal of fully funding IDEA.\n  Our proposal does not ask the federal government to assume \nresponsibility for building, improving and maintaining school \nfacilities. States and local school districts already have accepted \nthat responsibility by spending more than ever before on facilities. \nAccording to the most recent study by the General Accounting Office on \nschool facilities, issued in March 2000, spending on school \ninfrastructure increased by 39 percent from 1990 to 1997. But they \ncannot do it alone. The federal government can and should help by \nproviding BRICKS loans.\n  I hope that Senators who care about this issue will put aside \npartisan differences and look carefully at the plan Senator Snowe and I \nare proposing. We believe that BRICKS addresses an immediate problem in \na responsible manner that does not usurp the authority or \nresponsibility of states and school districts. I urge my colleagues to \njoin as cosponsors of BRICKS.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2891. A bill to establish a national policy of basic consumer fair \ntreatment for airline passengers; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                AIR TRAVELERS FAIR TREATMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Air Travelers' Fair \nTreatment Act of 2000.\n  Air travel is an increasingly unpleasant and stressful experience. \nAnyone who flies much at all knows that airports are crowded, flights \ntoo often delayed or canceled without explanation, ticket prices are \nunpredictable and hard to figure out, passengers are more unruly and \noccasionally violent.\n  Monday's edition of the Washington Post included a front-page story \nreporting that delays and cancellations are at an all-time high. \nAccording to Time Magazine, the number of air-rage incidents reported \nby flight crews from 66 in 1997, to 534 last year. It doesn't take a \ngreat leap of faith to see a relationship between the two.\n  Last year, Congress passed my ``air rage'' bill that increased \npenalties on passengers who commit acts that threaten the health or \nsafety of other passengers or jeopardize the safety of the flight. That \nwas a good bill, that I think will help passengers and airlines alike \nto reduce the amount of stress associated with flying.\n  But punishing unruly passengers is only half of the solution, because \nunruly passengers are not the only source of stress in air travel. Air \nrage is not only a cause, but a symptom, of stress.\n  The airlines have cut corners in recent years in ways that make \ntraveling by air more and more difficult and unpleasant for customers.\n  A few weeks ago, the Inspector General of the Department of \nTransportation released a study on the performance of the airline \nindustry. According to the study:\n  Through the first four months of this year, the number of passenger \ncomplaints to the Department has increased a whopping 74 percent \ncompared to last year.\n  Complaints about delays, cancellations, and missed connections were \nup 115 percent since last year--in other words, they have more than \ndoubled in only one year.\n  And even these numbers may be low, because the Inspector General \nestimates that the airlines receive anywhere from 100 to 400 complaints \nfor every one that is filed with the government.\n  Last fall, the airlines announced that they would voluntarily \nimplement their own reforms. They made a great show of implementing \ntheir ``12 Commandments for Customer Service'' last fall.\n  But this study reveals that things have become worse, not better. The \nstudy cites numerous instances where the airlines have violated their \nown so-called ``Commandments.''\n  For example, one of these so-called Commandments is to notify \ncustomers about delays and cancellations. The Transportation \nDepartment's report indicated that airlines were, in fact, making an \neffort to communicate delays and cancellations--but that the \ninformation communicated was, to quote the Inspector General, \n``frequently inaccurate, incomplete or unreliable.''\n  Airlines are often poorly equipped to handle in-flight emergencies--\nsome carriers have virtually no first-air or medical equipment on their \nflights, and the amount of first-aid training that flight crews \nreceived varies widely from carrier to carrier.\n  And airlines ticket prices are still confusing and arbitrary. Some \ncarriers have enacted rules that prohibit customers from combining legs \nof different tickets to get the best prices.\n  Now, there are some explanations for the decline in service and the \nincrease in the number of complaints. Last year, the airlines carried a \ntotal of 635 million passengers, a record number, double the number of \npassengers 20 years ago. The average load factor--which refers to the \npercentage of passengers compared to available seats--is 71 percent, \nalso a record.\n  But crowded airports are no excuse for airlines to violate their own \nso-called Commandments for Customer Service.\n  It's no excuse for providing misleading or inaccurate explanations of \ndelays or cancellations to air travelers. People make plans around \nposted flight schedules, important personal or business plans. If a \nflight is canceled or delayed, they should be able to find out what's \ngoing on, so that they can make alternative plans if they need to.\n  The bill I am introducing today will address some of these concerns.\n  The bill has seven provisions.\n  (1) Pricing Policies: Due to the complex way that airlines price \ntheir tickets, in some cases, a trip will be cheaper if a passenger \npurchases a ticket to a different destination and gets off during the \nlayover, leaving the second leg of the ticket unused, rather than \nbuying a ticket directly to his/her intended destination. Similarly, a \npassenger may save money by combining portions of different tickets. To \nprevent this and to force passengers to pay the higher prices, airlines \nhave  begun canceling the return ticket if the passenger does not use \nthe entire ticket, and penalizing travel agents who allow customers to \ncombine ticket portions this way. The bill would allow passengers to \nuse all, part or none of a purchased ticket without penalty by the \nairline, enabling passengers and travel agents to freely mix-and-match \ntickets to get the best price.\n\n  (2) Flight Delays: The bill requires air carriers to provide \ntravelers with accurate and timely explanations of the reasons for a \nflight cancellation, delay or diversion from a ticketed itinerary, by \nclassifying the failure to do so as an unfair business practice.\n  (3) Right to Exit Aircraft: Where a plane has remained at the gate \nfor more than 1 hour past its scheduled departure time and the captain \nhas not been informed that the aircraft can be cleared for departure \nwithin 15 minutes, passengers would have the right\n\n[[Page S7244]]\n\nto exit the plane into the terminal to make alternative travel plans, \nor simply to stretch their legs, get something to eat, etc. I believe \nthis provision will help prevent ``air rage'' incidents when passengers \nare forced to sit in parked planes for long periods of time.\n  (4) Right to In-flight Medical Care: Currently, each airline has its \nown policy regarding what kind of medical and first-aid equipment and \ntraining is provided on their flights, so that the available equipment \nvaries widely, particularly with more expensive equipment like \ndefibrillators. This bill would direct the Secretary of Transportation \nto issue uniform minimum regulations for all carriers regarding the \ntype of medical equipment each flight must carry, and the kind of \nmedical training each flight crew should receive.\n  (5) Access to State Laws: The Federal Courts have split on whether \nthe Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 pre-empts state consumer \nprotection and personal injury laws as applied to airlines. The Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals has held that passengers may sue airlines in \nstate court for violations of state tort and consumer laws; in \ncontrast, the Fourth Circuit has held that airlines are immune from \nstate laws. The Supreme Court has not acted on the issue. The bill \nwould add a provision making clear that the 1978 Act does not pre-empt \nstate tort and consumer protection laws.\n  (6) Termination of Ticket Agents: Travel agencies provide a valuable \nservice to customers looking for the best prices. Yet airlines have \nenormous leverage over what kind of information they can and cannot \nprovide to customers, because they can withdraw their accounts without \nnotice from any travel agency for any reason--even if the only reason \nis that the travel agency is giving the customer the best rates. The \nbill requires carriers to provide written 90-day advance statement of \nreasons before canceling a travel agency's account with the airline, \nand to give them 60 days to correct the identified deficiencies.\n  (7) Independent Commission: Finally, the bill would establish an \nindependent Commission to study the airlines' pricing practices and \ntheir effects on customer choice, on the number of routes available, \nand on the quality of service provided by the airlines.\n  The stress associated with air travel has increased considerably, and \nmuch of that stress is caused by things that airlines do to save money \nand maximize profit that hurt customers. I believe that we must look at \nunfair and deceptive practices of the airlines that contribute to the \nstress of air travel, in a specific, targeted and reasonable manner. \nThis bill will do that.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 2892.

McHUGH \n                             POST OFFICE''\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I had the honor and privilege of working \nwith former Representative Floyd H. Flake during my tenure in the House \nand it gives me great pleasure to join Senator Moynihan and my House \ncolleague Congressman Greg Meeks in introducing a bill to name a \nFederal building in Jamaica, Queens, New York, after the man who served \nthat district with the utmost honor and dedication.\n  Floyd was elected to the House of Representatives in 1986 to serve \nthe 6th Congressional District of New York. He served his constituents \nadmirably for 11 years until his retirement in 1997. He is most \nremembered for his service on the Banking and Financial Services \nCommittee, a committee we served on together.\n  In the House, Floyd distinguished himself as a leader in the fight \nfor the revitalization of urban communities. He worked tirelessly to \npass the Community Development Financial Institutions Act of 1993 and \nto ensure passage of the Community Reinvestment Act. These two acts, \nalong with Floyd's countless other efforts to help urban communities, \nillustrates his commitment as a true public servant.\n  Since his retirement, Floyd has continued his service to the public. \nHe is currently the Pastor of the Allen A.M.E. Church in Queens and has \nled a movement to increase church-based non-profit activity in \ncommunities. He has dedicated his life to helping New York City \nresidents work their way towards a better life through innovative \nemployment programs, community improvement projects and renewal of \nspiritual faith.\n  Floyd has distinguished himself as a true leader who was able to \ncombine high morals with government. I can think of no one more \ndeserving of this honor than Reverend Flake.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Burns, and Mr. \n        Santorum):\n  S. 2894. A bill to provide tax and regulatory relief for farmers and \nto improve the competitiveness of American agricultural commodities and \nproducts in global markets; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                THE RURAL AMERICA PROSPERITY ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural America \nProsperity Act of 2000. I am pleased that Senator Roberts, Senator \nSantorum, and Senator Burns have joined as cosponsors of this bill.\n  A Republican controlled Congress in 1996 produced a sweeping reform \nof farm programs. Farmers were no longer told by the government what \ncrops they had to plant. Farmers were no longer forced by the \ngovernment to idle part of their land. That farm bill disentangled \nfarmers from government controls and enabled them to make production \ndecisions based on market signals.\n  Freeing farmers from excessive, and often counterproductive, \ngovernment controls is an important step, but we should do more to give \nfarmers the tools they need to succeed. Specifically, we need to work \nto open foreign markets for our agricultural commodities and products, \nease the tax and regulatory burden, and provide new risk management \ntools for farmers.\n  There are three tax provisions in this legislation that I have long \nadvocated as crucial to the financial health of farmers. First is the \nrepeal of the estate tax. A repeal of this tax, which has prevented \nsome farms from being passed from one generation to the next, is \nessential. We are proposing the same 10-year phase-out of the estate \ntax which Congress just passed, and the President has promised to veto. \nExcluding capital gains from the sale of farmland would put production \nagriculture on the same footing as homeowners who benefit from a \ncapital gains exclusion for their home. The deduction of health care \ninsurance costs is needed for farmers and others who are self-employed.\n  Recently Congress provided over $8 billion to improve the federal \ncrop insurance program. While crop insurance is an important risk \nmanagement tool, today we offer two other risk management tools for \nfarmers--income averaging and FARRM accounts. Two years ago Congress \nmade income averaging a permanent risk management tool for farmers when \ncalculating taxes. Unfortunately, the interaction between income \naveraging and the alternative minimum tax has prevented many farmers \nfrom receiving the benefit of income averaging. This bill fixes that \nproblem. Under this bill, farmers will be able to contribute up to 20 \npercent of annual farm income into a FAARM account and deduct this \namount from their taxes. This is an excellent tool for managing \nfinancial volatility associated with farming.\n  We also address regulatory reform in our bill. We are seeking a \nreview of existing and proposed regulations to determine the cost of \ncompliance for farmers, ranchers and foresters. We want to determine if \nthere are more cost-effective ways for farmers, ranchers and foresters \nto achieve the objectives of these regulations.\n  Finally, we must do more to help develop new markets abroad for our \nfarm commodities and agricultural products. Opportunity lies in \ndeveloping\n\n[[Page S7245]]\n\ncountries where growing wealth allows for increased demand for meat and \nprocessed commodities. Authorizing fast-track authority for the \nPresident to negotiate international trade agreements may be the single \nmost important thing we can do to facilitate exports.\n  We also need to address sanctions. Sanctions that prohibit the export \nof U.S. agricultural products into the sanctioned country are often \nmorally indefensible because they deny necessities to people, not the \noffending government. Such sanctions also deny markets for U.S. \nagricultural products which are then captured by our competitors.\n  This legislation represents what I believe is necessary to further \nthe historic reforms initiated in the farm bill 4 years ago. I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this bill. I will continue to encourage my \ncolleagues and the Administration to work to enact these proposals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url":

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) natural disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, \n     tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires, pose great \n     danger to human life and to property throughout the United \n     States;\n       (2) greater emphasis needs to be placed on--\n       (A) identifying and assessing the risks to States and local \n     communities from natural disasters;\n       (B) implementing adequate measures to reduce losses from \n     natural disasters; and\n       (C) ensuring that the critical infrastructure and \n     facilities of communities will continue to function after a \n     natural disaster;\n       (3) expenditures for postdisaster assistance are increasing \n     without commensurate reductions in the likelihood of future \n     losses from natural disasters;\n       (4) in the expenditure of Federal funds under the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), high priority should be given to \n     mitigation of hazards to existing and new construction at the \n     local level; and\n       (5) with a unified effort of economic incentives, awareness \n     and education, technical assistance, and demonstrated Federal \n     support, States and local communities will be able to--\n       (A) form effective community-based partnerships for hazard \n     mitigation purposes;\n       (B) implement effective hazard mitigation measures that \n     reduce the potential damage from natural disasters;\n       (C) ensure continued functionality of the critical \n     infrastructure of communities;\n       (D) leverage additional non-Federal resources in meeting \n     natural disaster resistance goals; and\n       (E) make commitments to long-term hazard mitigation efforts \n     to be applied to new and existing construction.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a \n     national disaster hazard mitigation program--\n       (1) to reduce the loss of life and property, human \n     suffering, economic disruption, and disaster assistance costs \n     resulting from natural disasters; and\n       (2) to provide a source of predisaster hazard mitigation \n     funding that will assist States and local governments in \n     implementing effective hazard mitigation measures that are \n     designed to ensure the continued functionality of critical \n     infrastructure and facilities after a natural disaster.\n\n     SEC. 102.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congressional Joint Economic Committee data suggests \n     that over the last 15 years, agribusiness profits have come \n     almost exclusively out of producer income, rather than from \n     increased retail prices. Given the lack of market power of \n     producers, this data raises the question of whether the trend \n     has been a natural market development or is instead a sign of \n     market failure.\n       (2) Most economists agree that in the last 15 years the \n     real market price for a market basket of food has increased \n     by approximately 3 percent, while the farm value of that food \n     has fallen by approximately 38 percent. Over that period, \n     marketing costs have decreased by 15 percent, which should \n     have narrowed rather than widened the gap.\n       (3) There is significant concern that increasingly \n     vertically integrated multinational corporations, especially \n     those that own broad biotechnology patents, may be able to \n     exert unreasonable and excessive market power in the future \n     by acquiring companies that own other broad biotechnology \n     patents.\n       (4) The National Association of Attorneys General is very \n     concerned with the high degree of economic concentration in \n     the agricultural sector and the great potential for \n     anticompetitive practices and behavior. They estimate the top \n     4 meat packing firms control over 80 percent of steer and \n     heifer slaughter, over 55 percent of hog slaughter, and over \n     65 percent of sheep slaughter. Increased concentration in the \n     dairy procurement and processing sector is also raising \n     significant concerns.\n       (5) In the grain industry, United States Department of \n     Agriculture reports that the top 4 firms controlled 56 \n     percent of flour milling, 73 percent of wet corn milling, 71 \n     percent of soybean milling, and 62 percent of cotton seed oil \n     milling.\n       (6) Moreover, the figures in paragraphs (4) and (5) \n     underestimate true levels of concentration and potential \n     market power because they fail to reflect the web of \n     unreported and difficult to trace joint ventures, strategic \n     alliances, interlocking directorates, and other partial \n     ownership arrangements that link many large corporations.\n       (7) Concentration of market power also has the effect of \n     increasing the transfer of investment, capital, jobs, and \n     necessary social services out of rural areas to business \n     centers throughout the world. Many individuals representing a \n     wide range of expertise have expressed concern with the \n     potential implications of this trend for the greater public \n     good.\n       (8) The recent increase in contracting for the production \n     or sale of agricultural commodities, such as livestock and \n     poultry, is a cause for concern because of the significant \n     bargaining power the buyers of these products or services \n     wield over individual farmers and ranchers.\n       (9) Transparent, freely accessible, and competitive markets \n     are being supplanted by transfer prices set within vertically \n     integrated firms and by the increasing use of private \n     contracts.\n       (10) Agribusiness firms are showing record profits at the \n     same time that farmers and ranchers are struggling to survive \n     an ongoing price collapse and erratic price trends.\n       (11) The efforts of farmers and ranchers to improve their \n     market position is hampered by--\n       (A) extreme disparities in bargaining power between \n     agribusiness firms and the hundreds of thousands of \n     individual farmers and ranchers that sell products to them;\n       (B) the rapid increase in the use of private contracts that \n     disrupt price discovery and can unfairly disadvantage \n     producers;\n\n[[Page S7261]]\n\n       (C) the extreme market power of agribusiness firms and \n     alleged anticompetitive practices in the industry;\n       (D) shrinking opportunities for market access by producers; \n     and\n       (E) the direct and indirect impact these factors have on \n     the continuing viability of thousands of rural communities \n     across the country.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) enhance fair and open competition in rural America, \n     thereby fostering innovation and economic growth;\n       (2) permit the Secretary to take actions to enhance the \n     bargaining position of family farmers and ranchers, and to \n     promote the viability of rural communities nationwide;\n       (3) protect family farms and ranches from--\n       (A) unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive practices \n     or devices;\n       (B) false or misleading statements;\n       (C) retaliation related to statements lawfully provided; \n     and\n       (D) other unfair trade practices employed by processors and \n     other agribusinesses; and\n       (4) permit the Secretary to take actions to enhance the \n     viability of rural communities nationwide.\n\n      SEC. 5003.

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings--\n       (1) in 1990, pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination and \n     Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), 25 U.S.C. 450 et seq., a \n     class action lawsuit was filed by Indian tribal contractors \n     and tribal consortia against the United States, the Secretary \n     of the Interior and others seeking money damages, injunctive \n     relief, and declaratory relief for alleged violations of the \n     ISDEAA (Ramah Navajo Chapter v. Lujan, 112 F.3d 1455 (10th \n     Cir. 1997));\n       (2) the parties negotiated a partial settlement of the \n     claim totaling $76,200,000, plus applicable interest, which \n     was approved by the court on May 14, 1999;\n       (3) the partial settlement was paid by the United States in \n     September 1999, in the amount of $82,000,000;\n       (4) the Judgment Fund was established to pay for legal \n     judgments awarded to plaintiffs who have filed suit against \n     the United States;\n       (5) the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 requires that the \n     Judgment Fund be reimbursed by the responsible agency \n     following the payment of an award from the Fund; and\n       (6) the shortfall in contract support payments found by the \n     Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Ramah resulted \n     primarily from the non-payment or underpayment of indirect \n     costs by agencies other than the Bureau of Indian Affairs and \n     the Indian Health Service.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) repayment of the Judgment Fund for the partial \n     settlement in Ramah from the accounts of the Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs and Indian Health Service would significantly reduce \n     funds appropriated to benefit tribes and individual Native \n     Americans; and\n       (2) the Secretary of the Interior should work with the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget to secure \n     funding for repayment of the judgment in Ramah within the \n     budgets of the agencies that did not pay indirect costs to \n     plaintiffs during the period 1988 to 1993 or paid indirect \n     costs at less than rates provided under the Indian Self-\n     Determination Act during such period.\n\n                       TITLE II--RELATED AGENCIES\n\n                       DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                             Forest Service\n\n\n                     Forest and

The percentage shall be \n     calculated by Region 10 on a rolling basis as each sale is \n     sold (for purposes of this amendment, a ``rolling basis'' \n     shall mean that the determination of how much western red \n     cedar is eligible for sale to various markets shall be made \n     at the time each sale is awarded). Western red cedar shall be \n     deemed ``surplus to the needs of domestic processors in \n     Alaska'' when the timber sale holder has presented to the \n     Forest Service documentation of the inability to sell western \n     red cedar logs from a given sale to domestic Alaska \n     processors at price equal to or greater than the log selling \n     value stated in the contract.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 644, S. Res. \n329.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 329) urging the Government of \n     Argentina to pursue and punish those responsible for the 1994 \n     attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, \n     Argentina.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering and \nwill likely pass Senate Resolution 329, which urges the Government of \nArgentina to pursue and punish those responsible for the 1994 attack on \nthe AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina. On June \n28th, Senator Helms joined me in introducing this resolution, which was \nreported out of the Foreign Relations Committee that same day.\n  Six years ago, a car bomb ripped through the AMIA Jewish Community \nCenter in Buenos Aires, Argentina, killing 86 people and wounding 300 \nmore. Two years before that, a similar attack had devastated the \nIsraeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, killing 29 people and wounding over \n200. These heinous terrorist attacks have reverberated loudly in \nArgentina, home to the largest Jewish community in Latin America. These \ncowardly acts also reminded us, as Americans, that terrorism can strike \nanywhere at any moment.\n  I applaud President Fernando de la Rua's stated resolve to bring to \njustice those responsible for these atrocious crimes. However, the \nGovernment of Argentina has not, to this date, succeeded in completing \nits prosecution of this important case. In addition, investigative \nfindings in Buenos Aires have implicated local authorities--including \nsecurity officials--as party responsible for the attacks.\n  Senate Resolution 329 is a reiteration of the U.S. condemnation of \nthis terrorist act, as well as a call for justice in Argentina. This \nresolution not only urges Argentina to punish those responsible for the \nAMIA bombing, but it also calls on the U.S. Government and the \nOrganization of American States to lend support to this prosecution.\n  Our commitment to assist our neighbors to the south must embody the \nvery principles that have guided our Nation in implementing democratic\n\n[[Page S7280]]\n\ngovernance and the rule of law. In that regard, the United States must \ncontinue to speak out about the blatant massacre of innocent people, \nand the subsequent difficulty in bringing to justice those responsible \nfor this crime.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of all of my colleagues in having this \nimportant resolution considered and passed by the Senate.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an amendment \nat the desk to the resolution be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3939) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: To make a technical amendment)\n\n       On page 3, line 7 and 8, strike ``its promise to the \n     Argentine people'' and insert ``other commitments''.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an amendment \nto the preamble which is at the desk be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3940) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n            (Purpose: Technical amendments to the preamble)\n\n       In the fourth whereas clause, insert ``at that time'' after \n     ``forces''.\n       In the seventh whereas clause, insert ``has issued an \n     arrest warrant against a leader of the Islamic Jihad but'' \n     after ``Argentina''.\n       After the eighth whereas clause, insert the following:\n       ``Whereas the Government of Argentina was successful in \n     enacting a law on cooperation from defendants in terrorist \n     matters, a law that will be helpful in pursuing full \n     prosecution in this and other terrorist cases;''.\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Res. 122\n\n       Whereas in June 1940, the Soviet Union occupied the Baltic \n     countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania and forcibly \n     incorporated them into the Union of Soviet Socialist \n     Republics;\n       Whereas throughout the occupation, the United States \n     maintained that the acquisition of Baltic territory by force \n     was not permissible under international law and refused to \n     recognize Soviet sovereignty over these lands;\n       Whereas on July 15, 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt \n     issued Executive Order No. 8484, which froze Baltic assets in \n     the United States to prevent them from falling into Soviet \n     hands;\n       Whereas on July 23, 1940, Acting Secretary of State Sumner \n     Welles issued the first public statement of United States \n     policy of nonrecognition of the Soviet takeover of the Baltic \n     countries, condemning that act in the strongest terms;\n       Whereas the United States took steps to allow the \n     diplomatic representatives of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania \n     in Washington to continue to represent their nations \n     throughout the Soviet occupation;\n       Whereas Congress on a bipartisan basis strongly and \n     consistently supported the policy of nonrecognition of the \n     Soviet takeover of the Baltic countries during the 50 years \n     of occupation;\n       Whereas in 1959, Congress designated the third week in July \n     as ``Captive Nations Week'', and authorized the President to \n     issue a proclamation declaring June 14 as ``Baltic Freedom \n     Day'';\n       Whereas in December 1975, the House of Representatives and \n     the Senate adopted resolutions declaring that the Final Act \n     of the Commission for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \n     which accepted the inviolability or borders in Europe, did \n     not alter the United States nonrecognition policy;\n       Whereas during the struggle of the Baltic countries for the \n     restoration of their independence in 1990 and 1991, Congress \n     passed a number of resolutions that underscored its continued \n     support for the nonrecognition policy and for Baltic self-\n     determination;\n       Whereas since then the Baltic states have successfully \n     built democracy, ensured the rule of law, developed free \n     market economies, and consistently pursued a course of \n     integration into the community of free and democratic nations \n     by seeking membership in the European Union and the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization;\n       Whereas the Russian Federation has extended formal \n     recognition to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania as independent \n     and sovereign states; and\n       Whereas the United States, the European Union, and the \n     countries of Northern Europe have supported regional \n     cooperation in Northern Europe among the Baltic and Nordic \n     states and the Russian Federation in addressing common \n     environmental, law enforcement, and public health problems, \n     and in promoting civil society and business and trade \n     development: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the 60th anniversary of the United States \n     nonrecognition policy of the Soviet takeover of the Baltic \n     states and the contribution that policy made in supporting \n     the aspirations of the people of Estonia, Latvia, and \n     Lithuania to reassert their freedom and independence;\n       (2) commends Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania for the \n     reestablishment of their independence and the role they \n     played in the disintegration of the former Soviet Union in \n     1990 and 1991;\n       (3) commends Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania for their \n     success in implementing political and economic reforms, which \n     may further speed the process of their entry into European \n     and Western institutions; and\n       (4) supports regional cooperation in Northern Europe among \n     the Baltic and Nordic states and the Russian Federation and \n     calls for further cooperation in addressing common \n     environmental, law enforcement, and public health problems, \n     and in promoting civil society and business and trade \n     development, and similar efforts that promote a peaceful, \n     democratic, prosperous, and secure future for Europe, Russia \n     and the Nordic-Baltic region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/19/senate-section/article/S7282-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CROSS-BORDER COOPERATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY IN NORTHERN EUROPE \n                              ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Con. Res. 113\n\n       Whereas in 1988 thousands of Burmese citizens called for a \n     democratic change in Burma and participated in peaceful \n     demonstrations to achieve this result;\n       Whereas these demonstrations were brutally repressed by the \n     Burmese military, resulting in the loss of hundreds of lives;\n       Whereas, despite continued repression, the Burmese people \n     turned out in record numbers to vote in elections deemed free \n     and fair by international observers;\n       Whereas on May 27, 1990, the National League for Democracy \n     (NLD) led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi won more than 60 percent of \n     the popular vote and 80 percent of the parliamentary seats in \n     the elections;\n\n[[Page S7283]]\n\n       Whereas the Burmese military rejected the results of the \n     elections, placed Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and hundreds of \n     members of the NLD under arrest, pressured members of the NLD \n     to resign, and severely restricted freedom of assembly, \n     speech, and the press;\n       Whereas 48,000,000 people in Burma continue to suffer gross \n     violations of human rights, including the right to democracy, \n     and economic deprivation under a military regime known as the \n     State Peace and Development Council (SPDC);\n       Whereas on September 16, 1998, the members of the NLD and \n     other political parties who won the 1990 elections joined \n     together to form the Committee Representing the People's \n     Parliament (CRPP) as an interim mechanism to address human \n     rights, economic and other conditions, and provide \n     representation of the political views and voice of Members of \n     Parliament elected to but denied office in 1990;\n       Whereas the United Nations General Assembly and Commission \n     on Human Rights have condemned in nine consecutive \n     resolutions the persecution of religious and ethnic \n     minorities and the political opposition, and SPDC's record of \n     forced labor, exploitation, and sexual violence against \n     women;\n       Whereas the United States and the European Union Council of \n     Foreign Ministers have similarly condemned conditions in \n     Burma and officially imposed travel restrictions and other \n     sanctions against the SPDC;\n       Whereas in May 1999, the International Labor Organization \n     (ILO) condemned the SPDC for inflicting forced labor on the \n     people and has banned the SPDC from participating in any ILO \n     meetings;\n       Whereas the 1999 Department of State Country Reports on \n     Human Rights Practices for Burma identifies more than 1,300 \n     people who continue to suffer inhumane detention conditions \n     as political prisoners in Burma;\n       Whereas the Department of State International Narcotics \n     Control Report for 2000 determines that Burma is the second \n     largest world-wide source of illicit opium and heroin and \n     that there are continuing, reliable reports that Burmese \n     officials are ``involved in the drug business or are paid to \n     allow the drug business to be conducted by others'', \n     conditions which pose a direct threat to United States \n     national security interests; and\n       Whereas, despite these massive violations of human rights \n     and civil liberties and chronic economic deprivation, Daw \n     Aung San Suu Kyi and members of the NLD have continued to \n     call for a peaceful political dialogue with the SPDC to \n     achieve a democratic transition: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States policy should strongly support the \n     restoration of democracy in Burma, including implementation \n     of the results of the free and fair elections of 1990;\n       (2) United States policy should continue to call upon the \n     military regime in Burma known as the State Peace and \n     Development Council (SPDC)--\n       (A) to guarantee freedom of assembly, freedom of movement, \n     freedom of speech, and freedom of the press for all Burmese \n     citizens;\n       (B) to immediately accept a political dialogue with Daw \n     Aung San Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy (NLD), \n     and ethnic leaders to advance peace and reconciliation in \n     Burma;\n       (C) to immediately and unconditionally release all detained \n     Members elected to the 1990 parliament and other political \n     prisoners;

Res. 113\n\n       Whereas in 1988 thousands of Burmese citizens called for a \n     democratic change in Burma and participated in peaceful \n     demonstrations to achieve this result;\n       Whereas these demonstrations were brutally repressed by the \n     Burmese military, resulting in the loss of hundreds of lives;\n       Whereas, despite continued repression, the Burmese people \n     turned out in record numbers to vote in elections deemed free \n     and fair by international observers;\n       Whereas on May 27, 1990, the National League for Democracy \n     (NLD) led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi won more than 60 percent of \n     the popular vote and 80 percent of the parliamentary seats in \n     the elections;\n       Whereas the Burmese military rejected the results of the \n     elections, placed Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and hundreds of \n     members of the NLD under arrest, pressured members of the NLD \n     to resign, and severely restricted freedom of assembly, \n     speech, and the press;\n       Whereas 48,000,000 people in Burma continue to suffer gross \n     violations of human rights, including the right to democracy, \n     and economic deprivation under a military regime known as the \n     State Peace and Development Council (SPDC);\n       Whereas on September 16, 1998, the members of the NLD and \n     other political parties who won the 1990 elections joined \n     together to form the Committee Representing the People's \n     Parliament (CRPP) as an interim mechanism to address human \n     rights, economic and other conditions, and provide \n     representation of the political views and voice of Members of \n     Parliament elected to but denied office in 1990;\n       Whereas the United Nations General Assembly and Commission \n     on Human Rights have condemned in nine consecutive \n     resolutions the persecution of religious and ethnic \n     minorities and the political opposition, and SPDC's record of \n     forced labor, exploitation, and sexual violence against \n     women;\n       Whereas the United States and the European Union Council of \n     Foreign Ministers have similarly condemned conditions in \n     Burma and officially imposed travel restrictions and other \n     sanctions against the SPDC;\n       Whereas in May 1999, the International Labor Organization \n     (ILO) condemned the SPDC for inflicting forced labor on the \n     people and has banned the SPDC from participating in any ILO \n     meetings;\n       Whereas the 1999 Department of State Country Reports on \n     Human Rights Practices for Burma identifies more than 1,300 \n     people who continue to suffer inhumane detention conditions \n     as political prisoners in Burma;\n       Whereas the Department of State International Narcotics \n     Control Report for 2000 determines that Burma is the second \n     largest world-wide source of illicit opium and heroin and \n     that there are continuing, reliable reports that Burmese \n     officials are ``involved in the drug business or are paid to \n     allow the drug business to be conducted by others'', \n     conditions which pose a direct threat to United States \n     national security interests; and\n       Whereas, despite these massive violations of human rights \n     and civil liberties and chronic economic deprivation, Daw \n     Aung San Suu Kyi and members of the NLD have continued to \n     call for a peaceful political dialogue with the SPDC to \n     achieve a democratic transition: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States policy should strongly support the \n     restoration of democracy in Burma, including implementation \n     of the results of the free and fair elections of 1990;\n       (2) United States policy should continue to call upon the \n     military regime in Burma known as the State Peace and \n     Development Council (SPDC)--\n       (A) to guarantee freedom of assembly, freedom of movement, \n     freedom of speech, and freedom of the press for all Burmese \n     citizens;\n       (B) to immediately accept a political dialogue with Daw \n     Aung San Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy (NLD), \n     and ethnic leaders to advance peace and reconciliation in \n     Burma;\n       (C) to immediately and unconditionally release all detained \n     Members elected to the 1990 parliament and other political \n     prisoners; and\n       (D) to promptly and fully uphold the terms and conditions \n     of all human rights and related resolutions passed by the \n     United Nations General Assembly, the Commission on Human \n     Rights, the International Labor Organization, and the \n     European Union; and\n       (3) United States policy should sustain current economic \n     and political sanctions against Burma, and seek multilateral \n     support for those sanctions, as the appropriate means--\n       (A) to secure the restoration of democracy, human rights, \n     and civil liberties in Burma; and\n       (B) to support United States national security \n     counternarcotics interests.\n       Passed the Senate July 19, 2000.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/19/senate-section/article/S7283-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7283-S7284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SUPPORT FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS IN HAITI\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Res. 126\n\n       Whereas the legacy of fiat and abuse of the Duvalier \n     dictatorship led the framers of the 1987 Haitian constitution \n     to provide for clear separation of powers;\n       Whereas the 1987 Haitian constitution permanently vests all \n     legislative authority in an independent National Assembly;\n       Whereas national and local elections were held in Haiti on \n     May 21, 2000, which were intended to restore the independent \n     legislature which was dismissed by Haiti's President, Rene \n     Preval Garcia, in January 1999;\n       Whereas the Haitian people are to be congratulated for \n     patiently and peacefully voting in large numbers on May 21, \n     2000, despite an unfavorable electoral environment;\n       Whereas the legitimacy of the May 21, 2000, elections has \n     been compromised by organizational flaws, political murders, \n     the involvement of the Haitian National Police in the arrest \n     and intimidation of opposition figures, manipulation of the \n     independent Provisional Electoral Council by the Government \n     of Haiti and the ruling Fanmi Lavalas party, and the \n     publication of fraudulent results;\n       Whereas the Provisional Electoral Council has been \n     compromised by Fanmi Lavalas partisans operating within the \n     Council and inappropriate pressure and threats made against \n     members of the Council from the highest levels of the Haitian \n     government to induce the Council to issue fraudulent results;\n       Whereas Leon Manus, President of the Provisional Electoral \n     Council, was forced to flee Haiti in fear for his life and in \n     a statement released June 21, 2000 noted that the opposition \n     had made ``legitimate'' challenges to the credibility of the \n     electoral process and that the Council ``was often plagued \n     with traps and attacks'' and fought ``slanders and threats'' \n     that came ``most often from state actors'' and received \n     ``from the highest level of the government, unequivocal \n     messages on the consequences that would follow if [he] \n     refused to publish supposed final results'';\n       Whereas the Provisional Electoral Council is no longer \n     viewed as credible or independent by a broad spectrum of \n     political parties and civil society groups in Haiti;\n       Whereas Haitian organizations, including the Chamber of \n     Commerce, political parties, the Association of Haitian \n     Industrialists, the Roman Catholic Bishops Conference, and \n     the Protestant Federation have strongly protested the \n     publication of election results that do not correspond to the \n     provisions of Haiti's electoral law and generally accepted \n     norms and which have also been contested by the president of \n     the Provisional Electoral Council;\n       Whereas the international community, including the United \n     States, Canada, France, the United Nations, and the \n     Organization of American States, has condemned attempts to \n     manipulate the May 21, 2000, electoral process in Haiti; and\n       Whereas the absence of free and fair elections and the \n     resultant failure to constitute a duly elected legislative \n     body in Haiti constitutes a major setback for the Haitian \n     people's aspirations for peace and democracy, could result in \n     instability in Haiti, and directly jeopardizes United States \n     anti-narcotics objectives in Haiti and the region: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) condemns the electoral fraud being perpetrated against \n     the Haitian people and the continuing interruption of \n     democratic institutions in Haiti;\n       (2) calls on the Government of Haiti forthwith to end its \n     manipulation of the electoral process and take immediate \n     steps to reverse the fraudulent results announced by the \n     remaining members of the Provisional Electoral Council;\n       (3) calls on the Government of Haiti to immediately engage \n     in a thorough and verifiable process involving the National \n     Observation Council (CNO), all concerned Haitian political \n     parties, as well as private sector and other civil society \n     organizations, to review all reported irregularities and \n     allegations of fraud and authenticate the true results of the \n     election so that a legitimate, democratically-elected \n     National Assembly and local councils can be seated;\n       (4) urges the Organization of American States (OAS) to \n     consider joint actions by its members states to bring about a \n     return to democracy in Haiti; and\n       (5) calls on the President of the United States to--\n       (A) terminate United States assistance to the discredited \n     Provisional Electoral Council;\n       (B) review and modify as appropriate United States \n     political, economic, and law enforcement relations with \n     Haiti, if Haitian authorities persist in their current path;

Rept. 106-329). \nIn the interest of moving the bill to the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives promptly, the Committee on Science agreed not to \nexercise its right to report the legislation, provided that the House \nCommittee on Small Business agreed to add the selected portions of the \nScience Committee version of the legislation, as Sections 8 through 11 \nof the House floor text of H.R. 2392. H.R. 2392 passed the House \nwithout further amendment on September 27. The Science Committee \nprovisions were explained in floor statements by Congressmen \nSensenbrenner, Morella, and Mark Udall.\n\n[[Page S7288]]\n\n  On March 21, 2000, the Senate Committee marked up H.R. 2392 and on \nMay 10, 2000, reported the bill (S. Rept. 106-289). The Senate \nCommittee struck several of the sections originating from the House \nCommittee on Science and added sections not in the House-passed \nlegislation, including a requirement that Federal agencies with Small \nBusiness Innovation Research (SBIR) programs report their methodology \nfor calculating their SBIR budgets to the Small Business Administration \n(SBA) and a program to assist states in the development of small high-\ntechnology businesses. Negotiations then began among the leadership of \nthe Senate and House Committees on Small Business and the House \nCommittee on Science (hereinafter referred to as the three committees). \nThe resultant compromise text contains all major House and Senate \nprovisions, some of which have been amended to reflect a compromise \nposition. A section-by-section explanation of the revised text follows. \nFor purposes of this statement, the bill passed by the House of \nRepresentatives is referred to as the ``House version'' and the bill \nreported by the Senate Committee on Small Business is referred to as \nthe ``Senate version.''\n\n       Section 1. Short Title; Table of Contents. The compromise \n     text uses the Senate short title: ``Small Business Innovation \n     Research Program Reauthorization Act of 2000.'' The table of \n     contents lists the sections in the compromise text.\n       Section 2. Findings. The House and Senate versions of the \n     findings are very similar. The compromise text uses the House \n     version of the findings.\n       Section 3. Extension of the SBIR Program. The House version \n     extends the SBIR program for seven years through September \n     30, 2007. The Senate version extends the program for ten \n     years through September 30, 2010. The compromise text extends \n     the program for eight years through September 30, 2008.\n       Section 4. Annual Report. The House version provides for \n     the annual report on the SBIR program prepared by the SBA to \n     be sent to the Committee on Science, as well as to the House \n     and Senate Committees on Small Business that currently \n     receive it. The Senate version did not include this section. \n     The compromise text adopts the House language.\n       Section 5. Third Phase Activities. The compromise text of \n     this technical amendment is identical to both the House and \n     Senate versions.\n       Section 6. Policy Directive Modifications. The House \n     version includes policy directive modifications in Section 9 \n     and the requirement of a second phase commercial plan in \n     Section 10. The Senate version includes policy directive \n     modifications in Section 6. The Senate version and now the \n     compromise text require the Administrator to make \n     modifications to SBA's policy directives 120 days after the \n     date of enactment rather than the 30 days contained in the \n     House version. The compromise text drops the House policy \n     directive dealing with awards exceeding statutory dollar \n     amounts and time limits because this flexibility is already \n     being provided administratively. Addressed below is a \n     description of the policy directive modifications contained \n     in the compromise text that were not included in both the \n     Senate version and the House version.\n       Section 10 of the House version requires the SBA to modify \n     its policy directives to require that small businesses \n     provide a commercial plan with each application for a second-\n     phase award. The Senate version does not contain a similar \n     provision. The compromise text requires the SBA to modify its \n     policy directives to require that a small businesses provide \n     a ``succinct commercialization plan for each second phase \n     award moving towards commercialization.'' The three \n     committees acknowledge that commercialization is a current \n     element of the SBIR program. The statutory definition of \n     SBIR, which is not amended by H.R. 2392, includes ``a second \n     phase, to further develop proposals which meet particular \n     program needs, in which awards shall be made based on the \n     scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the \n     proposals, as evidenced by the first phase, considering among \n     other things the proposal's commercial potential'', and lists \n     evidence of commercial potential as the small business's \n     commercialization record, private sector funding commitments, \n     SBIR Phase III commitments, and the presence of other \n     indicators of the commercial potential. The three committees \n     do not intend that the addition of a commercialization plan \n     either increase or decrease the emphasis an agency places on \n     the commercialization when reviewing second-phase proposals. \n     Rather, the commercialization plan will give SBIR agencies a \n     means of determining the seriousness with which individual \n     applicants approach commercialization.\n       The commercialization plan, while concise, should show that \n     the business has thought through both the steps it must take \n     to prepare for the fruits of the SBIR award to enter the \n     commercial marketplace or government procurement and the \n     steps to build business expertise as needed during the SBIR \n     second phase time period. The three committees intend that \n     agencies take into consideration the stage of development of \n     the product or process in deciding whether an appropriate \n     commercialization plan has been submitted. In those instances \n     when at the time of the SBIR Phase II proposal, the grantee \n     cannot identify either a product or process with the \n     potential eventually to enter either the commercial or the \n     government marketplace, no commercialization plan is \n     required.\n       The compromise text also adds new provisions that were not \n     contained in either the Senate version or the House version. \n     Current law (Section 9(j)(3)(C) of the Small Business Act) \n     requires that the Administrator put in place procedures to \n     ensure, to the extent practicable, that an agency which \n     intends to pursue research, development or production of a \n     technology developed by a small business concern under an \n     SBIR program enter into follow-on, non-SBIR funding \n     agreements with the small business concern for such \n     research, development, or production. The three committees \n     are concerned that agencies sometimes provide these \n     follow-on activities to large companies who are in \n     incumbent positions or through contract bundling without \n     written justification or without the statutorily required \n     documentation of the impracticability of using the small \n     business for the work. So that the SBA and the Congress \n     can track the extent of this problem, the compromise text \n     requires agencies to record and report each such \n     occurrence and to describe in writing why it is \n     impractical to provide the research project to the \n     original SBIR company. Additionally, the compromise text \n     directs the SBA to develop policy directives to implement \n     the new subsection (v), Simplified Reporting Requirements. \n     This subsection requires that the directives regarding \n     collection of data be designed to minimize the burden on \n     small businesses; to permit the updating the database by \n     electronic means; and to use standardized procedures for \n     the collection and reporting of data.\n       Section 103(a)(2) of P.L. 102-564, which reauthorized the \n     SBIR program in 1992, added language to the description of a \n     third phase award which made it clear that the third phase is \n     intended to be a logical conclusion of research projects \n     selected through competitive procedures in phases one and \n     two. The Report of the House Committee on Small Business (H. \n     Rept. 102-554, Pt. I) provides that the purpose of that \n     clarification was to indicate the Committee's intent that an \n     agency which wishes to fund an SBIR project in phase three \n     (with non-SBIR monies) or enter into a follow-on procurement \n     contract with an SBIR company, need not conduct another \n     competition in order to satisfy the Federal Competition in \n     Contracting Act (CICA). Rather, by phase three the project \n     has survived two competitions and thus has already satisfied \n     the requirements of CICA, set forth in section 2302(2)(E) of \n     that Act, as they apply to the SBIR program. As there has \n     been confusion among SBIR agencies regarding the intent of \n     this change, the three committees reemphasize the intent \n     initially set forth in H. Rept. 102-554, Pt. 1, including the \n     clarification that follow-on phase three procurement \n     contracts with an SBIR company may include procurement of \n     products, services, research, or any combination intended for \n     use by the Federal government.\n       Section 7. Report on Programs for Annual Performance Plan. \n     This section requires each agency that participates in the \n     SBIR program to submit to Congress a performance plan \n     consistent with the Government Performance and Results Act. \n     The House and Senate versions have the same intent. The \n     compromise text uses the House version.\n       Section 8. Output and Outcome Data. Both the House and \n     Senate versions contain sections enabling the collection and \n     maintenance of information from awardees as is necessary to \n     assess the SBIR program. Both the Senate and House versions \n     require the SBA to maintain a public database at SBA \n     containing information on awardees from all SBIR agencies. \n     The Senate version adds paragraphs to the public database \n     section dealing with database identification of businesses or \n     subsidiaries established for the commercial application of \n     SBIR products or services and the inclusion of information \n     regarding mentors and mentoring networks. The House version \n     further requires the SBA to establish and maintain a \n     government database, which is exempt from the Freedom of \n     Information Act and is to be used solely for program \n     evaluation. Outside individuals must sign a non-disclosure \n     agreement before gaining access to the database. The \n     compromise text contains each of these provisions, with \n     certain modifications and clarifications, which are \n     addressed below.\n       With respect to the public database, the compromise text \n     makes clear that proprietary information, so identified by a \n     small business concern, will not be included in the public \n     database. With respect to the government database, the \n     compromise text clarifies that the inclusion of information \n     in the government database is not to be considered \n     publication for purposes of patent law. The compromise text \n     further permits the SBA to include in the government database \n     any information received in connection with an SBIR award the \n     SBA Administrator, in conjunction with the SBIR agency \n     program managers, consider to be relevant and appropriate or \n     that the Federal agency considers to be useful to SBIR \n     program evaluation.\n\n[[Page S7289]]\n\n       With respect to small business reporting for the government \n     database, the compromise text directs that when a small \n     business applies for a second phase award it is required to \n     update information in the government database. If an \n     applicant for a second phase award receives the award, it \n     shall update information in the database concerning the award \n     at the termination of the award period and will be requested \n     to voluntarily update the information annually for an \n     additional period of five years. This reporting procedure is \n     similar to current Department of defense requirements for the \n     reporting of such information. When sales or additional \n     investment information is related to more than one second \n     phase award is involved, the compromise text permits a small \n     business to apportion the information among the awards in any \n     way it chooses, provided the apportionment is noted on all \n     awards so apportioned.\n       The three committees understand that receiving complete \n     commercialization data on the SBIR program is difficult, \n     regardless of any reasonable time frame that could be \n     established for the reporting of such data. Commercialization \n     may occur many years following the receipt of a research \n     grant and research from an award, while not directly \n     resulting in a marketable product, may set the groundwork for \n     additional research that leads to such a product. \n     Nevertheless, the three committees believe that the \n     government database will provide useful information for \n     program evaluation.\n       Section 9. National Research Council Reports. The House \n     version requires the four largest SBIR program agencies to \n     enter into an agreement with the National Research Council \n     (NRC) to conduct a comprehensive study of how the SBIR \n     program has stimulated technological innovation and used \n     small businesses to meet Federal research and development \n     needs and to make recommendations on potential improvements \n     to the program. The Senate version contains no similar \n     provision. The study was designed to answer questions \n     remaining from the House Committees' reviews of these \n     programs and to make sure that a current evaluation of the \n     program is available when the program next comes up for \n     reauthorization.\n       The compromise text makes several changes to the House \n     text. The compromise text adds the National Science \n     Foundation to the agencies entering the agreement with the \n     NRC and requires the agencies to consult with the SBA in \n     entering such agreement. It also expands on the House \n     version, which requires a review of the quality of SBIR \n     research, to require a comparison of the value of projects \n     conducted under SBIR with those funded by other Federal \n     research and development expenditures. The compromise text \n     further broadens the House versions' review of the \n     economic rate of return of the SBIR program to require an \n     evaluation of the economic benefits of the SBIR program, \n     including economic rate of return, and a comparison of the \n     economic benefits of the SBIR program with that of other \n     Federal research and development expenditures. The \n     compromise text allows the NRC to choose an appropriate \n     time-frame for such analysis that results in a fair \n     comparison.\n       The three committees believe that a comprehensive report on \n     the SBIR program and its relation to other Federal research \n     expenditures will be useful in program oversight and will \n     provide Congress with an understanding of the effects of \n     extramural Federal research and development funding provided \n     to large and small businesses and universities. The three \n     committees understand, however, that measuring the direct \n     benefits to the nation's economy from the SBIR program and \n     other Federal research expenditures may be difficult to \n     calculate and may not provide a complete portrayal of the \n     benefits achieved by the SBIR program. Accordingly, the \n     legislation requires the NRC also to review the non-economic \n     benefits of the SBIR program, which may include, among other \n     matters, the increase in scientific knowledge that has \n     resulted from the program. The paragraph in the compromise \n     text calling for recommendations remains the same as the \n     House version, except that the bill now asks the NRC to make \n     recommendations, should there be any.\n       While the study is to be carried out within National \n     Research Council study guidelines and procedures, the \n     compromise text requires the NRC to take the steps necessary \n     to ensure that individuals from the small business community \n     with expertise in the SBIR program are well represented in \n     the panel established for performing the study and among the \n     peer reviewers of the study. The NRC is to consult with the \n     consider the views of the SBA's Office of Technology and the \n     SBA's Office of Advocacy and to conduct the study in an open \n     manner that makes sure that the views and experiences of \n     small business involved in the program are carefully \n     considered in the design and execution of the study. \n     Extension of the SBIR program for eight years rather than the \n     five being contemplated when the House study provision was \n     initially written has necessitated some adjustments in the \n     study. The report is now required three years rather than \n     four years after the date of enactment of the Act and the NRC \n     is to update the report within six years of enactment. The \n     update is intended to bring current, any information from the \n     study relevant to the reauthorization of the SBIR program. It \n     is not intended to be a second full-fledged study. In \n     addition, semiannual progress reports by NRC to the three \n     committees are required.\n       Section 10. Federal Agency Expenditures for the SBIR \n     Program. The Senate version requires each Federal agency with \n     an SBIR program to provide the SBA with report describing its \n     methodology for calculating its extramural budget for \n     purposes of SBIR program set-aside and requires the \n     Administrator of the SBA to include an analysis of the \n     methodology from each agency in its annual report to the \n     Congress. The House version has no similar provision. The \n     compromise text follows the Senate text except that it \n     specifies that each agency, rather than the agency's \n     comptroller, shall submit the agency's report to the \n     Administrator. The three committees intend that each agency's \n     methodology include an itemization of each research program \n     that is excluded from the calculation of its extramural \n     budget for SBIR purposes as well as a brief explanation of \n     why the agency feels each excluded program meets a \n     particular exemption.\n       Section 11. Federal and State Technology Partnership \n     Program. This section establishes the FAST program from the \n     Senate version, which is a competitive matching grant program \n     to encourage states to assist in the development of high-\n     technology businesses. The House version does not contain a \n     similar provision. The most significant changes from the \n     Senate version in the compromise text are an extension of the \n     maximum duration of awards from three years to five and the \n     lowering of the matching requirement for funds assisting \n     businesses in low income areas to 50 cents per federal \n     dollar, as advocated by Ranking Member Velazquez of the House \n     Small Business Committee. The compromise text combines the \n     definitions found in the Senate version of this section and \n     the mentoring networks section.\n       Section 12. Mentoring Networks. The Senate version sets \n     forth criteria for mentoring networks that organizations are \n     encouraged to establish with matching funds from the FAST \n     program and creates a database of small businesses willing to \n     act as mentors. The compromise text, except for relocating \n     the program definitions to Section 11, is the same as the \n     Senate text. The House version did not contain a similar \n     provision.\n       Section 13. Simplified Reporting Requirements. This section \n     is not in either the House or the Senate versions. It \n     requires the SBA Administrator to work with SBIR program \n     agencies on standardizing SBIR reporting requirements with \n     the ultimate goal of making the SBA's SBIR database more user \n     friendly. This provision requires the SBA to consider the \n     needs of each agency when establishing and maintaining the \n     database. Additionally, it requires the SBA to take measures \n     to reduce the administrative burden on SBIR program \n     participants whenever possible including, for example, \n     permitting updating by electronic means.\n       Section 14. Rural Outreach Program Extension. This \n     provision, which was not in either the House or the Senate \n     versions, extends the life and authorization for \n     appropriations for the Rural Outreach Program of the Small \n     Business Administration for four additional years through \n     fiscal year 2005. It is the intent of the three committees \n     that this program be evaluated on the same schedule and in \n     the same manner as the FAST program. Among other things, the \n     evaluation should examine the extent to which the programs \n     complement or duplicate each other. The evaluation should \n     also include recommendations for improvements to the program, \n     if any.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join me in \nvoting for H.R. 2392, the Small Business Innovation Research Program \nReauthorization Act of 2000. The Small Business Innovation Research \n(SBIR) program is a great example of how government and business can \nwork together to advance the cause of science, the diverse missions of \nthe government, and a healthy economy. The results have been dramatic \nfor small, high-technology companies participating in the program. \nSince 1983 when the program was started, some 16,000 small, high-\ntechnology firms have received more than 46,000 SBIR research awards \nthrough 1997, totaling $7.5 billion.\n  Technological advancement is a key element of economic growth. \nAccording to a Congressional Research Service Report, Small, High Tech \nCompanies and Their Role in the Economy: Issues in the Reauthorization \nof the Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Program, ``technical progress \nis responsible for up to one-half the growth of the U.S. economy and is \none of the principal driving forces for increases in our standard of \nliving.''\n  Mr. President, this bill, and the accompanying managers' amendment, \nare the products of months and months of work between Democrats and \nRepublicans, House and Senate, SBIR companies and SBIR advocates, the \nten Federal agencies that participate in the SBIR program, and the \nSmall Business Administration's Office of Technology and the Office of \nAdvocacy.\n  I want to thank Senator Bond and Senator Levin, and the members of \nthe House Committees on Small Business\n\n[[Page S7290]]\n\nand Science, and their staffs, for their hard work on this bill. Many \nof us had very different concerns regarding reauthorization of the SBIR \nprogram, and I greatly appreciate everyone's willingness to find common \nground where possible and compromise.\n  We wrestled with tough questions. How long to reauthorize the \nprogram? I wanted to make it permanent; it has a long and successful \ntrack record. In fact, in 1998, the Senate Committee on Small Business \nvoted to do just that, but that legislation never passed the House. \nThis year the Committee agreed to reauthorize the program for ten \nyears, giving the agencies and innovative small businesses a good \nmeasure of security to plan SBIR projects for the longer term. However, \nthe House Science Committee felt strongly that it should only be \nreauthorized for seven years. In the end, as reflected in this bill, we \ncompromised on eight, reauthorizing the bill through September 30, \n2008.\n  How to improve the quality and collection of data without \noverburdening small businesses? GAO reports have found that the SBIR \nprogram works well, but that the records are sometimes incomplete, \nmaking it harder to evaluate the program and track awards. I fully \nsupport the goal of collecting the best information possible to \nevaluate the program, but I don't want small businesses owners to spend \nmore time filling out paper work than absolutely necessary for that \npurpose. They are capable of developing cutting-edge research and \nmeeting national R needs and should spend the majority of their \nefforts on that. As Ranking Member of the Small Business Committee and \na Senator from the state whose small, hi-tech companies win the second \nlargest amount of SBIR awards, I heard many, many complaints and \nconcerns about the possibility of excessive and burdensome reporting \nrequirements. I also heard complaints that the same level of reporting \nis not required of universities and big business that get Federal R \ndollars. There were real fears that Congress would require SBIR award \nwinners to continue reporting to the SBA on SBIR research for years \nafter a contract ended and that tracking commercialization out of \ncontext would be used against the program and against individual SBIR \nfirms. Just knowing the ratio of awards to commercialization is not an \nindicator of success. By its very nature, R has a low probability of \ngetting a product to market in relation to the investment in research. \nIt is the ratio of commercialization in the SBIR program compared to \nthat of big business, universities and the private sector that may be \none indicator of the program's value to the government and to the \nnation. For example, one study shows that small businesses have 24 \ntimes as many innovations per R dollar as large businesses. In the \nend, we agreed to collect basic, but useful, information about sales \nand additional investment on Phase II awards. According to the \nDepartment of Defense that currently requires similar information, it \ngenerally takes less than 15 minutes to provide the information, and \ncompanies are only required to give the information during the life of \nthe contract.\n\n  Probably the biggest question we dealt with was how to increase the \nparticipation in the SBIR program in states, and areas of states, that \nreceive few or no awards. Though the number of awards given to a state \nhas been proportionate to the number of proposals submitted, according \nto a GAO study, one-third of the states receive 85 percent of all SBIR \nawards. And the states that submit the most proposals generally have \nthe right mix of small high-tech companies, an active venture capital \ncommunity, and universities that understand the benefits of technology \ntransfer, attract academic research funds and graduate a highly \nqualified workforce. While Massachusetts does extremely well in this \nprogram, for years I have recognized that the SBIR awards have been \nconcentrated in less than half the states. The problem has been how to \ncreate a solution that helps small businesses in states that don't have \nthe necessary infrastructure without changing the program's reliance on \ncompetition. Merit is the only way to maintain the integrity of the \nresearch because the highly competitive nature of SBIR awards (only one \nin seven or eight Phase I proposals is awarded) is one of the main \nreasons the program has been so popular and successful.\n  This bill takes two innovative approaches to increasing nationwide \nparticipation in the program. First, it establishes a peer volunteer \nmentoring network, which Senator Levin and I originally introduced as \nS. 1435 in 1999. Modeled after SBA's successful Service Corps of \nRetired Executives or SCORE program, this mentoring program would \nreimburse experienced SBIR companies that volunteer to assist one or \nmore newcomers to the program. They can help in a variety of ways, \nwhether it's writing proposals, understanding the Federal procurement \nprocess or a particular agency, tapping into venture capital, or \ncommercializing their technologies. The bill also directs the SBA to \ncreate a database with the names and profiles of successful SBIR \ncompanies interested in mentoring struggling or prospective SBIR \ncompanies. This will be used by the states to link companies to mentors \nbased on their needs.\n  Second, it creates the Federal and State Technology Partnership \n(FAST) program. This program is a competitive matching-grant program to \nencourage and help states cultivate high-tech small businesses and a \nbuild a support infrastructure in the state. I feel strongly, as does \nSenator Levin, and am very pleased, that all states, even the ones that \ncurrently win the most SBIR awards, are eligible to compete for a FAST \nmatching grant so that they can help develop small, hi-tech companies \nin areas of their states that don't have SBIR activity. For example, in \nMassachusetts, most of our awards are in the Boston area. But with \nthese grants, working with one of the economic development arms of our \nlocal government, we could coordinate and foster SBIR activity in the \nWestern part of the state close to Amherst and Northampton. Those \ncompanies could create high-quality, high-wage jobs where the cost \nstructure for companies is less expensive but where we have numerous \nuniversities and highly-skilled workers.\n  Given the strength of these initiatives, I do have some concerns \nabout mentoring getting lost in the states' FAST initiatives. For the \nrecord, I ask that the SBA, the program managers of participating SBIR \nagencies, and FAST entities promote this cost-effective tool. Take \nadvantage of the substantial pool of good-will and willingness to share \nexperiences of those who have been successful in the SBIR program. Let \nSBIR companies know that they will be reimbursed for relevant out-of-\npocket expenses if they choose to become a volunteer mentor. It gives \nthem another stake in this program, and will strengthen the program on \nmany levels. And, SBA and SBIR agencies should let prospective or \nstruggling SBIR companies know that veteran SBIR companies are out \nthere willing to help them understand the world of SBIR and federal \nprocurement.\n  Mr. President, these research and development awards not only provide \ndollars to small hi-tech companies that create quality jobs, but they \nalso help agencies meet their R needs. As one example, an Army SBIR \naward played a role in the development of the B-2 Bomber. Specifically, \nthe research led to the development of a ``pilot alert'' system which \nwarns the pilot if the plane is about to produce a trail of \ncondensation that could be detected by enemy radar. Sales to date, to \nboth the Air Force and commercial customers, exceed $27 million. And \nwhat about NASA? As the world watched the space shuttle Discovery in \n1998, the feature elements of two of the shuttle's payloads were \ndeveloped with SBIR funds.\n  In Woburn, Massachusetts, NZ-Applied Technologies used its SBIR award \nto help develop photonic components for optical telecommunications \napplications. The company is so successful that Corning recently bought \nit for $150 million. Further, the company was named as one of the top \n50 fastest growing companies in New England and top 500 fastest growing \ncompanies in the country.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their support of the SBIR program \nover the years. As always, I am pleased that we can work in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of \nthe Small Business Innovation Research program (SBIR) reauthorization\n\n[[Page S7291]]\n\nbill (H.R. 2392) that will reauthorize the SBIR program for eight more \nyears. An eight year reauthorization will allow participating agencies \nto continue to do long term planning for their research and development \n(R) needs. I'm especially pleased that this legislation includes my \nbill to establish a volunteer mentoring program.\n  The SBIR program, originally established in 1982 and reauthorized and \nexpanded in 1992, expires this year. This highly competitive program \nhas a well-deserved reputation for success and has enjoyed bipartisan \nsupport over the years. It improves upon what is already a successful \nprogram that gives small high technology companies access to federal \nresearch and development dollars and the federal government access to \nsome of the world's best innovation. I am pleased the full Senate is \nconsidering this legislation today and I hope House consideration will \nswiftly follow so that contracting agencies can be assured funding will \nbe available in this contract cycle.\n  I am a long time supporter of the SBIR program. The SBIR program \ncreates jobs, increases our capacity for technological innovation and \nboosts our international competitiveness. According to a recent GAO \nstudy, about 50 percent of all SBIR research is commercialized or \nreceives additional research funding. That's a pretty good success \nrate. It's also a great example of federal agencies working together \nwith small businesses to develop technologies to solve specific \nproblems and fill government procurement needs in a cost effective way.\n  The SBIR program is a highly successful program and we can make it \neven more successful by establishing an outreach and volunteer \nmentoring program to bring more high technology small businesses into \nthe program and help them successfully compete for awards. Many states \nbelieve they can do better regarding the number of SBIR awards their \nsmall businesses win. Since the SBIR program is a highly competitive \nand merit-based program, I believe the best way to increase \nparticipation is through outreach and mentoring. The SBIR \nreauthorization bill before the Senate today creates programs to do \nboth.\n  The Federal and States Technology Partnership Program (FAST) included \nin this bill establishes an outreach program through a technology \neconomic development program that aims to build more support for \nscience and technology research in states.\n  A natural complement to reaching out to new companies to tell them \nabout the SBIR program is the establishment of a ``mentoring network'' \nto increase their odds for success in that program. Many SBIR company \nofficials have benefitted from this R program, are committed to its \nsuccess and have told me they want to give something back by way of \nmentoring small companies new to the SBIR program. Many attribute their \nSBIR contracts with federal agencies as the main reason they have been \nable to successfully commercialize their research, make a ``real'' \nproduct, and expand employment in their companies. Through my proposal, \nmentoring networks will be established to match volunteer mentors with \nnew applicant high technology small businesses to help increase their \nchances for success in the SBIR program, and, ultimately, the \ncommercialization of their research. A small business's failure to \nobtain a phase I or phase II SBIR award may have nothing to do with the \ncapability of its technology but rather is often a result of a lack of \nunderstanding the government procurement process and procedures. \nMentoring will address this concern by matching the new company with \none that already knows the ropes of the SBIR program and federal \nprocurement process.\n  This is a cost effective program. Modeled after the successful SCORE \nprogram, the mentoring networks' volunteer mentors would be reimbursed \nonly for their out-of-pocket expenses. Their time, energy and know-how \nwould be donated free-of-charge. Specifically, the bill provides for \nthe establishment of mentoring networks that are eligible for matching \ngrants within the FAST program in each state. The mentoring network (an \nassociation, organization, coalition or other entity) will provide \nbusiness advice and counseling and assist small business concerns that \nhave been identified as good candidates for the SBIR program. Volunteer \nmentors are people associated with small businesses that have \nsuccessfully competed one or more SBIR funding agreement and have \nagreed to guide small business concerns through all stages of the SBIR \nprogram process.\n  The mentoring networks program also establishes an important publicly \naccessible national database housed at SBA to compile information on \nmentoring networks and volunteer mentors. This database will provide an \nimportant tool to increase small business' access to mentors. I urge \nSBA to devote its full attention to getting it up and running upon \nenactment of this legislation.\n  H.R. 2392 also expands the collection, reporting and maintenance of \ninformation for an SBA database regarding SBIR awards. It fixes a \nproblem identified by GAO by requiring a uniform definition of \n``extramural R budget,'' the formula used by each participating \nagency to determine the level of funds dedicated to the SBIR program. \nIt establishes a five year competitive matching grant pilot program \nadministered by the SBA for an organization or consortia to perform \noutreach and technology economic development within states, including \nestablishing or operating a mentoring network to provide advice and \ncounseling to SBIR applicants.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the reauthorization of this important \nhigh technology small business procurement program and the improvements \nto it that H.R. 2392 provides.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3944\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns], for Mr. Bond, for \n     himself, and Mr. Kerry, proposes an amendment numbered 3944.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the bill before us reauthorizes and improves \nupon one of the most successful small business programs we have in the \nFederal government--the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) \nprogram. The Small Business Committee has spent close to nine months \ndeliberating and negotiating this important bill. My colleagues on the \nCommittee, and in particular, Senators Kerry, Burns, Levin, Snowe and \nEnzi, have all been very cooperative and provided valuable assistance \nin preparing this important piece of legislation. The product that has \nresulted from the Committee's consideration is a bi-partisan bill that \nshould provide small businesses with confidence in the Congress' strong \nsupport for this program.\n  Mr. President, this Managers' Amendment is the result of negotiations \nconducted among my Committee and the Small Business and Science \nCommittees of the House of Representatives. The SBIR reauthorization \nbill that originally passed the House contained certain provisions that \nwere not included in the bill reported by the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness. These provisions had been interpreted by many in the small \nbusiness community to place requirements on small businesses receiving \nFederal research and development funds that are not placed on other \nbusinesses or on universities that are also recipients of such dollars. \nMy Committee negotiated with the representatives of the House Science \nCommittee, which drafted these provisions, to come up with language \nthat would provide information to Congress that is necessary for its \noversight of this program, while ensuring that small businesses are not \nsubject to government mandates that would affect their ability to \nperform high-quality research and development for the Federal \ngovernment. The House Science Committee has been very cooperative to \nensure that their provisions did not cause these unintended \nconsequences.\n  This bill, with the Managers' amendment will ensure that this \nprogram, which has been proven successful over a long period of time, \ncan continue to be so. Seventeen years ago, President Reagan signed \ninto law the Small Business Innovation Development Act, which required \nFederal agencies with extramural research and development\n\n[[Page S7292]]\n\nbudgets of $100 million or more to set aside not less than 2/10th of \none percent of that amount for the first SBIR program. In 1992, the \nprogram was reauthorized and Congress dictated that the program grow to \n2.5 percent of the extramural research and development budgets. \nThousands of small firms have received research grants under the \nprograms since 1982, and more than $1 billion was awarded to small \nbusinesses in Fiscal Year 1998 alone.\n  The original drafters of the SBIR program acknowledged that small \nbusinesses are the primary source of our nation's innovations. \nAccordingly, the SBIR program was created to stimulate technological \ndevelopment by leveraging the capabilities of these small firms. The \ngoals of the program are threefold. First, the program assists the \ngovernment with its research and development needs. Second, the program \nprovides a catalyst to groundbreaking research and development. Third, \nthe program strengthens our economy by promoting the commercialization \nof technologies developed through Federal research. The \ncommercialization of these technologies by small firms increases the \ncompetitiveness of our country in the world economy and expands \nemployment opportunities.\n  A good example of the benefits that the SBIR program provides to \nsmall businesses is the experience of Cutting Edge Optronics, a 49 \nemployee firm in St. Charles, Missouri. Cutting Edge Optronics has \nreceived several phase one and phase two SBIR awards with NASA and the \nAir Force to develop high-output lasers with both military and \ncommercial applications.\n  The SBIR program has made the difference between Cutting Edge \nOptronics growing its business and merely staying in business. The SBIR \nprogram has allowed Cutting Edge to engage in state-of-the-art research \nin a very competitive climate, which it otherwise would not have been \nable to do. Moreover, if the Air Force research develops successfully, \nCutting Edge Optronics expects that the commercial applications of the \ntechnology will spur astronomical growth of the company.\n  Mr. President, small businesses are the greatest job creators in our \neconomy. During the last seven years of economic growth, small \nbusinesses have accounted for the vast majority of all the net new jobs \ncreated. It is only rational that the Federal government distribute its \nresearch funds in a way that will contribute to this job growth by \ncreating incentives to the private sector to market the technologies \ndeveloped. As the example of Cutting Edge Optronics demonstrates, the \nSBIR program does just that.\n\n  There is abundant evidence that the SBIR program has been a success \nboth in assisting the government with its research and development \nneeds and in turning that research into new products and services. \nNumerous studies have been conducted over the last several years that \nbear this out. A 1989 General Accounting Office (GAO) study reported \nthat scientists and engineers at Federal agencies indicated that the \noverall quality of the research performed under SBIR awards equaled, \nand in some cases, exceeded the quality of other agency research they \nmonitored. As the program has grown in recent years, it does not appear \nthis conclusion has changed. A 1995 GAO study concluded that the \nquality of SBIR research proposals has kept pace with the program's \nexpansion.\n  Morever, the small businesses that have received SBIR awards, have \nhad significant success in commercializing technology. This is \nespecially important considering that these firms are engaging in \ncutting-edge research that will not always have a commercial \napplication. A 1997 internal Department of Defense study found that the \naverage phase-two SBIR award of $400,000 generated $760,000 in sales \nand attracted approximately $600,000 in additional non-SBIR funding. \nAdditionally, the GAO has reported that the commercialization rate on \nSBIR projects is close to 40 percent. There is no question that this \nprogram's record of success easily justifies a long reauthorization.\n  While there is general agreement that the SBIR program is successful, \nthere have also been some concerns that this legislation is intended to \nresolve. First, the GAO released a report in June 1998, indicating that \ndifferent agencies are using different interpretations of the term \n``extramural budget.'' The use of different interpretations may lead to \ninaccurate calculations of the amount of funds that should be allocated \nto each agency's SBIR program. To remedy this situation, the bill \nrequires each SBIR program agency to provide the Small Business \nAdministration (SBA) and Congress with a description of its methodology \nfor calculating the amount of the extramural budget for that agency. It \nis our hope that by closely analyzing how the agencies are calculating \ntheir extramural budgets, we can be assured that each agency will adopt \na uniform definition of extramural budget that is consistent with the \nstatutory language and Congress' intent.\n  Second, the Committee on Small Business, which I chair, has received \nfrom the GAO disturbing information regarding the SBA's collection and \nmaintenance of data on the SBIR program. Specifically, my Committee \nlearned that the GAO, in preparing its two most recent reports on the \nSBIR program, spent substantial resources correcting and updating \ninformation in the SBA's SBIR database. When the Federal government is \nproviding funds to third parties, whether in the private sector or to a \nstate or local government entity, the most basic rule of program \noversight is to monitor who has received those funds and what they have \ndone with the funds. Accordingly, this legislation establishes a \nstatutory duty on the SBIR program agencies to provide the SBA with \ndata on each SBIR award winner in a timely manner. Moreover, it \nrequires the SBA to maintain a comprehensive and public database of the \nsmall firms that receive SBIR awards and the activities supported by \nSBIR funds.\n  Finally, the GAO recently issued a report raising questions about the \ngeographic concentration of SBIR awards. From fiscal year 1993 through \n1996, companies in one-third of the states received 85 percent of the \nSBIR awards. Companies on the east and west coast received a vast \nmajority of these awards, while companies in the South, Midwest and \nRocky Mountain states generally received very few awards. For example, \nthe GAO reported that in fiscal year 1997, companies in Massachusetts \nand California received 202 and 326 phase-two awards, respectively, out \nof approximately 1,400 awards nationally. Thus, they received almost 38 \npercent of the awards.\n  Mr. President, if the SBIR program is going to continue to be \nsuccessful, it is incumbent on us to do more to reach out and provide \nopportunities to firms in the South, the Midwest and the Rocky Mountain \nstates that can provide high-quality research and development and \nprovide them with the information and assistance they need so that they \nmay seize the opportunity to participate in the SBIR program. The SBIR \nprogram was never intended to serve a limited group of small \nbusinesses, and we must do all we can to increase the participation of \nas many small businesses as possible.\n  Therefore, this legislation establishes a comprehensive program to \nassist states in the development of high-technology businesses that \ncould participate in the SBIR program. Specifically, the bill creates a \nmatching-grant program for organizations at the state or local level \nattempting to enhance or develop technology research and development by \nsmall business concerns. This legislation acknowledges that states that \ndo not aggressively support the development of high-technology firms \nare at a competitive disadvantage in establishing a business climate \nconducive to technology development. More importantly, however, \nbuilding stronger support for high-technology firms will expand \neconomic opportunities for our country generally and will increase our \ncompetitiveness in the world market.\n  The Small Business Innovation Research Program Reauthorization Act of \n2000 is a necessary step to ensure that the Federal Government \ncontinues to utilize the vast capabilities of high-technology small \nbusinesses to meet its research and development goals. Moreover, it \nensures that these research funds are leveraged to strengthen our \nNation's economy and its position as the lead innovator in the world.\n  The bill in front of us, with the Managers' amendment, is a \nreasonable\n\n[[Page S7293]]\n\ncompromise that will provide an effective structure for this program \nfor the next eight years. Given the hard work that has gone into this \ncompromise legislation, I trust that the House will act quickly on this \nbill, so that small businesses involved in the SBIR program will have \nconfidence that the program will continue without interruption.\n  A bi-partisan statement has been drafted by the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and the Committees on Science and Small Business of the \nHouse of Representatives to explain provisions in the Managers' \namendment that are not addressed in either the Senate or House \nCommittee reports on H.R. 2392. I ask unanimous consent that, \nimmediately following my remarks, this Explanatory Statement of H.R. \n2392 be included in the Record.\n  Thank you Mr. President and I ask for immediate consideration of the \nbill and its approval.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to, the committee amendment, as amended, be agreed to, the \nbill be considered read the third time and passed, as amended, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3944) was agreed to.\n  The committee amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 2392), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/19/senate-section/article/S7293-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7293-S7297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TIMBISHA SHOSHONE HOMELAND ACT\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 661, S. 2102.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2102) to provide to the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe \n     a permanent land base within its aboriginal homeland, and for \n     other purposes, which had been reported from the Committee on \n     Indian Affairs, with an amendment to strike out all after the \n     enacting clause and insert the part printed in italic:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Timbisha Shoshone Homeland \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since time immemorial, the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe has \n     lived in portions of California and Nevada. The Tribe's \n     ancestral homeland includes the area that now comprises Death \n     Valley National Park and other areas of California and Nevada \n     now administered by the Bureau of Land Management.\n       (2) Since 1936, the Tribe has lived and governed the \n     affairs of the Tribe on approximately 40 acres of land near \n     Furnace Creek in the Park.\n       (3) The Tribe achieved Federal recognition in 1983 but does \n     not have a land base within the Tribe's ancestral homeland.\n       (4) Since the Tribe commenced use and occupancy of the \n     Furnace Creek area, the Tribe's membership has grown. Tribal \n     members have a desire and need for housing, government and \n     administrative facilities, cultural facilities, and \n     sustainable economic development to provide decent, safe, and \n     healthy conditions for themselves and their families.\n       (5) The interests of both the Tribe and the National Park \n     Service would be enhanced by recognizing their coexistence on \n     the same land and by establishing partnerships for compatible \n     land uses and for the interpretation of the Tribe's history \n     and culture for visitors to the Park.\n       (6) The interests of both the Tribe and the United States \n     would be enhanced by the establishment of a land base for the \n     Tribe and by further delineation of the rights and \n     obligations of each with respect to the Furnace Creek area \n     and to the Park as a whole.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       Consistent with the recommendations of the report required \n     by section 705(b) of the California Desert Protection Act of \n     1994 (Public Law 103-433; 108 Stat. 4498), the purposes of \n     this Act are--\n       (1) to provide in trust to the Tribe land on which the \n     Tribe can live permanently and govern the Tribe's affairs in \n     a modern community within the ancestral homeland of the Tribe \n     outside and within the Park;\n       (2) to formally recognize the contributions by the Tribe to \n     the history, culture, and ecology of the Park and surrounding \n     area;\n       (3) to ensure that the resources within the Park are \n     protected and enhanced by--\n       (A) cooperative activities within the Tribe's ancestral \n     homeland; and\n       (B) partnerships between the Tribe and the National Park \n     Service and partnerships involving the Bureau of Land \n     Management;\n       (4) to ensure that such activities are not in derogation of \n     the purposes and values for which the Park was established;\n       (5) to provide opportunities for a richer visitor \n     experience at the Park through direct interactions between \n     visitors and the Tribe including guided tours, \n     interpretation, and the establishment of a tribal museum and \n     cultural center;\n       (6) to provide appropriate opportunities for economically \n     viable and ecologically sustainable visitor-related \n     development, by the Tribe within the Park, that is not in \n     derogation of the purposes and values for which the Park was \n     established; and\n       (7) to provide trust lands for the Tribe in 4 separate \n     parcels of land that is now managed by the Bureau of Land \n     Management and authorize the purchase of 2 parcels now held \n     in private ownership to be taken into trust for the Tribe.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Park.--The term ``Park'' means Death Valley National \n     Park, including any additions to that Park.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior or the designee of the Secretary.\n       (3) Tribal.--The term ``tribal'' means of or pertaining to \n     the Tribe.\n       (4) Tribe.--The term ``Tribe'' means the Timbisha Shoshone \n     Tribe, a tribe of American Indians recognized by the United \n     States pursuant to part 83 of title 25, Code of Federal \n     Regulations (or any corresponding similar regulation or \n     ruling).\n       (5) Trust lands.--The term ``trust lands'' means those \n     lands taken into trust pursuant to this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Timbisha Shoshone Homeland \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since time immemorial, the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe has \n     lived in portions of California and Nevada. The Tribe's \n     ancestral homeland includes the area that now comprises Death \n     Valley National Park and other areas of California and Nevada \n     now administered by the Bureau of Land Management.\n       (2) Since 1936, the Tribe has lived and governed the \n     affairs of the Tribe on approximately 40 acres of land near \n     Furnace Creek in the Park.\n       (3) The Tribe achieved Federal recognition in 1983 but does \n     not have a land base within the Tribe's ancestral homeland.\n       (4) Since the Tribe commenced use and occupancy of the \n     Furnace Creek area, the Tribe's membership has grown. Tribal \n     members have a desire and need for housing, government and \n     administrative facilities, cultural facilities, and \n     sustainable economic development to provide decent, safe, and \n     healthy conditions for themselves and their families.\n       (5) The interests of both the Tribe and the National Park \n     Service would be enhanced by recognizing their coexistence on \n     the same land and by establishing partnerships for compatible \n     land uses and for the interpretation of the Tribe's history \n     and culture for visitors to the Park.\n       (6) The interests of both the Tribe and the United States \n     would be enhanced by the establishment of a land base for the \n     Tribe and by further delineation of the rights and \n     obligations of each with respect to the Furnace Creek area \n     and to the Park as a whole.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       Consistent with the recommendations of the report required \n     by section 705(b) of the California Desert Protection Act of \n     1994 (Public Law 103-433; 108 Stat. 4498), the purposes of \n     this Act are--\n       (1) to provide in trust to the Tribe land on which the \n     Tribe can live permanently and govern the Tribe's affairs in \n     a modern community within the ancestral homeland of the Tribe \n     outside and within the Park;\n       (2) to formally recognize the contributions by the Tribe to \n     the history, culture, and ecology of the Park and surrounding \n     area;\n       (3) to ensure that the resources within the Park are \n     protected and enhanced by--\n       (A) cooperative activities within the Tribe's ancestral \n     homeland; and\n       (B) partnerships between the Tribe and the National Park \n     Service and partnerships involving the Bureau of Land \n     Management;\n       (4) to ensure that such activities are not in derogation of \n     the purposes and values for which the Park was established;\n       (5) to provide opportunities for a richer visitor \n     experience at the Park through direct interactions between \n     visitors and the Tribe including guided tours, \n     interpretation, and the establishment of a tribal museum and \n     cultural center;\n       (6) to provide appropriate opportunities for economically \n     viable and ecologically sustainable visitor-related \n     development, by the Tribe within the Park, that is not in \n     derogation of the purposes and values for which the Park was \n     established; and\n       (7) to provide trust lands for the Tribe in 4 separate \n     parcels of land that is now managed by the Bureau of Land \n     Management and authorize the purchase of 2 parcels now held \n     in private ownership to be taken into trust for the Tribe.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 1791, and \nthe Senate then proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1791) to amend title 18, United States Code, \n     to provide for penalties for harming animals used in Federal \n     law enforcement.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am proud to support H.R. 1791, the Federal \nLaw Enforcement Animal Protection Act, a bill by Representative Weller \nwhich would make it a federal crime to willfully and maliciously harm \nan animal used by a Federal agency for the principal purpose of \ninvestigating crimes, enforcing laws, or apprehending criminals.\n  I would first like to thank Senator Hatch for his help in discharging \nthis important bill from Committee. I would also like to thank the \nadvocacy groups and agencies, most notably, the Humane Society of the \nU.S., U.S. Police Canine Association, U.S. Customs Service, U.S. Border \nPatrol, and our very own Capital Police, for helping to publicize the \nneed for legislation to protect federal law enforcement animals.\n  I was pleased when Representative Weller called me and asked for my \nsupport of H.R. 1791. Under current law, a person who willfully injures \na federal law enforcement animal can only be punished under the statute \nthat makes it a crime to damage federal property.\n  Unfortunately, many of these animals have a monetary value of less \nthan a $1,000, even though their training can cost up to $20,000, so \nthe act of willfully harming them can only be prosecuted as a \nmisdemeanor. H.R. 1791 will address this problem and punish willful and \nmalicious harm done to these animals more severely than an act of \ndamage to an inanimate object.\n  This bill is important for law enforcement. These animals play an \nintegral role in protecting our borders, airports and our own capital \ngrounds. In fiscal year 1999, U.S. Customs Canine Enforcement Teams \nwere involved in over 11,000 narcotic or currency seizures. The street \nvalue of the narcotics uncovered by the canines exceeded several \nbillion dollars. The dogs detected approximately 631,909 pounds of \nmarijuana, 50,748 pounds of cocaine, 358 pounds of heroin, and $25.5 \nmillion in currency. H.R. 1791 would put federal law enforcement \nanimals on equal ground with local law enforcement animals that are \nprotected in 27 states, including my own state of Arizona.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1791) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/19/senate-section/article/S7298-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7298-S7301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           DISASTER MITIGATION AND COST REDUCTION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, Senator Smith of New Hampshire has an \namendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana (Mr. Burns), for Mr. Smith of New \n     Hampshire, proposes an amendment numbered 3946.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today in favor of \npassage of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 1999. As the chairman of the \nSenate Subcommittee with jurisdiction over FEMA, I have been working on \nthis legislation for the last couple of years. Senator Graham and I \nintroduced this legislation last fall and have been working diligently \non it ever since. We can both attest to this process being long and \narduous, with many unforeseen pitfalls. However, the final result has \nbeen a piece of legislation that while changing the scope of disaster \nassistance, continues to assure that FEMA will have the resources and \nthe capability to deliver disaster assistance when called upon.\n  As we all know, the Federal government, through FEMA, has been there \nto help people and their communities deal with the aftermath of \ndisasters for over a generation. As chairman of it's oversight \nSubcommittee, I want to ensure that FEMA will continue to respond and \nhelp people in need for generations to come.\n  Unfortunately, this goal is becoming increasingly difficult since the \ncosts of disaster recovery have spiraled out of control. For every \nmajor disaster Congress is forced to appropriate additional funds \nthrough Supplemental Emergency Spending Bills, another of which we will \nbe discussing at some point later this year. This not only plays havoc \nwith the budget and forces us to spend funds which would have gone to \nother pressing needs, but sets up unrealistic expectations of what the \nfederal government can and should do after a disaster.\n  For instance, following the Oklahoma City tornadoes on May 3, 1999, \nthere was an estimated $900 million in damage, with a large portion of \nthat in federal disaster assistance. In the aftermath of hurricane \nFloyd in North Carolina, estimates of $1 billion or more in damage have \nbeen discussed. This problem is not just isolated to Oklahoma City or \nNorth Carolina. In the period between fiscal years 1994 and 1998, FEMA \ndisaster assistance and relief costs grew from $8.7 billion to $19 \nbillion. That marks a $10.3 billion increase in disaster assistance in \njust five years. To finance these expenditures, we have been forced to \nfind over $12 billion in rescissions.\n  The Bill we are passing today will address this problem from two \ndifferent directions. First, it authorizes a Predisaster Hazard \nMitigation Program, which assists people in preparing for disaster \nbefore they happen. Second, it provides a number of cost-saving \nmeasures to help control the costs of disaster assistance.\n  In our bill, we are authorizing Project Impact, FEMA's natural \ndisaster mitigation program. Project Impact authorizes the use of small \ngrants to local communities to give them funds and technical assistance \nto mitigate against disasters before they occur; but this is not just a \nfederal give-away program. Local communities are required to have a \ndemonstrated public-private partnership before they can become a \nProject Impact community.\n  Too often, we think of disaster assistance only after a disaster has \noccurred. For the very first time, we are authorizing a program to \nthink about preventing disaster-related damage prior to the disaster. \nWe believe that by spending these small amounts in advance of a \ndisaster, we will save the federal government money in the long-term. \nHowever, it is important to note that we are not authorizing this \nprogram in perpetuity. The program, as adopted, is set to expire in \n2003. If Project Impact is successful, we will have the appropriate \nopportunity to review its work and make a determination on whether to \ncontinue the program.\n  This forward thinking approach is revolutionary in terms of the way \nthe federal government responds to a disaster. We all know it is more \ncost effective to prevent damage than to respond after the fact. I \nshould note that in my state of Oklahoma, which has recently been hit \nby severe flooding, one of the affected communities, my home town of \nTulsa, was a Project Impact community. While the community suffered \nsome damage, the effects could have been much more severe had the \ncommunity not undertaken preventative mitigation measures.\n\n[[Page S7299]]\n\n  In passing this bill, we are also allowing states to keep a larger \npercentage of their federal disaster funds for state mitigation \nprojects. Under current law, states can only retain up to 15 percent of \ntheir post disaster assistance funds for state-wide mitigation \nprograms. We are now increasing that percentage to 20 percent. Too \noften states have run into the program of too many mitigation projects, \nwith too little resources.\n  For example, in Oklahoma, the state used its share of disaster funds \nto provide a tax rebate to the victims of the May 1999 tornadoes who, \nwhen rebuilding their homes, build a ``safe room'' into their home. \nBecause of limited funding, this assistance is only available to those \nwho were unfortunate enough to lose everything they owned. The ``safe \nroom'' program in Oklahoma is a prime example of giving states more \nflexibility in determining their own mitigation priorities and giving \nthem the financial assistance to follow through with their plans.\n  An additional problem we remedy with the increase is the lack of \ncomprehensive state-wide mitigation plans. Under current law, states \nare required to submit mitigation plans to FEMA, at which time they are \nroutinely approved. However, as a condition of receipt of increased \nfunding, states are going to have to do a better job at bridging the \ngap between state and local mitigation plans by developing \ncomprehensive mitigation plans so that in the aftermath of a disaster, \nstates know what their most vulnerable areas are and can take \nappropriate preventative measures.\n  While we are attempting to re-define the way in which we respond to \nnatural disaster, we must also look to curb the rising cost of post-\ndisaster related assistance. The intent of the original Stafford Act \nwas to provide federal assistance after States and local communities \nhad exhausted all their existing resources. As I said earlier, we have \nlost sight of this intent.\n  To meet our cost saving goal, we are making significant changes to \nFEMA's Public Assistance (PA) Program. One of the most significant \nchanges in the PA Program focuses on the use of insurance. FEMA is \ncurrently developing an insurance rule to require States and local \ngovernment to maintain private or self-insurance in order to qualify \nfor the PA Program. We applaud their efforts and are providing them \nwith with some parameters we expect them to follow in developing any \ninsurance rule.\n\n  While FEMA's progress in this area is commendable, it has come at the \nconsiderable opposition from States and local governments who fear the \nimpact of any new insurance regulation. Instead of ignoring the \nconcerns of the stakeholders, we have sought to work with them and \nbring their views to the table early in the regulatory process. As FEMA \ncontinues its work towards an insurance regulation, States and local \ngovernments are now assured that the final rule will encompass their \nconcerns.\n  Second, we are providing FEMA with the ability to estimate the cost \nof repairing or rebuilding projects. Under current law, FEMA is \nrequired to stay in the field and monitor the rebuilding of public \nstructures. By requiring FEMA to stay afield for years after the \ndisaster, we run up the administrative cost of projects. Allowing them \nto estimate the cost of repairs and close out the project will bring \nimmediate assistance to the State or local community and save the \nFederal government money.\n  In all, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects our bill to \nsave approximately $238 million over five years. I personally feel this \nis an underestimate. CBO, because of budget rules, is unable to take \ninto account any savings that occur outside the initial five-year \nwindow. Yet, CBO says in its analysis that long-term savings are likely \nas a result of the predisaster mitigation measures included in the \nbill. CBO also says it cannot quantify the savings associated with the \nimplementation of any future insurance rule. Yet, common sense tells us \nthat if public buildings have some level of private insurance, federal \nspending under the Public Assistance Program will be reduced.\n  Mr. President, we have spent months working closely with other \nSenators, FEMA, the States, local communities, and other stakeholders \nto produce a bill that gives FEMA the increased ability to respond to \ndisasters, while assuring States and local communities that the federal \ngovernment will continue to meet its commitments. Our bill has the \nendorsement of the National League of Cities, the National Emergency \nManagers Association , and FEMA.\n  In closing, I want to thank Senators Graham, Smith, and Baucus for \ntheir help and the leadership they have taken on this important issue. \nI would also like to thank Senators Voinovich, Grassley, DeWine, and \nBond for their support of this legislation. Without their help, input, \nand insight this legislation would be little more than an idea. I look \nforward to continuing to work with them as this bill moves to \nconference to make this legislation a reality.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in support of the \namendments to the Stafford Act in the form of H.R. 707. I would like to \nthank Senators Inhofe and Graham and their staff for all their hard \nwork in developing a good bipartisan bill. I am proud the committee I \nchair was able to report a bill to the floor with strong bipartisan \nsupport. I am also very pleased the version the Senate passed will save \nthe taxpayer money both in the short and long term.\n  This bill makes great strides to enhance FEMA's ability to better \nserve the public in times of disaster. It will also help local \ncommunities to better prepare and mitigate potential problems prior to \na disaster. The mitigation focus in this bill will ensure better \nprotection of life and property as well as providing savings to the \ntaxpayer.\n  The substitute H.R. 707 that has been agreed to by the Senate is \nidentical language to that in S. 1691 as amended by the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works with the additional Technical and \nManagers' amendments that were filed. Those who wish to research the \nlegislative history of H.R. 707, as passed by the Senate, should refer \nto the legislative history of S. 1691 and the report, number 106-295, \nfiled by the Committee on Environment and Public Works on S. 1691.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to join my distinguished colleague \nfrom Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, upon the passage of our legislation to \nreauthorize the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and to \ncreate public and private incentives to reduce the cost of future \ndisasters.\n  On June 1st, we will face the beginning of the 2000 Hurricane season, \nthe National Weather Service has predicted that the United States will \nface at least three intense hurricanes during the next six months.\n  Coming just eight years after Hurricane Andrew damaged 128,000 homes, \nleft approximately 160,000 people homeless, and caused nearly $30 \nbillion in damage, this forecast reminds us of the inevitability and \ndestructive power of Mother Nature. We must prepare for natural \ndisasters now in order to minimize their devastating effects.\n  It is impossible to prevent violent weather. Our experiences since \nHurricane Andrew--including the Northridge Earthquake, the Upper \nMidwest Floods, and Hurricanes Fran and Floyd--clearly demonstrate the \noverwhelming losses associated with major weather events.\n  However, Congress can reduce these losses by legislating a \ncomprehensive, nationwide mitigation strategy. Senator Inofe and I have \nworked closely with our colleagues in the Senate, FEMA, the National \nEmergency Management Association, the National League of Cities, the \nAmerican Red Cross, and numerous other groups to construct a \ncomprehensive proposal that will make mitigation--not response and \nrecovery--the primary focus of emergency management. In addition, I \nwould like to recognize the efforts of Senator Bond, Chairman of FEMA's \nappropriations subcommittee, in working closely with us to pass this \nlegislation.\n  This legislation amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act by:\n  Authorizing programs for pre-disaster emergency preparedness;\n  Streamlining the administration of disaster relief;\n  Controlling the Federal costs of disaster assistance; and\n  Providing real incentives for the development of community-sponsored \ndisaster mitigation projects.\n\n[[Page S7300]]\n\n  Mr. President, history has demonstrated that no community in the \nUnited States is safe from disasters. From tropical weather along the \nAtlantic Coast to devastating floods in the Upper Midwest to \nearthquakes in the Pacific Rim, all Americans have suffered as a result \nof Mother Nature's fury.\n  She will strike again. But we can avoid some of the excessive human \nand financial costs of the past by applying both what we have learned \nabout disaster preparedness and by implementing new technologies that \nare available to mitigate against loss.\n  Florida has been a leader in incorporating the principles and \npractice of hazard mitigation into the mainstream of community \npreparedness. We have developed and implemented mitigation projects \nusing funding from the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, the Flood \nMitigation Assistance Program, FEMA's Project Impact, and many other \npublic-private partnerships.\n  All Americans play a role in reducing the risks associated with \nnatural and technological hazards. Engineers, hospital administrators, \nbusiness leaders, regional planners, emergency managers and volunteers \neach contribute to community-wide mitigation efforts.\n  A successful mitigation project may be as basic as the Miami Wind \nShutter program. The installation of shutters is a cost-effective \nmitigation measure that has proven effective in protecting buildings \nfrom hurricane force winds, and in the process, minimizing direct and \nindirect losses to vulnerable facilities. These shutters significantly \nincrease strength and provide increased protection of life and \nproperty.\n  For example, Hurricane Andrew did $17 million worth of damage to \nthree hospitals in Miami. These facilities included Baptist, Miami \nSouth, and Mercy Hospitals. Through the Hazard Mitigation Grant \nProgram, these hospitals were retrofitted with wind shutters. Six years \nafter Hurricane Georges brushed against South Florida, this mitigation \nproject paid real dividends. Mercy Hospital estimated that the $2 \nmillion investment in their shutters protected their $230 million \nmedical complex. In addition, the track of this storm motivated \nevacuees to leave more vulnerable areas of South Florida to seek \nshelter. The protective shutters allowed this hospital to be used as a \nsafe haven for 200 pregnant mothers, prevented the need to evacuate \ncritical patients, and helped the staff's families to secure shelter \nduring the response effort.\n  In July of 1994, Tropical Storm Alberto's impact on the Florida \nPanhandle triggered more than $500 million in federal disaster \nassistance. State and local officials concluded that the most direct \nsolution to the problem of repetitive flooding was to remove or \ndemolish the structures at risk. A Community Development Block Grant of \n$27.5 million was used to assist local governments in acquiring 388 \nextremely vulnerable properties.\n  The success of this effort was evident when the same area experienced \nflooding again in the spring of 1998. Although both floods were of \ncomparable severity, the damages from the second disaster were \nsignificantly lower in the communities that acquired the flood prone \nproperties. In summary, this mitigation project reduced the \ncommunities' vulnerability to loss.\n  Today, we will reinforce the working partnership between the federal \ngovernment, the states, local communities and the private sector. In \nmitigating the devastating effects of natural disasters, it is also \nimperative that we control the cost of disaster relief. Our legislation \nwill help both of these efforts. I thank my colleagues for their \nsupport of this initiative.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe Disaster Mitigation and Cost Reduction Act, and more importantly--\nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n  When I was elected to the Senate more than a year ago, I didn't think \nI would be faced with such an enormous challenge my first year in \noffice--helping my state rebuild from the one of the worst hurricanes \nin our history. On September 16, Hurricane Floyd pounded eastern North \nCarolina. Sixty-six counties, more than 70 percent of the state--were \ndeclared federal disaster areas. Fifty-seven people were killed, and \nmore than 60,000 homes were affected.\n  I've come to the floor many times and praised the courage and the \nstrength of eastern North Carolinians. Through this disaster, I have \nmet some of the most spirited and strong people. And I have also met \nsome of the most knowledgeable and caring federal workers--the men and \nwomen of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Whether it was \nDirector James Lee Witt, who visited my office many times to keep me \nup-to-date on the federal response, or any of the field representatives \nwho explained the programs available to the victims, FEMA helped North \nCarolina begin the long recovery process. And today, ten months after \nthe storm hit, FEMA is still helping us coordinate the federal and \nstate recovery efforts. It's been said before--and I now know first-\nhand--that Director Witt turned FEMA from a disaster of an agency into \na disaster response team.\n  The measure we pass today will help make simple changes to ensure \nthis agency continues to offer first-rate response. Most importantly, \nthe bill before us would increase the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program \ncap from 15 percent to 20 percent. We can't stop a hurricane, tornado \nor earthquake, but we can take concrete steps to mitigate damage. \nIncreasing the amount States are allowed to spend on mitigation will \ngive those governments the necessary resources to move those people out \nof harm's way. That means less future damage and less costly disasters.\n  H.R. 707 also authorizes Project Impact. New Hanover County, in my \nstate, was one of the first seven pilot Project Impact communities. \nProject Impact is FEMA's predisaster mitigation program that works \ndirectly with communities across the country to help them become more \ndisaster-resistant. In New Hanover County, residents are determined to \nbuild better, stronger and smarter in order to prevent damage from the \ninevitable late-summer hurricanes. The University of North Carolina at \nWilmington is also involved in the effort to mitigate disasters. That's \nthe great thing about the Project Impact communities--they are using \nall available agencies and organizations to ensure safe and smart \ndevelopment. We should officially recognize these communities efforts \nand encourage the same work in other disaster prone areas.\n   Finally, in my State we know how the Federal government's disaster \nresponse programs work--and sometimes don't work--together. This bill \ntakes steps to streamline the programs and to better coordinate between \ndifferent agencies. Portions of this bill would make life a bit simpler \nfor our outstanding emergency management agency in North Carolina. \nWhether it's streamlining management costs or making infrastructure \nrepairs simpler, this bill makes much-needed improvements in the \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, there is no area of the country untouched by natural \ndisasters. Whether it's my state battered by hurricanes; California \nplagued by earthquakes; the Midwest hit by floods; or the states in \n``tornado alley;'' we all know the sudden devastation Mother Nature can \nbring. And we all know we can count on FEMA at a time when the states \nwe represent are most vulnerable, when our people hurt the most. Now \nits time for Congress to support this bill and to ensure FEMA can \ncontinue the first-rate response we so depend on.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to engage the distinguished \nSubcommittee Chairman in a colloquy.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I want to express my appreciation for the Senator's \nefforts, and those of the Committee Chairman, Senator Smith, and \nSubcommittee Ranking Member Senator Graham in working with Senator \nBaucus and me to reaffirm the eligibility of Private Non-Profit (PNP) \nirrigation companies for FEMA reimbursement of their facilities in the \naftermath of disasters. As he knows, a pending FEMA policy would \nunfairly single out irrigators among PNPs as ineligible for FEMA \nassistance. Language in the legislation would ensure that PNP \nirrigators receive the same treatment as other PNPs in the event of a \ndisaster.\n  This matter is of critical importance to PNP irrigation companies \nthroughout the West. Generally taking on the responsibilities of water \nutilities elsewhere, irrigation companies provide a\n\n[[Page S7301]]\n\nvaluable service to westerners, including the provision of drinking \nwater, irrigation support, and other critical facilities. Without these \nservices, life in the West could not exist as we know it today.\n  At this time, I would ask that we yield to the distinguished Ranking \nMember of the full Committee, Senator Baucus. Senator Baucus?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator. I want to echo his comments about \nthe importance of this provision. PNP irrigators provide a valuable \nservice to communities in many western states and their continued fair \ntreatment under FEMA policies is the right thing to do. I extend my \nthanks to Chairman Inhofe, Chairman Smith, and Senator Graham in \nworking to address this matter, both in Committee and here today.\n  As this measure makes its way through the legislative process, I hope \nwe can count on the Senator's continued assistance in protecting the \ninterests of PNP irrigators. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the Senator bringing this matter to the \nCommittee's attention and working with us to come up with a clear \npolicy on PNP irrigators. As he knows, during the mark-up in February, \nthe Committee adopted the Crapo/Baucus/Bennett amendment to solve this \nsituation. However, as we later learned, the amendment was insufficient \nin the eyes of FEMA to resolve this issue. I think that the language \ncontained in the legislation unequivocally addresses the issue and \nthere can be no ambiguity in the wishes of the Senate concerning FEMA's \npolicy affecting private nonproit irrigators in the states. Therefore, \nI reiterate my commitment to enacting legislation that creates equity \nfor PNP irrigators in the implementation of FEMA policies.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank the Senator. I yield back the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS.
