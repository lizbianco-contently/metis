Mr. President, we are facing the last week for the \nconsideration of appropriations bills for the next fiscal year. I \nexpect we will end up having a continuing resolution--I hope so--so we \ncan finish our work without an interruption, the closing down of the \nGovernment.\n  One of the issues, of course, that is most important to all of us is \nthat of education. I wanted to talk--and will be joined by several of \nmy colleagues during the course of this hour--a little bit about \nstrengthening education.\n  The Republicans have had, and continue to have, a strong education \nagenda, one that reflects the view we share on this side of the aisle, \nthat of returning control to the State and local levels so more of the \ndecisions can be made by the school boards, by States, by parents, \nmaking Federal programs more flexible so there can be assistance from \nthe Federal Government but at the same time allowing local governments \nto have the flexibility to adjust educational programs and school \nprograms so they fit.\n  My State of Wyoming is unique in that we have lots of space and not \ntoo many people. Chugwater, WY, would have quite a different \neducational approach than Philadelphia. I think those\n\n[[Page S11456]]\n\ndifferences need to be recognized. We have worked hard to move towards \nblock granting of Federal money directly to States and to local school \ndistricts. I happen to believe that is a very important item in terms \nof Federal participation in elementary and secondary education.\n  There are differences of view as a matter of fact as to what the role \nof the Federal Government is with regard to elementary and secondary \neducation. Many believe, of course, that it is the primary role of the \nlocal governments. I share that view. I share the view, however, that \nthe Federal Government can assist, and in doing that, it needs to \nassist in a way that local officials can prevail.\n  Underlying this debate that we will hear a great deal about today and \nevery day is a fundamental philosophical difference as to how you \napproach education. The Democrat approach is to create a series of new \nmandates and new programs such as 100,000 federally funded teachers to \ndeal with class size. There is a different approach as to classroom \nunits depending on where you are. Most States--I believe 43 out of 50--\nhave this 18 to 1 ratio about which they talk. The Democrats are \ntalking about federally funded school construction and afterschool \nprograms, all of which sounds great and probably has some merit, but \nthe fact is we ought to be thinking more about funding the programs \nthat are already there, such as IDEA, those kinds of programs, than we \nshould be talking about expanding into new programs. Democrats don't \nlike the idea of letting local people make the decisions. They continue \nto want the educational bureaucracy in Washington to call the shots.\n\n  That is a fundamental difference, legitimate difference of views. \nThere are those who generally respect that idea and those of us who do \nnot. Sometimes it is difficult to differentiate between the basic \ndifferences of view as they get tangled up with the details of dollars.\n  But it is the local people, it is you and me as we serve on the \nschool boards, as I have and many of you, not the bureaucrats in \nWashington, who really need to decide what the classroom unit in our \nschools ought to be, whether they need a new gymnasium or something \nelse.\n  Those are the key issues about which we need to talk. It is not the \nissue of whether or not we want the Federal Government to participate. \nThe issue is how it participates, how much more regulation goes along \nwith this participation, and taxes, of course, as well.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act, which was vetoed last week by the President, \nhad over $500 billion in family tax relief. Parents could have used \nthis money to help educate their children. Specific educational \nprovisions totaled $11.3 billion in this tax bill the President \nvetoed--educational savings accounts, interest deductions for student \nloans, deductions for employer-provided tuition assistance, these kinds \nof things that would give families the opportunity to do more with \ntheir educational programs.\n  Congress had made substantial progress earlier this year with the \npassage of the Ed-Flex bill. I am hopeful the principal sponsor of the \nEd-Flex bill, who is now presiding, will have an opportunity to share \nwith us a little more of what that means. It is one of the big things \nwe have done this year in terms of education. It allows district \nwaivers of Federal requirements. This is the direction we really need. \nWe need to let the schools and the districts make their decisions. That \nis really where we are in much of the discussion at this time.\n  There will be some resolutions talked about today, introduced by the \nmajority leader and the minority leader, which deal directly with the \nfunding and how the funding is handled. I think they are extraordinary \nitems we will discuss in relation to whether or not this administration \nhas listened more to the polls and tried to do things that kind of pick \nup the people's attention or whether they really have been involved in \nseeking to strengthen education through the kinds of activities we have \nhad.\n  I yield to my friend, the Senator from Alabama.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Wyoming and appreciate so much \nhis leadership on so many different issues. His steady hand, his wise \ninsight, and determination to make education better in America--I \ncertainly share that.\n  Education is critical to our Nation's strength, economically, \nintellectually, and morally, and in relation to our character and other \nthings. Unity in a nation depends on good education. It includes high \ntechnology, but it also includes history, literature, art, and those \nkinds of things.\n  I strongly believe in public education. I am prepared to support it \nand do support it. I think we can do a lot for our country.\n  I was a product of public education. My wife was the product of \npublic education. My wife taught a number of years in public schools. I \ntaught 1 year in public schools. Our daughters graduated from a major \npublic high school in Mobile, AL. They were active in all of the \nschool's activities. They were annual editors of the yearbook there. It \nwas a big part of our lives. We participated in the PTA. My wife has \nvolunteered on regular occasions in the classroom, assisting teachers \nas an aide, as is done in many schools today.\n  I think those ideas are oftentimes better than spending endless \namounts of money. Too often parents are not encouraged to be a part of \nthe education process. I think they can contribute to that. So \neducational excellence in the classroom is what it is all about.\n  What our goal needs to be is to enhance that magic moment that occurs \nin a classroom between a teacher and a child when learning occurs and \nwhere excitement is present. That will benefit our children. Some of \nthe things we have done in education over the years really cause me \nconcern.\n  I think it is important for us, as a nation, to recall another point, \nand that is that the Federal Government is not the primary focus of \neducation in this country. Ninety-three percent of the money spent on \neducation comes from our States and localities. That is where education \nis run. That is a historic, fundamental view in America--that education \nought to be a local process and that we do not want the Federal \nGovernment dominating all of our education and telling us how \neverything ought to be run.\n  But what we have learned is, over the years, for the little money the \nFederal Government does put forth--the 7 percent that it contributes--\nso much of that money goes into regulations and burdens on local \nschools. We understand that 50 percent of the regulations for public \nschools in America come from Federal programs where only 7 percent of \nthe money is provided.\n  Currently, there are 788 Federal Government education programs. \nSchool systems, small and large, have to employee teams of people just \nto write grants, to figure out how they can get some of this Federal \nmoney for their school systems. And when they get the money, they \ncannot use it as they wish; they have to comply with burdensome federal \nregulations, essentially fitting some bureaucrat's idea of what ought \nto be done in that school.\n  One thing I have learned here is that schools across this country are \ndifferent. In the school I attended in the town of Camden, AL, 30 of us \ngraduated from high school together. Well over half of us started the \nfirst grade together in that school. It was an excellent high school. I \nwas blessed.\n  I was at the University of Alabama this weekend, and I met the dean \nof the human services department there; she was my classmate in our \nlittle class of 30. Another member of that group went on to Annapolis. \nAnd others have done well. But it was a public school, a small school.\n  My daughters went to a high school that had 2,000 students. So \nschools are different. The needs are different in each of the States. \nIt is very difficult for the Federal Government to control and dominate \nand say precisely how learning should occur in every classroom across \nthis country. I fundamentally believe that decisions about our \nchildren's education must be made by individuals who know our \nchildren's names.\n\n  We need to be sure that what we do in this Nation is a benefit to \nchildren and not a burden. I am really pleased to see Dr. Bill Frist, \nthe distinguished Senator from Tennessee, who previously presided in \nthe Chair, because\n\n[[Page S11457]]\n\nearlier this year he led the fight for a bill we called Ed-Flex that \nwould say: We are going to give schools more flexibility to utilize \nFederal dollars than they have had before in return for strict \naccountability.\n  It was a tough fight. Those on the other side of the aisle, the \nPresident, and all his staff, fought that bill tooth and claw--even \nthough the educators and the teachers and principals were telling us: \nWe badly need it. It was a battle. We did not get to go as far as we \nwould have liked, but it was a good step in the right direction. We \nneed to do more of that.\n  Do we really care about our children? Do we want to make sure they \nlearn as best they can? Let's give the money to the people we elected \nas our school board presidents and commissioners and superintendents to \nrun our school systems; the people who know our children's names. Those \npeople care about children; it is not just people in this body.\n  Many of us who have little or no knowledge about education, how is it \nwe think we know all there is to know about education? We can read a \nnewspaper article about somebody having a good idea, so we pass a \nFederal program to fund it, and we end up with 788 programs that really \nburden education.\n  Let me tell you about a number of things that are out there. I had a \nletter from a good, long-time friend of mine. I was a Federal \nprosecutor and attorney general of Alabama. This friend, Dave \nWhetstone, was a district attorney in one of our larger counties for \nquite a number of years. Dave Whetstone ran into the IDEA Act. Based on \nwhat IDEA says, children with disabilities ought not to be separated. \nThey are supposed to be kept in the classroom. That is certainly a good \nprinciple. We ought not to separate children who don't need to be \nseparated. But the act says, no matter what you do or how violent that \nchild may get, they can't be removed from the classroom for more than \n45 days. They have to be put back in there because of Federal law.\n\n  During committee hearings this year, we heard from a superintendent \nfrom Vermont who told us that over 20 percent of the education costs in \nthe school system with which he was involved went to funding the \nregulations of this program. One cannot believe what it demands. In the \nAlabama case, there was a young man who was the subject of a Time \nMagazine article, ``Is This the Meanest Kid in All of Alabama?''\n  I have met with District Attorney Whetstone to discuss this very \nproblem because he raised the question. He wrote me a letter in late \nApril. He said:\n\n       I am writing you this letter concerning my general outrage \n     over the laws of the Federal Government and how they are \n     being administered in relation to school violence.\n       I had already been having meetings . . . concerning the \n     Federal Disabilities Act.\n       The general thrust of the matter is that violent children \n     are being kept in school because of the new Federal Rules \n     relating to disabilities.\n       I can point to at least seven to nine occasions in Baldwin \n     County in which I believe expulsion was called for, but could \n     not be accomplished because of the interpretation of the \n     Disabilities Act.\n\n  He goes on to talk about the story of this one child.\n  In summary--Americans may not understand this--with regard to \nchildren who are really disruptive, they hire aides to not only be in \nthe classroom to help the teacher for this one child who is disruptive, \nthe aides go to their homes, ride the school buses with them to keep \nthem from disrupting the bus, stay with them all day, and ride the \nschool bus home at night.\n  That is what they were doing with this young man. He had violent \ntendencies. In one case on the school bus, he had an incident, and the \naide tried to stop him from wrecking the school bus. He tried to wreck \nthe school bus, and he attacked the aide. That is when the district \nattorney got involved and filed legal action to try to overcome this \nthing.\n  That is the problem we are living with, and that is driven by Federal \nregulations that are, in fact, reducing our ability to educate. I don't \nknow which children ought to be kept in the classroom and which ought \nto be removed. I would like to see every child who can stay in a \nclassroom stay in a classroom. I think that is extraordinarily \nimportant. But some children are so disruptive that it undermines the \nwhole teaching process. I believe the decision must be left to the \nlocal principals and school boards.\n  I have had teachers tell me: Jeff, I can't put up with it anymore. It \nis too stressful for me. I am going to get out of this profession that \nI love as soon as I can.\n  Much of it is driven, if you talk to your friends and neighbors who \nteach, by discipline problems. You would not know, if you listened to \nthese education bureaucrats in Washington, that a lot of it is driven \nby burdensome Federal education rules and regulations.\n  This Congress, since the Republican Party took the majority, has \nincreased Federal funding for education 27 percent. All this talk about \nslashing funds for education is not true. We do believe--I certainly \nbelieve--in public education and helping public education to flourish, \nbut we need to do it the right way. We need to do it in a way that \nhelps teachers to achieve that sublime moment when the learning occurs \nin a classroom and kids are motivated and they get that insight that \nmay lead them on to a lifetime of learning.\n\n  I am not sure the 788 programs we have now are working. I pledge to \nthe people of the United States, I am going to work to do all I can to \ncontinue to support our States in their efforts to educate, but I am \ngoing to try to reduce Federal regulation and Federal intervention in \ntheir schools and give them the kind of opportunities they have not had \nin many years to improve education in those schools. Each school does \nit differently. We can't mandate it from here.\n  It worked for welfare reform. Do my colleagues remember that? We \nsaid: We are going to stop mandating all these rules for every \ncommunity in America. We are going to challenge the States to take the \nwelfare money we have been spending and create programs they believe, \nin their State, are comprehensive and will get people off welfare and \nback to work. It has worked, and we have had a massive reduction in the \nwelfare rolls. It has been good for America.\n  We can do the same for education. The Senator from Tennessee has been \na national leader for education reform. He is on the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee. He has been a national spokesman for it, \nand it has been a pleasure for me to join that committee and work with \nhim.\n  Mr. President, I have concluded my remarks. I am pleased to yield to \nthe distinguished Senator from Tennessee on this subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Alabama for his \noutstanding leadership in the field of education, preparing our \nchildren for tomorrow, for that next millennium. He has done \noutstanding work. We work almost on a daily basis on this very issue.\n  I also commend the Presiding Officer for his leadership on this issue \nwhich, again, means so much to the future of our country.\n  Earlier this morning I was talking to a group of people who came up \nto visit from Texas. They said: Senator Frist, what in your mind is the \nmost important thing that society must do to prepare our country for \nthis new millennium that is upon us?\n  I very quickly turned it back to the audience and said: What do you \nthink?\n  When we came to education, every hand went up in the air. Indeed, \naccording to every public opinion survey, education is the No. 1 issue \nwhen people ask what the responsibility of the public--not necessarily \njust the Federal Government but of the public--is in terms of promoting \nmore fulfilling lives in the future. If we look a little bit further at \nthose town meetings, we say: What really can be done? People very \nquickly come back to our education system, to our public school system. \nAbout two out of three Americans are very supportive of public schools \nbut do believe that our public schools will require some major change, \nsome major innovation, some creativity. Just more of the same is simply \nnot going to work.\n  We only have to look at how we compare to our international \ncounterparts. When we look at reading, math, or science at the fourth \ngrade, the eighth grade, and at the twelfth grade, we are failing \ncompared to other countries all around the world. What is even sadder,\n\n[[Page S11458]]\n\nif we look at subjects such as reading or math, we fail in the fourth, \neighth, and twelfth grades. If we do OK in the fourth grade, we do \nworse in the eighth grade, and we do miserably in the twelfth grade. \nThe longer someone is in school, when we compare ourselves \ninternationally--we all know our world is becoming smaller, and our \nborders are beginning to fall in this global economy--when we compare \nourselves internationally, we are failing and failing miserably.\n  Republicans have set forth very solid proposals based on three pretty \nsimple, straightforward priorities. Mention has already been made about \nthe Ed-Flex bill, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act, which was \nsigned by the President, debated on this floor, and involves these same \nprinciples.\n  Those three principles are, No. 1, take education out of the hands of \nthe Federal bureaucrats and return it to the local level, to parents, \nto teachers, to school superintendents, to local officials, where it \nbelongs.\n  No. 2, since what we are doing is not working, based on the \nstatistics I just related, let's unleash the spirit of change, of \ninnovation, of doing something a little bit different. We can begin by \nuntying those Federal strings, those Federal regulations which are \nrestricting that change, which are holding back innovation.\n  No. 3, raise the standard of education excellence so every child gets \nthe education he or she needs and deserves.\n  For over three decades, we have seen this progression of Federal \ninvolvement in our educational system today. As the Senator from \nAlabama just pointed out, there are over 780 separate Federal education \nprograms. It really comes from a lot of people in this body and other \nbodies who came up with good ideas to cure particular problems. The \nresult is that you get a layering of these Federal programs, one on top \nof each other, until you get this whole spider web of good intentions. \nBut these good intentions have increased Federal bureaucracies, each \nwith its own set of regulations, hierarchy, own buildings, own section, \neach trying to educate people in a better way. These over 780 different \nFederal education programs are spread across over 40 entirely separate \nbureaucracies. So it is time to step back, streamline, and better \ncoordinate the resources that we are directing toward education.\n\n  Now, it is interesting that, in the Ed-Flex debate, a lot of things \nwere talked about on the floor of the Senate, and one was apparent to \nme. The statistic was that educators spend over 48 million hours \nchurning out paperwork and red tape because of these Washington-based \nregulations.\n  Now, 48 million hours sounds like a lot. How much is it? It is the \nequivalent of 25,000 teachers working 40 hours a week for 1 year--not \nin teaching that student but in filling out paperwork and regulations. \nIt is this excessive regulatory burden that we in Washington, DC, \nimpose on them. It is what the Federal Government pushes down on that \nteacher in that school in Alamo, TN.\n  How does it translate into taxpayer dollars? That $1 that is sent, on \nApril 15, to Washington, DC, filters down through the bureaucracy and \nis only worth 65 cents by the time it gets down to the classroom; that \nis, 35 cents of every taxpayer dollar that comes up to the Federal \nGovernment is lost in these 780 programs through 40 different \nbureaucracies.\n  The real question is, Can this be modernized? Is there something we \ncan do? The answer is absolutely. Ed-Flex is that first step. It shows \nthat we can make progress by doing what? Education flexibility--giving \nmore flexibility, providing for more accountability; those are two \nfundamental principles.\n  As Ronald Reagan said, ``There is nothing closer to eternal life than \na Government bureaucracy.'' So, yes, No. 1, we have to address the \nissues of the bureaucracy. How can we streamline and better coordinate \nto get more value out of the resources that we put into education? Ed-\nFlex attacked the issue of improved accountability and improved \nachievement by looking at those three Republican principles. Individual \nclassrooms have individual needs. Classrooms in Alamo, TN, are \ndifferent from those in Memphis, and different from Bristol, TN, and \ndifferent from those in New York City, or San Francisco. Some schools \nstress technology; some have computers; some are in a rural area and \ndon't have the technology.\n  The whole point is each school is different, and we in Washington, \nDC, must recognize the solutions to an individual school's challenges \nto educate a student have to be based on local concerns, local input, \non what those teachers need, on what advise and counsel parents offer \nto that particular school.\n  What did Ed-Flex do? As I said, it is the Education Flexibility \nPartnership Act. No. 1 is flexibility. It gets rid of a lot of the \nWashington red tape. It comes down from the 780 different programs. You \nhave absolutely the same goals, but how you reach those goals is \ndetermined at the local level. Ed-Flex has strong flexibility but also \nstrong accountability. Strong accountability, in that if you have an \nEd-Flex program in your State, you must say specifically how that plan \nwill be administered, how achievement will be measured, and you will be \nheld accountable for accomplishing that achievement.\n  In return, you are given flexibility. Ed-Flex started as a \ndemonstration project in six States, and it was expanded to 12 States. \nNow, through a bipartisan effort, we are able to expand that to every \nState in the Union.\n  Another way to achieve the three principles we are working on is the \nauthorization process--a process that is looking at the reauthorization \nof the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. This is the big bill \nthat authorizes how we spend all kindergarten-through-12 funding. The \npurpose of going back and looking at that authorization is to modernize \nthis system, to allow some innovation and creativity, to take it back \nto local control, instead of Washington, DC, control.\n\n  Republicans have designated this legislation as the vehicle to \naddress two principles: No. 1, to retain the same basic elements of \neducation funding through ESEA, the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, but eliminate the red tape that tells localities specifically how \nto spend it. The bill, as we go forward, needs to stress local control. \nI believe, and most Republicans believe, that we need to free States \nand free localities from red tape, from that lack of innovation, from \nthat rigidity, in return for improvements in achievement. We must make \nsure our students are really learning and progressing over time. In \naddition, we have to reduce that paperwork by focusing on not just the \nprocess but the actual performance of those students who will leave \nthat school and go on to higher education and to competition in our \nnational marketplace and in a global marketplace.\n  We need to allow States, I believe, to consolidate some of these 780 \nprograms at the State and local level if they believe they can have \ngreater achievement, and if they have a specific plan to do so, and are \nheld accountable for that. We need to empower parents, we need to \nempower local educators, and then we need to hold them accountable for \ntheir results.\n  Another issue that we absolutely must focus on, and we are focusing \non, is the quality of our teachers. There are some people who say the \nanswer to all this is 100,000 more teachers. That makes a good sound \nbite because more of anything sounds good to people. But I believe we \nneed to go back to that Republican fundamental belief that more can be \nhelpful, but what is more important is the quality of that teacher in \nthat classroom talking to those 10 students or 20 students or 30 \nstudents. Just having more of something there isn't necessarily the \nanswer. The answer is in teacher quality.\n  A researcher from the University of Tennessee put it quite well when \nhe said to me that teacher quality has a greater effect on performance \nthan any other factor, including student demographics or class size. If \nyou have to pick one, it is the quality of that teacher in the \nclassroom. He said--and these are exact words--``When kids have \nineffective teachers, they never recover.''\n  Think about that. Other than parents, no other intervention equals \nthe effect on a child's capacity to learn, to assimilate than that of \nhis teacher. Every classroom should have a qualified teacher, \nproficient in the subjects they teach. Now, one might say, well, no, \nthat is not it; we need more warm\n\n[[Page S11459]]\n\nbodies in the classroom and that is the answer.\n  Listen to these statistics. Today, over 25 percent of all teachers \nare poorly trained to teach; 12 percent have no prior classroom \nexperience before beginning to teach; 14 percent have not fully met \nState standards. In Massachusetts alone, 59 percent failed the basic \nlicensing exam; 54 percent failed a 10th grade level competency test. \nIf we look all across America, 18 percent of all social studies \nteachers have neither majored nor minored in the subject they teach; 20 \npercent of all science teachers have neither majored nor minored in \nscience; 40 percent of all math teachers have neither majored nor \nminored in mathematics.\n  Is it surprising, then, when you compare the performance of 12th \ngraders in this country in math and science to other countries around \nthe world that we are not 1st, 5th, 10th, 15th, or 20th in math and \nscience, but we are 21st? We are 21st among our competitor nations \naround the world. Is it surprising when 40 percent of all math \nteachers--the person actually teaching in that room with the 12th \ngraders--did not major or minor in the field of mathematics? We hear \nabout ``100,000 new teachers.'' That is a short sound bite, but I think \nthe focus you will see from our side of the aisle is on the quality of \nteachers and not on numbers alone.\n  The Teacher Quality Act works aggressively on directing Federal \nresources to help attract the very best, to help train and retrain \nthose very best teachers. Funds will be available in several areas, \nincluding establishing incentives to teachers with advanced degrees in \ncore subjects, or implementing teacher testing with bonuses for those \nwho score well, or expanding the pool of teachers by certifying \nqualified retired military personnel.\n  Another issue in our schools today, an issue we hear about all too \noften, is school violence. Again, the reasons are as many and numerous \nas the incidents themselves. Common sense says fix the obvious problem. \nOne obvious problem is drugs. A long-term study showed most drug use \nstarts at age 12 or 13. When the White House took a high-profile line \non this, illicit drug use declined consistently from 1979 to 1992 and, \nover that period of about 13 years, fell from 16 percent to 5 percent. \nHowever, in the first 5 years of the current administration, over half \nof that progress has been lost. The latest National Center for Alcohol \nand Substance Abuse poll shows 35 percent of teens believe drugs are \nthe most important problem they face.\n  We are responding again under an initiative being put forward through \nthe Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act. That act will add \nfinancial assistance for community programs for violent youth and will \nadd technical assistance to create community partnerships to look at \nyouth drug issues and youth mental health.\n  An area of discipline we will have to come back to is loopholes in \nthe current law, including the act mentioned this morning, the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, a bill in which I believe \nvery strongly and which was strongly supported in the efforts of the \npast Congress. There is a problem in that particular bill regarding \nviolence--violence and discipline in our schools. The fact is, one \ngroup of students is disciplined in a different manner from other \nstudents. That is unfair and has to be changed. It has not yet been \nchanged.\n  In my own county, Davidson County in Middle Tennessee, there were \neight firearms infractions, meaning there were eight children who \nbrought either guns or bombs to school; six of those were special ed \nstudents. Three of those special ed students were expelled, but three \nwere not expelled and came back to the classroom. In Tennessee, the \ngeneral law is, if a student brings a gun or a bomb into the classroom, \nthey are expelled for that year. Because of the Federal law, we say all \nstudents are not treated equally. There is a special class of students \nwho, even if they brought a gun or a bomb to the classroom, may return \nin 45 days. I see no reason why all children should not be subject to \nthe very same disciplinary action.\n  Education is the most important gift we can give our children. The \ntime to act is now. We are doing that with Ed-Flex as the first step, \nwith reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and \nwith the Teacher Quality Act.\n  I have an 11-year-old, 12-year-old, and a 14-year-old. I don't want \nto be too pessimistic. When we look at this generation that is coming \nthrough, the overwhelming majority of America's children are good, with \ngood intentions, and are working hard. In fact, when comparing the so-\ncalled millennial generation with the preceding generation, statistics \nare improving:\n  Teen sexual activity is down; teen pregnancies are down, especially \nin the inner cities; teen drinking is down; teen drunk driving is down; \nTV time is down; high school dropout rates are down. More time is being \nspent on homework today. Academic standards are slowly rising; time \nspent on chores is up; church-going is up. High-tech skills are rising \nsharply. Most teens today trust institutions; they agree with their \nparents on core values.\n  As for violence, the high school murder rate has indeed fallen 50 \npercent since 1993, the steepest decline in any age bracket. School-\nrelated violent deaths are declining. There has been an overall \nimprovement in teen crime. I say that because we have this interesting \njuxtaposition of great opportunity in our system, but when we compare \nourselves internationally, we are failing if performance is the \nmeasure.\n  Again, looking back to the fourth, eighth, and twelfth grade, we are \nfailing our children today, but we are doing it in an overall framework \nwhich says that it is possible to succeed. We need to be committed. We \nneed to do it in the right way, using the three Republican principles I \nput forward. Our children are America's future, they are America's \npride, and Republicans intend to do everything we possible can to help \nthem stay that way.\n  I ask unanimous consent, following the remarks of Senator Dorgan \ntoday, at approximately 2:20 p.m., Senator Hatch be recognized for up \nto 25 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the President of the United States \nvetoed the largest tax decrease bill to pass the Congress since 1981. \nBy doing this, he wants to continue the tax overpayment that working \nAmericans are paying into the Federal Treasury.\n  The President is saying in his veto that we ought to continue to tax \nthe taxpayers at the 21 percent of gross domestic product level, where \ntaxes are now, the highest level in the history of our country, as \nopposed to the last 50 years when taxes fell in the range of 18 to 19 \npercent of gross domestic product.\n  The people of the United States have been willing and, through \nconsensus, settled on the level of 18 to 19 percent of gross domestic \nproduct, both from the standpoint of what they are willing to pay into \nthe Federal Government and also from the standpoint of how that is, at \na lower level of taxation, better for the economy.\n  The President said in his veto message we would put in jeopardy \nseveral government programs if we did not continue to tax at this \nlevel. The President didn't say in so many words, but he has a plan for \nspending the $792 billion that the Congress would let the American \ntaxpayers keep. By spending it, he would do it in a fashion that would \nend up with a $200 billion additional national debt than what we would \nhave by giving the $792 billion to the taxpayers. He would, in a sense, \njack up the level of expenditure of the Federal Government to well over \nthe present level of expenditure and put in jeopardy balancing the \nbudget if we had a downturn in the economy and the taxes did not come \ninto the Federal Treasury at the rate of 21 percent of gross domestic \nproduct.\n  Even though the bill passed in a bipartisan way when it first went \nthrough the Senate, on final passage it ended up being a Republican tax \nreduction that went to the President because there were not any people \non the other side of the aisle who voted for it.\n  We were saying that this tax overpayment ought to be left with \nworking\n\n[[Page S11460]]\n\nAmericans because only the people spending the money or investing it do \nit in a way that creates wealth in America and creates jobs as a result \nof the creation of wealth.\n  Anybody who thinks money is better left in the Federal Treasury--at \nthe highest rate of taxation in the history of the country, at 21 \npercent of GDP--ought to realize that there are not jobs created as a \nresult of that money going into the Federal till because the Federal \nGovernment is not a creator of wealth. Our involvement with the \ncreation of wealth is to leave as many resources as we can to the \ningenuity of American working men and women to invest and to spend \nbecause it turns over so many more times in the economy than when it is \nspent by us in Washington.\n  So this tax decrease, the largest since 1981, was our effort to give \na tax refund to working Americans by returning the tax overpayment. We \ndo it in a responsible manner, by devoting 75 percent of the $3 \ntrillion surplus that is going to come into the Federal Treasury over \nthe next 10 years to Social Security, Medicare, paying down the \nnational debt, and other domestic priorities. We would leave three-\nfourths of that extra dollar that people pay in taxes that do not need \nto be paid, with the Federal Government for paying down the national \ndebt, strengthening Social Security, $505 billion that could be set \naside for strengthening Medicare and other domestic programs, and we \nwould leave 25 percent of that surplus with the taxpayers because we \nknow that hard-working men and women in America can use that money \nbetter than it can be misspent here in Washington.\n  It seems to me the President was intellectually dishonest last week \nwhen, in his veto message--that was on television; everybody heard it--\nhe said we were threatening Social Security, we were threatening \nMedicare, we were not paying down the national debt when we had this \ntax cut. I say that is intellectual dishonesty because the plan we sent \nto the President had in mind reserving all of the Social Security \npayroll tax money to Social Security, paying down the national debt, \nwith $505 billion for strengthening Medicare and other domestic \npriorities within our Government, and still leaving $800 billion to the \ntaxpayers.\n  It is only fair to give the taxpayers this money because it is their \nmoney that created the surplus in the first place. It is not the hard \nwork of bureaucrats in Washington, it is not the hard work of Members \nof Congress that created this surplus, it is the ingenuity of the \nAmerican people. For that ingenuity, they are being overtaxed at this \nparticular time to the tune of 21 percent of gross domestic product \ncompared to the 50-year history of somewhere between 18 percent and 19 \npercent. It is only fair to give them their money back.\n  Even Democrats agree that the surplus should be returned to the \ntaxpayers. One Member of the other side of the aisle said this:\n\n       I strongly believe we should return part of that money \n     [meaning the surplus] to hard-working Americans. To suggest \n     we cannot afford to cut income taxes when we are running a $3 \n     trillion surplus is ludicrous.\n\n  That is from a Member of the Senate from the other side of the aisle. \nThat same Member said:\n\n       To say that tax cuts stand in the way of needed domestic \n     spending, Medicare and debt relief, is also folly.\n\n  It is too bad the President of the United States does not listen to \nMembers of his own party.\n  The President wants you to believe he vetoed just a $792 billion tax \nbill--and that is a 10-year figure. But when you look at the bits and \npieces of it, I think it will demonstrate the President did not veto \njust a $792 billion tax bill, but he vetoed lower taxes for middle- and \nlower-income Americans, he made health insurance less affordable, and \nhe took away incentives to save more. Let me go through what the \nPresident vetoed to be very specific, so people know exactly what we \nplanned in this Congress when we passed this tax bill.\n  We planned to encourage savings, to encourage entrepreneurship, and \nto give hard-working families the money they need to support \nthemselves. We reduced tax rates for middle- and lower-income \nAmericans. The President vetoed that.\n  Our tax bill made health insurance more affordable by providing 100-\npercent tax deductibility for all premiums for the self-employed and, \nstarting for the first time in the history of our tax laws, gave \nemployees who work for corporations, who do not have a corporate health \nplan, the same tax deductibility for their own individual plans that \nemployees of major corporations have had since World War II. The \nPresident vetoed both of those items.\n  Our bill made it easier for children to care for elderly parents by \ngiving some tax incentives for family caregiving and also making tax \ndeductibility possible for long-term care insurers. The President \nvetoed that.\n  One thing we hear about more than any other injustice in the Tax Code \nis the marriage tax penalty. That correction was in the bill. The \nPresident vetoed the provisions to do away with the marriage tax \npenalty.\n  We hear from farmers and small businessmen how wrong it is to break \nup a business to pay a death tax. This bill did away with the estate \ntax, so there was no tax on death, so you could pass on the family farm \nand the family business. The President vetoed that.\n  We had increased incentives for retirement savings because everybody \nknows Social Security has never been intended to be a sole retirement \nplan and is not adequate today. So we have to have more encouragement \nfor families to save for retirement. The President vetoed that.\n  We hear from families, particularly from women who work outside the \nhome, that child care ought to be more affordable. The President vetoed \nthat.\n  We had full tax deductibility of interest on student loans in this \nbill. The President vetoed that.\n  We expanded the Individual Retirement Account opportunities. The \nPresident vetoed that.\n  In short, President Clinton vetoed tax relief measures that would \nbenefit men and women nationwide.\n  The President has vetoed it, and I do not think there will be a \ncompromise with the President on this because the $800 billion is such \nan infinitesimal amount of money--only 3.5 percent of all the revenue \ncoming into the Federal Treasury over the next 10 years--that how do \nyou compromise between zero and 3.5 percent when the 3.5 percent is so \npuny that we in the Congress ought to be embarrassed we could not find \nways of saving money and giving even a larger tax cut?\n\n  This means this issue will be taken to the country, and we will let \nthe Democratic candidate, presumably Vice President Gore, campaign next \nyear on a platform of spending this money, as President Clinton \nproposes to spend it, and we will let the Republican candidate for \nPresident run on a platform of, hopefully, backing at least this much \nof a tax cut and more of a tax cut. We will take this issue to the \ncountry. Let the people decide, and in letting the people decide, let's \nhave a clear mandate for spending the $792 billion or letting the \ntaxpayers keep it.\n  The President, in his veto message and all during the month of \nAugust, has been trying to make a mountain out of a molehill, as far as \nthis tax cut issue is concerned. He has suggested that $800 billion is \na mountain of money--and it is a lot of money--but as I said, it is 3.5 \npercent of all the money that is going to come into the Federal \nTreasury over the next 10 years that we could let the taxpayers keep in \ntheir pockets or spend it or invest it to create jobs and wealth in \nAmerica to expand our economy. But, in fact, the mountain is the $23 \ntrillion that is coming into the Federal Treasury over the next 10 \nyears, and the $792 billion tax cut is the molehill.\n  On this chart, we have the mountain over here, the $22.8 trillion \nthat the working men and women of America are going to pay into the \nFederal Treasury over the next 10 years. Mr. President Clinton, that is \nthe mountain, but right here is the $792 billion tax cut that you \nvetoed last week, and that is truly the molehill. Mr. President, you \ncan't make a mountain out of a molehill.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, the Washington Post printed an article \nlast Sunday about a group of WWII veterans returning to the beaches of \nNormandy to share stories and remember fallen brothers. It was yet \nanother reminder of the closing window of opportunity historians have \nto glean first-hand accounts from the generation of men and women who \nlived through the Great Depression, fought in WWII and came back to \nbuild America into the greatest power of health and wealth in the \nworld.\n  The Washington Post wrote: ``World War II veterans are dying at a \nrate of more than 1,000 a day. `It's the equivalent to a library \nburning down every day,' said National Guard Maj. Gen. Gene Krase.''\n  This week I'm presenting my Innovation in Education award to a group \nof students and educators in Wenatchee, Washington who are working to \npreserve the oral testimonies and first-hand accounts of the men and \nwomen who make up what some have called our greatest generation.\n  Allison Agnew's 11th grade Honors English class at Eastmont High \nSchool began the Honor By Listening program last year, which pairs each \nstudent with an elder in the Wenatchee valley to document his or her \npersonal history. After the student recorded and transcribed oral \ntestimonies, they wrote out each story in narrative form.\n  Businesses and leaders in the community support the process. \nRepresentatives from the North Central Washington Museum gave the \nstudents lessons on interviewing techniques and how to transcribe oral \nhistories. Local librarians, attorneys, and business leaders joined \neducators to help the students edit their narratives. Materials and \nfunds for publishing the final product came through donations from \nlocal businesses. It was a marvelous community effort.\n  Incidentally, one of my own staff members, Don Moos, has volunteered \ncountless hours of his time to help connect students with potential \ninterviewees. Don himself is a veteran who fought in the European \ntheater during World War II. In fact, he won a Purple Heart in the \nBattle of the Bulge, but I have yet to hear his whole story though we \nhave been friends for years. I look forward to reading about his \nexperiences.\n  This year the junior class at Eastmont will continue the program. It \nalready has obtained a list of 200 possible candidates to interview \nthis fall.\n  I am proud of the efforts these students are putting forth to not \nonly learn about, but to preserve, the rich heritage of Washington \nState. It is efforts like these that convince me I am heading in the \nright direction with my Straight A's bill. If we give educators the \nfreedom and flexibility to meet the unique needs of their students, \nwhile providing them with a system of accountability for the results, \nwe will see more innovative programs like this one.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last Friday, the Senate passed the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill. I first want to commend the chairman and ranking \nmember of that subcommittee for the superb job they did in managing \nthat legislation as it went through the Senate.\n  I do want to indicate a concern about what was missing in that bill \nbecause there is one program that was not funded which I believe is \nvery important to the country, certainly to my State, which is the \nCommunity Builders Program. It is my hope that this problem can be \ncorrected in the conference committee. I asked the chairman and the \nranking member of the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee to pay special \nattention to attempting to provide the resources necessary to keep the \nCommunity Builders Program going.\n  Despite HUD's successful efforts to reduce staff and provide better \nservice, the committee bill will result in the termination of more than \n400 community builders across the country. That is a program that is \nworking. This program is designed to bring new blood into that agency. \nIt has been called a prototype for the new type of public servant in \nthe 21st century. HUD, in recruiting for those 400 positions, had over \n9,000 applications, including lawyers, academics, and economic and \ncommunity development experts. These are people who were asked to come \nand give 2 years to helping revitalize HUD. We signed them up. We \nrecruited them. We signed contracts with them, and now we tell them, \nsorry, we have changed our minds--even though the program is working. I \ndon't think so.\n  The individuals who were selected to participate in community \nbuilders are experts in community outreach and development, who agreed \nto a 2-year term of service with HUD. They don't sit at a desk in \nWashington. They work in the 81 field offices doing face to face \ncontact with people in the communities in which they serve. This is a \nprogram that has received accolades from every independent source that \nhas looked at the program, including evaluations conducted by Booz, \nAllen & Hamilton, the respected private firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, \none of the major accounting firms in the country, and the public \nstrategies group--all who made independent reviews of the Community \nBuilders Program and all of whom said it was a significant improvement \nfor HUD.\n  If the community builders are now eliminated, some HUD field offices \nwill drop below the minimum staffing level and will have to close. That \nincludes the only office in my State. We have only one and it is going \nto close. Some people say: North Dakota is a small State, a rural \nState, you don't have many housing problems. Well, I can tell you that \nis not the case. We do have serious housing problems. Go to the Indian \nreservations in my State and you will see housing problems that are \nenormously serious.\n  But more than that, when disaster strikes, HUD is absolutely \ncritical. We saw that in 1997 when the flooding disasters hit eastern \nNorth Dakota. Let me say that HUD's presence in the State was \ncritically important to the recovery in North Dakota. Secretary Cuomo, \nin particular, was absolutely superb in his response to the crisis. He \nunderstood the very human impact this devastating flood was having on \nthe people of Grand Forks and the people of eastern North Dakota, and \nhe responded. He went out of his way to make certain that HUD's \nresponse took into account the unique circumstances of this event.\n\n  Rarely have I seen public servants respond in the way we saw in the \n1997 flood disaster in North Dakota. I have heard lots of criticisms of \nHUD over the years, but I can tell you firsthand that their response \nwas extraordinary, and I will never forget it.\n  Let me give one example. After the disaster bill passed Congress, top \nHUD staff, including the Secretary, stayed and worked all weekend at \nHUD headquarters in order to get the money out to North Dakota. That is \na level of commitment we rarely see. They were there Saturday, Sunday, \nfrom morning until night, to get the money flowing. Indeed, we were \nable to get $50 million into the hands of the Grand Forks community \nwithin 48 hours after the legislation passed. That is the kind of \nperformance one would like to see from public servants on a routine \nbasis. That is what we saw from HUD. They delivered, and they delivered \nin a way I think makes us all proud.\n  Because of HUD's quick work, Secretary Cuomo was able to provide that \n$50 million in disaster recovery funds to the city to meet the \nimmediate needs shortly after the bill was signed by the President. \nWithout those funds and the dedicated work of countless HUD staff, \nGrand Forks would not have been able to recover from that devastating \nflood. I toured Grand Forks with the head of FEMA, James Lee\n\n[[Page S11462]]\n\nWitt. We were there during the August break, and we saw the resurgence \nof that community. It is remarkable. This is a town where more than 90 \npercent of the homes were affected by flood. This is a community that \nwas also hit before the floods by the worst winter storm in 50 years. \nThen the floods came. In the midst of floods came fire. It was an \nextraordinary series of events, but there was also an extraordinary \nFederal response, and I am here today to thank my colleagues who \nstepped forward and were willing to assist. But I also want to \nrecognize the extraordinary work of HUD, and specifically Secretary \nCuomo, because rarely have I seen the kind of response we saw during \nour period of crisis. In part, it was because he had this new \nmechanism, these community builders across the country who were \ninfusing new energy and new ideas into the agency that made that \nresponse possible.\n  In Washington, we hear over and over that government needs to be more \nresponsive to people's needs and that government needs to be more \nflexible and work similar to the private sector. I can say that in \nGrand Forks, HUD did just that. Grand Forks is not an isolated example. \nWe saw it up and down the Red River Valley. It wasn't just in Grand \nForks; it was in Fargo; it was in Wahpeton; it was in Grafton; it was \nin Menoken. Town after town that was threatened had a full Federal \nresponse, and no agency was more responsive than HUD; no people were \nmore helpful than those community builders.\n  That is why I thought it important to come to the floor and say \nrestore the Community Builders Program, restore it in the conference \ncommittee. Let's not recruit some of the top people from all across the \ncountry, asking them to serve for 2 years, and then, after a year in a \nprogram that has been deemed successful by every independent entity \nthat has examined the program, say to them: Forget it; go home.\n  The amazing thing is, they won't go home because we have signed \ncontracts with them. If we don't fund it, we are still going to have to \npay for those positions.\n  I hope very much the conference committee will restore the funding to \nthe Community Builders Program, to say to those 400 people who have \ngiven so much, we recognize their contribution; we intend to keep them \nas part of a new HUD, a HUD that has been reformed, a HUD that is \nresponding in a splendid way to disasters such as the one we faced in \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was pleased to hear the remarks of \nSenator Conrad about the Community Builders Program at HUD. I echo all \nof the comments he made about the difference that HUD made in the lives \nof the people in the Red River Valley who suffered so immensely from \nthe massive flooding that occurred a couple of years ago.\n  I am on the Senate Appropriations Committee, and we had a discussion \nabout the Community Builders Program. I share the feeling Senator \nConrad has expressed on the floor of the Senate about that program. It \nseems to me we ought to find a way to continue to fund that program. \nThese are people all across this country who are making a difference, \nmen and women who give new energy and new vitality to the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. I think it is a step backward for this \nCongress to say that program doesn't work. We know it works. We know \nfirsthand its value. We understand its contribution in our communities \nand other communities across this country.\n  I placed a statement in the Record a couple of days ago about this \nsubject. I was pleased to have my colleague describe this in more \ndetail, its functioning in the context of what we experienced.\n  I ask the Senator if he doesn't believe, in the end process, in the \noverall scheme of the amount of money that is spent and invested by the \nCongress, if the funding for the Community Builders isn't almost an \nasterisk of an amount, but so significant in terms of what it means to \nthe new direction in HUD and to the capability of HUD to provide new \nenergy and new vitality to these programs. Is it not the case that \nfunding for this program can be done easily, without cost to other \nprograms, but in a way that will make it an incredibly important \ninvestment in HUD in the long term?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is exactly right. I think back to the time \nwhen we were in the midst of that crisis and what a splendid response \nwe got from HUD.\n  I think people are often critical of Federal agencies. Certainly HUD, \nespecially in the past, has received lots of criticism--well deserved, \nunfortunately. However, this new Secretary, Mr. Cuomo, has done a \nremarkable job of transforming that agency. We saw it firsthand in the \nflood disaster of 1997. Not only did they stay in all weekend down at \nHUD to get the money out to the affected communities, which was a \nsplendid performance, but they were with us every step of the way in \nrevitalizing and rebuilding that community.\n  We have just seen the result. The Senator from North Dakota was with \nme and with James Lee Witt as we toured Grand Forks to see how that \ncommunity is coming back. It would not have happened, the mayor of \nGrand Rapids said to me when we were at the League of Cities meeting \nSaturday night in North Dakota, without the assistance from the Federal \nGovernment that was received by the community of Grand Forks.\n  The key agencies were obviously FEMA and HUD, also SBA. All of those \nwere major contributors, as well as the Commerce Department and EDA. \nThose four agencies made a profound difference. The mayor said to me \nflatly, without the contribution made by HUD and Secretary Cuomo, that \ntown would not have come back in the way it has in just this short \nperiod.\n  It is truly amazing to drive through the streets of Grand Forks now, \nto see the schools that have been rebuilt, to see the downtown that is \nunder construction--a new corporate center, a new county facility--to \nsee other buildings that are being rehabilitated, to drive through the \nneighborhoods and see the new homes that have been constructed, \nhundreds of new homes, to see the devastated homes that have been taken \nout, to see the new greenway that is being created, and to go across \nthe river and see a brand new superstore that is being built and will \nattract hundreds of thousands of people a year. This is a testimony to \nprograms that work.\n  We all know there are Federal programs that don't work. We all know \nthere are times when Federal money is not well spent. This is an \nexample of when the Federal Government proved its worth and proved its \nmettle, performed, and made a difference in the lives of tens of \nthousands of people.\n  I want to publicly commend Secretary Cuomo and the people at HUD and \nto say this Community Builders Program ought not to be thrown over the \nside. We have 400 people who were recruited from 9,000 who applied to \ncome to work for the Government for 2 years--in and out--to add their \nexpertise and energy. We ought to continue the experiment. We know from \nevery independent analysis this is a program that has worked.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/27/senate-section/article/S11462-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11462-S11463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BUDGET SURPLUS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Today the Office of Management and Budget announced the \nunified budget is in surplus for fiscal year 1999 by at least $115 \nbillion. That is significantly higher than the unified surplus of $70 \nbillion for fiscal year 1998 and, in fact, is the largest dollar \nsurplus in the history of the United States.\n  This is a good day. This is a good day for the country, and this is a \ngood day for the Congress. It is certainly a good day for the President \nand the administration.\n  In 1992, the budget deficit was $290 billion. The forecast then was \nthat the deficit for this year would be over $400 billion. That was the \nforecast in 1992 for where we were headed if we didn't change course. \nWe did change course. The President proposed, and the Congress passed, \na plan in 1993, a 5-year plan, that has worked splendidly. In each and \nevery year of that 5-year plan, the deficit came down. In 1997, we \npassed a bipartisan addition to that plan. That addition closed the \ngap, made the difference, and finished the job. Now we can report we \nhave budget surpluses.\n\n[[Page S11463]]\n\n  The job is not fully complete because while we are reporting a $115 \nbillion surplus this year, the Social Security surplus is $124 billion. \nIn this year, we are still using $9 billion of that $124 billion Social \nSecurity surplus for other things. We shouldn't do that. It ought to \nstop.\n  But what dramatic progress we have made. We have gone from budget \ndeficits of $290 billion just 7 years ago to a $115 billion budget \nsurplus this year, and we are within hailing distance of stopping the \nraid on the Social Security trust fund. The Social Security trust fund \nis a $124 billion surplus in fiscal year 1999, and we are running a \nsurplus of $115 billion. So we are very close to stopping the raid on \nthe Social Security trust fund.\n  I hope very much we are able to stay on that course. We know that is \nin real jeopardy for fiscal year 2000. We know that if everything plays \nout as is currently contemplated in the Appropriations Committees, we \nwill be using between $30 billion and $40 billion of the Social \nSecurity surplus next year. We will be going backwards. Let's not do \nthat. Let's not go backwards. Let's keep moving forward. Next year, \nlet's be able to report that we are not using any of the Social \nSecurity surplus for any other purpose. That ought to be our goal.\n  We are now in this remarkable position of being able to say that if \nwe stay the course, if we don't go out on some big, new spending binge, \nif we don't have some radical, reckless tax scheme, we will be able to \nbalance the budget without counting Social Security and we will be able \nto eliminate the publicly held debt of the country in the next 15 \nyears.\n  Every economist who has come before the Senate Budget Committee and \nevery economist who has come before the Senate Finance Committee has \nsaid the highest and best use of these surpluses is to reduce the debt. \nWhat we did in 1993 confirms that view.\n  Remember that in 1993 we took action on a 5-year budget plan to \nreduce the deficit each and every year. The idea was, that would take \npressure off interest rates and that would give the greatest lift to \nthe economy, that by reducing deficits and debt, we would reduce \npressure on interest rates, that lower interest rates would help our \neconomy perform more strongly, and we would improve our competitive \nposition in the world.\n\n  How well that strategy and plan have served this country. Each and \nevery year of that 5-year budget plan passed in 1993 we reduced the \nbudget deficit. Each and every year we were moving towards lower \nspending as a percentage of our gross domestic product. Every year of \nthat 5-year budget plan we were moving towards the point at which we \ncould start reducing the national debt. That plan worked.\n  Now we are able to see the longest economic expansion in our history, \nthe lowest inflation in 30 years, the lowest unemployment in 30 years, \nand the lowest welfare rates in 30 years, with total spending of the \nFederal Government being reduced. We have gone from 22.7 percent of our \nnational income, our gross domestic product, going to the Federal \nGovernment to this year it being down to 19 percent. We are headed in \nthe right direction. Let's keep that up.\n  Let's move to a circumstance in which we will be able to report next \nyear that we have stopped raiding the Social Security trust fund. Let's \nbe able to report that we are on schedule to eliminate the publicly \nheld debt of the United States in 15 years. What a great thing that \nwould be for our country. How well that would position us for the baby-\nboom generation, because pretty soon we baby boomers are going to start \nto retire. We are going to add dramatically to the burden on the \nFederal Government from Social Security and Medicare, and the single \nbest way to prepare for that eventuality is to reduce publicly held \ndebt. We can do it. It is within our grasp. But we have to avoid new \nspending schemes and we have to avoid risky tax schemes if we are going \nto deliver on that promise.\n  I hope very much that together we will stay the course and put \nAmerica in a circumstance in which it is able to announce in 15 years \nthat there is no publicly held debt in America. What a great \ncircumstance that would be for our Nation. I can't think of anything \nthat would be a better present to our children and our grandchildren \nthan to be able to eliminate the publicly held debt in the next 15 \nyears.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/27/senate-section/article/S11463-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11463-S11464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments about the \nsubject of education.\n  We will have two votes later today on two competing resolutions \noffered by the majority leader and the Democratic leader here in the \nSenate on the subject of education. I would like to make a couple of \ncomments about that general subject.\n  Some long while ago, I was touring refugee camps as a member of a \nhunger committee in the House of Representatives. One of the camps I \nrecall visiting was on the border between Honduras and Guatemala.\n  At the United Nations High Command for Relief Operations camp that \nthey were running there on the border of Guatemala, I saw a lot of \nimpoverished people who had been forced to leave their homes and were \nliving in the camp. I visited with some of them through an interpreter. \nOne older fellow, probably in his seventies, could not speak English \nbut he motioned with his hands for me to come with him.\n  So I followed him about 20 paces or so back to this area where he was \nliving in a tent with so many others. The refugees at this camp had \ncots to sleep on, and this fellow reached under his cot, and from among \nhis meager belongings, which would have fit in one small knapsack, he \npulled out a very small book. Then he grinned a rather toothless grin. \nHe had only a few teeth in his mouth, but his smile was a mile wide as \nhe held up this book to show me. The interpreter who had walked with me \ninto that tent said: He wants to show you the book he is learning to \nread.\n  Here was a man living in a refugee camp, sleeping on a cot, in a tent \nwith many others with only a meager subsistence who was proud to show a \nvisitor that he was learning to read. The book he held up to show me \nwas the Spanish equivalent of a ``See Spot Run'' book. In halting \nSpanish, he read a couple of pages, and the interpreter interpreted \nwhat he was reading for me.\n  I have always remembered those circumstance because there on that \ndirt floor, in that tent, in that refugee camp, this fellow in his \nseventies was enormously proud of being able to learn to read, even \nthough he was on his first primer book.\n  This story illustrates for a lot of people how important it is to be \neducated and to have opportunity. How does it happen that opportunity \nexists in some societies and not in others? How does it happen that we \nin America have been so fortunate while some others have not?\n  I have told my colleagues before that one of the first visits I made \nwhen I came to Congress was to the oldest Member of Congress at the \ntime, Claude Pepper. He was then in his late eighties. Above the chair \nin his office were two photographs autographed to him. The first \nphotograph was of Orville and Wilbur Wright making the first airplane \nflight. Orville Wright had autographed it to Congressman Claude Pepper \nbefore he died. Beneath it was an autographed picture of Neil Armstrong \nwalking on the Moon, also autographed to Congressman Claude Pepper.\n  I was struck by those two gifts from the first persons who learned to \nfly and then from the first person to fly to the Moon--autographed \npictures that occurred in the span of Congressman Pepper's lifetime.\n  What was it that caused that explosion of knowledge, learning, and \ntechnology? The answer: Education. It was our education system that \nsaid to every young boy or girl in this country: You can become \nwhatever you want to become. You can be a physicist, a scientist, a \ndoctor, a barber, a mechanic. You decide what you want to become, and \nour education system allows your young minds to flower and to develop \ntheir full potential.\n  How is it that in our country we invented the television, we invented \nthe computer, we invented plastic, radar, the silicon chip, we learned \nto fly, we\n\n[[Page S11464]]\n\nflew to the Moon, and now we splice genes? That all comes from \neducation.\n  This education system of ours is not perfect. Through public \neducation in America, we have decided there will be universal \nopportunity for all children and our obligation is to maintain a public \nschool system to provide that opportunity for all. In our public \nschools in this country, we have about 53 million students who went to \nschool this morning, 53 million children in kindergarten through high \nschool, and that number is going to continue to increase. Our challenge \nis to have education policies that invest in our schools to make sure \nthose children are attending good schools.\n  When they walk through the door of a school, we want to make certain \nchildren have a good learning environment. Yet we have crumbling \nschools across this country. I have spoken on the floor at length about \nsome Indian schools I have visited that no one in this Chamber would \nwant their children to attend, but there is not enough money to invest \nin fixing these crumbling schools. What are we doing to attract and \nretain the best teachers? Do we have enough money to do that?\n  Some say these things are too expensive. Yet in the Senate we have \nfolks saying, although we cannot increase education funding, we have \nenough resources to provide a $792 billion tax cut over 10 years. That \nis our priority, they say. But we do not have enough money to fund this \nFederal investment in education. In fact, what has happened is that the \n$792 billion tax cut is only possible if we put a squeeze on domestic \ndiscretionary spending that means there is not enough money to fund \neducation.\n  My colleagues on Friday described the consequences of the Republican \nactions. The Republican budget allocation for education, which is 17 \npercent lower than the 1999 levels, would provide 5,246 fewer new \nqualified teachers, 50,000 students would be denied afterschool and \nsummer school programs, 142,000 children denied access to Head Start, \n100,000 students denied Pell grant awards, and the list goes on because \nthere is not adequate funding to do that.\n  Some of us believe there are certain obligations we have to maintain \na strong public education system. To do that, we have put forward a \nproposal that does not cost very much but that would allow the \nrefurbishing and remodeling of 6,000 public schools nationwide. Many of \nthese schools across the country were built after the second world war \nand many of them are in desperate need of modernization and repair. \nThis is a need not currently being met, and we have proposed a method \nto meet it. Helping local communities to reduce class sizes by being \nable to hire more teachers, ensuring teachers get the professional \ndevelopment they need to stay on top of their subject matter, increased \nfunding for special education, and providing 1 million more children \nwith access to constructive afterschool programs--all of these are \nimportant ingredients for developing a public education system we can \nbe proud of and one that continues to work.\n  There is a big difference in these proposals and what those on the \nother side of the aisle have proposed. I am proud to be part of a \npolitical party that has always viewed education and investment in this \ncountry's children as a priority. There are some people serving in the \nSenate who have said let's abolish the Federal Department of Education. \nThey have stopped actively trying to do that because they know it is \nmassively unpopular with the American people and so we do not hear much \nfrom them anymore. But that is what they believe; that is what they \nwould like to do. They have a right to that belief. I respect that, but \nI disagree with it profoundly because this country's future progress \nand opportunities rest on our ability to educate our future, our young \nchildren. It is our responsibility to educate our children in good \nschools with good teachers in classrooms that are safe.\n  I hope that, when we vote on the education resolutions before us this \nevening and when we continue to discuss this issue in the days ahead, \nwe might reach a consensus among everyone in this Chamber that \neducation ought to be the engine driving the budget train. It ought not \nbe the caboose on this appropriations train, it should be the lead car. \nEducation ought not be dealt with as an afterthought. It ought to be \nthe priority for this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I make a point of order a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I want to take some time to talk about a \ncouple of items that are related to the desperate crisis facing \nAmerica's family farmers. One, what the conference committee on \nAgriculture Appropriations, of which I am a member, is doing--or, as is \nmore accurate, not doing--to help them. Second, I want to talk to the \nissue of the burgeoning growing trade deficit.\n  I will talk for a moment about the Agriculture appropriations bill \nwhich is now in conference between the Senate and the House. I am a \nconferee. The Senate passed its version of that bill and included \nroughly $7.4 billion in emergency help for family farmers because \nprices have collapsed and farmers are in desperate trouble. We passed \nthat on August 4.\n  Weeks and weeks went by and nothing happened. No conference. No \nmeetings. Then last week, those of us who are conferees met with the \nHouse of Representatives. Then the Chair called an adjournment. The \nMembers of the House called an adjournment, and we have not met since. \nNearly a week later, and there has been no meeting since.\n  Why? They are all hung up on the House side of the conference with \nrespect to the question of whether we should retain embargoes on food \nand medicine.\n  The answer to that is simple: Of course not. Of course we should not \nretain any embargoes on food and medicine. That is what the Senate \nsaid. By a vote of 70, the Senate said let us stop using food as a \nweapon.\n  We have used food as a weapon against Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea--\nyou name it. We have embargoes. I do not have any problems with \nembargoes against countries that are behaving badly, but the embargo \nshould not include food. Why would you want to include food and \nmedicine in embargoes that hurt the poor folks around the globe, the \npeople who need the food and medicine?\n  I have always maintained that when we put an embargo on food \nshipments anywhere in the world, it is the equivalent of shooting \nourselves in the foot. When you do it for 40 years, it is almost \nunforgivable. It is one thing to shoot yourself in the foot; it is \nanother thing to take aim, hit it, and then brag about it. That has \nbeen the policy.\n  The Senate, by 70 votes, said: No more; we are going to break the \nback of food embargoes; we are going to stop using food as a weapon; \nover; finished; done.\n  We went to conference, and the House of Representatives said: No, we \nwant to continue using food as a weapon in some circumstances. The \nresult is, we have not even been meeting in that conference, and the \nemergency help that is needed for family farmers around this country is \nnot getting done because the conference is not meeting.\n  Hurricane Floyd roared up the east coast, and I am told that there \nare over 100,000 hogs floating belly up dead in floodwaters, along with \na million chickens, untold heads of cattle and horses. There are crops \nunderwater, devastated, and gone. The folks down in that region who \nwere so badly hurt by Hurricane Floyd are flat on their backs wondering \nhow they are going to get through this. How they will get through it \ndepends on this Congress deciding whether it will extend a helping hand \nsaying: When a natural disaster strikes, we want to help you.\n  Other farmers in my home state were flooded out this spring. Over \nthree million acres of farmland did not get planted early this spring, \nand family farmers who did get acres planted have discovered that if \nthey got a crop, it was, in many cases, a bad crop with sprout damage. \nIf they got a good crop\n\n[[Page S11465]]\n\nand hauled it to the elevator, they were told by the grain market their \ncrop was not worth anything because prices had collapsed.\n  The bill before the conference committee is a bill that provides from \nthe Senate side, not the House side, emergency help for collapsed \nprices and disaster relief for the massive loss of livestock and for \nprevented planning. All of those issues are critical for family \nfarmers. If this does not get done, we will have family farmers going \nbelly up in record rates in the next couple of months.\n  It is unfathomable to me that we have this interminable delay in \nsomething that is so urgent. There wasn't a delay in passing a $792 \nbillion tax cut that we could not afford, spending $792 billion in tax \nbreaks over 10 years based on the premise that we might have surpluses \nin the future. We do not have surpluses yet. All we have are \nprojections by economists.\n  Nobody knows what is going to happen in the future, but we are told \nto expect surpluses for 10 years. So before the first real surplus \nexists, we have folks rushing to the Senate Chamber to cut nearly $800 \nbillion in taxes. There was an urgency to do that, a real urgency. We \nhad to get it done immediately. But, of course, on the issue of \nproviding disaster relief to family farmers, there is not quite the \nurgency, at least not for some.\n  There is a crisis in farm country. This deserves a response now. The \nconference ought to be meeting. We ought to pass emergency relief. We \nought to pass disaster relief. We ought to extend a helping hand to \nfarmers of this country to say: You matter. We care and want to help \nyou get through these tough times.\n  Let me turn to the other issue that is related to the family farm \ncrisis, the trade deficit. Last week, we heard from the Department of \nCommerce. We see in the newspapers that the trade deficit has gone up \nonce again to a record high of $25.2 billion last month alone.\n  What does that have to do with farmers? It means we are selling less \noverseas than we used to. We are importing much more from other \ncountries.\n  Here is an example of what is happening with our trade deficit with \nCanada. Mr. President, on this chart, 1998 is in blue; 1999 is in red. \nThere was nearly a doubling of the trade deficit with Canada in one \nyear, a dramatic increase in the trade deficit with Mexico, and a \ndramatic increase in the trade deficit with the European Union. Of \ncourse, these are much lower than the trade deficits that exist with \nChina and Japan. We have huge trade deficits with China and Japan.\n  In addition to all of this, our family farmers in North Dakota who \nare hurting so badly are suffering from a massive quantity of durum \nwheat being shipped into our country, in my judgment illegally, by the \nCanadians. Last year saw the largest amount of durum wheat imports, and \nin the first 6 months of this year, the level of imports is 80 percent \nabove that.\n  What is being done about all of this? Senator Byrd, Senator Stevens, \nand I and others were able to establish a Trade Deficit Review \nCommission last year. That Commission is now meeting to make \nrecommendations on the trade deficit. Otherwise, this matter has met \nwith eerie silence. We do not hear anything from the administration. We \ndo not hear anything from Congress about this issue.\n  This is a very serious issue that could easily undermine this \ncountry's economic growth. We have to do something about it, and we \nhave to do something now. One of the things we ought to do is expect \nthis administration to stand up and take action against unfair trade, \nwhich is part of this. I will show you what they have done.\n  We have a trade dispute with Europe, and the trade dispute actually \nis about a couple of things. One is beef, which is legitimate. The \nsecond is bananas. We do not produce bananas in the United States. We \nhave American corporations that get bananas from the Caribbean and want \nto ship them to Europe. Europe does not want the Caribbean bananas, so \nwe have a trade dispute on behalf of American corporations that are \nshipping to Europe something we do not produce. So we are right and \nthey are wrong. On the merits we are right.\n\n  It is always surprising to me. We fight so hard over bananas. How \nabout durum wheat? Durum wheat deals with semolina flour. Semolina \nflour is made into pasta. When you eat pasta, you are eating something \nfrom the wheat fields, often in North Dakota. What about standing up \nfor those producers? We stand up for banana producers in the Caribbean. \nWhat about standing up for wheat producers?\n  What have we done now? We have done nothing about the unfair trade \nfrom Canada, but we have taken tough action against the Europeans with \nrespect to the banana and beef hormones cases. We said to the \nEuropeans: You better watch it. We're going to take action against you \non Roquefort cheese. That is tough. You whip somebody with Roquefort \ncheese. You can have a big fight.\n  Or even better, we are going to take action against your Roquefort \ncheese and chilled truffles. That is strong action. This is going to \nscare the devil out of the Europeans.\n  Do you know what else we are going to do? We have decided we are \ngoing to take action against goose livers. If that does not scare the \nEuropeans, it will at least scare the geese. Goose livers, chilled \ntruffles, Roquefort cheese--and finally tough action against animal \nbladders. That is not all. There are some regular things as well.\n  If we are going to get tough on trade--and I have been waiting for \nthis a long time--maybe we can get tough on durum wheat. But, no, not \nus, not our trade ambassador. We get tough on goose livers. Maybe I \nmissed the point. Maybe everybody in the world will miss the point.\n  If we can't stand up and insist on fair trade, on open markets \noverseas--and, yes, on fair trade at home, to be sure--if we can't do \nthat, this country will never get this trade deficit under control.\n  The trade deficit is huge and growing. Almost everyone understands \nthat it is dangerous. It is unsustainable. It will inevitably result in \na weakened dollar and higher interest rates and less economic growth. \nThis country must get a handle on the trade deficit.\n  I have sent a letter to President Clinton once again and said to the \nPresident: If this trade ambassador is not willing to take action \nagainst the Canadians, replace the trade ambassador. The Canadians are \njust one issue. Replace the trade ambassador if she will not take \naction.\n  This ambassador has the authority to self-initiate a trade complaint, \nand ought to do so. If the failure to do so at USTR is due to the \nambassador, get an ambassador who will.\n  We are willing to get tough with the European over bananas--that we \ndo not produce here.\n  Forgive me for being cynical. Forgive me for wondering if there is \nsome common sense around here. How about standing up for things that \nmatter in a way that says to our trading partners: This country demands \naction. This country demands open markets. This country demands fair \ntrade. This country demands a stop to dumping in our marketplace. This \ncountry demands an end to unfair trade at secret prices by State \ntrading enterprises that would not be legal in this country.\n  How does this relate to farmers? As I said before, family farmers \nmust find a foreign home for much of what they produce. Regrettably, \nour trade policy has now produced very large trade deficits for two \nreasons. One is because foreign markets have evaporated, dried up, been \nreduced in size.\n  It is true that no one in the Congress or the administration caused \nthe Asian crisis. I understand that. Yet there are other problems--the \nfailure to enforce fundamental trade laws, the failure to enforce \nNAFTA, the negotiation of incompetent trade agreements; and then the \nfailure to even live up to those incompetent agreements. This is not, \nin my judgment, something that we should be expecting from our trade \nrepresentatives.\n\n  Mr. President, I know my colleague from Utah is seeking recognition. \nHow much time remains, if I might inquire?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 51 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me take about 2 or 3 additional minutes. I know my \ncolleague has things he would like to say to the Senate, as well.\n  Let me conclude by saying this. I regret coming to the floor and \ntalking in these terms about the trade ambassador's office or about the \nadministration. I think the trade strategy of this\n\n[[Page S11466]]\n\nCongress is abysmal, to the extent we have one--and I guess largely we \ndo not because you do not hear anybody talking about a trade strategy \nexcept myself and a couple others.\n  It is this Congress that passed NAFTA. It is this Congress that \npassed the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement. It is this \nCongress that passed the WTO. I didn't vote for any one of the three. \nBut we helped cause these problems, and we ought to help solve them.\n  This administration has a responsibility, and so does this Congress. \nAnd this Congress bears responsibility for the farm policy, the \nunderlying farm policy that relates in some part to this trade policy \nthat is such a significant failure.\n  Our President has been very helpful in trying to push for a disaster \nand emergency package that will be helpful to family farmers, to save \nthem from catastrophe, the catastrophe of collapsed prices.\n  How would anyone in this Chamber, how would anyone in this country \nlike to do business when someone says to you: By the way, your income \nis going to be changed this year. You say: How is that? And they say: \nYou are going to receive depression-era income. We are going to adjust \nyour income to depression levels.\n  That is what has happened to family farmers. How many here would like \nto lose 40, 60, or 80 percent of your income and be told that is the \nway the market system works? It is not the way it works in a country \nthat cares about producing on the land with a network of family farms.\n  Europe does not do that. Europe has 7.5 million farms. And it says: \nWe want you to stay on the farms because we want to have a healthy \nrural system in our country, with small towns that are thriving and \nfamily farms that are making a living.\n  That happens in Europe. It happens because they have public policy \nthat demands it. This country does not have comparable public policy. I \nhope that it will someday soon.\n  This Congress must create that public policy. This President will \nlead in that direction. That is what he believes. This President is \nstrong on those issues. I criticize this administration on trade. On \nfarm policy, this administration has been very helpful.\n  It is this Congress that is dragging its feet. As a member of the \nconference committee, I hope very much that we will soon get back to \nwork on an emergency and a disaster package to respond to the desperate \nneeds of family farmers.\n  I also hope this administration will take action, aggressive action, \nto deal with these trade problems. I hope the administration and \nCongress will understand the gravity of the trade deficit and the \ngravity that the unsustainable increase in our current account deficit \nposes to this country's economy.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his kindness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/27/senate-section/article/S11466-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11466-S11470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FEDERAL TOBACCO LAWSUIT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, never in my years of service to the people \nof Utah and this country have I witnessed an administration more \ninclined to twist, deform, or ignore, the rule of law than the Clinton \nadministration. The past 7 years are replete with exploits of legal \nmanipulation. Indeed, the legacy of the administration may prove to be \nthat its most significant exploits--infamous or otherwise--were \naccomplished by warping the law for blatant political purposes. Here \nare just a few of the most notorious examples: Attorney General Reno \nboth misapplied and ignored the Independent Counsel Act in order to \nprevent the appointment of an independent counsel in the campaign \nfinance investigation; the 1996 election fundraising scandal where soft \nmoney prohibitions were ignored and foreign donations were illegally \nand eagerly accepted; fundraising from the White House--it was \ndeplorable the Escalante Proclamation, where a huge chunk of Southern \nUtah was effectively annexed by the Federal government without any \nprior consultation with Utah officials, to my knowledge--certainly not \nany elected officials; the misuse of FBI files by the White House--the \nmyriad proclamations of Executive Orders as a vehicle to skirt the \nauthority of Congress; and just to mention one more, the violation of \nthe Vacancies Act to hold in office individuals lacking Senate \nconfirmation.\n  This list does not even include the myriad events, dissemblance, and \ncontempt for the law and our courts, which brought us the impeachment.\n  Given this record, I must confess that I wasn't shocked to learn that \nthe Department of Justice may have misled Congress in sworn testimony \nand then filed suit against the tobacco industry.\n  Last Wednesday, the Department of Justice filed in Federal district \ncourt a multibillion dollar suit against the tobacco industry seeking \nrecoupment of losses to Federal health care programs. After reviewing \nthe 131-page complaint, I have serious reservations concerning several \nkey counts in the complaint. Moreover, I am skeptical of the entire \nlawsuit.\n\n  It is well known around here that I am no friend of tobacco use, nor \nan apologist for the tobacco industry. Indeed, I have never used \ntobacco products in my life and am opposed to tobacco use. I never \ninhaled or chewed tobacco.\n  Along with my cosponsor, Senator Feinstein, I worked hard last \nCongress to pass legislation that would have gone a long way in helping \nAmericans to kick the habit and in reducing teen smoking. The \nlegislation required the tobacco companies to pay over $400 billion to \nsettle existing lawsuits--$429 billion, to be more accurate. In return \nfor the settlement of these lawsuits, the companies would have stopped \ntargeting children and would have funded smoking cessation efforts.\n  While this measure has yet to pass, I strongly believe that the \nfairest and most effective solution to the use of tobacco is omnibus \nlegislation such as the Hatch-Feinstein bill rather than relying upon \nlegally dubious lawsuits. Litigation cannot effectively deal with \nimportant public policy problems, such as what measures the industry \nmust take to reduce youth smoking or what effect will rising prices \nhave on the black market for cigarettes.\n  Given my skepticism about the administration's fidelity to the rule \nof law, I have several questions concerning the Federal lawsuit. The \nfirst question I have is, What is the administration's motivation here? \nIt has been reported that many attorneys at the Department of Justice \nopposed filing of a lawsuit because the Federal Government did not \npossess a valid cause of action or claim against the tobacco companies.\n  Indeed, Attorney General Reno, at the April 30, 1997, hearing before \nthe Judiciary Committee, testified that no Federal cause of action \nexisted for both Federal Medicare and Medicaid claims. I disagree with \nthe assertion made by David Ogden, Acting Assistant Attorney General \nfor the Civil Division and the current nominee for that post, that \nAttorney General Reno was referring only to State actions. Ms. Reno's \ncontention that no Federal cause of action existed was made clearly in \nresponse to a question by Senator Kennedy, who asked whether the \nFederal Government could recoup both Medicare and Medicaid payments.\n  It was only after President Clinton, in his State of the Union \nAddress in January, called for a suit against the tobacco industry that \nthe Department of Justice changed its tune and, presto, announced that \na legitimate cause of action may exist.\n  I have been criticized in the past for saying that the politically \nminded and partisan White House, and not the Attorney General, is in \nreality running the Department of Justice. In the case of the Federal \ntobacco litigation, it appears once more that the White House is \ndirecting the activities of the Department of Justice for political \nends. This lawsuit is a horrible precedent that, if it continues, will \nerode the liberty of the American people. Here again, the rule of law \nis apparently being replaced by the rule of the politically correct and \nexpedient.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the fine story appearing in last \nFriday's Wall Street Journal entitled ``Justice Reverses: Lobbying \nEffort Wins Turnabout On Tobacco Suit.''\n\n[[Page S11467]]\n\n  This story chronicled the change in the Department's position \nconcerning the viability of the Federal tobacco suit. The story \ndemonstrated that the Department's attorneys were skeptical about a \nFederal lawsuit. It also established that the Department brought suit \nonly after pressure from the White House and outside lobbyists, who \napparently were paid by an outside consultant for their efforts to help \nconvince the Department to change its viewpoints.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 24, 1999]\n\n Tobacco--Justice Reverses: Lobbying Effort Wins Turnabout On Tobacco \n                                  Suit\n\n          (By David S. Cloud, Gordon Fairclough and Ann Davis)\n\n       Washington.--On a rainy day in January of this year, a \n     group of high-profile academics and lawyers with experience \n     in the tobacco wars trooped into a conference room filled \n     with dour Justice Department officials to make a case for \n     filing a federal lawsuit against the tobacco industry.\n       The prosecutors were dubious. ``The meeting was tense,'' \n     says G. Robert Blakey, a Notre Dame law professor and member \n     of the group, which some called the Tiger Team. ``You could \n     palpably feel the hostility in the room.''\n       But this week the Justice Department made a startling \n     turnabout. On Wednesday it filed a massive civil lawsuit in \n     federal court here charging that major tobacco companies \n     carried on a 45-year campaign of deception that obfuscated \n     the risks of smoking and drove up government health-care \n     costs. The suit is potentially the biggest threat yet against \n     the already beleaguered industry. It is also a major test of \n     Attorney General Janet Reno's Justice Department.\n       The story of how the department overcame its doubts is a \n     tangled one, involving pressure on the department from \n     several directions at once--from the White House, Congress \n     and plaintiffs' lawyers involved in state suits against the \n     industry.\n       Inside the department, an institutional reluctance to take \n     on a case involving untested legal theories and an industry \n     sure to wage a bruising fight slowly fell away as key \n     officials realized that they had the makings of a case, \n     albeit a difficult one.\n       The effort to persuade the department to change its mind \n     began over a year ago, following the collapse of efforts to \n     pass sweeping federal legislation that would have broadened \n     regulatory oversight of tobacco companies and settled the \n     state cases. Mississippi plaintiffs' attorney Richard Scruggs \n     called top Clinton domestic-policy aide Bruce Reed at the \n     White House and volunteered to represent the federal \n     government free in an antitobacco case.\n       ``They were excited about it,'' Mr. Scruggs says, and were \n     looking for ways to bring the industry back to the \n     negotiating table before the eventual settlements with all \n     the states. He had several meetings with Mr. Reed and others \n     at the White House. But the White House was having trouble \n     sparking interest at Justice, according to administration \n     officials.\n       The biggest obstacle was Frank Hunger, another \n     Mississippian, who headed the department's civil division, \n     which would have handled the case. Mr. Hunger had been \n     married to Vice President Al Gore's sister, a smoker who died \n     of lung cancer. Advocates of a lawsuit considered him a \n     natural ally, but it turned out that Mr. Hunger and his top \n     aides were dubious that the federal government had a strong \n     statutory basis to sue the industry.\n       In a meeting with Mr. Scruggs, Mr. Hunger was cordial, but \n     said: ``My lawyers are telling me we can't do it,'' according \n     to Mr. Scruggs. Mr. Scruggs wrote a memo, to address their \n     concerns, but says he got no response. Mr. Hunger declined to \n     comment.\n       Mr. Scruggs and his allies had a strong motivation to get \n     the federal government involved. Some of the lawyers had \n     represented states in suits against the industry and were \n     hoping to see those settled, in part so they could collect \n     legal fees. They thought the industry would be more likely to \n     settle if it faced the combined weight of the state suits and \n     the federal government.\n       During the summer and fall of 1998, they worked other \n     angles in hopes of persuading the Justice Department. They \n     met with Mr. Reed and assistant White House counsel Bruce \n     Lindsey to brainstorm.\n       Then, later in the autumn, Mr. Scruggs says, he got a call \n     from Sen. Kent Conrad (D., N.D.) informing him that Senators \n     Conrad, Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) and Bob Graham (D., Fla.) \n     were interested in getting him to do a federal case. To \n     persuade Ms. Reno that her staff was wrong, Mr. Scruggs \n     assembled what he called the Tiger Team of Mr. Blakey; \n     professors Laurence Tribe and Einer Elhauge of Harvard Law \n     School; Jonathan Massey, a Washington lawyer; and Kim Tucker, \n     a lawyer then on leave from the Florida attorney general's \n     office. He estimates that he paid them a total of about \n     $250,000 for their efforts.\n       Inside Justice, interest in tobacco was building anyway. \n     Mr. Hunger announced his intention to leave at the end of \n     1998. In December, Ms. Reno made the decision, which was kept \n     confidential, to move forward with the lawsuit, aides said. \n     She designated David Ogden, who succeeded Mr. Hunger, to put \n     together the team. It included William Schultz, a former \n     Food and Drug Administration official and onetime aide to \n     tobacco critic Henry Waxman, a Democratic congressman from \n     California.\n       Many career lawyers in the department remained skeptical, \n     but President Clinton surprised them by announcing in his \n     State of the Union address to Congress in late January that a \n     suit was in the works.\n       Working in strict secrecy, 15 Justice Department lawyers \n     reviewed thousands of pages of internal industry documents \n     unearthed in state lawsuits. Roberta Walburn, an outside \n     lawyer who represented Minnesota, was hired to help sift \n     through the evidence and discuss legal theories. One shift of \n     Justice Department lawyers worked by day, another by night.\n       Other outsiders were rebuffed. Ms. Tucker, who worked with \n     the Scruggs team, said she had trouble getting her calls \n     returned. She says a Justice Department attorney even told \n     her: ``At some point, outside assistance becomes a hindrance. \n     We at Justice will decide what, if anything, is in the \n     interest of the United States.''\n       Ultimately, the Justice Department decided on a bold use of \n     the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute, \n     which permits the government to go after profits derived from \n     fraud.\n       Ms. Reno made the final call to go forward on Tuesday, the \n     day before the suit was filed, a Justice official said. She \n     then telephoned the White House and informed John Podesta, \n     Mr. Clinton's chief of staff.\n       For President Clinton, the suit holds out the possibility \n     of winning far-reaching restrictions in the marketing and \n     advertising of cigarettes, a legacy he has sought early in \n     his first term.\n       But that is by no means assured. Tobacco lawyers plan to \n     make a concerted push to have the suit dismissed, on the \n     grounds that the government has no statutory authority to \n     combine millions of individual smokers' claims into a single \n     cost-recovery suit. Also, the industry says the RICO claims \n     seeking ill-gotten profits are unwarranted against a legal \n     industry.\n       The Justice Department's increasing interest in a civil \n     case coincided with the collapse of its massive five-year \n     criminal investigation of the industry. The case had once \n     seemed promising. But last year, the federal appeals court in \n     Richmond, Va., ruled that the Food and Drug Administration \n     didn't have the authority to regulate tobacco companies. \n     Prosecutors became worried they couldn't charge companies \n     with making false statements about alleged nicotine \n     manipulation to an agency that had no authority over them.\n       There were other setbacks, too. Brown & Williamson, a unit \n     of British American Tobacco PLC, succeeded in convincing the \n     judge overseeing grand-jury matters to deny the government \n     access to documents the company said were privileged. And \n     several Philip Morris Cos. scientists who were granted \n     immunity in exchange for their testimony revealed little to \n     the grand jury, say people with knowledge of their testimony.\n       The tobacco industry's jubilation didn't last long. Philip \n     Morris Senior Vice President Steven C. Parrish says an \n     industry lawyer had received assurance from a senior White \n     House official several months ago that a lawsuit wouldn't be \n     filed without the industry getting a chance to make a final \n     presentation. But on Tuesday night, Mr. Parrish says, he \n     learned of the impending lawsuit from reporters.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Another question I have is, Why wasn't Congress consulted? \nMonths prior to the filing of the lawsuit, I had been attempting to \nascertain on what legal theories the Department may base a lawsuit \nagainst the tobacco companies, but the Department has refused to share \nthe information, even though the Department has asked for an additional \n$20 million to finance the suit. I assured them that the American \npeople and the Congress will want to know what they are paying for. \nCongress is not in the habit of writing blank checks, and, in the \nabsence of a straight answer, Congress appropriately refused the \nadditional monies.\n  Notwithstanding the clear position of Congress, I learned of the \nfiling of the suit from the newspapers. This is particularly galling \nsince the Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division and \nthe nominee for that office, David Ogden, in written responses dated \nSeptember 2 to my questions concerning the possible suit against the \ntobacco industry, wrote that the Department had not even decided \nwhether to file the suit or on what legal theories to pursue any \nprojected litigation. He stated at that time:\n\n       The Department is currently in active preparation for this \n     litigation, and we are in the process of making decisions on \n     whether it will be filed and, if so, based on what legal \n     theories.\n\n  Now, less than 3 weeks later, the full-fledged suit has been filed.\n\n[[Page S11468]]\n\n  I have yet another question. Does the Department of Justice have any \nchance of prevailing on the merits? The Department seeks to ``recoup'' \nthe cost of medical care for treatment of tobacco-related illnesses for \nthose on Medicaid, but the injury claimed by the Federal Government may \nbe questionable. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service \nrecently issued a study which concluded that tobacco use imposes no net \ncost to the Federal Government. Indeed, the Federal Government receives \napproximately $6 billion a year in tobacco tax revenue. Moreover, it is \nsimply absurd for the Government to seek recoupment when it has been a \nvigorous partner with the tobacco industry in promoting tobacco use.\n  From the late 1960s to the late 1970s, the Federal Government worked \nhand in hand with the tobacco industry to develop so-called ``safe'' \ncigarettes. Until 1974, the Government provided free cigarettes in C \nrations to servicemen.\n  Furthermore, cigarettes continue to be sold at substantially \ndiscounted rates at military post exchanges. In 1997, the Department of \nVeterans Affairs blocked claims by veterans for tobacco-related \nillnesses, contending that these individuals should not be covered \nbecause they were responsible for their individual choices and the \nhealth problems that resulted from those choices.\n  Of course, the Federal Government yearly subsidizes tobacco growing. \nPerhaps the public interest groups should sue the Federal Government, \nwhich authorized and fostered the growing of tobacco and the \nmanufacture and sale of tobacco products. Could one not argue that the \nGovernment was at least a joint tort-feasor under these circumstances? \nFurthermore, it is preposterous for the Federal Government now to claim \nthat it did not know of the risks of tobacco use.\n  Since 1964, the Government has issued Surgeon General reports that \nwarned consumers of the dangers of tobacco use. Since 1966, the \nGovernment has required warning labels on cigarette packs. Indeed, \neverybody not on Mars for the past few decades has known that using \ntobacco can be harmful.\n\n  Besides this hypocrisy and the difficulty in seeing how the Federal \nGovernment has been harmed, I question the veracity of at least two \nmain counts of the complaint. These involve alleged violations of the \nMedical Care Recovery Act, known as MCRA, and the Medical Secondary \nPayer Provisions, or MSP. The Department of Justice contends that these \ntwo statutes create an independent cause of action for the Federal \nGovernment to recover Medicaid benefits for tobacco-related illnesses.\n  Let me point out that the U.S. Supreme Court, in U.S. v. Standard \nOil, in 1947, held that, in the absence of a statute, the Federal \nGovernment does not possess the independent right of action to recover \nthe medical costs of servicemen. It was in response to Standard Oil \nthat Congress passed the MCRA in 1962 and MSP in 1984. But these \nchanges to Federal law were limited and discrete in scope.\n  For instance, MCRA allows the Federal Government to independently sue \nto recover the cost of medical treatment given to military service \npersonnel, veterans suffering from disabilities unrelated to service, \nand other government workers who received medical help but were injured \nby negligent third parties. It does not apply to all Medicaid patients \nnor does it appear to allow the aggregation of all the individual \nclaims in one massive lawsuit, which is what the Department of Justice \nhas done here. Besides aggregating such claims, liability could be \nproven only through statistics, but I believe a trial based on \nstatistics would be unconstitutional.\n  Furthermore, MSP allows only for suits against insurance companies \nproviding liability insurance to tort-feasors, but not against the \ntort-feasors themselves. The MSP cause of action does not apply because \nthe tobacco companies are in no way acting as insurers of their \nproducts.\n  I am still studying the other causes-of-action sounding in violations \nof the Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization law, \nbetter known as RICO, and State civil fraud statutes. But as a \npreliminary matter, I have serious doubts about their legal viability. \nRICO, for instance, was enacted to deal with organized crime \nsyndicates. Here we are talking about a legal product, a product that \nhas not only been approved by the Federal Government but which has been \nsubsidized by the Federal Government. RICO does not apply to lawful \nactivities, such as the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, no matter \nhow obnoxious those products may be. For RICO and the State consumer \nstatutes to apply here, the Department must demonstrate that the \ntobacco industry criminally and fraudulently marketed and sold their \nproducts. This is a difficult task that in almost every case has not \nbeen successful in a court of law because the harmful effects of \ntobacco products were well known. Indeed, the day the Department filed \na civil suit, it announced that it was terminating the criminal \ninvestigation of the tobacco companies and tobacco executives for lack \nof viable evidence.\n\n  I believe these counts of the complaint were added to force the \ntobacco companies to settle. A successful RICO suit would force the \ntobacco companies to disgorge all their so-called illegal profits of \nhundreds of billions of dollars. This would bankrupt the tobacco \nindustry. The Clinton White House is gambling that the tobacco \ncompanies will settle and not take the risk of corporate capital \npunishment in prohibition of all tobacco use. When all is said and \ndone, it would seem that legislation is what is truly needed for a \ndirect recovery suit against the tobacco companies. In short, it seems \nthat this suit lacks merit.\n  This is not like the State suits against the tobacco companies. I \nsupported the June 20, 1997, global settlement of those suits and \nconducted a half dozen or so hearings in an attempt to have Congress \nset a national tobacco policy. The difference is that the Federal suit \nappears to have no legal basis.\n  Let me ask rhetorical questions: What is the big deal? Why should \nanybody care about another suit filed against the big, bad tobacco \ncompanies?\n  I will tell you why. It is for the reasons I stated in this speech. \nNo administration should be able to circumvent the Constitution and \nCongress' sole authority to raise and spend revenue for the general \nwelfare by suing for billions of dollars and then spending the money \nwithout congressional appropriation. If there is no legitimate lawsuit, \nthe action by the Department of Justice would violate separation of \npowers. That doctrine is a cornerstone of our Constitution's guarantee \nof liberty. Simply put, litigation should not replace legislation as \nthe means to effect public policy in a democracy.\n  Granting the Federal Government the unfettered ability to sue any \nindustry which happens to fall into disfavor in order to effectuate a \nsocial goal such as reduction in tobacco-related illnesses is a \nmistake. It would, in essence, allow the executive branch to bypass \nCongress and the law and set unilaterally our Nation's tobacco policy.\n  The way to solve the youth tobacco problem and other social problems \nis for Congress to legislate in an orderly and coherent manner. \nLitigation will produce ad hoc and incoherent results. Litigation \ncannot determine, for instance, whether the FDA should regulate \ntobacco.\n  There is a disturbing trend in misusing the litigation system for \nwhat appears to be social ends. Besides tobacco, Government-sponsored \nlawsuits have been filed against gun manufacturers and paint \nmanufacturers. It was reported that suits are being considered to be \nfiled against automobile manufacturers, the alcoholic beverage \nindustry, manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and chemicals, Internet \nproviders, the entertainment industry, the dairy industry, and even \nfast food restaurants are being discussed as potential targets.\n  Boy, it looks as if the trial lawyers of America got control of the \nJustice Department. They certainly have control of this administration \nand its projected successors in either Al Gore or Bill Bradley. Let me \nquote the distinguished legal scholar and former jurist, Robert Bork, \nwho cogently discerned, in an article entitled ``Tobacco Suit is the \nLatest Abuse of the Rule of Law,'' published in a September 23 edition \nof the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The Justice Department's complaint is only the most recent, \n     and it will be by no\n\n[[Page S11469]]\n\n     means the last, effort to use litigation to bludgeon private \n     firms in order to accommodate a prohibition that government \n     could not muster the political support to legislate. Gun \n     manufacturers are beginning to face the same problem. Why not \n     sue oil companies, whose gasoline leads to traffic deaths, or \n     fast-food chains, whose products contribute to heart disease?\n       The only difference is political. If the product is \n     sufficiently unpopular with the politically correct, massive \n     public propaganda efforts will ultimately make lawsuits \n     possible. . . .\n       Law has been warped for political purposes repeatedly, and \n     never more so than in this Administration. Is there no judge \n     who shall call this case what it is--an intellectual sham and \n     a misuse of the courts to accomplish through litigation what \n     cannot be won through legislation?\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the Bork article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 23, 1999]\n\n            Tobacco Suit Is Latest Abuse of the Rule of Law\n\n                          (By Robert H. Bork)\n\n       At least when the nation decided to end the ``scourge'' of \n     alcohol, it had the political courage to ratify the 18th \n     Amendment making Prohibition the law of the land.\n       Not so in these pusillanimous days. Now, as then, we are in \n     the throes of a reform campaign waged with the vigor and \n     self-righteousness of the bluenoses of old. This time their \n     target is cigarettes, not whiskey. But our politicians no \n     longer have the courage to legislate the end of what they \n     condemn. Instead, they resort to lawsuits in an effort to end \n     smoking by destroying the tobacco companies. The end, \n     apparently, justifies any means, no matter how fraudulent.\n       States attorneys general have filed multibillion-dollar \n     suits, allegedly to recover the medical expenses the states \n     have incurred caring for victims of smoking. Never mind that \n     the states have made far more money taxing cigarettes than \n     they spend on medical care. If that were all, we could shrug, \n     as we usually do, at the cynicism of our elected officials. \n     Unfortunately, the damage runs deeper than the pillaging of \n     shareholders in the tobacco companies.\n       The Department of Justice has just filed suit to recover an \n     estimated $25 billion spent by the federal, military and \n     civilian insurers on smoking-related illnesses. This follows \n     the settlement by tobacco companies with states that calls \n     for payment of more than $240 billion over 25 years. It is, \n     unfortunately, to be expected that states would file such \n     suits. (Not for nothing is the National Association of \n     Attorneys General--NAAG for short--often called the National \n     Association of Aspiring Governors.) But one might have hoped \n     that the Justice Department, even under Janet Reno, was above \n     such chicanery. Not so.\n       The real damage done by this noxious mixture of \n     governmental greed and moralism is not to the tobacco \n     companies' shareholders (they should have seen it coming and \n     got out a long time ago) but to what we still, with \n     increasing irony, call the rule of law.\n       The federal and state suits suffer from the same defect, \n     which ought to be fatal. All of these governments have known \n     for more than 30 years that smoking creates health risks. Yet \n     with that knowledge, they all permitted the sale of tobacco \n     products and profited nicely, indeed enormously, from excise \n     taxes. How can A tell B he may lawfully sell a product that A \n     knows will cause injury and then sue B for the injury caused? \n     Maybe the people injured could sue B, or A as well, but the \n     one party that should have no cause of action, no complaint \n     whatever, is A.\n       In the case of tobacco, the people who smoked and were \n     harmed should have no cause of action either. Governmental \n     and private organizations for decades have been pounding the \n     message that smoking is deadly; cigarettes even come with an \n     explicit government warning. Smokers are harassed in \n     restaurants and expelled from their offices to catch \n     pneumonia on the sidewalks. You cannot be sentient and \n     unaware of the risks of smoking.\n       The lame answer to all of this is that nobody had a choice \n     because smoking is addictive and the tobacco companies hid \n     that fact from the government and from smokers. First and \n     least important, tobacco is not addictive as medical science \n     has long defined addiction. Second, everybody not in solitary \n     confinement for the last four decades has known that using \n     tobacco can be habit-forming.\n       The law is being deformed in other ways as well. Government \n     suits against the tobacco companies are designed to remove \n     the defenses that could, justifiably, be asserted against \n     individual plaintiffs. While many juries are disinclined to \n     relieve smokers of the consequences of their own informed \n     choices, the government can try to avoid that defense by \n     arguing that it assumed no risk; others did. But of course \n     the government that authorized the sale of a known dangerous \n     product did assume the risk that, under its own laws, it \n     would have to pay when the risk became a fact. The Justice \n     Department's suit would also render irrelevant smokers' lack \n     of reliance upon any company statements as well as the \n     various statutes of limitation.\n       If that were not enough, the government is charging a \n     violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt \n     Organizations law--a statute enacted to deal with organized \n     crime--to force the tobacco companies to disgorge their \n     ``illicit profits.'' No wonder President Clinton thinks the \n     companies will buckle and settle. Perhaps they ought to \n     countersue to force the government to pay back its illicit \n     taxes.\n       The Justice Department's complaint is only the most recent, \n     and it will be by no means the last, effort to use litigation \n     to bludgeon private firms in order to accomplish a \n     prohibition that government could not muster the political \n     support to legislate. Gun makers are beginning to face the \n     same problem. Why not sue oil companies whose gasoline leads \n     to traffic deaths, or fast-food chains whose products \n     contribute to heart disease?\n       The only difference is political. If the product is \n     sufficiently unpopular with the politically correct, massive \n     public propaganda efforts will ultimately make lawsuits \n     possible. That is what happened here. Yet even Ms. Janet Reno \n     not long ago told a Senate committee that ``the federal \n     government does not have an independent cause of action.'' \n     But the White House insisted, and the attorney general now \n     says she has studied the matter carefully and--presto!--there \n     is a cause of action after all.\n       Law has been warped for political purposes repeatedly, and \n     never more so than in this administration. Is there no judge \n     who will call this case what it is--an intellectual sham and \n     a misuse of the courts to accomplish through litigation what \n     cannot be won through legislation?\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today's tobacco lawsuit may be tomorrow's \nbeef or dairy industry lawsuit. That is why about 100 trade \nassociations, private business companies, policy organizations, as well \nas several Governors, have voiced their opposition to this Federal \ntobacco suit. They understand, as do I, that big government can be as \nharmful as big tobacco.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of these individuals and \norganizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n      Organizations and Individuals That Oppose a Federal Lawsuit\n\n       American Insurance Association, American Legislative \n     Exchange Council, American Tort Reform Association, American \n     Wholesale Marketers Association, Americans for Tax Reform, \n     Anchorage Chamber of Commerce, Associated Industries of \n     Kentucky, Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain \n     Millers International Union, Burley Stabilization \n     Corporation, Business Civil Liberties, Inc., Business Council \n     of New York State, California Manufacturers Association, Cato \n     Institute, Citizens for a Sound Economy, Citizens for Civil \n     Justice Reform, Civil Justice Association of California, \n     Coalition for Legal Reform Member Organizations, Coalition \n     for Uniform Product Liability Law, Coalitions for America, \n     Connecticut Business and Industry Association, Convenience \n     Store Association of Michigan, Council for Burley Tobacco \n     (The), County Chamber of Commerce (New York).\n       Eastman Chemical Company, Empire State Petroleum \n     Association, Federation of Southern Cooperatives, Food \n     Distributors International, Food Marketing Institute, \n     Frontiers of Freedom (The Honorable Malcolm Wallop), \n     Governors: The Honorable Roy Barnes (Georgia); The Honorable \n     James Hunt, Jr. (North Carolina;) The Honorable Jim Hodges \n     (South Carolina); The Honorable Don Sundquist (Tennessee); \n     The Honorable James Gilmore (Virginia).

Mr. President, if we are going to solve this problem of \ntobacco, we need to face the music in Congress. We need to pass \nlegislation that will solve it. One reason why the Hatch-Feinstein \nlegislation would have worked is because we believe as high as it was, \nat $429 billion, the tobacco companies reluctantly would have had to \nagree with it. Therefore, we could have imposed the free speech \narticles on them that would have prohibited them from advertising, \nwhile at the same time causing them to have to advertise in a way that \nwould help our youth to understand the evils of tobacco. That, we \nbelieved, should be done. I still believe that should be done. It was \nso fouled up in the last Congress that we were unable to get that done.\n  So I am concerned about the misuse of the law, to be able to punish \nany industry that whoever is presiding in the Federal Government \ndecides they are against. I think it is a travesty of justice, and even \nthough I don't like tobacco and I have never used the products, and \neven though I think something certainly needs to be done in this area, \nyou don't do it by abusing the process of law, which I think this \nadministration has repeatedly done, time after time after time. I \nthink, as history views what has gone on in this administration, it is \ngoing to have to come to the conclusion that this is an administration \nthat has not been dedicated to the rule of law, while it has been \ntriumphantly pushing the rule of law upon other nations, hoping they \ncould have something like we have in this country.\n  The fact of the matter is, it is hypocrisy, pure and simple. I am \nvery concerned that if we allow our Justice Department to continue to \nact in this fashion, we are going to reap the whirlwind in this country \nand there will be no business that would be safe from the all mighty \npower of the Federal Government. There is one thing worse than big \ntobacco and that is an unrestrained big government. That is what this \nlawsuit is all about. It is a voracious desire to get money in an \nindustry that should be gotten, but in a reasonably legal way, \nbasically through legislation.\n  I hope everybody will look at this lawsuit for what it is. I hope the \ncourts will dismiss it so we can get about legislating and doing what \nwe should to resolve the problems about tobacco use and misuse in our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I came to the floor today to speak about an \nevent which happened this past Saturday that in many States across the \nNation went relatively unnoticed. It was National Public Lands Day. It \nwas a time for all Americans to recognize the value we have in our \npublic lands and a time for all of us to give a little something back \nby volunteering a Saturday to lend a helping hand to improve our public \nlands.\n  If you were out and about, you noticed volunteers both in this city \non some of our parkways and across the area. But across the Nation, \nover 20,000 volunteers took some of their precious time. We all know \nthat weekend time in a busy populace is a precious time and, by taking \nit, they performed over $1 million worth of improvements to our public \nlands--from helping construct to simply cleaning up and picking up.\n  In recognition of National Public Lands Day, I want to spend a few \nminutes today reflecting on the value of our public lands and on what \nthe future holds for them.\n  There are about 650 million acres of public lands in the United \nStates. They represent a vast portion of the total land mass of our \ncontinent. However, most of these lands are concentrated in the West. \nComing from Idaho, I recognize that very clearly. There are some States \nwhere over 82 percent of that State's land mass is public. In my State \nof Idaho, it is nearly 63 percent of the entire geography that is \nowned, managed, and controlled by the Federal Government, or by the \ncitizens of this country.\n  There can be a great beneficial effect for our public lands, for all \nof us. For starters, there are a great many resources available on our \npublic lands--from our renewable forests to the opportunities to raise \ncattle on them, to drilling for oil, to mining for minerals from the \nsurface. And the subsurface of our public lands holds a great deal of \nresources. We all depend on it for our lives. Without question, our \npublic lands have been the treasure chest of the great wealth of our \nNation.\n  Many of our resources have come from the utilization of the resource \nof the public land. Having these resources available has afforded not \nonly the opportunities I have spoken to but it has clearly advanced \nsome of our governmental services because most of those resources reap \na benefit to the Treasury, and from the Treasury to our schools, our \nroads, and our national defense. All of these resources and their \nrevenues have helped ease the tax burden on the average taxpayer.\n  Not only are the taxpayers of our country rightfully the owners of \nthat public land, but we, the Government, and all of us as citizens are \nbeneficiaries of those resources.\n  Just as important though is the recreational opportunity and the \nenvironment that our public lands offer. Every day, people hike and \npack in the solitude of our wilderness areas, climb rocks, ski, camp, \nsnowmobile, use their off-road vehicles, hunt, fish, picnic, boat, and \nswim--the list goes on and on of the level of recreation and \nexpectations we have coming from our public land.\n  Because the lands are owned by all of us, the opportunity has existed \nfor everyone to use the land within reasonable limits. Certainly our \nresponsibility as a policymaker--as I am, and as are all Senators--in \nshaping the use of these lands, I am hopeful that this year Republicans \nand Democrats in the Senate can work together to pass balanced \nlegislation that corrects the abuses by both debtors and creditors in \nthe bankruptcy system.\n  But this partisan attempt to prematurely cut off debate before we \neven started to consider this bill does not bode well for that effort.\n\n[[Page S11471]]\n\n  I hope that once this cloture motion is defeated, the Senate will \nbegin a reasonable and fair debate on bankruptcy reform legislation \nthat reflects a balancing of rights between debtors and creditors.\n\n  Those public lands have been a historic and primary responsibility of \nthe Congress itself. However, in the last couple of decades several \nchanges have occurred.\n  We are in the midst of a slow and methodical attack on our very \naccess as individuals to the public land itself. It started with the \nresources industries. That was the restrictive nature or the change in \npublic policy that limited access by our resource industries and how \nthey might use the land. Some would say, well, that is merely important \nfor the preservation of the land. But what we have also seen is an ever \nincreasing attitude to keep people--just simple people who want to hike \nor backpack, to have access to that land--off the land or in some way \ncontrol their very character on the land.\n  Some radical groups are fighting to halt all resource management on \nour public lands, and they are working to restrict, as I have \nmentioned, the elemental human access to those lands. On the Targhee \nNational Forest in Idaho, the Forest Service tore up the land to keep \npeople off. I was out touring that forest and came upon over 300 huge \ngouges in roads that had been contracted by the Forest Service to stop \naccess to the land. It was all in the name of an endangered species. \nBut at the same time, if that kind of damage or destruction had \noccurred at the hands of a mining company or a logging company, the \nowners of those companies would have been in court. Here it was merely \nthe forest land saying, oh, well, this huge tank trap or gouge in the \nroad to stop traffic was our way of protecting the land. I am not sure \nwho was the protector in that instance.\n  Additionally, we are seeing the implementation of dramatic changes in \nthe philosophy of the public's access to our Forest Service from \nopenness to an element of closeness. At the time when Gifford Pinchot \nconvinced Teddy Roosevelt to remove forested lands from the public \npreserve and make them forested preserves, the concept was that these \nlands were open. While they were protected, to be utilized for forest \nand to be maintained for water quality and wildlife habitat, always the \npeople could have access.\n  Slowly but surely, there has been a change in that attitude. That \nattitude has dramatically shifted to one in which the Forest Service \nwould now suggest to you that our U.S. forests are closed to the public \nunless designated open. Gifford Pinchot would roll over in his grave as \nnot only one of our Nation's great conservationists but one of the \ngreat advocates for forested reserves. The reason he would is that he \nsaid: If you do not associate the people to their land, ultimately the \nland becomes the king's land, much like feudal Europe in which the \nforests were the King's and the serf could not tread on that land \nunless given express permission by the King.\n  When the forest is closed--and that is what is being talked about \ntoday, and in many instances the chief of the U.S. Forest Service, \nChief Dombeck, who is an advocate of this philosophy, ``closed unless \ndesignated open''--then where do you go to gain permission to access \nyour public lands? You go to the Government. In essence, you go to the \nKing. You go to the ruler.\n  I don't think that is what Americans want. While Americans may differ \non how they want their public land managed and for what reason they \nwant it managed, there is one thing I doubt any of us would argue \nabout, and that is that the Federal Government should not have the \nabsolute right to tell our citizens who may or may not tread upon these \nlands.\n  All of us should be outraged by a Forest Service attitude that it is \ntheir land and they control it and they will give permission, they will \nbe the implementors of policy in a way that will determine who is \nlocked off the land. That, in my opinion, appears to be their agenda.\n  That very forest in Idaho I told you about, where large tank traps \nappeared in the public roads, just in their new forest plan they have \nchanged the philosophy of the management to suggest that all roads are \nclosed and, therefore, the forest is closed unless designated open.\n  Yes, we must manage our public lands responsibly, which includes \nrestrictions on some activities and in some areas with the preservation \nof the land's environment. For the water quality, for the wildlife \nhabitat, for all of those fundamental reasons, we enjoy our public land \nbase. But we should not sit here so snidely as to suggest that a \nFederal agency has the right to say you may enter or you may not enter \nthe land. Yet more and more forests and public lands of our country are \nnow receiving those kinds of restrictions.\n  Some people like to hike in our back country, others like simply the \npeace and the solitude, while others prefer to ride ATVs in the woods. \nSome prefer to camp in a more developed facility, while others prefer \nprimitive spots.\n\n  The point is, the recreational opportunities on our public lands \nshould be as diverse as America's public interests. On the same note, \nwe can use the natural resources we need in an environmentally \nresponsible manner and still have plenty of opportunities to recreate. \nIn fact, recreation and resource interests can team together to help \neach other.\n  In my own State of Idaho in the Clearwater National Forest we have \nseen a dramatic decline in our elk herds in large part because of a \nlack of habitat. This is a massive amount of public land. Yet by its \nmanagement--the suppression of wildfires, the inability of the Forest \nService to manage using controlled burns but changing the habitat and \nthe character of the land itself--one of the Nation's largest elk herds \ncollapsed. In the winters of 1996 and 1997, thousands of elk starved to \ndeath simply by the mismanagement of our public lands by a Forest \nService that would not seek the diversity of landscape that is so \ncritically necessary to maintain those unique elk herds and the \nvibrancy of the land itself.\n  Rather than fight each other, elk conservation groups, the Forest \nService, and the timber industry are coming together to develop a plan \nto mechanically thin some of the areas and use prescribed burns and \nothers to treat nearly a million acres to increase elk habitat. Yet on \nthe outside there are some conservation groups that say even thinning a \ntree is cutting a tree and should not be allowed. How absurd.\n  Why deny the right of good stewards to manage land in a way that \ncreates diversity and balance so that Idaho can reclaim its heritage of \nhaving a large elk herd, and at the same time having more than 4 \nmillion acres of wilderness, and at the same time having a vibrant \nForest Service products industry, while at the same time having growth \nwithin the State as one of its No. 1 economies tourism and recreation. \nThat is a wise and balanced approach toward managing our public lands \ninstead of this single attitude of ``lock 'em out, preserve, and deny'' \nthe ability to manage public resources in a diverse and balanced way. \nWe need all of our public lands to be used in a way that appeals to all \nof our citizens, not to just a single, relatively narrow-minded group.\n  Public land management, because of this, is now embroiled in fights, \nin appeals, in litigation. Every decision made by our public lands \nmanagers ends up in court, oftentimes fought out over weeks, months, \nand years. While all of that has been going on, the Congress of the \nUnited States has sat idly by and watched, simply hoping it would play \nitself out when, in fact, the fight seems to have intensified.\n  Differing interests have to come together to realize we all have one \ncommon goal: To use our land in a responsible manner, in a sustainable \nmanner, in a balanced manner, in the kind of way that will meet most of \nour interests, and do so to assure a quality environment and an \nabundant wildlife habitat. I believe all of those things can be done.\n  Over the last several years, I have held over 50 hearings on the \nmanagement of the U.S. Forest Service and why it can't make decisions, \nand when it does, why those decisions are in court. Why has it become \nlargely the most dysfunctional agency of our Federal Government? Yet it \nhas a phenomenally great legacy of appropriate management and \nresponsible caretakership of the land.\n\n[[Page S11472]]\n\n  As a result of that, I have introduced S. 1320, a comprehensive \nreform on the public land laws primarily governing the Forest Service \nbut also reflecting on the BLM. However, until we all realize there is \nroom for everyone on our public lands instead of just ``lock 'em up and \nkeep 'em out'' solely in the name of the environment; that we can \nutilize our resources in a wise and sustainable manner; that we can \ncontinue to accept these lands in a way that offer a resource to our \nTreasury, along with a resource to our mind; then I think we will \ncontinue to be in litigation. Successful management of our public lands \nrealizes a balanced approach, a diverse approach, and one that I think \nour country can take great comfort in the legacy of the past. In all \nfairness, we ought to be a bit embarrassed about our current situation.\n\n  Last Saturday was National Public Lands Day. It shouldn't be viewed \nas just one that talks about the quality of our parks and recreational \nareas. It should be reflective of the millions and millions of acres of \npublic lands in my State and other Western States that by their own \ndiversity assure an abundant resource, abundant revenue, and \nopportunities not only for recreational solitude but economic \nopportunity in the communities that reside on and near those public \nlands. I hope a lifetime from now our public lands will be as vibrant \nas they are today, but will be managed in a much more diverse and \nmultiple-use way than it appears we are heading at this moment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).

Madam President, for the people of America who are \ninterested in where we are on the tax cuts and the President's message \nregarding the veto, I thought I might share my version of what has \nhappened.\n  First of all, the main reason the President has given for vetoing the \ntax bill is we need to take care of Social Security and Medicare first.\n  The question is, When will the American people ever get a tax cut? If \nwe don't ask that question, we don't put anything in perspective as to \nwhere we are and where we will be.\n  I will share why I believe the tax cut was right and why I believe \nwhat the President is talking about is not right and will probably \nyield to no tax cut to the American people.\n  First, I might ask rhetorically, how long has the President been \nPresident? I guess he has been President almost 7 years. He will then \nhave an eighth year. Whatever legacy he will leave the American people \nis close at hand. Why have we not solved Social Security in the 6 years \nand 9 months he has been President? But now that we have a surplus, \nwhen we can give the American people a little piece of it in a tax cut, \nall of a sudden the President thinks we ought to save Social Security. \nWhy didn't we save it last year or the year before?\n  Why didn't we save it after the President conducted hearings in three \nor four cities in America and said he understood it and he thought he \nknew what we ought to do and he sends a package. However, in terms of \nreform he does almost nothing and sets up a new fund to put in a piece \nof everybody's Social Security money, not in individual investment \naccounts but, in a new trust fund to be run by--whom? Seven or nine \npeople; appointed by whom? The Government of the United States. Who \nbelieves the Government is going to manage the funds for Social \nSecurity in a way to make money and enhance the value of their pension \nplans? Who believes that? Hardly anyone.\n  Second, who believes we ought to have the Federal Government, with \nappointed people, investing billions and billions, maybe even trillions \nof dollars in the stock of America and in bonds in America, without \nbeing very concerned whether they will distort the market? Instead of \nbeing a free market with equities, loans and bonds, it will be a market \ncontrolled by what the Federal Government thinks? Just think of that, a \nyear after it exists there will be somebody on the floor of this Senate \nsaying: We should not invest any of that money from Social Security in \ncigarette companies. Boy, everyone will say, of course, we should do \nthat. Then next year there will be a report that obesity comes from \nMcDonald's and other companies that sell us quick-fix foods. So \nsomebody will say: Why would we want to invest money in McDonald's? \nThey add to obesity in America. Then, who knows what else? We will \ndistort the American market.\n\n  Everybody who is thinking understands the President has not submitted \nanything credible on Social Security. Is it not interesting, there we \nare showing a $3.4 trillion surplus over the next decade, $2 trillion \nof which belongs to Social Security, and they will get it--but what \nabout the rest of it? Should we sit around and wait to spend it? Or \nshould we give some of it back in an orderly manner over a decade?\n  Mr. President, your concerns about Social Security and Medicare do \nnot ring true. They come into existence when you do not want to give \nthe American taxpayers a tax cut. That is why all of a sudden they come \nup. Now you have even indicated we might be able to get that done in a \nfew weeks. Get what done? Fix Social Security and Medicare, which you \nhave not been able to fix in almost 7 years in office? In a few weeks \nwe can fix it so we can give the American people a tax cut?\n  Friends, you understand in a Republican budget there is a very large \nset-aside that is not spent on anything that can be used to repair \nMedicare. The problem is the President does not have a plan into which \nanybody wants to buy. He sent us a plan to fix prescription drugs for a \npart of America that might need them under Medicare, and nobody likes \nhis plan--Democrat or Republican. So why doesn't he sit down and talk \nseriously about fixing that?\n  A commission that was bipartisan, that came up with a reasonably good \nplan--bipartisan, bicameral, citizens and legislators--he caused that \nto be distorted and thrown away by asking his representatives to vote \nno when everybody else voted yes. Because we needed a supermajority, it \nfailed by one vote. We had a plan.\n  If I were a senior, I would say: Madam President, it looks to me as \nif you do not want my children and my grandchildren to have a tax cut \nbecause you are trying to use as an excuse that we have to fix Medicare \nand Social Security when you do not need that money that is going in \nthe tax cut to fix either of them. Why did it take him so long to fix \nthem, if all of a sudden we must fix them in the next few weeks in \norder to get a tax cut?\n  Frankly, there are a lot of other reasons the President has given, \nbut these are the ones that are politically aimed at America. If you \nread the polls, if you ask the question the wrong way, Americans will \nsay: Fix Medicare and Social Security first. But if you said to them in \na poll question: If we have sufficient money left over to give the \nAmerican people a tax cut and we have enough money for Social Security \nand Medicare, would you want to give them a tax cut? watch the answer. \nThe answer, instead of what they are quoting around, would be 85 \npercent. That happens to be the facts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/27/senate-section/article/S11472-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11472-S11473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I want to talk a little bit about \neducation because somehow or another we have ourselves involved in \ncompeting resolutions about the funding of education when we do not \nknow how much education is going to get funded because the \nappropriation bill has not been produced yet. If this were a court of \nlaw, the Daschle resolution would be dismissed as being premature. \nThere is no issue yet. But we will have to debate it and vote on it. \nBefore we are finished, the Appropriations Committee that handles \nLabor-Health and Human Services will produce a bill that is more \nconsistent with the budget resolution than anything else.\n  Regardless of what it looked like 3 or 4 weeks ago, they are going to \nhave sufficient resources. Remember, the President of the United States \nadvance appropriated, in his function and in his budget, $21 billion. \nWe are going to do some of the same things because they are legitimate \nand proper. When you take that into consideration, frankly, the Daschle \nresolution is talking about a nonreality.\n\n[[Page S11473]]\n\n  I can say there is a high probability, and if I had one more \nafternoon to go talk to a couple of Senators on that committee, I would \npredict with certainty--but I can say with almost certainty that the \nsubcommittee of the Senate on Labor-Health and Human Services will \nappropriate more money in education than the President put in his \nbudget. When you combine what they are going to give, it will be more \nthan the President's.\n  Is it going to have every single item in it? I do not know. In fact, \nbefore we vote on the final determination of education funding, the \nSenate will debate the issue on an appropriations bill which I have \njust described which will have more funding in it than the President's. \nWe will probably decide in a floor fight on this floor how that \neducation program should be structured. I think the occupant of the \nchair knows that Republicans have been working very hard at loosening \nup this money from the strings and rigidities of Washington into \nsomething that will go local schools in a looser fashion, from which we \ncan get accountability and flexibility. We give flexibility and we \nexpect accountability. It will not be all the line items the President \nwants, but it will be more money than the President requested.\n  So I do not know what we are voting about in these resolutions. They \nare premature. The only guidance we have is the budget resolution that \nRepublicans voted for and which said that of the domestic programs, \nthere are a number of priorities but the highest one is education. The \nSenator occupying the chair voted for that resolution. In fact, it said \nwe should appropriate, over the next 5 years, in excess of $28 \nbillion--$26 or $28 billion more than we had been appropriating \nregularly under the President's approach. Over 10 years, it should be \nsomewhere around $85 billion or $90 billion more. That is the only \ndirection and guidance we have.\n  That is not binding. But if ever there was something you know you are \ngoing to do when you pass a budget resolution, it is this because the \nAmerican people think it is right. But the American people do not think \nwe are making headway with the existing education programs. They would \nbe thrilled if we gave more money and did it differently. Why should we \nbe doing it the same old way which we have been doing it, which has no \naccountability and is all targeted whether the schools need it or not? \nThey have to put on the same pair of socks and same shoes in every \nschool district in America. They have to fit into the same shoes in \norder to get the Federal money, whether they have the problems or not.\n  Then we have the great program that we call IDEA, where we told them \nyou get started with special education and we will end up paying a \nsubstantial portion of it. We did not. We cheated. We made them pay a \nlot more than they were supposed to after we mandated it. Under \nRepublican leadership, we are putting more and more money into that \nprogram for special education because we told them to do it, and we \nsaid we would pay a certain percent and we never came close. We keep \nputting more in than the President. The President complains about some \ntargeted program we do not fund, but we fund IDEA and it loosens up \nmoney the States would otherwise have to spend for a program that we \nmandated, that we never lived up to our commitment on, and that is \npretty good and we probably will do that this year, provide more \nfunding than the President asked for.\n  So I don't know, when this 5:30 vote comes, what we are voting on. I \nthink we ought to put them both off and let's see what the \nappropriations subcommittee does. But if we do not, I can say I don't \nknow why anybody would vote for the Daschle resolution. It is a \nstatement of unreality. It is a statement of hypotheticals. It is a \nstatement of: Here is how much money they have to spend in that \nsubcommittee, so I am going to do some arithmetic and assume everything \nis going to get cut 17 percent. That is about where the 17-percent \nnumber comes from, but it does not mean anything because nobody \nsuggests that all the money Labor-Health and Human Services gets is \ngoing to be divided the way any Senator currently thinks it should \nbe. It is going to be done by a committee that has been doing it for \nmany years.\n\n  Those are my two thoughts for the day. I have used about 5 minutes on \neach, and I talked faster than I normally do because I did not want to \nstay down here too long. Other Senators want to speak. I repeat: If we \ncannot give the American taxpayers a cut in their taxes when in the \npast 6\\1/2\\ years the tax take of America, what we have taken from the \ntaxpayers, is up 58 percent--got it?--the tax receipts of America in \nthe last 6 years 9 months is up 58 percent. The average check increase \nfor American working people is up 11 percent, and the cumulative \nincrease of Government annually over 7 years--6 years 9 months--is 22.\n  Who was cut short? A 58-percent tax increase, 22-percent growth in \nGovernment, 11-percent growth in the paychecks of Americans. They need \nsome of their money back. That is what that issue is about. If not now, \nwhen? On education, wait and see. We will do better than the President. \nIt will be hard to convince the President, and he will have something \nto say about it. We ought to put up a nice big board and add up the \nnumbers when we are finished with appropriations. We will do better \nthan he did.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, first I will speak in response to what \nI regard as the commonsense statesmanship demonstrated on the part of \nthe President with his veto of the Republican tax bill. There is an \nacknowledgment that there is around $1 trillion that could come into \nthe Treasury over the next 10 years, over and above that required for \nSocial Security.\n  It was wise on the President's part to say, first of all, we ought to \nbe very prudent about whether that trillion dollars will actually \nmaterialize or not. It is based on assumptions that may or may not come \ntrue. If they do come true, we should prolong the life of Medicare and \npay down existing debt.\n  Everywhere I go in South Dakota people of both political stripes tell \nme: Pay down the debt, keep interest rates down, make our economy grow, \nand if you still have dollars left, make key investments in education, \nin economic development, child care and health care, and then if there \nare some resources remaining, do give some tax relief.\n  The President has submitted a request for $250 million targeted to \nmiddle-class and working families, the families that need it most. I \nbelieve that veto is a wise move. We ought to go on to a negotiated end \nto this budget dilemma that will be bipartisan in nature and will be \nmuch more deliberative, much more thoughtful, and much wiser about how \nto use $1 trillion that may or may not materialize.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/27/senate-section/article/S11473-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11473-S11475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PRESCRIPTION DRUG FAIRNESS FOR SENIORS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, the second issue I want to talk about \nthis afternoon is the issue of prescription drug costs. I am going to \nhave to edit my remarks due to time constraints more than I really \nprefer, but I do want to talk about the prescription drug costs we face \nin this Nation.\n  American seniors 65 or older make up only 12 percent of our \npopulation but consume, understandably, 35 percent of all prescription \ndrugs. Studies have\n\n[[Page S11474]]\n\nshown that the average senior citizen takes more than 4 prescription \ndrugs per day and fills an average of 18 per year. Costs have \nskyrocketed in recent years, increasing an estimated 17 percent last \nyear alone.\n  What impact has this drug price increase had on senior citizens? It \nhas been catastrophic for all too many. A survey completed in 1993 \nreported that 13 percent of older Americans say they literally are \nchoosing between buying food or their prescription drugs.\n  Sadly, I hear the same story everywhere I go in my home State. \nThirty-five percent of the Medicare population, equivalent to 13 \nmillion people, have no prescription drug benefits of any kind under \nany kind of insurance plan. Seniors sometimes fail to realize that the \nMedicare program itself contains no prescription drug benefit.\n  I recently requested a South Dakota study of prescription drug prices \nfor seniors in our State, a study that I asked the Government Reform \nand Oversight Committee of the other body to conduct, comparing the \nprices our seniors pay compared to favored customers such as HMOs, the \nFederal Government, and large insurance companies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the detailed summary of the study be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nPrescription Drug Pricing in South Dakota: Drug Companies Profit at the \n                       Expense of Older Americans\n\n(Minority Staff Report House Committee on Government Reform U.S. House \n                   of Representatives, July 31, 1999)\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       This staff report was prepared at the request of Senator \n     Tim Johnson of South Dakota. In South Dakota, as in many \n     other states around the country, older Americans are \n     increasingly concerned about the high prices that they pay \n     for prescription drugs. Mr. Johnson requested that the \n     minority staff of the Committee on Government Reform \n     investigate this issue. This report is the first report to \n     quantify the extent of prescription drug price discrimination \n     in South Dakota and its impact on seniors.\n       Numerous studies have concluded that many older Americans \n     pay high prices for prescription drugs and have a difficult \n     time paying for the drugs they need. This study presents \n     disturbing evidence about the cause of these high prices. The \n     findings indicate that older Americans and others who pay for \n     their own drugs are charged far more for their prescriptions \n     drugs than are the drug companies' most favored customers, \n     such as large insurance companies health maintenance \n     organizations, and the federal government. The findings show \n     that senior citizen in South Dakota paying for his or her own \n     prescription drugs must pay, on average, more than twice as \n     much for the drugs as the companies favored customers. The \n     study found that this is an unusually large price \n     differential--more than five times greater than the average \n     price differential for other consumer goods.\n       It appears that drug companies are engaged in a form of \n     ``discriminatory'' pricing that victimizes those who are \n     least able to afford it. Large corporate, governmental, and \n     institutional customers with market power are able by buy \n     their drugs at discounted prices. Drug companies then raise \n     prices for sales to seniors and others who pay for drugs \n     themselves to compensate for these discounts to the favored \n     customers.\n       Older Americans are having an increasingly difficult time \n     affording prescription drugs. By one estimate, more than one \n     in eight older Americans has been forced to choose between \n     buying food and buying medicine. Preventing the \n     pharmaceutical industry's discriminatory pricing--and thereby \n     reducing the cost of prescription drugs for seniors and other \n     individuals--will improve the health and financial well-being \n     of millions of older Americans.\n     A. Methodology\n       This study investigates the pricing of the five brand name \n     prescription drugs with the highest sales to the elderly. It \n     estimates the differential between the price charged to the \n     drug companies' most favored customers, such as large \n     insurance companies, HMO's, and certain federal government \n     purchasers, and the price charged to seniors. The results are \n     based on a survey of retail prescription drug prices in chain \n     and independently owned drug stores throughout South Dakota. \n     These prices are compared to the prices paid by the drug \n     companies' most favored customers. For comparison purposes, \n     the study also estimates the differential between prices for \n     favored customers and retail prices for other consumer items.\n     B. Findings\n       The study finds that:\n       Older Americans pay inflated prices for commonly used \n     drugs. For the five drugs investigated in this study, the \n     average price differential was 121% (Table 1). This means \n     that senior citizens and other individuals who pay for their \n     own drugs pay more than twice as much for these drugs than do \n     the drug companies' most favored customers. In dollar terms, \n     senior citizens must pay $50.33 to $94.12 more per \n     prescription for these five drugs than favored customers.\n\n TABLE 1.--AVERAGE RETAIL PRICES IN SOUTH DAKOTA FOR THE FIVE BEST-SELLING DRUGS FOR OLDER AMERICANS ARE MORE THAN TWICE AS HIGH AS THE PRICES THAT DRUG\n                                                      COMPANIES CHARGE THEIR MOST FAVORED CUSTOMERS\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                      Retail       Differential for S.\n                                                                                                       Prices for   prices for   Dakota senior citizens\n            Prescription drug                     Manufacturer                       Use                favored     S.

This study also analyzed a number of other popular \n     drugs used by older Americans, and in some cases found even \n     higher price differentials (Table 2). The drug with the \n     highest price differential was Synthroid, a commonly used \n     hormone treatment manufactured by Knoll Pharmaceuticals. For \n     this drug, the price differential for senior citizens in \n     South Dakota was 1,469%. An equivalent quantity of this drug \n     would cost the manufacturers' favored customers only $1.75, \n     but would cost the average senior citizen in South Dakota \n     over $27.00. For Micronase, a diabetes treatment manufactured \n     by Upjohn, an equivalent dose would cost the favored \n     customers $10.05, while seniors in South Dakota are charged \n     an average of $47.24. The price differential was 370%.\n       Price differentials are far higher for drugs than they are \n     for other goods. This study compared drug prices at the \n     retail level to the prices that the pharmaceutical industry \n     gives its most favored customers, such as large insurance \n     companies, government buyers with negotiating power, and \n     HMOs. Because these customers typically buy in bulk, some \n     difference between retail prices and ``favored customer'' \n     prices would be expected.\n\n                        TABLE 2.--PRICE DIFFERENTIALS FOR SOME DRUGS ARE MORE THAN 1,450%\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                        Price\n                                                                           Prices for     Retail    differential\n      Prescription drug           Manufacturer               Use            favored     prices for     for S.\n                                                                           customers    S.

The study compared the price differential for \n     prescription drugs to the price differentials on a selection \n     of other consumer items. The average price differential for \n     the five prescription drugs was 121%, while the price \n     differential for other items was only 22%. Compared to \n     manufacturers of other retail items, pharmaceutical \n     manufacturers appear to be engaging in significant price \n     discrimination\n\n[[Page S11475]]\n\n     against older Americans and other individual consumers.\n       Pharmaceutical manufacturers, not drug stores, appear to be \n     responsible for the discriminatory prices that older \n     Americans pay for prescription drugs. In order to determine \n     whether drug companies or retail pharmacies were responsible \n     for the high prescription drug prices paid by seniors in \n     South Dakota, the study compared average wholesale prices \n     that pharmacies pay for drugs to the prices at which the \n     drugs are sold to consumers. This comparison revealed that \n     the pharmacies in South Dakota appear to have relatively \n     small markups between the prices at which they buy \n     prescription drugs and the prices at which they sell them. \n     The retail prices in South Dakota are actually below the \n     published national Average Wholesale Price, which represents \n     the manufacturers' suggested price to pharmacies. The \n     differential between retail prices and a second indicator of \n     pharmacy costs, the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, which \n     represents the average price pharmacies actually pay for \n     drugs is only 13%. This indicates that it is drug company \n     pricing policies that appear to account for the inflated \n     prices charged to older Americans and other customers.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, the results of the South Dakota study \nare consistent with studies in other States finding that seniors in \nSouth Dakota pay inflated prices for commonly used drugs. In fact, \nseniors are paying twice the amount per prescription compared to the \nprice the pharmaceutical companies sell their drugs to their favored \ncustomers. In fact, we found some individual prescriptions where the \nprice differential was as high as 1,469 percent for the same drug. \nThese price differentials are far higher for prescription drugs than \nfor any other consumer good.\n  The average price differential for the five top selling prescription \ndrugs for seniors is 121 percent, while the price differential for \nother items considered daily essentials for the consumer is only 22 \npercent.\n  The study also indicates that pharmaceutical manufacturers--not the \ndrugstores, not the pharmacies--appear to be responsible for this huge \ndifferential. South Dakota pharmacies have relatively small mark-ups, \nbetween the prices at which they buy the drugs and the prices at which \nthey sell them.\n  The question is, Where do we go from here? There is talk about a \nMedicare add-on for prescription drugs. I hope we can go down that \nroad. Quite frankly, a bipartisan agreement about how to pay for it and \nadminister it simply has not been reached. In the interim, there are \nalternatives.\n  The Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act of 1999, which I have \nsponsored with Senator Kennedy, will provide a mandate--without the use \nof tax dollars, or any new Federal bureaucracy--that the pharmaceutical \nindustry sell prescription drugs at the same price to Medicare \nbeneficiaries as they sell to their favored customers. No more \ndiscrimination. If the Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act was \nenacted, we could reduce the cost of prescription drugs available to \nseniors by approximately 40 percent. There would be no bureaucracy, no \ntax dollars, and a huge benefit for seniors all over America. Our \npharmacists would use the existing pharmaceutical distribution system \nand not create any new bureaucracy.\n  It is estimated that we will reduce drug prices for seniors by \napproximately 40 percent. There will be no more devastating choices \namong groceries, rent, and prescription drug costs.\n  I am pleased our bill is gaining endorsement and currently has the \nsupport of 10 of our colleagues, including Senators Daschle, Dodd, \nDorgan, Feingold, Hollings, Inouye, Leahy, Kerry, Wellstone, and \nBingaman. Earlier this year, Representatives Tom Allen, Jim Turner, \nMarion Berry, and Henry Waxman were joined by 61 of their colleagues \nwhen they introduced the House version of this bill, H.R. 664. They \nhave now over 120 cosponsors.\n  Several organizations endorsed our legislation, some of which include \nthe National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, TREA \nSenior Citizens League, Consumer Federation of America, and Families \nUSA Foundation. Many South Dakota groups have also endorsed our bill, \nincluding the South Dakota Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities and \nthe North Central Chapter of the Paralyzed Veterans of America. We now \nhave well over 30 organizations actively supporting this legislation.\n  Currently, there are several prescription drug proposals in Congress. \nWe ought to have hearings on this issue, and we ought to go forward as \naggressively as we can.\n  Madam President, there is no need to wait. We can act on this now. We \ncan give seniors now the benefit of this 40 percent reduction in \nprescription drug costs that they deserve and need.\n  What an irony it is that so many of our seniors wind up not taking \ntheir prescription drugs in order to save money and then fall ill with \nan acute illness and wind up in the emergency room, and then Medicare \npicks up the tab. Wouldn't it be better if we can find a way to make \nsure seniors can afford the prescription in the first place to avoid \nthat kind of acute illness, that emergency room visit? The taxpayers \nwill gain, the dignity of the seniors will gain, their physical health \nwill gain. All Americans would be better off with the immediate passage \nin this Congress of the Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act of \n1999.\n  I yield back such time as may remain.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, shortly we will be debating two \nresolutions regarding education funding. Though there are differences \nin the approaches taken in the resolutions, the bottom line is \nsimilar--namely, this Senate and this Congress need to support \neducation, and we need to find sufficient funding to meet our \nobligations to America's students. We need to support our struggling \nschools as they attempt to provide safe, disciplined environments in \nwhich our youth can learn both the fundamentals of history, literature, \nmathematics, and science, as well as the emerging fields of the next \ncentury--computers, satellite communications, advanced electronics and \nother information technologies that are reshaping the American \nworkplace.\n  On this bottom line, we all agree. The difficult part in this \ndifficult appropriations cycle is, how do we get there? Our funding \nlevels are too low to meet the administration's request, too low to \nmeet the needs that we can all see and agree need to be met, but we are \nconstrained by a budgetary straightjacket imposed in 1997. All year, I \nhave advocated breaking the budgetary caps in order to meet our most \npressing needs, but until that happens, the Appropriations Committee \nmust play the cards it has been dealt. This evening, the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, will \nmeet to mark up an appropriations bill that contains funding for \neducation, among other things. When all is said and done, Madam \nPresident, I am very proud of the work of our Committee on \nAppropriations this year. I have served with many great Senators and I \nhave served with a number of great chairmen of the Committee on \nAppropriations. None has handled their responsibilities any better than \nhas our current Appropriations Committee Chairman, Senator Stevens of \nAlaska. He has worked closely with me throughout his tenure as chairman \nof the committee in as nonpartisan a manner as anyone I have ever \nworked with. We have handled these very difficult matters as best we \ncould to the benefit of all Senators and for the American people. In so \ndoing, despite these crushing spending caps, we have been able to pass \nin the Senate most of the appropriations bills. The final bill, namely \nthe Labor-HHS appropriations for FY 2000, will be marked up in \nsubcommittee this evening and, in all\n\n[[Page S11476]]\n\nlikelihood, in the full Appropriations Committee tomorrow.\n  Madam President, frankly, I see no intellectually honest way to \nadequately provide for education without breaking the budgetary caps.\n  I know neither side wants to suggest that the caps be broken. Each \nside wants the other side to be the first. I have no hesitancy to say \nhow I feel because I am interested in education. I am interested in \nmeeting the needs of the country and meeting the needs of the people. \nIf it cannot be done without breaking the caps, then so be it.\n  I cannot support these two resolutions, not because I disagree with \ntheir intent, but because I cannot voice my support for increasing \neducation funding on the one hand while in the same breath saying that \nthe budget caps cannot be broken. Education is important. If it is \nimportant, it is worth breaking the budget caps. And it is. It is worth \nbreaking the budget caps. Budgetary gimmicks that add months to the \nfiscal year or that take funds from other critical programs like \nheating assistance for the poor and the elderly will not hold up over \ntime. They are very frail reeds, very weak reeds, to which to cling in \nthe face of hurricane force winds of need.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/27/senate-section/article/S11476-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11476-S11491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REAUTHORIZING THE \n             ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT OF 1965\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING EDUCATION FUNDING\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, as I rode to the office this \nafternoon, I was listening to news accounts which were reporting that \nthe President was making a series of speeches in which he was \ncriticizing the congressional majority and their plans for education \nand education improvement in this country.\n  It seemed to me as I listened to the news accounts--assuming they \nwere accurate--the President was basing his criticism on two counts: \nNo. 1, if you did not believe that his priorities in education were the \nproper priorities, then you did not really value education in this \ncountry and you were failing in your commitment to public schools. His \nsecond criterion was the amount of money that was going to be spent on \npublic education at the Federal level.\n  So really two criteria: You have to spend it where he wants to, and \nyou have to spend the amount he desires, or else you have failed in \nsome kind of litmus test as to a commitment to education.\n  I reject both of those tests. I think, as you look at the amount of \nmoney and the increases in funding for education nationally over the \nlast 25 years, you have to conclude that simply spending more money is \nnot the answer to improving education--that that criterion fails. If \nthat is going to be the criterion, well, then, there may be a lot of \npeople who can say they are committed to education but with very little \nevidence of success or results.\n  Because we, as Republicans, disagree with the President's particular \npriorities, which are funding a new program for 100,000 teachers, \nwhether or not that happens to be the great need in a particular area; \nand increased funding for the construction of schools, though we know \nthere are many dilapidated schools, many schools that are in need of \nconstruction, that may or may not be the priority, the great need in a \nparticular area--because we disagree with his priorities and his effort \nto further nationalize education in this country, he would deem us then \nas lacking commitment to education.\n  I believe, with the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act this year, we have a golden opportunity to dramatically \nimprove Federal education programs that for years have not provided a \ngood return for every dollar.\n  If we are going to spend taxpayers' money on education--and poll \nafter poll indicates that this is a high priority with the American \npeople; it is high on their list of where they believe emphasis should \nbe placed--then I suggest we must hold the States, we must hold school \ndistricts, we must hold even individual schools accountable for the \nfunds they are receiving.\n  In the past, ESEA has not rewarded success nor has it punished \nfailure. Instead, money is allocated only for specific uses, with no \nresults demanded or expected.\n  For example, we allocate funding for technology in schools, but in no \nway do we require schools to show us how this is helping kids to learn. \nWe only require them to use the funding appropriately, but there is no \nlink to the ultimate goal, which is and should be student achievement. \nIn category after category, we find this to be the case. We provide the \nfunds and so long as the States can demonstrate they are spending it \nappropriately--that is, for the appropriate category--there is no \nrequirement that they demonstrate student achievement.\n  I believe this system must change. We must allow schools more \nflexibility in how they use funding to meet their individual needs and \nshow how they are improving student achievement for all students. The \nbottom line should be, the bottom line must be, in education: Are \nstudents learning? Not are we spending more money, not is our funding \nincreasing, not are they meeting a set of regulations that can fill out \nthe forms and demonstrate that they, in fact, have spent technology \nmoney on technology, but are students learning, are student achievement \nscores increasing? That must be the ultimate test.\n  It is in that area that Federal education programs have abysmally \nfailed. Schools currently receive Federal funding with so many strings \nattached they cannot effectively use the funding they receive. I \nbelieve those strings must be reduced so that the only requirement is \nthe dollars are being spent in the classroom to enable children to \nlearn.\n  Over the past 34 years, since the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct was first passed, it has grown dramatically in size and scope. The \nDepartment of Education currently administers 47 K-through-12 programs \nthat are authorized under ESEA. In his fiscal year 2000 budget \nproposal, the President wanted to create 5 new programs in addition to \nthe 47 currently administered by the Department of Education. I suggest \nto my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, the last thing this \nCongress should do is add 5 new programs to ESEA, when all the evidence \nis that we are failing in the 47 that currently are authorized.\n  Diane Ravitch, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and \nformer Assistant Secretary of Education, who has testified on numerous \noccasions before congressional committees, puts it this way:\n\n       At present, American education is mired in patterns of low \n     productivity, uncertain standards, and a lack of \n     accountability. Federal education programs have tended to \n     reinforce these regularities by adding additional layers of \n     rules, mandates, and bureaucracy. The most important national \n     priority must be to redesign policies and programs so that \n     education funding is used to educate children, not to \n     preserve the system.\n\n  The proposal from the President to add five new programs to ESEA \nsimply reinforces the status quo. In fact, it expands the existing \nsystem which has failed American students so terribly.\n  A study by the Ohio State Legislature reported that more than 50 \npercent of the paperwork required by a\n\n[[Page S11477]]\n\nlocal school in Ohio was the result of Federal education programs and \nmandates, even though the Federal funding in that Ohio district \naccounted for only 7 percent of the total education spending--7 percent \nof the funding, 50 percent of the paperwork. I am afraid that is all \ntoo typical of what we find with regard to Federal education spending \nand Federal education programs.\n  While spending on education has increased, there has been no \ncorresponding rise in academic achievement. According to Investor's \nBusiness Daily, over the past 25 years, inflation-adjusted, per-pupil \nspending for grades kindergarten through 12 has climbed 88 percent.\n  Republicans are not opposed to more education spending. In fact, we \nhave proposed that we dramatically increase education spending. But we \nbelieve that simply increasing education spending without a \ncorresponding reform of the system is money ill spent. In Arkansas, \ntotal education spending since 1970, adjusted for inflation, Federal, \nState and local, has grown by almost 58 percent. Since 1970, we have \nseen in Arkansas a dramatic increase in per-student spending, the \nexpenditures on each child, in the public schools in the State of \nArkansas. Unfortunately, overall performance of the average 17-year-old \nstudent on the NAEP test changed little between the early 1970s and \n1990.\n  Before we decide the answer to improving our education system is to \nthrow in more money and create more programs, may I suggest we examine \nclosely the programs as we reauthorize them and that we change the \ncurrent system to allow schools to innovatively use their funding to \naddress their problems as they see fit and as they know best.\n  Now, in the area of IDEA, funding for disabilities, I think that is \nan area all of us could agree we have done too little. During the \nreauthorization of IDEA in 1997, the Federal Government was authorized \nto pay up to 40 percent of the excess cost of educating special \neducation students. However, the President, who lauds his record on \neducation, has consistently funded special education at only about 10 \npercent of the excess costs. For fiscal year 2000, the President has \nrequested $4.31 billion. That is the same amount appropriated in fiscal \nyear 1999. This is an area Democrats and Republicans have agreed we \nhave not met our Federal commitment and our pledge to the States and \nlocal school districts. Yet the President, who wants to create five new \nprograms, has level funded the area of IDEA.\n\n  Reduced funding for special education causes the local school \ndistricts to pay the cost of educating children with disabilities. \nOften these costs, as we all know, can be three to four times the \namount spent on other students. Therefore, what is happening is that \nthose local schools are taking money from other programs and other \nservices because the Federal law requires them to provide that \neducation for special ed students. As a result, they are shortchanging \nother needed educational programs because the Federal Government has \nfailed to meet its commitment.\n  Another area I think we have failed is in the area of impact aid. The \nPresident's fiscal year 2000 budget requests $736 million for impact \naid. That is an increase of $128 million from 1999. But impact aid \nprovides support to school districts affected by Federal activities, \nchildren living on Indian lands and children who live on Federal \nproperty who have a parent on active duty in the uniform services. This \nis one area in which I believe it is very clear that the Federal \nGovernment has a role in education. Yet the President's budget does not \nreflect that priority, that clear responsibility that we have on the \nFederal level.\n  Education is mainly a State and local responsibility, where funding \nis generated from local and State taxes. Yet children who live on \nFederal lands or on military bases are being cheated out of an equal \neducation. In Arkansas, we have the Ouachita National Forest. We have \nthe Ozark National Forest, the St. Francis National Forest, the Buffalo \nNational River. We have, though many don't realize, because Arkansas is \nnot a far western land, hundreds of thousands of acres in the public \ndomain, school districts that are dependent upon impact aid to fund the \neducational base because they do not have a tax base upon which they \ncan rely. There is no tax base for these areas.\n  Any decline in impact aid funding requires State and local school \ndistricts to find additional funding to give their children a good \neducation. It is an area that Congress clearly has a role in providing \nfunding. Yet the President continually tries to reduce funding and \ndeemphasize this priority and this responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment. In his budget proposal for fiscal year 2000, the President \nseeks to increase administrative spending for the Direct Loan Program \nby $115 million. That is a 26-percent increase in the Direct Loan \nProgram for administration. Perhaps nothing reflects the misguided \npriorities of this administration more than their effort to increase \nadministrative spending in a student assistance program by 26 percent.\n  Adding programs--the wrong priorities in spending--I think reflects \nthe misguided effort of this administration to further nationalize, \nfurther remove local control, and, I believe, continue a system that \nhas demonstrated itself to be broken, which has not given us the \nresults students in this country deserve.\n  They want to promote the Direct Loan Program--there is no doubt about \nthat--and particularly increase the area of administration that is the \nvery area in which we need to be reducing spending. Then in other areas \nof student assistance, while the maximum Pell grant award would \nincrease from $3,125 to $3,250, total Pell grant funding would be cut \nby $241 million. They are particularly important in higher education in \nStates such as Arkansas or any State that has a rural population and a \nrelatively low per capita income.\n  In Arkansas, that is exacerbated because we have a rather low \npercentage going on to higher education. The reason for that, many \ntimes, is because there is not adequate student assistance available. \nSo while we increase the total amount of a Pell grant, we don't \nincrease--in fact, what would be available is cut in the President's \nbudget dramatically. The result is we have fewer Pell grants available, \neven though the demand is greater than ever before.\n  Madam President, let me reiterate my point and my concern about the \nPresident's priorities in education and his very ill-timed attacks upon \nthe Republican majority in the House and the Senate. Because we \ndisagree on priorities, his judgment is we are not committed to \neducation. Because we disagree in the amount and where that money \nshould be spent, his conclusion is that we are not committed to \neducation.\n  I believe Republicans have come forward with one of the most \ncreative, innovative educational priorities since taking control of the \nHouse and the Senate: The idea of taking 21 Federal education programs \nunder ESEA and telling the States that, on a cafeteria basis, they can \nchoose which ones of those programs they wish to have consolidated with \nnew flexibility to find creative and innovative solutions at the State \nand local level. That is what we need to be doing.\n  But there are those entrenched in the status quo who say: Let's \nreauthorize what we have been doing; let's put more money into a system \nthat has not given us greater educational achievement. They think that \ndemonstrates greater commitment to our children. I think we do have a \ngolden opportunity this year, and I think the line could not be clearer \nbetween those who believe the Federal Government is the solution and \nthose of us who believe we need local control with greater local \nflexibility, while demonstrating a commitment on the Federal level but \ngiving maximum flexibility for local policymakers to decide how the \nlocal issues can be best solved.\n  I look forward to the education debate in the coming hours and weeks \nas we conclude this session. I hope that as we reauthorize the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, we will do so in a way that \ntruly demonstrates our love, our commitment, and our concern for the \npublic school students of this country. I look forward to working with \nSenator Gorton, who has been so active in this whole education area, \nand Senator Frist, Senator Jeffords, and all on the Education \nCommittee, to fashion an Elementary and Secondary Education Act that \nwill take us\n\n[[Page S11478]]\n\nin a new direction and result in higher student achievement, better \nresults, better education, as we compete in a world economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for \nhis eloquent comments. I am honored to be a part of a partnership with \nhim and with the distinguished Senator from Maine, who now occupies the \nchair, in proposing a set of reforms on the way in which the Federal \nGovernment relates to education in the United States that emphasizes \nstudent achievement and a higher quality of education, as against a \nnumber of categorical programs where school districts become eligible \nsimply by filling out the right forms and spending the money in the way \nthe Secretary of Education tells them to spend the money, without \nregard to student achievement and without regard to the priorities set \nby elected school board members and superintendents and principals and \nteachers and parents all across the United States.\n  This afternoon, we are going to vote on two distinctly different \napproaches to education--a proposal by the minority leader and a \nproposal by the majority leader. The proposal by the minority leader \nbeats a dead horse. It starts from the proposition that we are to \nreduce the amount of money we spend on education by some 17 percent, \nwhen later on this afternoon--at 6 o'clock--the subcommittee in charge \nof appropriations for education, in fact, will pass an appropriations \nbill that not only increases the amount of money we spend on common \nschool education in the United States but increases it by more than the \namount requested by the President of the United States in his budget. \nThat is a true commitment to education.\n  The Democratic proposal ignores the proposition that the President's \nbudget, in fact, lessens the amount of money available for special \nneeds students and education for the disabled; that it reduces very \nsubstantially the amount of money for impact aid to those school \ndistricts that are greatly impacted by a Federal presence in national \nparks or forests or military installations; in fact, the proposal \nbefore us from the minority leader, ignoring the responsibilities the \nFederal Government has already undertaken in education, simply talks \nabout new programs, the great advantage of which is that they are \ntitled with names either of the President or of present members of the \nminority party. It does seem to me that even if we are working within \nthe present system, we would be far better off financing those \nundertakings which the Congress and the President have already made \nthan by beginning new ones, not particularly requested by the schools \nthemselves, while leaving the financing of past programs to local \nentities, whether they regard them as the highest priority or not.\n\n  But there are, as I think the Senator from Arkansas pointed out, two \nmajor differences in the philosophy of education of the two parties \nexemplified by these two resolutions. First, as I have said, the \nresolution by the minority leader speaks about a proposal that does \nnot, in fact, exist. It talks about the fact that education spending \nwill be reduced when, in fact, it will be increased by more than the \namount the President requests.\n  Now, the end of that resolution, of course, does say that we should \nspend more. Interestingly enough, however, it says we should spend more \nand take it out of other spending programs without breaking the so-\ncalled budget caps. That is an interesting proposition but one that \nwould require genuine magic to accomplish. This body has already passed \nevery appropriations bill, except that which includes education. It is \non the basis of the passage of those bills that the minority leader \ncomes up with this proposition that we will cut spending for education. \nI cannot remember a single member of the other party voting and \nspeaking against a single one of these appropriations bills on the \ngrounds that it spent too much money.\n  As a matter of fact, the great majority of them voted for each one of \nthese bills that brings us into exactly this situation. Yet they state, \nwith alarm, the fact that we would reduce this amount of spending, \nsaying we should not do it; we should spend more money; we should not \nbreak the caps; we should take it out of something else--something they \nhave already voted for. Well, we are, in fact, going to increase the \namount of money we are spending on education. But we should do it--and \nthis is the second great difference between the two resolutions--in a \nway that actually improves the quality of education of our young \npeople, measures it in an objective fashion--actual student \nachievement.\n  The other side proposes not only more programs that have not \ndramatically had that impact, but they would like a half a dozen new \nones in addition--all categorical aid programs--decided here in \nWashington D.C., all one-size-fits-all for every school district in the \ncountry.\n  The proposal of the Presiding Officer, myself, and others is a very \nsimple one. We believe the people who spend their lives educating our \nchildren, and who have dedicated their lives to educating our children, \nmight just possibly know more about what they need than do Members of \nthis body or bureaucrats in the U.S. Department of Education.\n  We say, let's take 12, 21, or 24 of these present programs, and let \nany State which guarantees that it will use that money to improve \nstudent grade achievement do so for a period of 5 years and then be \ntested on one ground: Have students done better? Is the quality of the \neducation they are getting improved by teachers, parents, principals, \nsuperintendents, and school board members who decide priorities? A \nrural district in Maine or an urban district in Washington or a \nsuburban district in Pennsylvania will obviously have different \npriorities.\n  That is our goal, and it is a goal that is finding agreement in our \neducational establishment, wherever the Presiding Officer goes in her \nState, or wherever I go in my State, or wherever any of us go. Our \nschools want to be liberated because it is their goal to provide better \neducational opportunities for the kids. They think they know what the \nkids and students need. It is as simple as that.\n  We are fighting a phony battle today because, in fact, we are going \nto increase the amount of money available for education. But it will do \nus little good unless student achievement is increased and improved \nupon. We can only do that by changing the system and trusting those who \nhave devoted their lives to educating our children with coming up with \nthe right answers by which to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as I understand it, we are expected to \nhave two votes at the hour of 5:30--on Senator Daschle's and Senator \nLott's Sense-of-the-Senate proposals. The time has been divided for \nthose who favor and those who are opposed to the different proposals. I \nstrongly support the Sense-of-the-Senate which has been introduced by \nSenator Daschle and which I am a cosponsor.\n  The essence of Senator Lott's proposal is: Resolved that it is the \nsense of the Senate that this Congress has taken strong steps to reform \nour Nation's education system, and allows States, local schools, and \nparents more flexibility and authority over their children's education; \nand the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 will enable this Congress to continue its effort to send \ndecision making to States, local schools, and families.\n  Of course, we are all in support of reauthorization of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act. We don't have any dispute over that. I \nhave listened to a good part of the debate. I have yet to hear those \nother steps enumerated and identified or commented on. The one piece of \nlegislation that we took was what was called ED-Flex. That is basically \na modest expansion of what was done under the Democratic Goals 2000 in \n1994. Goals 2000 was President Clinton's initiative. At that particular \ntime, the initial ED-Flex gave the Governors the flexibility. We \nprovided some modest increase in the flexibility, and I supported it. \nBut it\n\n[[Page S11479]]\n\ndoesn't deal with the kind of problems which we are talking about. That \nis at the heart of this debate and discussion.\n  I welcome the fact that since the time Senator Daschle introduced his \nresolution that our Republican leader has made a decision to have a \nmark-up tonight on these education bills. That is real action. This is \nthe kind of encouragement we would like to have--that we have the \nintroduction of the Daschle resolution, and then under evidently the \nurging of the majority leader, the Committee on Appropriations is going \nto meet this evening in order to try to indicate the priority education \nwould have in terms of the national budget. That is as much as you \ncould ever hope for in terms of positive action of a Sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution--real action. We will wait to see how the Committee \non Appropriations in the Senate of the United States is going to act.\n\n  What brought about the reasons for the Daschle resolution? Quite \nfrankly, what we heard over the course of the afternoon would respond \nto those facts. The fact is, since the Republicans have taken over \nleadership in 1995, in the Senate of the United States, we have found \nthat education as a part of the Federal budget has been the last--not \nthe next to the last but the last--appropriations the Congress has \nconsidered. We on this side believe it ought to be the first--not the \nlast but the first.\n  Now we are caught in a situation with the deadline for adjournment is \nsome time at the end of October and there are only 3 or 4 days \nremaining in the fiscal year. Finally, we have the Republicans saying: \nAll right. We will finally hold an Appropriations Committee meeting on \nMonday night when the fiscal year starts later on this week, on Friday. \nWe find that unacceptable.\n  Members over here can talk in generalities about flexibility. They \ncan talk about the makeup of the Pell program and they can talk about \nadministrative costs over in the Department of Education. We are \ndelighted to get into a more detailed discussion about those particular \nitems. But what those on the other side of the aisle haven't answered \nis why the funding for the education of the young people in this \ncountry has been the last priority under the leadership of the \nRepublicans. That is the issue. That is the question.\n  With all respect to my friend from Mississippi, and with all respect \nto the many years he went to public school--I admire that and respect \nit--it doesn't answer that simple question about why, with all the \npriorities we have in this country, the leadership has placed this as \nthe last priority.\n  The history of where the Republicans have been with regard to \neducation as a last priority kind of escapes certain facts. This is \nextraordinary. My good friend from Mississippi said on September 24: \nSince Republicans took control of Congress, Federal education funding \nhas increased by 27 percent.\n  Why? Because of President Clinton and because of the Democratic \nleadership.\n  You can say: Well, that is an interesting statement, an interesting \ncomment. Show me.\n  That is exactly what I intend to do. Right over here is a chart that \nshows what the funding levels have been under the Republicans since \n1995.\n  In 1994, the Democrats lost the election. The Republicans took over \nthe House and the Senate.\n  What happened in 1995? In 1995, we had a rescission. What is a \nrescission? A rescission means the House has appropriated money, the \nPresident has signed it, but we want to take some of that money \nback, rarely used in education, and the Republicans did what? What did \nthey do? We have the suggestion our Republican leader is attempting to \nconvey, that they have been the supporters of expanded use of funding \nin education.\n\n  They had a rescission for $1.7 billion below the bill actually \nenacted; they asked for a rescission of $1.7 billion.\n  In 1996, the House bill was $3.9 billion below the 1995 final \nfigure--$3.9 billion below.\n  In 1997, the Senate bill was $3.1 billion below the President's \nrequest.\n  In 1998, it was $200 million below the President's request.\n  In 1999, the House bill is more than $2 billion below the President's \nrequest.\n  Those happen to be the facts.\n  Let me state the time line for passage of these appropriations.\n  On March 16, 1995, the House rescission bill came to the floor. The \nRepublican leadership could hardly wait to get into office when they \nsent this bill up to take some of the money back that funded education.\n  Then we have the omnibus bill in 1996, the last continuing \nresolution. The funding of that program passed 7 months after the end \nof the fiscal year.\n  In 1997, it passed on the last day of the fiscal year.\n  In 1998, it passed 1 week after the end of the fiscal year.\n  The agreement for 1999 was passed 3 weeks after the end of the fiscal \nyear.\n  As we have seen, they have virtually all been the last \nappropriations. Nothing my friends have stated has disputed that. This \nis the record of the requests under Republican leadership in the House \nof Representatives and the Senate of the United States. The reason we \nfind that Federal education funding rose during this period of time is \nthat we had the Government shutdown and our President refused to go \nalong with it. He actually raised it.\n  For the majority leader now to say, look at what we have done, is a \ncomplete distortion and misrepresentation of the facts. They cannot \ndispute it. Those are the facts.\n  The reason this was brought into such sharp relief is that last \nThursday, the House Appropriations Committee went to work again and \nfinally had their series of recommendations where they have cut back or \neffectively eliminated the President's program to go for smaller class \nsizes. They had agreed on it at the end of the last Congress. In 1998, \nCongressman Goodling said how wonderful it was they had gone ahead and \nreduced class size for 1 year.\n  Former Speaker Gingrich said:\n\n       . . . a victory for the American people. There will be more \n     teachers and that is good for all Americans. I'm in.\n\n  The Republican leader in the House said this will mean more teachers \nand this is good for all Americans.\n  We say fine, that is why we want to expand it. The Republican leader \nsaid it was good for all Americans; President Clinton thinks it is good \nfor all Americans; the various statistics and figures in the various \nSTAR evaluations for smaller classes in the State of Tennessee indicate \nchildren are making progress. Everyone seems to agree--except who? The \nRepublicans in the House Appropriations Committee that zeroed that \nprogram out.\n  I don't hear from the other side why we have the inconsistency, why \nit is we have in 1998 Republicans saying it is a victory for the \nAmerican parents and we have President Clinton supporting it, we have \nthe statistics that say smaller class size for grades 1, 2, and 3 are \nparticularly important in terms of children's academic achievement and \naccomplishment, and now we find the Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives zero it out, eliminate all of the funding for that \nparticular program. We ask, why?\n  That happened last week. Later, I will review the various studies \nshowing how the smaller class sizes have been important in terms of \nacademic enhancement and achievement. It ought to be self-evident. No \none makes this case more passionately and with more knowledge than \nperhaps the only school teacher in this body, and that is Senator \nMurray of the State of Washington. She has taught and been a member of \na school board and can state the difference between having 15, 25, and \n30 children in a classroom. We have had the eloquent statements and \ncomments made by the Teacher of the Year, talking about the difference \nin being able to know the names of the children and the needs of those \nparticular children and being able to take time with those particular \nchildren. It is self-evident. We have seen that. But not according to \nthe Republican Appropriations Committee.\n  We say this is wrong.\n  We saw other examples. In the program for helping and assisting \nchildren to read, we have made some progress in the area of reading--\nnot much, but we have made noticeable progress. We have a long way to \ngo. We know the challenges out there. There have been a variety of \ndifferent approaches developed. The chairman of our committee, Senator \nJeffords, has long been committed to this program. A number of Members \nenjoy the opportunity to read at Brent Elementary School, here in\n\n[[Page S11480]]\n\nWashington. We know the importance of children learning to read and how \nimportant that program is in terms of their ability to read and in \nterms of their own academic achievement and accomplishment.\n  Why in the world would we cut that program way back? It is a matter \nof priorities. I read Members' comments made on Friday saying: We \ncannot fund everything; some people--knowing they were meaning this \nSenator from Massachusetts--want to fund all these programs. The fact \nis, here is a question of priorities. The debate is about priorities. \nWe are saying education is a No. 1 priority; that is where scarce \nresources ought to be continued. If there are other priorities, there \nis a problem, and we have to make a judgment.\n  But hold this institution accountable for making education the No. 1 \npriority. We are prepared to do that. We are prepared to call the roll \non it. If Members have other priorities they think are more important, \nthey can go along with those and make their judgment.\n  One of the major achievements of the reauthorization of the Higher \nEducation Act last year was trying to increase the total number of \nteachers. We don't just need 2.2 million teachers in 10 years; 30 to 40 \npercent are in retirement at the present time. There is also rising \nenrollments--447,000 more children started school this year. Some might \nsay we have more teachers, maybe the programs that are working need \nsome help and assistance if we are going to try to help those 447,000 \nstudents. What we have found out is one of the important cutbacks was \nin the program to enhance the additional qualified teachers to be \nteaching in our schools.\n\n  These are the realities. These are the numbers. This was, actually \nwith regard to teaching, 40 percent below the President's request. It \nis the Teacher Quality Enhancement Program.\n  We know, even with the President's programs, with 100,000 new \nteachers, we are not going to be able to do the whole job. The record-\nhigh enrollment this year of 53.2 million students--447,00 more \nchildren than last year, and the continued rise over the next ten \nyears; 324,000 in 2000, by 282,000 in 2001, by 250,000 in 2002, and \ncontinuing on an upward trend in the following years. I do not hear any \ndiscussion about: Look, there is an expanding number of students in our \nschools in this country. How are we going to ensure we will have \nsufficient teachers who will be qualified; not people who will be in \nthe classroom but well-qualified teachers? That is what we are strongly \ncommitted to.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Illinois who, I am sure, wants to \naddress the Senate. These are questions of priorities. As I have said \nbefore, allocating the resources is a question of priorities. Money \ndoes not solve all of the problems. But one thing we do know, without \nresources you are not going to be able to invest in the children of \nthis country--you are not going to be able to do it. We believe this is \nan indication of a nation's priorities. Not all the programs are going \nto work perfectly. Some may be altered or changed. We will look forward \nto the debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which is \nthe principal instrument to help and assist the local schools.\n  Their answer to the question of priorities is suggesting we should \ngive first priority to helping and assisting families in this country \nin the partnership--and it is a partnership--between the local \ncommunities and the States and the Federal Government. We provide very \nlittle, 7 cents out of every dollar. This idea we are making these \ndecisions that will decide all education policy--we understand where \nthe education responsibility is, it is locally. They put up the \nmajority of resources in it. But we provide some targeted resource to \ntry to make a difference in specific areas. That is what we believe in.\n  We cannot support this concept that the Congress has taken strong \nsteps. Look at the record: Nothing this year for more teachers or \nsmaller classes; nothing to modernize schools, to help with repairs, to \nwire the schools for computers; nothing to help train teachers; nothing \nto help with the basic skills such as literacy--virtually nothing. \nVirtually nothing. All we have seen so far are cuts in education. That \nis not strong steps to reform our Nation's education system.\n  I will be glad to yield 10 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, \nnot only for his statement but also for his leadership on this issue. I \ndo not think there is another Member of Congress, let alone the Senate, \nwho could rival his commitment to education over the years.\n  I am happy it has come to this vote because I think between these two \nresolutions--one offered by the Republican majority leader, Mr. Lott, \nand one offered, as well, on the Democratic side, an alternative by the \nDemocratic minority leader, Senator Tom Daschle--we see a difference in \napproach and a difference in attitude when it comes to education.\n  It is curious, as the Senator from Massachusetts has noted, that we \nhave left the education issue for last. After we have talked about \nevery other appropriations bill, some 12 other bills, we are finally \ngoing to get around to talking about education. Our human experience \ntells us we usually leave to last the thing we do not want to do. But \nwhy in the world would this Congress not want to deal with education? \nWhat is our reluctance to deal with an issue which, on a Republican, \nDemocratic, and independent basis, is judged to be the No. 1 issue in \nAmerica today? The No. 1 issue with American families is dead last when \nit comes to Senate consideration.\n  We are only a few days away from the beginning of a new fiscal year. \nI will be very honest and concede that rarely, if ever, does Congress \nhave all of its work done on time so we start October 1 with all the \nnew spending bills. But I can never recall a time in the 17 years I \nhave served on Capitol Hill when Congress has been in such utter chaos \nas we approach October 1.\n  If the Republican leadership has some master plan they have been \nholding back on how we are going to meet our responsibilities and do \nthe right thing for the American people, I hope they will unveil it in \nthe next 4 days because October 1 is Republican Responsibility Day. The \nleaders in Congress, Republican leaders, are responsible for, at a \nminimum, telling the American people what their plan is so we do not \nhave another horrendous Government shutdown and we meet the priorities \non which the vast majority of American families agree.\n  I look at these two resolutions on education and I can clearly tell \nthere is a difference of opinion between the two political parties \nabout an issue where there should be so much common ground. First, \nSenator Lott's S. Res. 186--I assume it will be the first one voted on, \nbut whether it is or not, it is interesting to note Senator Lott goes \nthrough and recounts some of the things that have been done in funding \neducation and finds many shortcomings with our public education system. \nNinety percent of the children in America go to public schools, 10 \npercent to private schools and home schools, and I concede in many \npublic school districts and systems there are schools and classes and \nteachers that, frankly, should be better. I think we ought to strive \nfor accountability when it comes to education but also for a commitment \nto education from this Nation.\n  I think Senator Lott, however, overlooks some of the more important \nprogress that has been made in public education. I note that student \nachievement on a nationwide basis is definitely improving. Average \nreading scores have increased from 1994 to 1998 in all grades tested--\n4, 8, and 12. It is interesting to me the Republican Party generally \nopposes the idea of national testing so schools can be held \naccountable. They think this is all local and it should be done \nlocally, though the students, when they graduate, are going to compete \nfar beyond their localities, probably their States, and maybe \nnationally or globally. But when we look at these tests we find things \nare getting better.\n\n  We have seen student access to modern computers increasing \nsignificantly, and we know the partnership we have been striving to \nestablish between the Federal Government and local school districts has \nimproved reading scores in many districts. In my home State of \nIllinois, which I am honored to represent in the Senate, we have done \nremarkable things in the public school\n\n[[Page S11481]]\n\nsystem. A system written off by Secretary of Education William Bennett \na few years ago has now become a model for the Nation. It is because of \na partnership--Federal, State, and local partnership. There is nothing \ninherently wrong with that. In fact, we are proving, in Chicago, that \npartnerships can make a difference.\n  So when Senator Lott, in his resolution, says Congress has to \nrecognize the need for significant reform in light of troubling \nstatistics, I think this is clearly a case where we are either going to \nlight a candle or curse the darkness. In Senator Lott's situation I am \nafraid the candle isn't lit.\n  What we have in the resolution, in the ``resolved'' clause, which is \nwhere you get down to business, very little is said. Let me read it to \nyou. This is Senator Lott's Republican resolution:\n\n       . . . it is the sense of the Senate that--this Congress has \n     taken strong steps to reform our Nation's educational system \n     and allowed States, local schools and parents more \n     flexibility and authority over their children's education. . \n     . .\n\n  And he goes on in the second paragraph:\n\n       The reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 will enable this Congress to continue \n     its efforts to send decision making back to States, local \n     schools, and families.\n\n  What a contrast with the resolution that is being supported by \nSenator Kennedy and offered by Senator Daschle which, for two pages, \ngoes into specific detail as to what this Congress needs to do before \nwe go home if we are going to be able to face families across America \nand say: Yes, we get the message. Education is critically important.\n  In the Daschle Democratic resolution, unlike the Republican \nresolution, he speaks out specifically for us to reduce class sizes so \nteachers in the early grades can pay more attention to kids who need a \nhelping hand; to increase support for the development and training of \nprofessional teachers, and that is something we know we will need as \nteachers are retiring and as school enrollments continue to work.\n\n  More afterschool programs, an issue I feel very strongly about. We \ncan lament violence in our schools; we can lament juvenile crime; but \nif we do not invest money in afterschool programs, it is easily \nunderstood why these problems get worse instead of better.\n  An increase, and not a decrease, in funding for the Safe and Drug-\nFree Schools and Communities Act of 1994.\n  An increase in funding so kids who come from the toughest \nneighborhoods and families with the most problems have a chance to \nsucceed.\n  More money for kids who are disabled, so they will have a chance to \nprove themselves.\n  More money for Pell grants. Boy, if you are a parent who has sent any \nof your kids through college, you understand what kids coming out of \ncollege face: A diploma in one hand and the equivalent of a mortgage in \nthe other; $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 for a bachelor's degree. If we do \nnot accept the commitment that Senator Daschle challenges us to accept, \nthese kids will have more and more debt when they graduate. That is \nclearly something we do not want to see.\n  We want to make certain that kids, particularly from working \nfamilies, come out of the college experience and are able to take a \ngood job and not worry, first and foremost, about paying back their \nschool loans which have greatly increased in size.\n  The Daschle resolution calls for more money for technology in \nclassrooms; also, that the school facilities be modernized. We have \nseen too many schools that are ramshackle and falling down.\n  What a clear difference between the Daschle resolution, which speaks \nin specific terms about the challenges ahead in education, and the \nresolution offered by Senator Lott, who is now on the floor, which \npoints, I guess, with some pride, to passing the Ed-Flex bill, which I \nsupported, but says, I guess, in a way, that Congress has already taken \nstrong steps. I think the steps taken by Congress can be a lot stronger \nand more specific. As we face Responsibility Day, October 1, just a few \ndays away, the question most American families will ask us is, Have we \naddressed education?\n  I will close with this thought. At this moment in our history, with \nour economy the strongest, many say, that it has ever been, with more \npeople, particularly in high-income categories, realizing more income \nand a better quality of life, with the general economy having \nweathered, endured, and experienced the most prosperous decade in our \nhistory, at a time when we are talking about a surplus in our Federal \nTreasury when only a few months ago we talked about deficits, at a time \nwhen the majority party, the Republican Party, has said, we have so \nmuch money in Washington, we have to give $792 billion away in a tax \ncut primarily to wealthy people, I have to say: Before we do that, \nlet's get things right when it comes to education. I want to say to the \nAmerican people: We got the message; we will start the 21st century \ncommitted to education to make sure the American century, the 20th \ncentury, is followed by the next American century, the 21st century.\n  We will not achieve that by holding to the standards suggested in S. \nRes. 186. It is weak soup. Instead, we should be dealing with Senator \nDaschle's resolution which calls on this Congress in specific terms to \nmeet its obligation not only to the families across America and the \nvoters who sent us here but the future generations who count on us to \nbe prepared to put education as our highest priority.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As the Senator was going over 1995 through 1999, does \nthe Senator remember when it was the standard Republican position to \nabolish the Department of Education? I think you and I want every time \nthat President meets with his Cabinet officials one person who is going \nto think nothing but education, and every time that President talks \nabout national priorities, to speak for the education of the children \nof this country. That I know has been the position of the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Does the Senator understand why, on the one hand, they were going in \nthat direction and then, within about a year after that, we had \nSecretary Lamar Alexander's answer in terms of the elementary and \nsecondary school reform: That we have a model school in each \ncongressional district and in each of the States, and they to be \ndecided, by whom? By the local community? No; by the Secretary of \nEducation.\n  Now we have another approach. We have the block-grant approach. Can \nthe Senator explain to me, within a period of about 5 years how we can \ngo from, on the one hand, abolishing the Department of Education to, on \nthe other hand, having the Secretary of the Department of Education \nsaying we ought to have model schools in each of the congressional \ndistricts, to now block granting everything and sending it back to the \nStates?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is a curious thing, I respond to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, that the Republican Party--and I believe it might have \nbeen in the party platform; it certainly has been a position taken by \nmany of their prominent Presidential candidates that we should abolish \nthe U.S. Department of Education and, in abolishing that Department of \nEducation, give back responsibility for education to the local school \ndistricts and families.\n  The local school districts and the families should have the premier \nvoice when it comes to educational decisions. But we should not \noverlook the fact, as the Senator from Massachusetts notes, that there \nare responsibilities we in Washington should accept. And one of those \nresponsibilities is to gauge the demands of the global economy and to \nmake certain that, as a nation, we are moving forward with the kind of \neducational system in general that will prepare kids for the future.\n  I have yet to run into a school district in my home State of Illinois \nthat does not want to have Federal assistance in meeting that \nresponsibility. I concur with the Senator from Massachusetts that the \nDaschle resolution really deals with that in specific terms. The Lott \nresolution, unfortunately, does not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I did speak at length on Friday afternoon \non this issue of education. I will not repeat everything I said then. I \ndo have a unanimous consent request I want to\n\n[[Page S11482]]\n\nmake momentarily. First, I will make some opening remarks.\n  I am the son of a schoolteacher. I went to public schools all my \nlife. So did my wife. So did my children. I care a great deal about \nquality education, public education, private and parochial education. I \nwill take no backdoor approach to education. We have to have quality \neducation in America. It also has to be safe and drug free.\n  There is a fundamental difference about how we do that. The Democrats \nthink the answer is here in Washington, that nameless and faceless \nbureaucrats in Washington, DC, know better what should be done in \neducation in Bangor, ME, or Pascagoula, MS. I reject that. I have faith \nin the students, the teachers, the parents, the administrators, the \nlocal officials, and the State officials to do what is right for \neducation.\n  I may or may not have been right on some educational issues over the \nyears. I voted for a separate Department of Education. I voted for it. \nI do not want too much revisionist history to be made this afternoon. \nWhen I was in the House of Representatives, I did that, and I took a \npounding for it. My constituents did not agree with me. They did not \nthink we needed a separate Department of Education. I argued at the \ntime that it was being overrun and overwhelmed by the Department it was \nin, HEW--Health, Education, and Welfare. It was blocked by the other \ntwo issues and did not get the attention it should have. I did that.\n  I must say, I do not see where a separate Department of Education has \ndone a whole lot of good for education in America. The education scores \nhave continued to go down, although recently some of the test scores \nmay have gone up.\n  When my children finished high school, I felt they did not have as \ngood an education as I did when I finished high school in Pascagoula, \nMS. By the way, they went to two of the best high schools in America: \nThomas Jefferson High School in Northern Virginia and Annandale High \nSchool in Northern Virginia. Yet when they got to the University of \nMississippi, even though they had been to the public schools of Fairfax \nCounty, they did not have as good a background and preparation for \ncollege as some of the students in Biloxi, MS.\n  What is going on here? I have been through this education thing for a \nlong time. I feel strongly about it. We must have a better education \nsystem in America. What we have is not working. What the Democrats are \nadvocating is the same old thing in the same old box. It will not work. \nWe have to come up with different ideas, new ideas.\n  I repeat one example I went through last Friday. Why is it that \nelementary and secondary education in America is way down the list of \nelementary and secondary education programs of the world? I have seen \nsome statistics where we are 17th, and yet higher education is rated \nthe best in the world. How can that be, that elementary and secondary \neducation is not what it should be and higher education is excellent?\n  I have a couple suggestions for you. One, when you finish high school \nin America, you have a choice of where you go. You can go to work, if \nyou have been in a vocational education program in high school; you can \ngo to a community college or junior college, a technology training \nprogram or job training program; you can go to a college, a university, \na State university; you can go to a parochial university; or you can \ngo, Heaven forbid, to Harvard if that is what you choose. Every student \nin America, everyone who finishes high school, can get a college \neducation--with scholarships and loans.\n  I was a beneficiary of what was then known as the NDEA loan. When my \nown family fell apart, I was trying to get a law degree. I held down \ntwo jobs and got an NDEA loan, thank the Lord. It helped me get an \neducation. I am for loans. You also have grants and supplemental \ngrants. With the combination of jobs and the Work-Study Program--jobs, \ngrants, loans, scholarships--you can go to school.\n  Every student may not be able to go to Harvard. Some may have to go \nto local community college where, by the way, you can get a great \neducation. The community college system in America is fantastic. You \nhave a choice, but not if you are in high school. If you live in a \nmiddle school district in a neighborhood, you have to go to the middle \nschool in that neighborhood. If it is no good it does not make any \ndifference. It does not make any difference if it is drug infested. It \ndoes not make any difference if it is violence prone. You have to go \nthere, even though there might be a good quality public school right \ndown the street.\n  Right here in the District of Columbia, you have some good high \nschools. Yet, if the parents want their children to go or the students \nthemselves want to go to a good high school, they are told: No, you \ncan't do that. That does not seem fair. Some of the teachers union \npeople say: Well, the bad schools might not make it. Right. If the \nschool is not doing its job, then get out of the way. Choice is one of \nreasons we have much better higher education in America.\n  The other one is financial aid, because if you want to go to college, \nyou get a loan. But you do not get a loan if you want to help your \nsixth-grade student get a computer or if you want to help them with \nsome of their other needs. You cannot have a Coverdell A+ savings \naccount for elementary and secondary education. Oh, no. No, we can't \nhave that. They might choose to save their money and put their students \nin some other school.\n  So I think we need to think about those differences in how we can \nimprove education overall.\n  Also, I want to make this point. There is talk about, oh, how \nRepublicans are going to starve education. That is total baloney. In \nfact, in the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill that will be on \nthe floor this week, the Republicans have a half a billion dollars more \nfor education than the President's budget--surprise, surprise. How \ncould that be? As a matter of fact, in recent years--I will give the \nstatistics here in a moment--Republicans have provided for a 27-percent \nincrease for education.\n  We are not stingy on education. We want education to have the money \nit needs. We don't want it to be able to waste money on programs, but \nwe want to do it differently. We don't want it to be eaten up here in \nWashington, DC, where the bureaucracy takes a bite out of it, and a \nlittle dribbles down to Atlanta, and a little dribbles down to Jackson, \nand eventually it gets down to where the student is. No.\n\n  We say we have faith in the local and State governments and the \nteachers, the administrators at the local level. We would like it to go \ndown to where the rubber meets the road. Let them make the choices. If \nthey want to put that money into computers, great. If they want to put \nit into elementary education, or if they want to put it into remedial \nreading or remedial math, or if they want to fix a roof, great.\n  Of course, the answer again for the Democrats is, we should get into \nthe school building business; the Federal Government should start being \nin charge of repairing local school building roofs, by the way, at a \ntime when every State in the Nation--every one--has a surplus.\n  Every State has a surplus, and some people say: Well, it might be a \nfew dollars--$34 billion. So how about local and State governments \nbeing in charge of building schools? If we start down that road, if we \nstart being in charge of the roofs and building the buildings at the \nFederal level, we will have to build every one in America. I think once \nagain it will bring more control to Washington, and we should be \ndirecting it the other way.\n  I would like to ask consent to add a modification to our resolution \nwe have pending. I do now ask unanimous consent that the pending \nresolution be modified with changes I send to the desk.\n  Before the Chair rules, let me say to the Senate, these are \nmodifications regarding the vetoed tax bill and all the education \nbenefits that bill would have extended to the American people if it had \nbeen signed into law by the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we just received these changes. There \nwas an initial presentation, a Lott resolution. Then that was changed \non Friday, which was fine. Now this is an additional one. At this time, \nI would have\n\n[[Page S11483]]\n\nto reserve the right to object just so we would have an opportunity to \nread it and familiarize ourselves with it. So I object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I thank the Senator for putting it in a \nreservation in that way. He would like to have a chance to read it \nover.\n  This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. The Democrats are stating \ntheir sense of the Senate on education issues. We have our resolution, \nand we would like to do the same thing. So I hope they will review the \nlanguage we have in this modification and agree that it could be added \nto our resolution. But in the meantime, let me state what is in this \nresolution.\n  So here is the untold story. This modification, that may be objected \nto, would simply spell out what was in the tax cut bill the Republicans \npassed--the Congress passed and sent to the President, and he vetoed \nit. What has not been told is that there were a lot of education \nbenefits in that bill.\n  In fact, it was interesting to me that 1 day after the President \nvetoed that bill, providing considerable new incentives for education, \nthe Democrats complained about this Congress' performance on education. \nBut they raised not a single voice to protest the unwise veto when you \ntake into consideration the tremendously enhanced education for \nmillions of Americans that was included in that bill.\n  The President's veto denies 14 million American families from \nparticipating in the education savings accounts--that is what I was \nreferring to a while ago--to allow parents to save for their children's \neducation needs at the elementary and secondary level, which they \ncannot do now. These accounts would have generated $12 billion for \nparents to provide tutors, pay for books, buy computers, send children \nto afterschool instruction, and pay for tuition at private schools if \ntheir public school failed to make the grade. Twenty million Americans \nchildren would have benefited, but the President said no to that.\n\n  The President's veto denies 1 million students savings to make \ncollege more affordable. Our bill would have provided 1 million \nstudents in-State prepaid tuition plans. And my State of Mississippi is \none of those; I think the State of Maine may be one of those, and a \nnumber of other States. They are being denied this prepaid tuition plan \nwhich would provide significant tax relief to make college more \naffordable.\n  Why shouldn't parents be able to save in advance for their own \nchildren's college tuition? The financial crunch for college would be \neased for 1 million students, but the President said no.\n  The President's veto denies 1 million workers receiving education \nassistance through their employers. This is something that I believe \nthe Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, has advocated for years. In \ntoday's competitive economy, education is the key to maintaining \nskilled workers. One million American workers would have had access to \nbetter education or more education, but the President said no.\n  The President has made college more expensive for millions of \nAmericans. The Taxpayer Relief and Refund Act would have allowed recent \ncollege graduates to deduct the interest on their student loans. I \nwould have liked to have had that when I graduated. For my own NDEA \nloan, the interest rate was not that high then, but it would have \nhelped in paying that loan back. This provision is particularly \ncritical for young people trying to hold down their first job and \npaying off their college debt at the same time. College would have been \nmore affordable for millions of American students, but once again the \nPresident said no.\n  The American people would have benefited also by the help given in \nthis bill to schoolteachers. Our bill allowed every elementary and \nsecondary school teacher in America to receive tax relief for their \nprofessional development expenses.\n  My mother taught the first grade through the sixth grade but \ngenerally first grade. This is something that would have been helpful \nto her when she was teaching those 19 years. This bill would have made \nprofessional development less expensive, but the President said no; \nthat, once again, the teachers should not have this benefit.\n  So I wanted to point out several educational features that are in \nthis bill. All I am trying to add to our resolution is this information \nso people will be aware of it.\n  With regard to our commitment to education, in the bill that will be \ncoming to the floor--and in bills that have come to the floor in recent \nyears--we have raised the Pell grant funding for our Nation's poorest \nstudents to historically high levels. We have increased funding for our \nNation's disadvantaged schoolchildren, thanks to the leadership of \nSenator Gregg of New Hampshire and others. And we have raised the \nfunding by $2 billion over the last 3 years for IDEA, the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act. Our commitment to our Nation's \ndisabled children certainly outstrips the President, who recommended \nfunding levels this year that do not even keep pace with \ninflation. Funding for education has increased by 27 percent since \n1994. We will continue moving forward. We will continue to provide \nadequate funding for education. We will continue to work for innovative \nways to improve education, and we will have a bill on the floor this \nvery week that puts money where our mouths are. We are not interested \njust in saying what the President didn't do or what the Democrats \ndidn't do. We are interested in getting the job done. That may mean \ndoing some things differently from the way they have been done in the \npast.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen minutes 37 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I think, going forward with this debate, there ought to be some facts \npointed out for clarification because the resolution of the Democratic \nleader and the representations of the Senator from Massachusetts and \nthe Senator from Illinois are not consistent with the facts, as they \nare presently in existence and on the ground.\n  Specifically, the Republican budget included a dramatic increase for \neducation, and the mark for education under the Labor-HHS bill, which \nis being marked up this evening, represents a $2.2 billion increase \nover last year; no reduction, a $2.2 billion increase.\n  Let me go through a few of these programs that have been represented \nby the other side as being reduced. That is misinformation. It is \ninaccurate, and it is really inappropriate, that the Democratic leader \nwould bring to the floor of the Senate a resolution which is so totally \nand grossly inaccurate.\n  In the area of Pell grants, the committee will be marking up a bill \nwhich has a $74 million increase over last year's funding; that \nrepresents a number of $7.7 billion. In the area of IDEA, the committee \nwill be marking up a bill which has a $701 million increase over last \nyear's funding; that represents a number of $5.8 billion. In the area \nof IDEA part B, the committee will be marking up a bill which has a \ncommittee increase over last year's funding of $678 million, a total \nbudget of $4.8 billion. In the area of the TRIO Program, the committee \nwill be marking up a budget which has a $30 million increase over last \nyear's spending, $630 million.\n  In the area of title I, the committee will be marking up a budget \nwhich has a $324 million increase over last year's budget, a number of \n$8.7 billion for title I. In the area of the safe and drug-free \nschools, the committee will be marking up a budget which has an \nincrease of $45 million over last year, a total number $611 million. In \nthe area of Head Start, the committee will be marking up a budget which \nhas a $608 million increase over last year, total budget of $5.2 \nbillion.\n  In the area of afterschool programs, the committee will be marking up \na budget which has a $200 million increase over last year. When you add \nthese increases up, we are significantly above the administration \nrequest.\n  For example, in the Pell grant area, we are $315 million over the \nadministration request. In the IDEA area, we are $375 million over the \nadministration's request. In the IDEA part B area,\n\n[[Page S11484]]\n\nwe are $675 million over the administration's request. In the title I \narea, we are $16 million over the administration's request. In the safe \nand drug-free schools area, we are $20 million over the \nadministration's request.\n  The simple fact is, the representations put forward in this \nresolution by the Democratic leader are absolutely inaccurate. It is \ninappropriate that this has not been amended to reflect the markup \nvehicle which is going forward in the Senate. Maybe the Democratic \nleader thinks he represents the House of Representatives, not the \nSenate. In the Senate, these are the numbers we are working from, \ndramatic increases in funding and a commitment to programs we think are \nworking.\n\n  Yes, there are significant differences on priorities. As both the \nSenator from Illinois and the Senator from Massachusetts have said, \ntheir priorities are different than our priorities. That is true. There \nis a different philosophy of government, a different philosophy of \napproach to education.\n  We happen to believe parents should be empowered. We happen to \nbelieve teachers should be empowered. We happen to believe principals \nshould be empowered. We happen to believe local school boards should be \nempowered to make decisions as to how they operate their schools and \nwhere they will put their scarce and valuable resources.\n  The other side of the aisle happens to think they have the best ideas \nin the world, that all the good ideas come from the national labor \nunions and from the Department of Education and from the \nadministration; that, therefore, there should be developed a set of \ncategorical grants which will tell the parents, the teacher, and the \nprincipal exactly how they will run their local school because \nWashington absolutely knows better how to do it than the local parents, \nthe teacher, or the school.\n  Well, there is the difference. No question about it. The other side \nwants to set up a categorical program in the area of buildings, in the \narea of afterschool programs, in the area of teacher ratio. What we \nwant to do is say to the local school district, to the parents, to the \nteacher, and to the principal: Here are the dollars. We tell you you \nmust set a standard of education which is an excellence standard, a \nstandard which requires that the children in your school meet the basic \nelements of education--math, reading, and writing. You have to have \nthose standards. But within the context of meeting those standards, \nwhich standards shall be set at the State, not by us in Washington--we \ndon't believe in national tests because we don't happen to think people \nhere in Washington should write the tests; we think people in the \nStates should write the tests--once those standards are set at the \nlocal school district by the States, then we say to the States, local \nschool districts, parents, and teachers: You make the decision on where \nthe dollars should be. Should they be in a new classroom or with an \nadditional teacher, or maybe there are some schools out there that \nhappen to want another computer, that happen to want to have another \nFrench teacher, that want to have another math teacher, or maybe they \nwant to send their kids to some special program. Maybe they have some \nnew concept of education they think is going to work better.\n  Leave it to the local school district to make that decision. Leave it \nto the parent to make that decision. Leave it to the principal and the \nteacher to make that decision. Let us not make those decisions in \nWashington.\n  Yes, there are priority differences. Our priority is to empower the \nparent, the teacher, and the principal. Their priority is to empower \nthe national labor unions, the Department of Education, and the great \nthinkers in Washington who have the answers to everything on every \nsubject and especially on the issue of education.\n  We have, in the proposals we will be putting forward, specific \nprograms which do empower parents, which give parents a chance to do \nsomething when their kids are in schools that fail. It is an outrage \nthat in this Nation we have 5,000 high schools and elementary schools \ncombined that are failing schools, by the standards set by the people \nwho run those schools. If you have your kids in those schools, what is \nyour option? You don't have an option. Your kid is stuck in that \nschool.\n  Parents ought to have an option. If their children are in a school \nthat has failed year after year after year after year to teach those \nchildren how to write, how to read, how to think, parents shouldn't \nhave to be subjected to sending their kids to those schools. They \nshould have the opportunity to say to that school: OK, we are going to \ngive you 2 years to clean up your act--which is exactly what our \nproposal does--on your standards. We are not setting the standards. We \nwill not set a bar so high that nobody can reach it. You get to set the \nstandards--you, the State; you, the community.\n  If that school doesn't meet those standards--and I suspect those \nstandards are going to be reasonably stringent; at least they are in \nNew Hampshire--so that an elementary school, once again, for 2 years in \na row fails, then we basically put that school on probation. We say to \nthe State: You have to go into that school and you have to straighten \nit out. You have 2 years to do that. You have 2 years to get those kids \nan education, which is what the goal is, obviously.\n  If after 2 more years that school still doesn't cut it, then we say \nto the parents of the kids who are going to be subjected to this \nhorrendous school: It is up to you. You make the decision as to whether \nyou want your son or daughter to go to that school. If you decide you \nwant your son or daughter to go to another public school or to another \nprogram that involves afterschool activities and you are a low-income \nperson, we are going to let the funds go with your child. We are going \nto let the funds follow your child rather than have that school absorb \nall these funds that will do nothing for you in the way of educating \nyour children. That is a difference of opinion. They want to run the \nfailed schools, keep sending money to the failed schools, and they want \nto build more failing schools.\n\n  We say if a school is failing, let's get it under control and make it \nwork; if it doesn't work, let's give the parents some options. We also \nsay: Listen, we have all these categorical programs that almost tell \nteachers how many pencils they can have in their classrooms. Let's stop \nthat and take a bunch of these categorical programs and put them into a \nbasket of money, and after setting the standards--again, the standards \nare set by the State, not by us--after setting the standards, say to \nthe local school districts: You can use this basket of money to try to \nhelp your kids make the standards. It is called ``straight A's.'' Every \nschool district in this country is for it. The only people against it \nare the big labor unions in Washington and the Department of Education \nbecause they don't want to give up the categorical programs. Why? \nBecause there is political power in those programs. This isn't about \neducation; this is about power, about controlling dollars for the sake \nof power.\n  We are talking about getting money out to the parents; they are \ntalking about empowering a bunch of people in Washington who happen to \nbe affluent in their field or effectively are elitists, in my opinion. \nSo, yes, there are differences of philosophy. But on the facts, this \nresolution carries no weight because it is totally inaccurate on the \nfacts. It should be amended because every one of these cuts it lists is \nnot a cut at all.\n  While we are on the subject of cuts, who does make the most \nsignificant cut at the Federal level? Is it the Republicans? No, it is \nnot. It is the President's budget, sent up here without any increase in \nspending for the IDEA program, the special ed program. Let's talk about \nthat a little bit because there is a difference in priorities. Special \ned is a very important part of education, a good idea put together back \nin 1976 under 74-142 or 76-142--I am not sure which; there are so many \nnumbers floating around. But it said, if you have a special needs \nchild, that child has the right to a good education in the educational \nsystem, and the Federal Government knows it is going to cost a lot to \neducate that child, so the Government will pay for 40 percent of the \ncost of that child's education.\n  What happened? While the Democrats controlled this Congress, year in \nand year out, that 40-percent number went right down like a roller \ncoaster going down a big hill. The Federal Government's share of \neducation was down to\n\n[[Page S11485]]\n\n6 percent when the Republicans took control of the Senate and the \nHouse. We recognized that was wrong. What happens when we don't pay the \nspecial needs cost is the dollars flow from the local community, who \ntakes over the Federal responsibility, and then the local community no \nlonger has flexibility over the local dollars because they are paying \nfor what the Federal Government was supposed to do in the first place.\n  (Mrs. HUTCHISON assumed the chair.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. GREGG. I will certainly yield to the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. So what the Senator is saying is it has been the \nRepublican Congress that has attempted to live up to the promise made \nin funding special education; it has been the Republican Congress, and, \ntoday, the Appropriations Committee is going to meet to add educational \ndollars to the President's budget. In fact, we will be increasing \nspending for essential programs such as special ed, Pell grants, the \nTRIO programs, above what the President has requested; am I correct in \nthat understanding?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator is absolutely correct. Regarding IDEA, the \nPresident, all during his term in office, has never sent up a budget of \nany significance. However, the Republican Senate and Congress have \nincreased IDEA funding by over 85 percent and, after this year, there \nwill be up to about a 110-percent increase in it over the baseline with \nwhich we started.\n  Ms. COLLINS. If I may, I will ask the Senator from New Hampshire, who \nhas been such a leader on education issues, one further question. So \nthis is not a debate about money because it has been the Republicans \nwho have continually increased educational funding. What this is a \ndebate about is who is going to make the decisions. This is a debate \nabout philosophy. Does the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is exactly right. It is about philosophy and it is \nabout power.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Maine has been a leader on education \nissues, also, especially IDEA.\n  To complete my thought on that issue, the President sent up a budget \nwhich had no increase in IDEA. He took the money from the special ed \nkids and he started these new categorical programs--buildings, \nafterschool, teachers. That money should have gone to special ed to \nfulfill the obligation of the 40 percent we said we were going to pay \nin the first place. But, no, he took the money from the IDEA program \nand put it into the categorical programs, which had the double, \ninsidious effect of making the local governments have to now support \nthe Federal programs, so they lose their local schools. They could have \nbuilt schools if they wanted to build schools or added teachers or done \nwhatever they wanted to. Now they don't have the dollars because they \nare supporting IDEA.\n  On top of that, he says to the local school districts: I have taken \nyour dollars for special ed, which we were supposed to pay you to begin \nwith, and I put them in categorical programs; to get the dollars, you \nhave to do what I tell you to do--build a school, or add a teacher, or \nyou have to do an afterschool program. The local school district may \nnot want to do that; they may want to do something else, such as a new \nFrench program, or a new computer system. They may want to add to the \nfootball team, or put in an arts department. But they can't do it \nbecause the money they were going to have to do that with is being \nspent to do the Federal end of the special ed funds. Now the money that \nis supposed to come in for that is coming into a categorical grant.\n  It is all about power and who is going to run the education system. \nIs it going to be run in Washington by labor union leaders and \nbureaucrats, or is it going to be run by the teachers, parents, and the \nprincipals? That is what this debate is about; it is not about money.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 23 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  Madam President, a couple of quick facts. If the good Senator from \nNew Hampshire went back to March 25 of this last year--the time we were \nconsidering the $790 billion tax cut--we offered an amendment that \nwould have taken one-fifth that amount of money and completely funded \nIDEA. The Republicans unanimously rejected it. They unanimously \nrejected it. They thought we ought to have tax breaks rather than \nfunding IDEA. So, before we get all worked up about this position that \nwas just talked about, we ought to understand that.\n  Madam President, with all respect to my friend, the majority leader, \nI don't find traveling around Massachusetts that the school systems are \nsaying: We have sufficient resources and we don't need any help or \nassistance. The role of the Federal Government, historically, is to \nprovide a very limited amount of resources in targeted areas, where \nthere are some special needs, and that is why we have these targeted \nresources.\n  If our good friends on the other side want to have a good deal more \nfunding, generally, in terms of education, they can request their \nGovernors to go ahead and do so. Our role is to find targeted \nresources.\n  Now, what are these targeted areas we have talked about? Let's get \nspecific. One of the key areas are smaller class sizes. As I mentioned, \nthe Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, is our leader on that issue. \nThe project STAR studied 7,000 students in 80 Tennessee schools. \nStudents in small classes performed better than students in large \nclasses in each grade from kindergarten through third grade. Follow-up \nresearch shows that gains lasted through at least the eighth grade. \nSTAR students were less likely to drop out of high school. Research \nalso shows that STAR schools and smaller classes in grades up from K \nthrough 3 were between 6 and 13 months ahead of regular classes in \nmath, reading, and science, all the way through the fourth, sixth, and \neighth. That is one of the programs that we support. That is a priority \nitem. The Republicans zeroed that out.\n\n  I was interested in the Republican leader saying we are going to have \na big bill on the floor of the Senate next week. We are saying: Where \nhas it been? We are glad it is going to be here, but where has it been? \nThat is our point.\n  We have the situation of after-school programs. We know the dangers \nof young students getting in trouble with violence after school. \nJuveniles are most likely to commit violent crimes after school, as \nthis chart shows, it is between 3 and 6 p.m.\n  We had a modest program by the President with $200 million. There \nwere 1,700 applications for that program. Only 184 programs can be \nfunded at the current level of $200 million. There were 1,800 unfunded \nafter-school programs. We are trying to fund those. The Republicans say \nno.\n  Take a look at what these dollars have meant in terms of math scores \nimproving. This is in the neediest areas of this country. From 1992 to \n1996, in every one of these areas, and particularly in the areas where \nthe students are the poorest, almost double the performance for \nchildren in the area of math and science. In each of the various \nquarters, we have seen a significant increase in the last 4 years.\n  That is our priority: Smaller class size, after-school programs, and \ntrying to improve student achievement in the areas of math and science.\n  I'll mention one more area, wiring the schools for the 21st century. \nWe have seen the gradual increase in the schools that are wired. But \nstill, for the instructional rooms where children learn, they do not \nhave those kinds of resources. We believe we should provide some help \nand assistance. Local school districts want that help and assistance. \nWe are being denied that under the Republican priorities.\n  Finally, with all respect to our majority leader, the history and the \nrecord shows that it has been this President and the Democratic \nleadership who have seen the increase in the funding over the period of \nthe last 6 years. That is just a matter of record, with all respect.\n  The final point the Republican leader says: Why didn't they support \nour tax reductions? The Office of Management and Budget has stated that \nthere would have been a 40-percent reduction in\n\n[[Page S11486]]\n\nsupport of education in order to pay for that tax break.\n  I ask the majority leader, if you have $780 billion that you want to \ngive away in tax breaks, why aren't you providing additional funding on \nprograms that have been tried, tested, and have enhanced the \neducational achievement of the children of this country?\n  Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Democratic \nleader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will use leader time so as not to \ntake what limited time may be left.\n  I want to speak for a moment and commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for his remarks and for the incredible message I \nthink that chart alone points out.\n  We heard our Republican colleagues say over and over that they are \nthe ones who have supported education; they are the ones who can take \ncredit for the fact that we have actually improved funding over the \ncourse of the last several years. As Senator Kennedy has pointed out so \nably, it is only because we have forced our Republican colleagues to \nincrease this investment that we see any real improvement whatsoever.\n  That is the reason I am hoping our colleagues will be very wary of \nthe resolution posed by our Republican colleagues this afternoon.\n  Obviously, if you look at some of the stated priorities, there is \nvery little for which there can be disagreement. We should have well-\ntrained, high-quality teachers. Parents need to be involved in \neducation of their children. There have to be safe schools, and we need \nto have orderly places for children to learn.\n\n  But the problem is the rhetoric and the record are totally opposite. \nRhetoric is what we just heard. The record is deep cuts in education \nevery single year. The Republican agenda will not achieve the rhetoric \nthat the resolution the Republicans are proposing today calls for.\n  Look again at what the House Labor-HHS-Education subcommittee did \nlast week. How does killing class size reduction match the rhetoric in \nthe resolution? How does it match the rhetoric in the resolution to \nprovide only half of the money the President has requested for \nafterschool programs? How can you ensure that we have orderly places \nfor children to learn when you cut funds from the Safe and Drug Free \nSchool program? How do we help make sure children are ready to school \nwhen you provide $500 million less for the Head Start Program than the \nPresident has requested? How can you do the things the Republicans \npropose in their resolution and then eliminate the Class Size Reduction \nProgram, making it even more difficult to make sure that every \nclassroom has a qualified teacher. Giving families a $5 annual tax \nbreak isn't going to make schools safer or provide afterschool \nprograms. Vouchers do nothing for these kids left behind in low-\nperforming schools.\n  I urge our colleagues to look very carefully at this resolution, and \nlook at the statement at the end of the resolution which says this \nCongress is now in a position to be congratulated for its strong \neducation performance.\n  How do you congratulate a Congress that cuts as deeply as the House \ndid last week? How do you congratulate a Congress that has nothing to \nshow for the record in education except for an Ed-Flex bill we passed \nlast spring that is of very little value in reaching the goals and the \nstated objectives in the Republican resolution?\n  That is why we have offered our resolution. Our resolution addresses \nthe priorities stated by our Republican colleagues. We put our money \nwhere our mouth is. We do what we need to do--fund the priorities \nwithin this budget to ensure that we are able to achieve those goals, \nnot just talk about them.\n  We provide $1.4 billion to reduce class size. We triple the funding \nfor afterschool programs. We increase college access and affordability. \nWe expand opportunities to incorporate education technology. We advance \nschool literacy and readiness.\n  Those are the kinds of things you need to do if you are serious about \nthese stated goals which are found in both resolutions.\n  You have to look at what happens once the resolution passes. From \nwhere does the money come, and how big a commitment is there on the \npart of colleagues on either side of the aisle to achieve what we say \nwe want to achieve? Only one resolution pending does that.\n  I hope everyone will understand that before they cast their vote.\n  Let me also make a couple of comments. The Senator from Massachusetts \ndid such a good job that very little else needs to be said with regard \nto some of the remarks made by our Republican colleagues. But the \nmajority leader on Friday made a couple of statements to which I think \nthere must be a response. He pointed out that spending on education has \nrisen every year since the Republicans took the majority.\n  It has risen, all right. But it has risen over the objections of many \nof our colleagues on the other side. It has risen only because this \ncaucus and the administration have pressed the Republican leadership \nand the Republican Members of the Senate to do what we have advocated \nagain this year--to provide the kind of commitment and resources \nnecessary.\n  One of the Republicans' first action was to rescind $1.7 billion in \neducation funding. One of their most famous actions over the years has \nbeen to propose abolishing the Department of Education altogether. Of \ncourse, they shut the Government down in an effort to enact the \nDraconian cuts in education and all other programs. It was only because \nDemocrats refused to make education such a low priority that these \ninvestments are made.\n  So how ironic now that we have prevailed, they attempt to take \ncredit. I think most people understand that. Democrats have supported \nreal options to involve parents in our education system as well.\n\n  Our majority leader asserted last week the Democrats oppose giving \nparents options. Nothing could be further from the truth. I cannot \nimagine anybody could actually say that and be serious. We have \nsupported providing choices through open enrollment in public charter \nschools. More importantly, we believe communities and parents should \nhave the tools--including the resources--to make sure each local \nneighborhood school provides every single child a high quality \neducation, not just some.\n  Despite suggestions to the contrary, we support increasing resources \nfor special education. We believe we need to do that in addition to, \nnot instead of, addressing other problems. Helping all children is what \nwe want to do with our educational agenda.\n  We offered an amendment earlier this year to fully fund the special \neducation program by reducing the Republican tax cut. Guess what. The \nmajority rejected it. I think almost to a person, if not to a person, \nthey rejected it. When it came down to a tax cut or fully funding \nspecial education, our Republican colleagues did what we could almost \npredict they will do every single time: They voted for the tax cut.\n  I think it is important to note the Republican resolution doesn't \ngive the whole picture about the state of public education. There are \nproblems, but some good things are happening. There is not a word in \nthe resolution they offer today about the good things that have been \neffective.\n  I think it was Senator Murray who said last week, and it ought to be \nrepeated over and over: Public education isn't failing us; we are \nfailing public education. When we look at the shortfalls in this \nbudget, once again, and the failure to fund the commitment to public \neducation, I think she was right on the mark when she said that.\n  With the help of incentives from Goals 2000 and the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, school districts are now setting higher \nacademic standards; many school districts are taking strong steps to \nreform schools using proven, research-based methodologies. Student \nperformance is rising in math, science, and reading. SAT scores are \nincreasing. Students are taking more rigorous, tougher courses they are \ndoing better. A higher percentage of students are receiving passing \ngrades on advanced placement exams, and fewer students are dropping \nout. I think it is important to note that the gap between whites and \nblacks in completing high school is closing in many communities.\n  I hope our Republican colleagues will join in our agenda to help \ncommunities achieve all these goals and more. The bottom line is, they \nhave made education their last--not their first, their\n\n[[Page S11487]]\n\nlast--priority. As the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out, we are \nless than 1 week away from the end of the fiscal year and we have yet \nto act on education, yet to act to provide the resources necessary to \nensure education is funded.\n  We have a real opportunity this afternoon to voice our concern, to \nexpress our support, to commit the resources. There is no question, a \nstrong public education system is critical for our Nation's future. \nThat is exactly what the Democratic agenda provides.\n  I urge our colleagues who support the resolution we propose to oppose \nthe Lott-Gregg-Coverdell resolution. I urge my colleagues to make the \nFederal Government a constructive partner in improving our public \nschools and to work to enact a strong education agenda with more than \nrhetoric and with a commitment to the resources and the investments \nthat are required to ensure our actions meet our rhetoric.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We heard from the majority leader and the Senator from \nNew Hampshire that we don't have to worry about education funding \nbecause they are going to have an appropriations bill that will far \nexceed the President's request.\n\n  I ask the Senator if on the one hand he finds it perhaps encouraging \nthat we are finally moving to get education reform, and what kind of \nconsideration we ought to give to that kind of assurance?\n  It is Monday evening. We go into the fiscal year on Friday. The \nmajority leader has said we are going to have a budget that will exceed \nthe President's. Can the Senator tell me why, if they are going to \nexceed the President's budget, that suddenly we find this money, does \nhe know of any reason we have not had this money before? Doesn't he \nbelieve we should have had it before? Or does he know from where the \nfunding will come?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think the Senator asks a very good question. I respond \nby asking three questions of my own.\n  If that is the case, why did the House Republican caucus choose to \nmake the deep cuts they did? And, second, why was there not an outcry \non that side of the aisle in this Chamber against those cuts? Where was \nthe outcry when those deep cuts were made? If that is the case, my \nthird question is, why today are we continuing to use the Health and \nHuman Services subcommittee's budget, their allocation, as an ATM \nmachine to fund everything else? Why the outcry on our side? Look at \nthe record. Why the practice of using this budget as an ATM machine for \neverything else? If they support education, why doesn't the record show \nit?\n  I think the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts asks a very good \nquestion. Frankly, I am interested in their response to that question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield further, I searched the Record \nand I didn't find it as of last week when the leader put in his own \nresolution and when we talked about this. There was no comment, no \nsense of outrage at that particular time.\n  This is a poor way of dealing with the families of this country that \nunderstand our role in the area of education is limited. We spend about \n7 cents out of every dollar, but we try to target it in areas of \nspecial need. To be able to on one day see these dramatic cuts and 3 \ndays later hear a statement by the majority leader that it will be far \nin excess of the President's request, does not he agree with me that \nthe American people are entitled to a more serious discussion and \ndebate of a priority which they believe so deeply is important for \ntheir children and the future of this country?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely right.\n  Ask people in South Dakota, and I am sure in Massachusetts: What do \nyou want us to put our time, effort, and resources into? Without \nquestion, time and time and time again they say: We want to make sure \nthat one thing happens--our young people are educated. We want to make \nabsolutely certain if you do anything, ensure we have an educated \nworkforce.\n  I was with a number of businesspeople over the weekend. Again, I was \nreminded this is not just an education issue; this is a business issue, \nan economic issue. This is an American strength issue. This could be \ncalled a national security issue. That is what this is. It isn't just \nabout education. Our country is at stake. Whether or not we educate our \nyoung people adequately determines in large measure what kind of \neconomy we will have, what kind of society we have, and certainly what \nkind of strength we will have in the long term.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the Democratic leader for an \nexcellent statement and for reminding all Members why we are here on a \nMonday evening debating this issue: The American public has said \neducation is its No. 1 priority. It ought to be the No. 1 priority of \nthe Senate.\n  I have been delighted to hear the rhetoric from both sides throughout \nthis year that education is the No. 1 priority. That is why I am so \ndisappointed tonight. Clearly, the budget priorities we now see show \neducation has dropped to last. It is the last appropriations bill to be \nconsidered. It is the appropriations bill we have been using from which \nto steal the funds throughout this entire process. Who gets hurt in the \nend? It is our children.\n  I listened to a Senator a few minutes ago saying this is a debate \nabout philosophy. I agree. It is a philosophy about whether or not just \na few kids in our country get a good education or whether we are going \nto make sure every child, no matter who they are or where they come \nfrom, gets a good education and how we do that.\n  In talking to parents across this country, they are not saying \neliminate bureaucracy; they are not saying block grant the programs. \nThey are saying: Make sure my child can learn to read and write. They \nare saying: If my child is in a smaller classroom in first, second, and \nthird grade and gets the attention they need, they will get a good \neducation. They will learn how to read and write; they will be a \nsuccess.\n  They are asking Congress to partner with their State and local \ngovernments to reduce class size. They are asking Congress to make sure \nour teachers are given the skills they need to teach the young kids in \nour classrooms. They are asking Congress to put the resources behind \nthe rhetoric.\n  When I tell people in my State and across this country that 1.6 \npercent of the Federal budget goes to education, something they believe \nis a priority, they are appalled. Education needs to be funded at a \nlevel where every child can learn to read and write and be a success in \nthis world. This Congress is failing.\n  I was extremely disappointed with the House appropriations bill that \npassed out of committee last week; it eliminated the Eisenhower Teacher \nProfessional Development Program. That is a program that is geared to \nhelping our teachers teach the basics of math and science. Talk to the \nnew startup businesses and the businesses that are succeeding. They say \nour kids need to learn math and science.\n  That is what the Eisenhower Grant Program is all about. I met with \nsome scientists in my home State just a few months ago, leaders in the \nbiotech industry, leaders in the technology industry. They spent an \nevening with me, of their own time, because they wanted to tell me how \ngreat the Eisenhower teacher professional development grants were, what \nthey have done for students in our local high schools, invigorated them \nand got them to go on to science and math in college. They wanted to \nmake sure we continued this program.\n  What did the House do last week? They took the money out. It is gone. \nNo longer are we saying to schools across this country that making sure \nwe have math and science students who succeed is important. That is \nwrong.\n  What else did they do? They eliminated the Goals 2000 Program. This \nis a program that helps school districts fund their own locally-\ndesigned programs to help student achievement by improving the quality \nof teacher training. Every one of us knows, if you want your company to \nsucceed, you make sure your employees have the best skills they can to \nwork for you. That is what we need to be doing with our teachers. We \nneed to be training them. We need to be making sure they have the \nskills they need to pass on to our young students today. That is what\n\n[[Page S11488]]\n\nGoals 2000 is about. The House eliminated it.\n  The Class Size Reduction Initiative? Eliminated in the House budget. \nWhen I went out to my State just a few weeks ago, I went to a school in \nTacoma, WA, where they had taken the Class Size Reduction Initiative \nmoney we had given them and focused it entirely on the first grade \nclassrooms in the Tacoma school districts. Today, this year, 57 schools \nin Tacoma, WA, have 15 students in their first grade classrooms. They \nthen used their title I money to help train those teachers in literacy \nefforts. Their focus this year is to make sure every first grade \nstudent can read at the end of the year. That is an amazing program. We \nare making it happen with the class size reduction money that was \npassed with bipartisan support a year ago. We are going to now take \nthat away and tell those students and tell those teachers we no longer \nare going to help them do what they told me was absolutely critical?\n  As you can see behind me on this chart, K-12 enrollments are \nincreasing dramatically right now. Why are we, then, reducing the \nlevels of support for these students? We have to make sure every child \ngets the resources he or she needs. We have to make sure the local \ncommunities have the resources behind them. We at the Federal level are \na partner with our State and our local governments to make sure our \nkids learn. We want to know their classes are small enough that kids \ncan learn to read and write and do math. We want to know those teachers \nare trained. We want to know there are afterschool programs so our \nstudents do not go home alone, to their neighborhoods, alone where they \nare not learning or where they are unproductive or can get in trouble. \nThat is what the Democrats have been fighting for. That is what we will \ncontinue to fight for.\n  We know the rhetoric is not going to educate one child. We know all \nof the bills with big names are not going to educate one child. We do \nknow the dollars--behind reducing class size, training our teachers, \nEisenhower grants--make a difference. School districts are held \naccountable for making sure our kids learn, and we are making sure we \nhave the resources behind those efforts to make sure it happens.\n  This debate is important. The debate tonight in the Appropriations \nCommittee is even more important--whether we are willing to put those \ndollars behind those students. I think it is appalling that our kids \nhave been left to last in the budget process, that they are going to be \nfunded by smoke and mirrors. We will not see the reality of this for \nprobably several months, but it will happen. When this is all said and \ndone, if we do not put the dollars behind our students and our teachers \nand our schools, our kids will get the message. They will get the \nmessage that we do not care. I do not want to be sending that message; \nI do not think anybody here does.\n  I have listened to the rhetoric. I have heard every Senator come out \nand say education is critical. If that is the truth, let's pass the \nDaschle amendment, go to work and make sure our kids have the resources \nthey need to be productive in the next century.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for an inquiry? I thought the \nvote was scheduled by unanimous consent to be at 5:30. Might the \nSenator from New Mexico inquire when we might start voting?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has been extended. There are a little \nover 9 minutes for the Senator from Massachusetts and 41 seconds for \nthe Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think we were prepared, after these last two speakers, \nto move ahead. I am told we will reserve.\n  I know just one Senator who wants to speak for 4 minutes on our side, \nand we will be prepared to yield back the other time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 41 seconds.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed \nto speak up to 5 minutes on the pending resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, this morning President Clinton \nannounced we have set a new record budget surplus. It now stands at \n$115 billion, according to the President. That would be absolutely \nwonderful, if it were true. The President says our prosperity now gives \nus an unprecedented opportunity and an unprecedented responsibility to \nshape America's future by putting things first, by moving forward with \nan economic strategy that is successful and sound, and by meeting \nAmerica's long-term challenges.\n  He continues to operate as if he has a $2.9 trillion surplus over the \nnext 10 years to take care of every problem and pay for every program \nover the next decade. However, the numbers the President is relying on \nare nothing but a mirage, pure speculation. The $2.9 trillion surplus \neveryone seems to be talking about in the next 10 years is based on 10-\nyear projections. As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said:\n\n       . . . it's very difficult to project with any degree of \n     conviction when you get out beyond 12, 18 months.\n\n  In addition, he stated that:\n\n       . . . projecting five or ten years out is a very precarious \n     activity, as I think we have demonstrated time and time \n     again.\n\n  Again, the President continues to play games with the numbers and \ncontinues to use Social Security to puff up his inflated budget surplus \nnumbers. How much of this $115 billion so-called surplus is actually \noffset, using our Nation's pension fund, Social Security? With today's \npronouncement, he continues to perpetuate the myth that we have a huge, \nhonest-to-goodness surplus. But he is using Social Security.\n  Just this last year--and I think this is really important for the \nAmerican people to understand--there was a great celebration here about \nhaving a surplus. But the fact of the matter is that in 1998, when \neverybody celebrated, there was no on-budget surplus; actually, there \nwas a $30 billion deficit. That is, the expenses exceeded the revenues, \nand we glossed it over with the Social Security surplus.\n  We have to stop playing games as if we had all this money to spend. I \nthink the President is doing the American people a disservice. But it \nis the only way the President is going to be able to fund his expansion \nof the Federal Government--by claiming the surplus is bigger than it \nreally is and that we are flush with cash. This is not how we should \nrun the Government. It is just plain wrong.\n  When I was Governor of Ohio, if somebody had come to me from the \nschools, or from the cities, and said, ``Governor, we want to spend \n$100 billion on a program,'' and then they said to me, ``I want to use \nthe pension funds from the State of Ohio to pay for it,'' I would have \nthrown them out of the office. That is what we have been doing in this \ncountry, and continue to do, is to pay for programs, frankly, that are \nthe responsibilities of State and local government, by taking the money \nout of Social Security.\n  If the President was still the Governor of Arkansas, this wonderful \nprogram I have heard about from my Democratic colleagues, all this \nmoney for schools, and for all these other new programs, would be \nappropriate. But the President is not the Governor of the United States \nof America and this Senate is not the school board of America. The \nresponsibility for education is at the State and local level. Today in \nthis country, with our $5.7 trillion debt, with a deficit that has gone \nup 1,300 percent, with an interest payment of 14 cents out of every \ndollar --we are spending more money on interest today than we are on \nMedicare--we have a terrible financial problem.\n  I have listened to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk \nabout the President's vision. I listen to them every day. I watch them \non C-SPAN. They are talking about school construction, 100,000 \nteachers--they are all great priorities, but they are the \nresponsibility of State and local government.\n  One of the things this Senate has to face up to, and this country has \nto face up to: There are certain responsibilities on the Federal \nGovernment and there are certain responsibilities on State and local \ngovernment.\n  I am going to vote against the Democratic leader and his resolution \nwhich continues to raid the pension funds of the United States of \nAmerica. Does everybody hear me? There is no surplus.\n\n[[Page S11489]]\n\n Let's stop talking about it. We have a Social Security surplus, and it \nis time we stop using the pension funds of the people of this country \nto pay for programs that are the responsibility of State and local \ngovernment, particularly in terms of where the States are a lot more \nflush than we are on the Federal level.\n  Today I will vote against that resolution. I will support the \nRepublican resolution which advocates giving the most amount of \nflexibility to our State and local school districts and in programs \nwhere we do have a proper role.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. They are on the front lines and should be given every \nopportunity to make decisions that are most appropriate for their \nchildren.\n  Earlier this year, we passed Ed-Flex in a bipartisan effort. I even \nwent to the Rose Garden when the President signed it. We need more \nprograms similar to Ed-Flex which give local officials flexibility, and \nwe ought not to be funding State and local programs with our pension \nfunds. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  I rise to support the Daschle resolution. There is a difference. It \nsays something about any institution in terms of how it prioritizes its \nagenda, and it says volumes about where the leadership in this Congress \nis that puts as the last issue for us to discuss and debate the \nEducation appropriations bill. We are last. This is the last one to be \nconsidered, despite the fact the American public has said on numerous \noccasions over the last year or so that they think this is the most \nimportant issue. They apparently think it is the least important issue \nbecause they have decided to put it at the end of the day. When \neverything else is taken care of, now we will see if there is anything \nleft over for education.\n  We have a different point of view. We say we ought to do this first \nbecause this is the Nation's No. 1 priority. If we lack an educated \nsociety, if we fail to provide opportunities for children and their \nfamilies to learn, then every other issue will suffer accordingly.\n  The U.S. Government contributes about 7 percent--7 cents on every \ndollar--that goes to fund elementary and secondary education. That is \nour commitment. What we are talking about is as much as a 17-percent \ncut of that 7 percent. It will be one thing if we are talking about the \nFederal Government doing the lion's share of the work in education. We \nare not. We have a paltry 7 percent that we help contribute to the \neducation of America's young people. Now we are talking as much as a \n17-percent cut of that 7 percent.\n  There is a sense of frustration one can hear in our voices because \nthe American people are frustrated. They understand that for this \nNation to succeed in the 21st century, it must have the best prepared, \nbest educated generation we have ever produced. Yet here we are with \nevery other appropriations bill having been passed but this one, the \nlast one.\n\n  What does it mean in real terms to the American public? It means in \nreal terms there can be a lot fewer children who will get child care, a \nlot fewer who will get Head Start--about 140,000 of them--a $1.3 \nbillion cut in title I, an $880 million cut in special education.\n  Let me tell you how important that one is. Ask any mayor of any city \nin this country whether or not special education dollars are important \nto them. Put aside, if you will, the needs of families, which I think \nspeak for themselves. But one of the rising costs for our communities \nacross this country is the staggering cost of educating a special needs \nchild. Yet when we are talking about $880 million in cuts for special \neducation, how do we expect our communities to meet that tremendous \nchallenge for those children?\n  I respect the Ed-Flex bill. We all voted for it. But to call that \nmajor education policy--that does not even come close to being major \neducation policy. It is worthy, but it is not the answer. I think it is \nthings such as class size, school safety, Pell grants for needy \nfamilies, and certainly doing what we can to see to it there is equal \nopportunity in education all across this country.\n  I have school districts in my State where my communities have the \nresources, and they have every imaginable technological opportunity. \nBut I can take you to a school 15 minutes away in inner cities where \nyou will find four or five computers for a student body of 2,000. I \ncome from an affluent State, but most of our educational funding comes \nfrom the local level. There are disparities that exist in every one of \nour States--huge disparities. When all the U.S. Government does is 7 \npercent--7 cents on the dollar comes from us--with a huge disparity in \nopportunity, to suggest somehow we have done enough with the Ed-Flex \nbill and that is all we need to worry about in 1999 in preparation for \nthe 21st century I do not think convinces the American public we are \nthere.\n  The Daschle bill is something I will support but, candidly, we ought \nto be voting on a funding resolution on education, not a sense of the \nSenate that we ought to deal with education. I am disappointed that is \nnot before us. But of the two propositions in front of us, the Daschle \nproposal at least lays out the fact we ought to be voting on the \nfunding measures and not stealing from education to pay for every other \nprogram in this country. Education ought to come first. That is where \nwe stand, and that is what our resolution suggests.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Whatever time is left, I yield to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, first, I join my distinguished colleague from \nConnecticut in his eloquent address and the passion he brings to that \nsubject. I share that passion.\n  I certainly join many of our colleagues who have spoken about the \nneed to adequately fund our public education system, but I want to \nrespond to an argument the distinguished majority leader made on Friday \nregarding the condition of our Nation's schools.\n  The Senator from Mississippi indicated it is not the Federal \nGovernment's job to fix leaky roofs. He indicated it is not the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government to build local schools. He \nindicated that every State has a budget surplus so the Federal \nGovernment should not get involved.\n  As a former Governor who was able to pump over $1 billion of \nadditional money into public education without a tax increase, I might \nordinarily agree with that premise, but there are times which call for \nextraordinary partnerships among localities, States, and the Federal \nGovernment. I believe we are experiencing one of those times.\n  We have three phenomena that are colliding to put the greatest level \nof stress on our educational infrastructure that we have seen since the \n1950s. Our school facilities across the Nation are over 40 years old on \naverage, our school-age population is skyrocketing, and our States and \nlocalities simply do not have the resources to do what needs to be done \ndespite their surpluses.\n  To say that providing school construction funding is not a Federal \nresponsibility is easy. It is an easy way to sit on our hands and do \nnothing to help children who wade through puddles to get to class, to \ndo nothing to help children who suffer in up to 100-degree temperatures \nin buildings with no air conditioning, to do nothing to help the \ncountless mayors across this country who stated they desperately need \nour help.\n  In Virginia alone, despite our Commonwealth surplus and plans to \ninvest more money in school infrastructure, we still face a $4 billion \nshortfall in school construction and repair needs. I have heard from \nsuperintendents, local officials, State legislators, parents, and, most \nimportant, students who have all asked for Federal help in this area.\n  For those colleagues who fear Federal intrusion in the area of \neducation, I simply say, if Federal officials want to help local \nofficials pay for school buildings and repairs, things we all \nacknowledge we need urgently, how do we encroach on local school \ncontrol of education? Localities have asked for our help, and it is \nhelp we can provide\n\n[[Page S11490]]\n\nwithout telling them how to run their schools. I believe this is \nactually one of the least intrusive things that we can do to help from \nthe Federal level.\n  Providing school infrastructure assistance is not intended to be a \npanacea for all the challenges we face with respect to increasing \nacademic achievement, but it is certainly a critical need.\n  Under the leadership of a Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower, \nour predecessors in Congress summoned the political will to fund a \nmassive national infrastructure initiative.\n  We did help build roads. We did help build schools. We did it because \nour States and localities needed our help. We did it because our \npopulation was booming. And we did it to try to ensure that the United \nStates would have the infrastructure it needed to be economically sound \nand competitive. It is my hope that we can summon that will once again.\n  With that, Madam President, in full support of the statement made by \nour distinguished Democratic leader and my colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle, and in opposition to the proposal from the other side of the \naisle upon which we will vote momentarily, I thank the Chair and yield \nthe floor.\n\n\n                        Vote On S.

Res. 186) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 186\n\n       Whereas the fiscal year 2000 Senate Budget Resolution \n     increased education funding by $28,000,000,000 over the next \n     five years, and $82,000,000,000 over the next ten years, and \n     the Department of Education received a net increase of \n     $2,400,000,000 which doubles the President's requested \n     increase;\n       Whereas compared to the President's requested levels, the \n     Democratically controlled Congress' appropriations for the \n     period 1993 through 1995 reduced the President's funding \n     requests by $3,000,000,000, and since Republicans took \n     control of Congress, Federal education funding has increased \n     by 27 percent;\n       Whereas in the past three years, the Congress has increased \n     funding for Part B of Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Act by nearly 80 percent, while the Administration's fiscal \n     year 2000 budget only requested a 0.07 percent increase which \n     is less than an adjustment for inflation, and Congress is \n     deeply concerned that while the Administration has provided \n     rhetoric in support of education of the disabled, the \n     Administration's budget has consistently taken money from \n     this high priority program to fund new and untested programs;\n       Whereas Congress is not only providing the necessary funds, \n     but is also reforming our current education programs, and \n     Congress recognizes that significant reforms are needed in \n     light of troubling statistics indicating--\n       (1) 40 percent of fourth graders cannot read at the most \n     basic level;\n       (2) in international comparisons, United States 12th \n     graders scored near the bottom in both mathematics and \n     science;\n       (3) 70 percent of children in high poverty schools score \n     below even the most basic level of reading; and\n       (4) in mathematics, 9 year olds in high poverty schools \n     remain two grade levels behind students in low poverty \n     schools;\n       Whereas earlier in 1999, the 106th Congress took the first \n     step toward improving our Nation's schools by passing the \n     Education Flexibility and Partnership Act of 1999, which \n     frees States and local communities to tailor education \n     programs to meet the individual needs of students and local \n     schools;\n       Whereas the 1999 reauthorization of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 will focus on increasing \n     student achievement by empowering principals, local school \n     boards, teachers and parents, and the focus should be on \n     raising the achievement of all students;\n       Whereas Congress should reject a one-size-fits all approach \n     to education, and local schools should have the freedom to \n     prioritize their spending and tailor their curriculum \n     according to the unique educational needs of their children;\n       Whereas parents are the first and best educators of their \n     children, and Congress supports proposals that provide \n     parents greater control to choose unique educational \n     opportunities to best meet their children's educational \n     needs;\n       Whereas every child should have an exceptional teacher in \n     the classroom, and Congress supports efforts to recruit, \n     retrain, and retain high quality teachers;\n       Whereas quality instruction and learning can occur only in \n     a first class school that is safe and orderly;\n       Whereas Congress supports proposals that give schools the \n     support they need to protect teachers and students, remove \n     disruptive influences, and create a positive learning \n     atmosphere; and\n       Whereas success in education is best achieved when \n     instruction focuses on basic academics and fundamental \n     skills, and students should no longer be subjected to untried \n     and untested educational theories of instruction, rather our \n     Nation's efforts should be geared to proven methods of \n     instruction: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) this Congress has taken strong steps to reform our \n     Nation's educational system and allowed States, local schools \n     and parents more flexibility and authority over their \n     children's education; and\n       (2) the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 will enable this Congress to continue \n     its efforts to send decision making back to States, local \n     schools, and families.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to a \nperiod of morning business with Senators permitted to speak for up to \n10 minutes each.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what is \nthe pending business if we were to go to the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. S. 625.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The bankruptcy legislation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business would have been S. 625, \nwhich is the bankruptcy bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Further reserving the right to object, if that \nlegislation were before the Senate, would it be in order for me to \noffer the minimum wage as an amendment--if it were pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendments are in order, if it were pending.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. But, as I understand it, the leader now has indicated, \nby consent request, that we go to morning business, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Further reserving the right to object, can the leader \ngive us any idea when we will be back on the pending legislation, the \nbankruptcy legislation? Or when we will have an opportunity to address \nthe issue of the minimum wage?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to get to the bankruptcy reform legislation. I \nthink that is important. We need to have this reform. The system is not \nworking well now, and there is broad support, I think on both sides of \nthe aisle, for bankruptcy reform. I think we could move to the bill if \nwe could have a full debate on bankruptcy and relevant amendments to \nthat. We could probably even work out an agreement that would include \nconsideration of the small businessman's and small businesswoman's \nneeds, and minimum wage needs. But I do not think it is fair the \nbankruptcy reform legislation, which should be considered in and of and \nby itself, should become an out-basket for every amendment to be \noffered on every subject that has already, in many instances, been \nconsidered this year, and that it become a Christmas tree for all kinds \nof unrelated amendments.\n  That is why I moved to a cloture vote because I wanted to get up \nbankruptcy reform. I would like to go to that. I will be glad to work \nout some sort of agreement as to how that bill will be considered. But \nI do not think we have the time right now, with the appropriations \nbills we have to complete before the end of the fiscal year. Hopefully, \nthe last one, the 13th one, will be up--it will be up on Wednesday. We \nwill be on that bill until we complete it. Hopefully, we will complete \nit by midnight on Thursday night, which would be the 13th bill. It \nwould be only about the third time in the last 15 or 20 years we will \nhave passed all appropriations bills through the Senate by the end of \nthe fiscal year.\n  So that has been our focus. We have been focusing on the \nappropriations bills. We will have a conference report in the morning \nwe will need to vote on, the Energy and Water appropriations bill. We \nwill continue to move those bills and the conference reports through. \nWhen we get through with that process, then we will look back to what \nthe legislative schedule is going to be. I hope we can come to \nagreement on how that would be considered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just further reserving the right to object, of course, \nwe did not give a clear indication whether we would have the \nopportunity to vote on an increase in the minimum wage. We have seen \nMembers vote for an increase in their own pay, their salaries, for some \n$4,400. We have doubled the President's salary. We voted for an \nincrease for the military, which I strongly support, and also for \nGovernment employees.\n  I wonder when we will be able to enter into some kind of agreement on \nthe minimum wage. I do not think it will take a great deal of time. We \nwill be glad to do it of an evening, if it would be more convenient for \nthe leadership, working out the schedule. But we have not had the \nopportunity for the Senate to express its will. We would like to at \nleast get some indication from the leader as to when we might be able \nto do this, since the days are moving along and still many workers, who \nare working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, have not \nparticipated in the very substantial economic progress and are looking \nto the Senate to see whether we will address this issue.\n\n  Can the leader help us at all, in terms of indicating when we might \nhave some chance to address that?\n  Mr. LOTT. I can't at this time because we must focus on the \nappropriations bills through the remainder of this week. I will need to \ndiscuss this with Senator Daschle and Senator Kennedy and see if we can \ncome up with a way we can handle that issue without it opening up the \ndoor to all kinds of other issues that, in many instances, for \ninstance, we may have already considered in the Senate.\n  Having said that, whatever we do, I want to make sure we do it in \nsuch a way that entry-level workers, people who do come into \nrestaurants and other small businesses, don't wind up losing their \njobs. That is important to them. Also, that we do not wind up doing it \nin such a way that small businessmen and small businesswomen cannot \ncontinue to stay in business.\n  So I think we have to find a way to offset the costs, particularly \nfor small businessmen and small businesswomen who are working on a very \nsmall margin of profit. I know I have heard from some. I remember one \nlady in particular, outside of Atlanta--I think maybe in Marietta--who \nhad a sweet shop. She basically said: If you do this again without some \nsort of offsets, I cannot make up the difference anymore myself.\n  So we have to make sure it is a balanced approach when we do consider \nthis and however we consider it.\n  However, the answer to your question is any time you and Senator \nDaschle want to sit down and seriously discuss a way to get this done, \nI will be ready to do it, once we get through the appropriations \nprocess, which will be done, hopefully, at the end of this week.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S11492]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, September \n23rd was the 2-year anniversary of submission of the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty to the US Senate for ratification.\n  Both Republican and Democratic presidents over the span of 4 decades \nhave worked to enhance our national security by negotiating limits on \nnuclear testing. Progress has been slow and halting, but the \ninescapable logic of improving security by banning nuclear tests has \nprevailed. The successful negotiation of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty, signed by 152 countries, was the culmination of these decades \nof effort on the part of the United States. Ratification and entry into \nforce of this treaty is in our best interest and in the best interest \nof nuclear non-proliferation and international stability.\n  Mr. President, I have urged the Committee on Foreign Relations to \nhold hearings on this treaty. I know the Chairman has concerns about \nthe treaty. I hope he will air them in a forum that will allow \ndiscussion of his concerns and those of other Members of the Committee. \nAnd I urge the Majority Leader to bring this treaty to the Senate \nfloor. Time is of the essence on this matter. America has been the \nworld leader on this issue and was the primary architect of this \ntreaty. We have an obligation to take up this treaty in the Senate, to \neducate ourselves on its provisions and to debate the merits of its \nratification. The eyes of the world are on our actions as the 44 \ncountries who have ratified the treaty prepare to meet on October 6th \nin Vienna, Austria, to discuss implementation of the treaty. I would \nvastly prefer that the United States were sitting as a party at that \nmeeting. But at a minimum, we should use this opportunity to make \nprogress on the treaty here in the Senate.\n  We have an obligation to future generations to improve the national \nsecurity of our nation. It would be irresponsible of us to let slip out \nof our grasp a very important tool in the fight against nuclear \nproliferation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/27/senate-section/article/S11492-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I wish to express my support for the \namendment offered last Friday by Senator Kerry to fund 50,000 new \nSection 8 vouchers. Had the Senate voted on this amendment, I would \nhave voted in favor of it. I am pleased that Senator Mikulski and \nothers have committed to work on this issue in conference.\n  The Kerry amendment is particularly important to my home state in \nlight of the current affordable housing crisis in California. Eleven of \nthe twenty-five least affordable metropolitan areas are located in \nCalifornia. The homeownership rate is 47th among the 50 states. More \nthan one-third of homeowners and one-half of renters pay more than \nthirty percent of their income for housing in California. On average, \nit takes more than three years to receive a Section 8 voucher in \nCalifornia. In Los Angeles, approximately 8,000 families are currently \non the Section 8 waiting list and it can take as long as eight years to \nget a voucher. That is just too long for a family to wait for \naffordable housing.\n  It is clear that in California, and indeed throughout the country, \nthere is a definite need for further housing assistance.\n  Section 8 housing assistance serves the poorest of the poor, persons \nwith incomes averaging approximately $7,500 per year. Last year, \nCongress made available almost 100,000 new Section 8 vouchers. No new \nvouchers had been made available in the past five years. That was an \nimportant first step--but it is time to do more. In my own state of \nCalifornia, almost 13,000 families would receive Section 8 assistance \nunder the Kerry amendment.\n  Our economy is booming: unemployment is at historically low levels, \nnearly 18 million jobs have been created since 1993, and the inflation \nrate has averaged just 2.5 percent since 1993--the lowest rate since \nthe Kennedy Administration.\n  In these economic good times, however, the gap between rich and poor \ncontinues to grow. We must continue to assure that everyone in this \ncountry has affordable housing.\n  I urge my colleagues on the conference committee to provide \nadditional Section 8 vouchers to America's families in need of housing \nassistance.\n  Mr. President, I also want to talk about the provision in this bill \nthat would eliminate HUD's Community Builder program.\n  Community Builders act as liaison between HUD and local governments \nand non-profit organizations. They help local authorities identify the \nprograms in HUD that best serve the needs of their neighborhoods.\n  Many experts have affirmed that HUD is becoming the model of \nreinvention. I believe that HUD's Community Builder program has been a \nkey component of HUD's reinvention efforts.\n  The Community Builder program is working. Ernst & Young's initial \naudit found that the Builders are knowledgeable about HUD programs, are \nmaking customer service more efficient, assisting communities, and \nusing their expertise to make government work better. A similar survey \nby Andersen Consulting found that ``Community Builders have had a \npositive effect on the ability of [HUD] customers . . . to conduct \nbusiness.''--and recommended an expansion of the Community Builder \nprogram to cover more communities. In addition, I have received \nnumerous letters from elected officials and nonprofit organizations \nthroughout California expressing support for the Community Builder \nprogram.\n  Approximately twenty HUD offices would be forced to close if the \nCommunity Builder program were eliminated--including one in Fresno, \nCalifornia.\n  I ask that my colleagues on the conference committee work together to \nfind funding for this important program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/27/senate-section/article/S11492-4", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/27/senate-section/article/S11492-5", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11492-S11493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE NATIONAL UNION FOR \n THE TOTAL INDEPENDENCE OF ANGOLA (UNITA)--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--\n                                 PM 61\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\n\n[[Page S11493]]\n\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I transmit herewith a 6-month \nperiodic report on the national emergency with respect to the National \nUnion for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) that was declared in \nExecutive Order 12865 of September 26, 1993.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the Education for \nDemocracy Act. I am pleased that the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Dodd) has joined me as a cosponsor to reauthorize and \nimprove existing federally supported civic education programs.\n  ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution,'' has proven \nto be an excellent curriculum and a successful program for teaching the \nprinciples of the Constitution.\n  Since 1985, the Center for Civic Education has administered the \nprogram. It is a rigorous course designed for high school civics \nclasses that provides teacher training using a national network of law \nprofessionals as well as other community and business leaders.\n  The most visible component of We the People, is the simulated \nCongressional hearings which are competitions at local, state and \nnational levels. The final round of this annual competition is held in \nan actual United States Senate or House of Representatives hearing \nroom, here in the Nation's Capital.\n  The Popularity of We the People is demonstrated by the 82,000 \nteachers and the 26.5 million students who have participated since its \nbeginning. Studies by the Education Testing Service\n\n[[Page S11495]]\n\nhave repeatedly indicated that We the People participants outperform \nother students in every area tested. In one, We the People high school \nstudents outscored university sophomore and junior political science \nstudents in every topic.\n  A Stanford University study showed that these students develop a \nstronger attachment to political beliefs, attitudes and values \nessential to a functioning democracy than most adults and other \nstudents. Other studies reveal that We the People students are more \nlikely to register to vote and more likely to assume roles of \nleadership, responsibility and demonstrate civic virtue.\n  Mr. President, in addition to We the People, this bill reauthorizes \nthe Civitas International Civic Education Exchange Program, which in \ncooperation of the United States Information Agency, links American \ncivic educators with their counterparts in Eastern Europe and the \nstates of the former Soviet Union. This program is highly effective in \nbuilding a community with a common understanding of teaching and \nimproving the state of democracy education, worldwide.\n  Mississippi recently became the latest state to participate in this \nimportant international exchange program. Jones County Junior College \nin Ellisville, Mississippi will partner with universities in Texas and \nFlorida in an exchange with Hungary and other countries.\n  Ms. Susie Burroughs, Mississippi's new Civic Education program \ndirector, is committed to a deeper understanding of democracy and \nassisting others who desire to teach the ways of a free society in the \nworld's newest democracies. I am pleased that Mississippi teachers will \njoin the more than 8,000 other teachers who have participated in the \nCivitas training and exchange opportunities.\n  Mr. President, We the People and Civitas are preparing America's \nstudents and teachers to live and lead in the world by the standards \nand ideals set by our Founding Fathers.\n  I invite other Senators to cosponsor and support the Education for \nDemocracy Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Schumer, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1644. A bill to provide additional measures for the prevention and \npunishment of alien smuggling, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n             alien smuggling prevention and enforcement act\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Alien Smuggling \nPrevention and Enforcement Act. This legislation, which I am \nintroducing with my colleagues, Senator Schumer and Senator Feinstein, \nwill give law enforcement new tools and resources in the continuing \nfight against the smuggling of illegal aliens.\n  Despite continued efforts, Mr. President, alien smuggling remains a \nserious problem in America. Smugglers have responded to increases in \nthe efforts of our border patrol by adopting more daring methods to \nsmuggle individuals illegally into the United States. In many cases, \nthese methods entail little or no concern for the safety of the \nindividuals being smuggled. Moreover, these attempts increasingly \ninvolve organized criminal gangs. As recently as 1996, in the Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, Congress has acted \nto combat this dangerous form of smuggling. But it is clear that more \nneeds to be done.\n  I would like to quote from a story appearing in the August 15, 1999 \nedition of the Detroit News. This story sums up well our current \nsituation, demonstrating that we face a problem of national importance: \n``Illegal alien smuggling is a growing yet largely hidden business \nalong the U.S.-Canadian border. Smugglers are getting as much as \n$50,000 per person to bring in aliens desperate to reach the United \nStates. Yet immigration authorities, short of personnel and detention \nfacilities, can do little to slow the activity.'' The story goes on to \nquote Carl L. McClafferty, chief of the Detroit sector of the Border \nPatrol, who notes ``We get spurts of drug smuggling, but we have a \nconstant drone of alien smuggling. For us, alien smuggling is steady \nwork.''\n  My state of Michigan has been hit particularly hard by alien \nsmugglers. Crackdowns in other areas of the country have made Detroit \nin particular a target for illegal entry. We simply do not have the \nstaff on hand with the tools and resources needed to successfully \ncombat this problem. This means more illegal aliens in our country. It \nalso produces an added boost to criminal gang activities and all the \nproblems these activities bring with them. And that, Mr. President, is \nwhy I am introducing this legislation.\n  The Alien Smuggling Prevention and Enforcement Act would do the \nfollowing.\n  First, it would double the personnel devoted to combating alien \nsmuggling. Today, Mr. President, approximately 260 people are employed \nby the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to investigate and \nfight alien smuggling. This figure has not risen in the past three \nyears. This legislation would require the INS to add 50 more \ninvestigators and other enforcement personnel each year over the next 5 \nyears, each of them devoted to combating alien smuggling.\n  Second, this legislation would double criminal sentences for alien \nsmugglers. Under U.S. Sentencing Commission guidelines, the current \nminimum sentence for smuggling one to five aliens is 10 months; for \nsmuggling 6-24 aliens the minimum sentence is 18 months; for 25-100 \naliens it's 27 months; and for more than 100 aliens it's 37 months. \nSimply put, those sentences are not high enough to deter this heinous \nconduct. Nor are they severe enough, in moral terms, as punishment for \nacts involving intentional breaking of American law and the serious \nrisk of injury and death to innocent parties and those being smuggled. \nThis legislation would direct the U.S. Sentencing Commission to double \nthe relevant sentences to 20 months, 36 months 54 months, and 74 \nmonths, respectively.\n  Third, this legislation would increase fines for those convicted of \nalien smuggling to twice the amount an alien smuggler received, or \nexpected to receive, for his or her this illegal activity. Under U.S. \nSentencing Commission guidelines, currently the minimum fine is $3,000 \nfor smuggling one to five aliens; for smuggling 6-24 aliens the fine is \n$4,000; for 25-100 aliens it's $6,000; and for more than 100 aliens \nit's $7,500. Again, that is simply not strict enough, particularly \ngiven the profits to be made from this illegal activity. This \nlegislation would direct the U.S. Sentencing Commission to impose a \nfine above these minimum levels equal to twice the amount an alien \nsmuggler received, or expected to receive, for his or her illegal \nactivity.\n  This legislation also would authorize additional operating expense \nmoney to conduct undercover operations and prosecute alien smuggling \nand require an annual report to Congress by the Commissioner of the INS \non the agency's strategy to deal wit alien smuggling.\n  Taken together, Mr. President, these measures will deter alien \nsmuggling. By giving law enforcement personnel the tools they need to \ncatch alien smugglers and seeing to it that they are punished as \nharshly as is called for by their crime, this legislation will help \ndeter illegal immigration and deal a very real blow to criminal gang \nactivity.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1644\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Alien Smuggling Prevention \n     and Enforcement Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

AMENDMENTS TO SENTENCING GUIDELINES REGARDING THE \n                   EFFECT OF PROSECUTORIAL POLICIES.\n\n       In the exercise of its authority under section 994 of title \n     28, United States Code, the United States Sentencing \n     Commission shall amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to \n     include the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 5H1.14. Plea bargaining and other prosecutorial \n       policies.\n\n       ``Plea bargaining and other prosecutorial policies, and \n     differences in those policies among different districts, are \n     not a ground for imposing a sentence outside the applicable \n     guidelines range.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In addition to funds otherwise available \n     for such purpose, there are authorized to be appropriated to \n     the Immigration and Naturalization Service of the Department \n     of Justice such sums as may be necessary to carry out section \n     2 and to cover the operating expenses of the Service and the \n     Department in conducting undercover investigations of alien \n     smuggling activities and in prosecuting violations of section \n     274(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (relating \n     to alien smuggling), resulting from the increase in personnel \n     under section 2.\n       (b) Availability of Funds.--Amounts appropriated pursuant \n     to subsection (a) are authorized to remain available until \n     expended.\n\n     SEC. 6.

They devote many hours to helping seniors in \nemotional crisis.\n  Mt. Hood Community Mental Health Center began in 1985 as an outreach \nprogram for seniors at risk of suicide, and soon developed several \nprograms to address various levels of depression or emotional crisis \namong seniors, including Volunteers Involved in the Emotional Well-\nbeing of Seniors (VIEWS). Over the last ten years, Mt. Hood Community \nMental Health Center has trained more than 100 peer counselors who \nhave, in turn, provided crucial counseling to over 400 seniors. Without \nthe help of these volunteers, many of Oregon's seniors would have sunk \ndeeper into isolation and despair. As a result of the assistance of \nthese invaluable volunteers, the medical professionals at Mt. Hood \nCommunity Mental Health Center have been able to extend their reach far \nbeyond what their limited budget would otherwise allow.\n  These volunteers are performing extraordinary work. I am proud that \nmy own State of Oregon has initiated this effort, and I again wish to \ncongratulate the VIEWS volunteers for being an example of what we can \ndo to help others make a positive difference in the lives of \nseniors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/27/senate-section/article/S11501-4", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11501-S11502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO H. MELVIN NAPIER\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to rise today to pay \ntribune to one of Idaho and America's finest veterans, H. Melvin \n``Mel'' Napier, of Boise, ID.\n  There is no question Mel Napier is a true American patriot and a \nleader,\n\n[[Page S11502]]\n\nfrom his participation in the military, to his work on behalf of \nveterans, to his contributions in the community. The Air Force has a \nvery special tradition in Idaho, and Mel has long been part of that \ntradition. Enlisting in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean conflict, \nMel served 4 years on active duty and 8 years in the Air Force Reserves \nas a meteorologist. He has also been a stalwart veteran advocate. His \nactive membership and leadership in the American Legion led him to be \nselected to be National Vice Commander in 1982-83. In 1983, Mel began \nhis service as State Adjutant for the Legion, and he has served in that \ncapacity until this September.\n  Mel's service to our country makes it clear that he has never been \nafraid of challenges, hardships or hard work. Idaho is privileged to \nhave Mel and his family as residents. I am honored to stand before the \nSenate today and tell my colleagues about Mel; however, I do this with \nmixed emotions. Mel Napier recently stepped down as State Adjutant for \nthe American Legion, a position he held for 16 years. It is a special \nindividual indeed who commits to that kind of service on behalf of all \nthe men and women in uniform who have proudly served our great nation.\n  In sum, I would like to thank Mel for his tremendous contribution to \nour country, and most of all, to America's veterans. I know that Mel \nwill not be leaving the American Legion, or ending his service to \nveterans because he will no longer serve as State Adjutant, but I do \nthink that this is a very appropriate time to give Mel our thanks and \nshow our gratitude for his service.\n  Mr. Napier, thank you, congratulations, and Godspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/27/senate-section/article/S11502-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO KATHRYN ``KAYCI'' COOK\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding public servant and steward of our National Park System, \nKathryn ``Kayci'' Cook, Superintendent of Fort McHenry National \nMonument and Historic Shrine and Hampton National Historic Site. Kayci \nhas recently been selected as Assistant Superintendent of Glen Canyon \nNational Park in Utah and I, and many others in the State of Maryland, \nare sorry to see her go.\n  Throughout her 18-year career with the National Park Service, Kayci \nCook has distinguished herself for her leadership, commitment and \ndedication to managing and protecting our Nation's most precious \nnatural and cultural resources. Beginning as a seasonal park ranger at \nWupatki and Canyon de Chelley National Monuments in northern Arizona, \nshe quickly advanced through the ranks to positions as park ranger at \nSan Antonio Missions National Historical Park in Texas, supervisory \nranger at California's Death Valley National Monument, and Chief of \nResource Education for Apostle Islands National Lakeshore in Wisconsin. \nIn 1994, her contributions and accomplishments in these positions \nearned Kayci the prestigious Benvinetto Congressional Fellowship\n  I came to know Kayci three years ago, soon after she was appointed to \nlead Fort McHenry and Hampton and have had the privilege of working \nclosely with her on a number of matters of mutual concern affecting \nthese units of the National Park System.

Under her leadership the fort walls and many historic \nstructures at Fort McHenry have been restored, plans have been advanced \nto develop a new visitors center to accommodate the increasing number \nof visitors to the Fort, many preservation projects have been completed \nat Hampton and a new General Management Plan for this historic site is \nbeing completed.\n  Kayci Cook's hard work and dedication to the stewardship Fort McHenry \nand Hampton have earned her the respect and admiration of everyone with \nwhom she has worked.

Under the leadership of Stan McGrady, this \nteam of 11-and 12-year-olds completed an underdog run to win the \nWestern Regional Pennant and advance to the Little League World Series \nin Williamsport, PA. They won one game and lost two in the World \nSeries, but, more importantly, showed an impressive amount of maturity \nand sportsmanship and represented our state in an exemplary manner.\n  Furthermore, the Madison Cats of Rexburg, ID, ended a successful \nseason by competing in the Babe Ruth League World Series in Clifton \nPark, NY. This team of 14-year-olds, coached by Randy Sutton, went \nundefeated in both the state and regional tournaments to earn the right \nto represent the Pacific Northwest in the Babe Ruth World Series.\n  Along with the entire State of Idaho, I am very proud of these young \nmen. Their accomplishments show a level of dedication and teamwork that \nwill benefit them for many years to come. They were exceptional \nambassadors for Idaho. I congratulate them, their parents, and their \ncommunities on these unprecedented accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/27/senate-section/article/S11502-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11502-S11503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      WELFARE REFORM AND THE COLLEGE OPTION: A NATIONAL CONFERENCE\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this weekend, the McAuley \nInstitute, Wider Opportunities for Women, the Center for Women Policy \nStudies, and the Howard Samuels State Management and Policy Center of \nCUNY hosted a national conference on the important relationship between \nwelfare reform and higher education. On Friday night, they held an \nopening night reception and awards ceremony. Unfortunately, I was \nunable to attend, but I ask to have printed in the Record a letter that \nwas read on my behalf as part of the ceremony.\n  The letter follows.\n\n                                               September 24, 1999.\n       To All in Attendance: First, I would like to begin by \n     apologizing for the fact that I can't be here in person to \n     accept this award. Certainly, I always like to attend any \n     dinner that someone has gone to the trouble of holding in my \n     honor, but even more so I would love to attend your \n     conference focusing on the important relationship between \n     education and economic self-sufficiency.\n       Second, I would like to thank all of the sponsors of this \n     conference--the McAuley Institute, Wider Opportunities for \n     Women, the Center for Women's Policy Studies, and the Howard \n     Samuels State Management and Policy Center of CUNY--for \n     presenting me with this award. I have worked with these \n     groups in the past on important legislative efforts, and \n     deeply respect the work that each of these organizations has \n     done to protect and advance the well-being of the most needy \n     among us.\n       Having done that, though, I would also like to take this \n     time to talk a little bit about poverty and need.\n       We live in a nation of riches. Since 1969, the era when we \n     launched our War on Poverty, we have seen the nation's total \n     wealth per person grow by 62 percent, and as a nation, we \n     consumed 73 percent more material goods and services per \n     person in 1997 than we did 1969. Yet during that same time, \n     the number of poor children in America grew by 46 percent, or \n     more than 4 million children. About one-half of this growth \n     represented the growing number of poor children in families \n     headed by someone who worked.\n       1998 was a year of economic prosperity for many Americans. \n     Many of us have benefitted greatly from a strong economy: \n     unemployment is at its lowest level since 1969, and for the \n     second year in a row wages have gone up, cutting across the \n     traditional barriers of race, ethnicity and education.\n       Unfortunately, though, these gains have barely been felt by \n     those left behind by the growing economic inequality we see \n     in this country. New figures on family income show that the \n     gap between low- and moderate-income families and rich \n     families is at an all-time high. During the 1990s, we have \n     seen a disturbing trend in income gains--the rich in America \n     are benefitting in ways that the poor are not: While the \n     richest 20 percent of households gained about $15,000 dollars \n     in annual income between 1990 and 1997, the poorest 20 \n     percent of families gained only about\n\n[[Page S11503]]\n\n     $35 in annual income. That's a gain of 15 percent versus a \n     gain of less than 1 percent.\n       A recent study by the Center on Budget and Policy \n     Priorities offers further evidence of the widening income gap \n     between the rich and the poor in this country. Using \n     Congressional Budget Office data, they found that the after-\n     tax income of the richest one percent of the population will \n     more than double between 1977 and 1999, rising 115 percent \n     after adjusting for inflation. At the same time, the average \n     after-tax income for middle-income households, which accounts \n     for 60 percent of all households, will increase by only 8 \n     percent--less than one-half a percent per year--and the \n     average income of the poorest twenty percent of households \n     will actually decrease. As a result of these large increases \n     in income among the rich and the loss of income among the \n     poor, CBPP estimates that in 1999, the richest twenty percent \n     of households in the U.S. will have slightly more income than \n     the other 80 percent of households combined, and the 2.7 \n     million Americans with the highest incomes will have as much \n     after-tax income as the 100 million Americans with the lowest \n     incomes.\n       My own state of Minnesota provides a telling example of how \n     some of our families are being left behind: Minnesota leads \n     the country in low unemployment--less than 3 percent \n     statewide, less than 2 percent in the Minneapolis-St. Paul \n     area. But even with such impressive figures, we still see a \n     situation where unemployment in our poorest central-city \n     neighborhoods hovers around 15 percent, and a horrifying 60 \n     percent of the children who live in these neighborhoods are \n     growing up in poverty. And it isn't just in our cities, but \n     also among our rural communities, particularly our farm \n     communities, where we see similar levels of poverty and need.\n       And when we talk about people being poor, we are talking \n     about people in desperate need. It never fails to amaze me \n     what the Federal government defines as poor--in 1997, a \n     three-person family was ``officially'' poor if it made less \n     than $12,802 a year. Even more upsetting, though, is that \n     most poor families in the U.S. don't even meet this minimum. \n     The average poor family with children received in 1997 only \n     $8,688 a year in total income from all sources--the \n     equivalent of $724 a month, $167 a week, less than $24 a day.\n       Of course, those who suffer the most from poverty in this \n     country are our children. It makes me sick just thinking \n     about it. America's youngest children, those under the age of \n     6, are more likely to live in poverty than any other age \n     group. During the past two decades there has been a \n     substantial increase in the number and percentage of poor \n     young people in the United States. The young child poverty \n     rate has grown among all racial and ethnic groups, and in \n     urban, suburban, and rural areas. The number of American \n     young children living in poverty increased from 3.5 million \n     in 1979 to 5.2 million in 1997. The young child poverty rate \n     grew by 20 percent during those two decades, and currently \n     one-in-five young children in the U.S. live in poverty. \n     Nearly one-in-two young African American children live in \n     poverty, and about one in three young Latino children live in \n     poverty in the U.S.\n       Still more horrifying, one in ten young children in the \n     U.S. live in extreme poverty, in families with incomes less \n     than half the poverty level, an amount of only $6,401 for a \n     family of three in 1997. Nearly half of the children living \n     in poverty in the U.S. live in extreme poverty. Currently, \n     the extreme poverty rate among young children is growing \n     faster than the young child poverty rate.\n       I think what I find most upsetting is not the fact that so \n     many among us still live in poverty, but that so many of \n     those who live in poverty are hard-working parents who are \n     doing everything--everything--that they can. But they still \n     aren't making it. Sixty-one percent of the average poor \n     family's income comes from work--$5,295 a year, $441 a month, \n     $102 a week, or less than $15 a day. For an 8 hour workday, \n     that means someone was earning just under $2 an hour. Only \n     twenty-one percent of our average poor family's income came \n     from welfare--just $1,824 a year, $152 a month, $35 a week, \n     or less than $5 a day. And a majority of all poor children \n     under age 6, 65 percent, live with at least one employed \n     parent. Only one-sixth of poor young children live in \n     families who rely solely on public assistance for income.\n       How is this possible? How can we live in a time when there \n     are people who literally can't support themselves and their \n     families despite the fact that they work, often nearly 52 \n     weeks a year, 40 hours a week, sometimes more than one job. \n     In a time of unprecedented economic well-being, of budget \n     surpluses, and an 8.6 trillion dollar economy, it is criminal \n     that there are those living among us, who are doing \n     everything within their powers to make ends meet, who cannot \n     provide the basic needs of day-to-day survival for themselves \n     and their families.\n       We need to ask ourselves, we must ask ourselves, what is \n     happening when we see this happening. We should be \n     desperately concerned when we see that the average income of \n     American families living in poverty actually declined between \n     1996 and 1997. Simply put, this is both inexcusable and \n     utterly unacceptable. Even in the hardest of times, no \n     family, no child, in this country should be forced to go \n     without the basic necessities of food, shelter, and medical \n     care. But even more so, in a time of unparalleled economic \n     prosperity, how can any one not react with both despair and \n     outrage when confronted by such a scenario?\n       There is much to be done, much that should be done, much \n     that must be done. I am deeply committed to doing my part: I \n     will continue to offer legislation that protects the rights \n     of the poorest among us, and to fight to help them provide \n     for their needs. I have sponsored or co-sponsored legislation \n     to raise the minimum wage; to find out what's happening to \n     people when they lose their welfare benefits; to allow \n     welfare recipients to count two years of education or \n     vocational training toward their TANF work requirements; to \n     ensure that everyone in America has access to quality, \n     affordable healthcare and child care; and to guarantee that \n     women and children who are victims and survivors of domestic \n     violence have the economic resources and security they need \n     to leave abusive situations. We in Congress must recognize \n     that it isn't enough to tell people they must work, but we \n     also need to provide them with a wide range of supports while \n     they try to make the difficult transition from poverty to \n     economic self-sufficiency. All of it goes together--we must \n     address each if we intend to solve any.\n       There is so much that you can do with me as well. I urge \n     you to follow what happens in Congress and with the \n     Administration and make your opinion known to your \n     Representatives, to your Senators, and to the President--\n     write, e-mail, fax, and phone. Participate in every way you \n     can, not only for yourselves but also for those who might not \n     feel able to. We must all give a voice to those who are most \n     likely to go unheard, and we must teach them to speak loudly \n     for themselves. We must also make sure that people don't \n     forget the less fortunate among us. Sometimes in our own \n     prosperity, it is easier to simply turn away from that which \n     is difficult or painful to witness. We must not relax our \n     efforts, and we must never allow anyone to declare the war \n     against poverty won until there is no one, no mother, no \n     child, who lies down at night hungry or homeless. No one \n     should have to worry about whether or not they can provide \n     medical care for a sick loved one, or whether or not their \n     child is safe in daycare while they are at work.\n       I know that I am preaching to the choir at this point, so I \n     will close by simply praising you for all of your efforts--\n     each and every one of you is fighting this fight right on the \n     front lines--and by urging you not to bend and not to give \n     up. In the face of spending cuts, changing priorities, and a \n     simple lack of concern, you are the real ``poverty \n     warriors.''\n       And finally, I thank you again for honoring me this \n     evening.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Paul D.

Mr. President, on June 9, 1999, Judge Giles S. Rich \npassed away at age 95, still serving on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Federal Circuit after nearly 43 years as a Federal judge and as the \noldest active Federal judge in U.S. history. Today, the Federal court \nwill hold a memorial service in his honor. I rise today to add my voice \nto those of the participants in that memorial service in paying tribute \nto this man who contributed as much, if not more, than anyone else in \nthis century to the development of U.S. patent policy and the promotion \nof American innovation.\n  Judge Rich was heard to say, ``You see, as I go along, practically \neverything I did was what I didn't intend to do.'' I believe that \nstatement to be true in large part because Judge Rich was a man who \ndidn't follow success, but was instead followed by success. Bright \npeople and prestigious positions were drawn to him because of who he \nwas.\n  Judge Rich was educated at Harvard College, from which he graduated \nin 1926. He went on to receive his law degree from Columbia Law School \nin 1929. Since Columbia University didn't have any patent law classes, \nJudge Rich decided to teach himself patent law, through an arrangement \nwith a professor that allowed him to receive credit for a thorough and \nlengthy paper on patents. He in turn shared his knowledge and intellect \nwith students as a lecturer on patent law at Columbia University from \n1942 until 1956, as an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law \nCenter from 1963 to 1969, and as a lecturer on patent and copyright law \nas part of the Federal Judicial Center's training program for newly \nappointed judges from the program's inception in 1965 until 1971.\n  As a dedicated lawyer, professor, and judge, Judge Rich played a \nsignificant role in the development and evolution of intellectual \nproperty law in the United States. He practiced law in a private \npractice from 1929 to 1956, specializing in patent and trademark law. \nHe became a member of the New York Bar in 1929 and was certified by the \nU.S. Patent Office in 1934. As a member\n\n[[Page S11504]]\n\nof a two-man drafting committee, he was one of the two people \nprincipally responsible for drafting the 1952 Patent Act, which served \nas the first codification of all our nations' federal patent laws and \nwhich has served this country well for half a decade without \nsignificant revision. In 1992, Judge Rich earned special recognition \nfrom President Bush for his contributions to the patent code of our \nnation's patent system.\n  Judge Rich served in private practice until 1956, when President \nEisenhower appointed him as an associate judge for the Court of Customs \nand Patent Appeals (CCPA). Then, in 1982, he was appointed as a Circuit \nJudge for the CCPA's successor court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFederal Circuit, which holds exclusive jurisdiction for patent appeals. \nFrom his seat on the Federal Circuit, Judge Rich authored landmark \ndecisions clarifying some of the most difficult concepts in patent law, \nincluding decisions that have been hailed as laying the foundation for \nthe modern biotechnology industry and important cases dealing with the \ncomplex area of software and computer-related inventions.\n  Judge Rich was the distinguished recipient of a host of awards during \nhis career, ranging from the Jefferson Medal of New Jersey Patent Law \nAssociation in 1955 to the Oldest Active Judge in U.S. History \nRecognized by Chief Justices in 1997. He was the inaugural recipient of \nthe Pesquale J. Federico Memorial Award for outstanding service to the \npatent and trademark systems, awarded by the Patent and Trademark \nOffice Society. He was awarded the Charles F. Kettering Award and \nDistinguished Government Service Award from the George Washington \nUniversity. He was awarded the Harlan Fisk Stone Medal from Columbia \nUniversity. There is a law school moot court competition sponsored by \nthe American Intellectual Property Law Association--now in its 28th \nyear--named in his honor. There is even an Inn of Court named in his \nhonor. He has been awarded recognition from intellectual property law \nassociations in cities across the country and, in 1997, was awarded the \nCentennial Visionary Award by the American Intellectual Property Law \nAssociation upon the commemoration of its 100th anniversary. He holds \nhonorary Doctor of Law degrees from the George Washington University, \nJohn Marshall Law School, and George Mason University School of Law. \nAnd these are but a few of the many accolades Judge Rich has received \nthroughout life.\n  As with all judges, many of those who followed Judge Rich's decisions \nadmired and agreed with his legal theories, while others disagreed. But \nall respected his intelligence, strength, and ambition. He wrote in the \nhistory of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals that ``[c]ourts are \npeople and little else. Law evolves from their manners of thinking at \nparticular times and from the interactions of people thinking.'' Judge \nGiles S. Rich, as a person, helped transform our federal courts. He \ncontributed to a body of statutory and judicial precedent that is \nunparalleled throughout much of our nation's history. Chief Judge \nArcher said of Judge Rich in 1994 that Judge Rich was ``open-minded, \nflexible and respectful of the views of his colleagues. He [brought] to \nthe art of judging the temperament and knowledge that are rarely \nequaled. It sets a high standard for all of us.'' And as John Reilly \nstated in eulogizing Judge Rich, he was ``a quiet jurist and gentle man \nwho by his tireless scholarship and faithful devotion to the patent \nlaw, turned our American century into an inventive, productive \npowerhouse, to the benefit of us all.''\n  Judge Rich began his career as an intellectual property law \npractitioner and scholar at a time when radio broadcasts were the \nlatest emerging technology, yet he lived to set much of the patent \npolicy that formed the foundation for the digital revolution. For these \ncontributions to American jurisprudence and our patent system, his \npresence will always be remembered by legislators, lawyers, and judges \nwho reflect on the law that was made by the feisty judge that wasn't \ngoing to stop hearing cases until something forced him to do so.\n  Judge Rich, at one time, told an attentive audience of a verse his \nmother would recite, ``The wise old owl lie in an oak. The more he saw, \nthe less he spoke; the less the spoke the more he heard. Why can't we \nbe more like that old bird?'' The intellectual property community and \nall of us can learn a great deal from the ``old bird,'' Judge Rich. \nJohn Witherspoon, one of Judge Rich's former law clerks, once said \nthat, ``Giles Rich is a Master teacher--by which I mean, he doesn't \nteach at all; those around him simply learn.''\n  Many will miss his presence and the experiences it brought. I send my \ncondolences out to his family, and my gratitude to the man who worked \nso hard to contribute to American jurisprudence and the preservation of \nAmerica's status as a nation of inventors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/27/senate-section/article/S11504-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11504-S11518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n  On September 24, 1999, the Senate amended and passed H.R. 2684, as \nfollows:\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 2684) entitled ``An Act making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \n     Development, and for sundry independent agencies, boards, \n     commissions, corporations, and offices for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2000, and for other purposes.'', do pass \n     with the following amendment\n       Page 2, strike out all after line 9, over to and including \n     line 3 on page 95, and insert:\n\n                TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n                    Veterans Benefits Administration\n\n\n                       Compensation and Pensions\n\n       For the payment of compensation benefits to or on behalf of \n     veterans and a pilot program for disability examinations as \n     authorized by law (38 U.S.C. 107, chapters 11, 13, 18, 51, \n     53, 55, and 61); pension benefits to or on behalf of veterans \n     as authorized by law (38 U.S.C. chapters 15, 51, 53, 55, and \n     61; 92 Stat. 2508); and burial benefits, emergency and other \n     officers' retirement pay, adjusted-service credits and \n     certificates, payment of premiums due on commercial life \n     insurance policies guaranteed under the provisions of Article \n     IV of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, as \n     amended, and for other benefits as authorized by law (38 \n     U.S.C. 107, 1312, 1977, and 2106, chapters 23, 51, 53, 55, \n     and 61; 50 U.S.C.

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) One of the most outrageous examples of the failure of \n     the Federal Government to honor its obligations to veterans \n     involves the so-called ``atomic veterans'', patriotic \n     Americans who were exposed to radiation at Hiroshima and \n     Nagasaki and at nuclear test sites.\n       (2) For more than 50 years, many atomic veterans have been \n     denied veterans compensation for diseases, known as \n     radiogenic diseases, that the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     recognizes as being linked to exposure to radiation. Many of \n     these diseases are lethal forms of cancer.\n       (3) The Department of Veterans Affairs almost invariably \n     denies the claims for compensation of atomic veterans on the \n     grounds that the radiation doses received by such veterans \n     were too low to result in radiogenic disease, even though \n     many scientists and former Under Secretary for Health Kenneth \n     Kizer agree that the dose reconstruction analyses conducted \n     by the Department of Defense are unreliable.\n       (4) Although the Department of Veterans Affairs already has \n     a list of radiogenic diseases that are presumed to be \n     service-connected, the Department omits three diseases--lung \n     cancer, colon cancer, and central nervous system cancer--from \n     that list, notwithstanding the agreement of scientists that \n     the evidence of a link between the three diseases and low-\n     level exposure to radiation is very convincing and, in many \n     cases, is stronger than the evidence of a link between such \n     exposure and other radiogenic diseases currently on that \n     list.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     lung cancer, colon cancer, and brain and central nervous \n     system cancer should be added to the list of radiogenic \n     diseases that are presumed by the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs to be service-connected disabilities.\n\n         TITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT\n\n                       Public and Indian Housing\n\n\n                        Housing Certificate Fund\n\n                     (including transfers of funds)\n\n       For activities and assistance to prevent the involuntary \n     displacement of low-income families, the elderly and the \n     disabled because of the loss of affordable housing stock, \n     expiration of subsidy contracts (other than contracts for \n     which amounts are provided under another heading in this Act) \n     or expiration of use restrictions, or other changes in \n     housing assistance arrangements, and for other purposes, \n     $11,051,135,000, to remain available until expended: \n     Provided, That of the total amount provided under this \n     heading, $10,855,135,000, of which $6,655,135,000 shall be \n     available on October 1, 1999 and $4,200,000,000 shall be \n     available on October 1, 2000, shall be for assistance under \n     the United States Housing Act of 1937 (``The Act'' herein) \n     (42 U.S.C. 1437) for use in connection with expiring or \n     terminating section 8 subsidy contracts, for enhanced \n     vouchers (including renewals) as provided under the \n     ``Preserving Existing Housing Investment'' account in the \n     Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \n     Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, \n     1997 (Public Law 104-204) for families eligible for \n     assistance under such Act, and contracts entered into \n     pursuant to section 441 of the Stewart B.

Sense of the Senate Regarding Aeronautics \n     Research. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Every aircraft worldwide uses and benefits from NASA \n     technology.\n       (2) Aeronautical research has fostered the establishment of \n     a safe, affordable air transportation system that is second \n     to none.\n       (3) Fundamental research in aeronautics is not being \n     supported anywhere in the country outside of NASA.\n       (4) The Department of Transportation predicts that air \n     traffic will triple over the next 20 years, exacerbating \n     current noise and safety problems at already overcrowded \n     airports. New aeronautics advancements need to be developed \n     if costs are to be contained and the safety and quality of \n     our air infrastructure is to be improved.\n       (5) Our military would not dominate the skies without \n     robust investments in aeronautics research and development.\n       (6) Technology transferred from NASA aeronautics research \n     to the commercial sector has created billions of dollars in \n     economic growth.\n\n[[Page S11518]]\n\n       (7) The American aeronautics industry is the top \n     contributor to the United States balance of trade, with a net \n     contribution of more than $41,000,000,000 in 1998.\n       (8) Less than 10 years ago, American airplane producers \n     controlled over 70 percent of the global market for \n     commercial aviation.\n       (9) America's dominance in the world's civil aviation \n     market is being challenged by foreign companies like Airbus, \n     which now has approximately 50 percent of the world's civil \n     aviation market, and is aiming to capture 70 percent.\n       (10) The rise of foreign competition in the global civil \n     aviation market has coincided with decreases in NASA's \n     aeronautics research budget and a corresponding increase in \n     European investment.\n       (11) NASA's aeronautics laboratories have the research \n     facilities, including wind tunnels, and technical expertise \n     to conduct the cutting-edge scientific inquiry needed to \n     advance state-of-the-art military and civil aircraft.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States should increase its commitment to \n     aeronautics research funding.\n       Sec. 433. Underground Storage Tanks. Not later than May 1, \n     2000, in administering the underground storage tank program \n     under subtitle I of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. \n     6991 et seq.), the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency shall develop a plan (including cost \n     estimates)--\n       (1) to identify underground storage tanks that are not in \n     compliance with subtitle I of the Solid Waste Disposal Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 6991 et seq.) (including regulations);\n       (2) to identify underground storage tanks in temporary \n     closure;\n       (3) to determine the ownership of underground storage tanks \n     described in paragraphs (1) and (2);\n       (4) to determine the plans of owners and operators of \n     underground storage tanks described in paragraphs (1) and (2) \n     to bring the underground storage tanks into compliance or out \n     of temporary closure; and\n       (5) in a case in which the owner of an underground storage \n     tank described in paragraph (1) or (2) cannot be identified--\n       (A) to bring the underground storage tank into compliance; \n     or\n       (B) to permanently close the underground storage tank.\n       Sec. 434. The comment period on the proposed rules related \n     to section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act published at 64 \n     Federal Register 46012 and 46058 (August 23, 1999) shall be \n     extended from October 22, 1999, for a period of no less than \n     90 additional calendar days.\n       Sec. 435. Section 4(a) of the Act of August 9, 1950 (16 \n     U.S.C. 777c(a)), is amended in the second sentence by \n     striking ``1999'' and inserting ``2000''.\n       Sec. 436. Promulgation of Stormwater Regulations. (a) \n     Stormwater Regulations.--The Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency shall not promulgate the \n     Phase II stormwater regulations until the Administrator \n     submits to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of \n     the Senate a report containing--\n       (1) an in-depth impact analysis on the effect the final \n     regulations will have on urban, suburban, and rural local \n     governments subject to the regulations, including an estimate \n     of--\n       (A) the costs of complying with the 6 minimum control \n     measures described in the regulations; and\n       (B) the costs resulting from the lowering of the \n     construction threshold from 5 acres to 1 acre;\n       (2) an explanation of the rationale of the Administrator \n     for lowering the construction site threshold from 5 acres to \n     1 acre, including--\n       (A) an explanation, in light of recent court decisions, of \n     why a 1-acre measure is any less arbitrarily determined than \n     a 5-acre measure; and\n       (B) all qualitative information used in determining an acre \n     threshold for a construction site;\n       (3) documentation demonstrating that stormwater runoff is \n     generally a problem in communities with populations of 50,000 \n     to 100,000 (including an explanation of why the coverage of \n     the regulation is based on a census-determined population \n     instead of a water quality threshold); and\n       (4) information that supports the position of the \n     Administrator that the Phase II stormwater program should be \n     administered as part of the National Pollutant Discharge \n     Elimination System under section 402 of the Federal Water \n     Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1342).\n       (b) Phase I Regulations.--No later than 120 days after \n     enactment of this Act, the Environmental Protection Agency \n     shall submit to the Senate Environment and Public Works \n     Committee a report containing a detailed explanation of the \n     impact, if any, that the Phase I program has had in improving \n     water quality in the United States (including a description \n     of specific measures that have been successful and those that \n     have been unsuccessful).\n       (c) Federal Register.--The reports described in subsections \n     (a) and (b) shall be published in the Federal Register for \n     public comment.\n       Sec. 437. Pesticide Tolerance Fees. None of the funds \n     appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act shall be \n     used to promulgate a final regulation to implement changes in \n     the payment of pesticide tolerance processing fees as \n     proposed at 64 Fed. Reg. 31040, or any similar proposals. The \n     Environmental Protection Agency may proceed with the \n     development of such a rule.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Departments of Veterans \n     Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/27/senate-section/article/S11518-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1999\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.
