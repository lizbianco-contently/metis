Mr. President, the Senate, we hope today or perhaps \ntomorrow, will be bringing this session to a close. It has been a \nsession which has involved some historic decisions by the Senate. Of \ncourse, it began with an impeachment trial of the President of the \nUnited States, which ended in a bipartisan decision of the Senate not \nto convict the President. Then, shortly thereafter, we faced a rather \nhistoric challenge in terms of our role in Kosovo. So we went from one \nextreme in the Constitution, involving an impeachment against the \nPresident, to the other extreme, where this Senate had to contemplate \nthe possibility, the very real possibility, of war. That is how our \nsession began, at such a high level with such great challenges.\n  There were so many other challenges that were presented to the Senate \nduring the course of the year. I am sad to report that we addressed \nvery few of them. Things that American families really care about we \ndid not spend enough time on, we did not bring to a conclusion. So, as \nwe return to our homes, States, and communities after this session is \ncompleted and we are confronted by those who are concerned about their \ndaily lives and they ask us, What did you achieve during the course of \nthis session? I am afraid there is very little to which to point.\n  This morning, I received some letters from my home State of Illinois \nfrom senior citizens concerned about the cost of prescription drugs, as \nwell they should be, because not only are these costs skyrocketing, but \nwe find gross disparities between the charges for prescription drugs in \nthe United States and the cost of the very same drugs made by the same \ncompanies if they are sold in Canada or in Europe.\n  In fact, in the northern part of the United States, it is not \nuncommon for many senior citizens to get on a bus and go over the \nborder to Canada to buy their prescription drugs at a deep discount \nfrom what they would pay in the United States. That is difficult for \nseniors to understand; it is difficult for Senators to understand as to \nwhy that same prescription drug should be so cheap if purchased \noverseas and so expensive for American citizens in a country where \nthose pharmaceutical companies reside and do business.\n  The senior citizens have asked us, as well as their families who are \nconcerned about the costs they bear, to do something. Yet this session \ncomes to an end and nothing has been done--nothing has been done--\neither to address the spiraling cost of prescription drugs or to amend \nthe Medicare program and to make prescription drugs part of the \nbenefits.\n  Think about it: In the 1960s, under President Lyndon Johnson when \nMedicare was created, we did not include any provision for paying for \nprescription drugs. We considered it from a Federal point of view as if \nprescription drugs were something similar to cosmetic surgery, just an \noption that one might need or might not need, but certainly something \nthat was not life-threatening.\n  Today, we know we were wrong. In many instances, because of the wide \narray of prescription drugs and the valuable things they can do for \nseniors, we find a lot of our senior citizens dependent on them to \navoid hospitalizations and surgeries and to keep their lives at the \nhighest possible quality level.\n\n[[Page S14841]]\n\n  Last week, I went to East St. Louis, IL, the town where I was born, \nand St. Mary's Hospital and visited a clinic. I walked around and met \ngroups of senior citizens and asked them how much they were paying for \nprescription drugs. The first couple took the prize: $1,000 a month \ncame in from their Social Security; $750 a month went out for \nprescription drugs. Three-fourths of all the money they were bringing \nin from Social Security went right out the window to the pharmacy.\n  There was another lady with about $900 a month in Social Security; \n$400 a month paid in prescription drugs.\n  Another one, about $900 a month in Social Security; $300 a month in \nprescription drugs.\n  The last person we met, though, told another story. He was retired \nfrom a union job he worked at for many years, a tough job, a manual \nlabor job, and he, too, had expensive prescription drugs, but he was \nfortunate. The union plan helped him to pay for them. Out of pocket, he \nputs down $5 to $15 a month and is happy to do it.\n  Think of the contrast between $750 a month and $15 a month. One can \nunderstand why people across America, seniors who want to continue to \nlead active and healthy lives, have turned to Congress and said: \nPlease, learn from the President's lead in the State of the Union \nAddress that we should have a prescription drug benefit.\n  This Senate--this Congress--will go home without even addressing that \nissue. That is sad. It is a reality facing American families. You will \nrecall, as well as I, a few months ago we were all in shock over what \nhappened at Columbine High School with the killing of those innocent \nstudents. This Senate made an effort to keep guns out of the hands of \nchildren and criminals with a very modest bill that said if you were \ngoing to buy a gun at a gun show, we want to know your background.\n  The bill passed. It was sent over to the House of Representatives. \nThe gun lobby got its hands on it, and that was the end of it. End of \ndiscussion.\n\n  As we return home to face parents who say, what have you done to make \nAmerica safer, to make communities, neighborhoods, and schools safer, \nthe honest answer is nothing, nothing.\n  Take a look at campaign finance reform. Senator Feingold of Wisconsin \nis on the floor. He has been a leader on this issue with Senator McCain \nof Arizona. They had a bipartisan effort to clean up this mess of \ncampaign funding in America. Yet when it came to a vote, we could \nmuster 55 votes out of 100 favoring reform, which most people would \nsay: You have a majority; why didn't you win?\n  Under Senate rules, it takes more than a majority. It takes 60 votes. \nWe were five votes short. All of the Democratic Senators supported \ncampaign finance reform, and 10 stalwarts on the Republican side came \nforward. Yet when it was all said and done, nothing was done. We will \nend this session never having addressed campaign finance reform, \nsomething so basic to the future of our democracy.\n  On a Patients' Bill of Rights, there is a term which a few years ago \nAmerican families might not have been able to define. I think they \nunderstand it now. It was an effort on the floor of the Senate to say \nthat families across America and individuals and businesses would get a \nfair shake from their health insurance companies; that life-and-death \ndecisions would be made by doctors and nurses and medical \nprofessionals, not by clerks at insurance companies. It is that basic. \nMr. President, you know as well as I, time and again, a good doctor \nmaking a diagnosis, who wants to go forward with a procedure, first has \nto get on the phone and ask for permission.\n  I can recall a time several years ago in a hospital in downstate \nIllinois where I accompanied a doctor on rounds for a day. I invite my \ncolleagues to do that. It is an eye-opener to see what the life of a \ndoctor is like, but also to understand how it has been changed because \nhealth insurance companies now rule the roost when it comes to making \ndecisions about health care.\n  This poor doctor was trying to take care of his patients and do the \nright thing from a medical point of view, and he spent most of his time \nwhile I was with him on the phone with insurance companies. He would be \nat the nurses' station on a floor of St. John's Hospital in \nSpringfield, IL, begging these insurance companies to allow him to keep \na patient in the hospital over a weekend, a patient he was afraid might \nhave some dangerous consequences if she went home before her surgery--\nher brain surgery--on Monday. Finally, the insurance company just flat \nout said: No, send her home.\n  He said: I cannot do that. In good conscience, she has to stay in the \nhospital, and I will accept the consequences.\n  That is what doctors face. Patients who go to these doctors expecting \nto get the straight answers about their medical condition and medical \ncare find they are involved in a game involving health insurance \ncompanies and clerks with manuals and computers who decide their fate.\n  When we tried to debate that issue on the floor of the Senate, we \nlost. American families lost. The winners were the insurance companies. \nThey came here, a powerful special interest, and they won the day. They \nhad a majority of 100 Members of the Senate on their side, and American \nfamilies lost.\n  Thank goodness that bill went to the other side of the Rotunda. The \nHouse of Representatives was a different story. Sixty-eight Republicans \nbroke from the insurance lobby and voted with the Democrats for the \nPatients' Bill of Rights so that families across America would have a \nchance. But nothing came of it. That was the end of it. The debate in \nthe House was the last thing said; no conference committee, no bill, no \nrelief, no protection for families across America.\n  I will return to Illinois, and my colleagues to their States, unable \nto point to anything specific we have done to help families deal with \nthis vexing problem.\n  The minimum wage debate is another one. Senator Kennedy, who sits to \nmy right, has been a leader in trying to raise the minimum wage 50 \ncents a year for the next 2 years to a level of $6.15. He has been \ntrying to do this for years. He has been stopped for years. We are \nliterally talking about millions of Americans, primarily women, who go \nto work in minimum-wage jobs and try to survive. Many of them are the \nsole bread winners of their families. We will leave this session of the \nCongress--the Senate and the House will go home--and those men and \nwomen will get up and go to work on Monday morning still facing $5.15 \nan hour.\n  In a Congress which could come up with $792 billion for tax breaks \nfor the wealthiest people in America, we cannot find 50 cents for the \nhardest working men and women, who get up every single day and go to \nwork, as people who watch our children in day-care centers, as those \nwho care for our parents and grandparents in nursing homes, as those \npeople who make our beds when we stay in hotels, service our tables \nwhen we go to restaurants. They get up and go to work every single day. \nThis Senate did not go to work to help those people. We could find tax \nbreaks for wealthy people, but when it came to helping those who are \nlargely voiceless in this political process, we did nothing. We will \nreturn home and face the reality of that decision.\n  If there is any positive thing that came of this session, it emerged \nin the last few days. Finally, after an impasse over the budget that \nwent on for month after weary month, the Republican leadership sat down \nat the table with the President. The President insisted on priorities, \nand you have to say, by any measure, he prevailed. And thank goodness \nhe did.\n  Let me tell you some of the things that are achieved in the budget we \nwill vote for. It has its shortcomings--and I will point out a few of \nthem--but it has several highlights.\n  The President's 100,000 COPS Program across America has had a \ndramatic impact in reducing violent crime and making America a safer \nplace to live. There was opposition from Republican leadership to \ncontinue this program. But, finally, the President prevailed, and we \nwill move forward to send more police and community policemen into our \nneighborhoods and schools across America to make them safer. That is \nsomething achieved by the President, in negotiation with congressional \nleaders at the 11th hour and the 59th minute.\n  In the area of education, the President has an initiative at the \nFederal level which makes sense from a parent's point of view. If we \ncan keep the\n\n[[Page S14842]]\n\nclass sizes in the first and second grade smaller--rather than larger--\nteachers have a better chance to connect with a child, to find out if \nthis is a gifted child who has a bright future, or a child who needs \nsome special help with a learning disability, or perhaps a slow learner \nwho needs a little more tutorial assistance to get through the first \nand second grade.\n  You know what happens when those kids do not get that attention? They \nstart feeling frustrated and falling behind, and the next thing you \nknow, it is even a struggle to stay in school, let alone enjoy the \nexperience and learn from it. The President has said: Let's take our \nFederal funds, limited as they are, and focus on an American initiative \nto make class sizes smaller in the first and second grade.\n  I went to Wheaton, IL, and I saw a class like this. Believe me, it \nworks. Don't take my word for it. Ask the administrators at the school, \nwho applied for it, and the teachers who benefit from it. And the \nparents are happy that it is there.\n  The Republican side of the aisle resisted the President's initiative. \nBut thank goodness, in the closing minutes of the negotiations, the \nPresident prevailed. Common sense prevailed. And we will continue this \ninitiative to reduce class size.\n  The way we are paying for some of these things is very suspect; I \nwill be honest with you. We had this long debate during the course of \nthe year about the future of the Social Security trust fund. Some on \nthe Republican side said: We will never touch it. Well, historically we \nhave touched it many times. The money, the excess and surplus in that \nfund that is not needed to pay Social Security recipients has been \nborrowed by President Reagan, President Bush, and President Clinton, \nwith the understanding it would be paid back with interest.\n  Now that we have gotten beyond the deficit era in America, when we \ntalk about surplus, we hope we do not have to borrow from it in the \nfuture. So this year, to avoid directly borrowing from the fund, \nRepublicans argued that they have done some things that are fiscally \nresponsible.\n\n  Let me give one illustration. This budget agreement contains $38 \nbillion for education programs. That is 7 percent, $2.4 billion, more \nthan last year. However, this increase is due to the fact that the \nagreement includes $6.2 billion more in advance appropriations than \nlast year's bill.\n  What is an advance appropriation? You borrow from next year. You do \nnot take your current revenue; you borrow from next year. So in order \nto provide more for education, we borrow from next year.\n  You might assume, then, we are going to have this huge surplus of \nmoney from which we continue to borrow. It is anybody's guess. We pass \na bill, we appropriate the money, but we cannot account for its \nsources.\n  Let me tell you about Head Start.\n  This is a good story. Head Start is a program created by President \nLyndon Johnson in the Great Society. There were people who were critics \nof the President's initiatives, but Head Start has survived because it \nis a great idea. We take kids from lower income and disadvantaged \nfamilies, and bring them into a learning environment at a very early \nage, put them in something similar to a classroom, and give them a \nchance to start learning. And we involve their parents. That is the \ncritical element in Head Start.\n  This budget is going to provide $5.3 billion--the amount requested by \nthe President--to serve an additional 44,000 kids across America, and \nto stay on track to serve 1 million children by the year 2002.\n  Class size reduction, which I have mentioned to you, is one that is \nvery important to all of us. Disadvantaged students--there is $8.7 \nbillion for title I compensatory education programs. That is an \nincrease of $274 million, but it is still short of what the President \nrequested.\n  In special education there is good news. This budget will provide $6 \nbillion, $912 million--or 18 percent--more than the fiscal year 1999 \nappropriations for special ed. In my home State of Illinois, school \ndistricts will receive $227 million, a 62-percent increase since 1997.\n  Keep in mind these school districts, because of a court decision and \nFederal legislation, now bring disabled children and kids with real \nproblems into a learning atmosphere to give them a chance. But it is \nvery labor intensive and very expensive. I am glad to see that this \nbudget will provide more money to those school districts to help pay \nfor those costs.\n  Afterschool programs: We provide $453 million, an increase of $253 \nmillion, to serve an additional 375,000 students in afterschool \nprograms. How important are afterschool programs? Ask your local police \ndepartment. Ask the families who leave their kids at the school door \nearly in the morning, and perhaps do not return home from work until 6 \nor 7 o'clock at night. They have to be concerned about those kids, as \nanyone would be. And the people in the local police department will \ntell you, after school lets out, we often run into problems. So \nafterschool programs give kids something constructive to do after \nschool. I am glad the Federal Government is taking some leadership in \nproviding this.\n  In student aid, the agreement increases maximum Pell grant awards to \ncollege students by $175, from $3,125 to $3,300. Since President \nClinton has taken office, we have seen the Pell grants increase by 43 \npercent.\n  This is an illustration of things that can be done when Congress \nworks together. But we literally waited until the last minute to \nconsider the education bill in the Senate. What is the highest priority \nfor American families was the lowest priority of the Appropriations \nCommittee. When we wait that long, we invite controversy and delay. \nFortunately, it ended well. The President prevailed. These educational \nprograms will be well funded.\n  Let me tell you of a bipartisan success story: The \nNational Institutes of Health. That is one of the best parts of the \nbill that we are going to vote on. It receives a 15-percent increase \nover last year's funding level. The National Institutes of Health \nconducts medical research. Those of us who are in the Senate, those \nserving in the House, are visited every single year by parents with \nchildren who suffer from autism, juvenile diabetes, by people \nrepresenting those who have Alzheimer's disease, cancer, heart disease, \nAIDS. And all of them come with a single, unified message: Please, \nfocus more resources, more money on research, more money on the \nNational Institutes of Health. We increase it this year some 15 \npercent.\n\n  Fortunately, one of the budget gimmicks which would have delayed \ngiving the money to the National Institutes of Health until the last 48 \nhours of the fiscal year was changed dramatically. Because of that \nchange, we do not believe there will be any disadvantage to this \nimportant agency.\n  I will give you an example of the life of a Senator and how this \nagency affects it. A few weeks ago, a family in Peoria, IL, who had a \nlittle boy named Eric with a life-threatening genetic disease called \nPompe's disease, called my office. Their son's only chance to live was \nthrough a clinical trial; in other words, an experimental project at \nDuke University, which was being sponsored by a private company.\n  Unfortunately, there were not any additional slots available for Eric \nin this clinical trial. The company could only manufacture enough of \nthe drug for three patients. Eric would have been the fourth. Eric was \ndenied admission to the trial for this rare disease. Sadly, Eric passed \naway. Pompe's disease is rare. Children like Eric frequently rely on \nthe Government and its sponsored research for cures because a cure for \na rare disease is unlikely to be very profitable for a lot of the \npharmaceutical companies. I am glad to salute Senator Specter, \nRepublican of Pennsylvania; Senator Harkin, my Democratic colleague \nfrom Iowa; and my colleague from Illinois, Congressman John Porter, a \nRepublican. They have made outstanding progress in increasing the money \navailable for the National Institutes of Health in this bill.\n\n  There is money also available for community health centers. We have \ntalked about a lot of things in this Congress, but we don't talk about \nthe 42 million Americans--and that number is growing--who have no \nhealth insurance. Many of these Americans who are not poor enough to \nqualify for Medicaid and not fortunate enough to have a job with health \ninsurance go to community health centers, trying to get\n\n[[Page S14843]]\n\nthe basic health care which all of us expect for our families in this \ngreat Nation. These community health centers serve so many of these \npeople, and they deserve our support. With a 30-year track record of \nproviding quality service to America's most vulnerable, these community \nhealth centers need to have our support.\n  According to congressional testimony by the Health Resources Service \nAdministration, which overseas health center programs, 45 percent of \nthese health centers are at risk financially, 5 to 7 percent close to \nbankruptcy, and 5 to 10 percent in severe financial trouble. Between 60 \nand 70 health center delivery sites already have been forced to close \ntheir doors. Changes in the Medicaid program have cut the compensation \nfor these centers. The Balanced Budget Act, which was good overall, \nmade some cuts that really have resulted in deprivation of funds. An \nadditional $100 million to community health centers would provide \nhealth care to another 350,000 Americans. It can open up 259 new \nclinics. This is something we should do.\n  Let me point to one thing I am particularly proud of in this bill. It \nis an initiative on asthma. I was shocked to learn of the prevalence of \nasthma in America today. I was stunned when I learned it is the No. 1 \ndiagnosis of children who were admitted to emergency rooms across \nAmerica. Asthma is the No. 1 reason for school absenteeism in America. \nWhen I asked my staff to research what we are doing to deal with \nasthma, I found that we did precious little. I started asking my \ncolleagues in the Senate about their concerns over asthma and was \nsurprised to find so many of them who either had asthma themselves or \nhad a member of their family with asthma.\n  They joined in trying to find a new approach, a new initiative that \nwould deal with this problem. Leading that effort was my colleague from \nthe State of Ohio, Senator Mike DeWine. He and I put in an amendment, \nwhich was funded in this bill, to provide $10 million in funding to the \nCenters for Disease Control for childhood asthma programs.\n  What is asthma like? I have never suffered from it, thank God. But \nimagine this illustration: For the next 15 minutes, imagine breathing \nthrough a tiny straw the size of a coffee stir, never getting enough \nair. Now imagine suffering this three to six times a day. That is \nasthma.\n  There have been some innovative things that have been done. In \nSouthern California, Dr. Jones, with the University of Southern \nCalifornia, has started a ``breathmobile'' moving around the areas and \nneighborhoods of highest incidence of asthma, identifying kids with the \nproblem, making sure they receive the right treatment and that their \nparents and teachers know what to do. That is what we have to \nencourage. The $10 million Senator DeWine and I have put in this bill \nfor this type of outreach program for asthma can have dramatic positive \nresults.\n  There is one other thing I will mention. That is a program in which I \nbecame interested in 1992. I went to Detroit, MI, and saw an effort \nthat was underway to provide residential treatment to addicted pregnant \nwomen. I thought it was such a good program, I asked the directors: \nWhere do you get your Federal funds? They said: We don't qualify for \nFederal funds. I went back to Washington and put a demonstration \nproject in place so that we could take addicted mothers across America \nout of their drug-infested neighborhoods, put them in a safe \nenvironment, and try to make certain that the babies they would bear \nwould be free from drug addiction.\n\n  It was a demonstration project, and it worked--1,500 children in 1994 \nin America were born drug free because of this program which we started \nin 1992. We were about to lose it this year. Imagine, we know a drug-\naddicted baby is extremely expensive, let alone, perhaps, a waste of \ngreat potential in human life. I was able to work with Senators Specter \nand Harkin to put $5 million in the bill to expand our current efforts.\n  I say, in closing, there is one area of this bill I find particularly \ntroubling. In a world which now has 6 billion people, in a world where \nwe see the need for family planning and population control to avoid \nserious poverty, to avoid environmental disaster, and to avoid wars, \nthe leadership in the House of Representatives and the Senate has \nturned a blind eye to international family planning. I cannot \nunderstand how this Republican Party--not all of them but many of \nthem--can be so insensitive to the need for international family \nplanning. Every year it is a battle. We have to understand that when \npopulation growth is out of control in underdeveloped countries, it is \na threat to the stability not only of that country, of that region, but \nof the world and the United States.\n  We have to follow the lead of President Clinton and many in Congress \nwho have said U.S. involvement in international family planning is \nabsolutely essential. We hear arguments and see amendments offered \nbecause there are some who want to make this an abortion issue. The sad \nreality is that if a woman in a faraway land does not have the \nwherewithal to plan the size of her family and has an unintended \npregnancy, it increases the likelihood of abortion. So family planning, \nwhen properly used, will reduce the likelihood of these unintended \npregnancies. That is as night follows day, for those who care to even \ntake a look at this policy issue.\n  I am sorry to report that although we are going to finally pay a \nmajor part of our U.N. dues, which has been an embarrassment to many of \nus for so many years while the Republican Congresses have refused to \npay those dues, it was at the price of threatening international family \nplanning programs. The Republican leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives insisted, if we are going to pay our U.N. dues, it has \nto be at the expense of international family planning programs. I think \nthat is extremely shortsighted. I hope the next Congress will have a \nlittle more vision when it comes to family planning, when it comes to \nenacting a treaty, for example, a nuclear test ban treaty. The Senator \nfrom Nebraska, who is now presiding over the Senate, is working with \nSenator Lieberman from Connecticut in an effort to revive that effort \nas well.\n  I hope the next session of Congress will be more productive in that \narea and many others.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nevada yield?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to follow the \nSenator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend from Illinois leaves the \nfloor, I want to direct a few questions to him. I appreciate very much \nthe outline of this congressional session made by my friend from \nIllinois. The Senator from Illinois and I came to the Senate from the \nHouse of Representatives. I feel a great affinity for my friend, not \nonly for the great work he does but because we came as part of the same \nclass. I made a number of notations as he gave his speech.\n  Isn't it about time we updated, revised, modernized Medicare? I say \nthat because it was almost 40 years ago, certainly 35, 36 years ago, \nthat Medicare passed. Almost 40 years ago, 4 decades ago, we didn't \nhave prescription drugs; we didn't have drug therapies that extended \nlives or made life more comfortable for most people.\n  I say to my friend from Illinois, isn't it about time Medicare became \nmodern? Isn't it about time senior citizens have a program where they \ncan get an affordable prescription drug program to keep them alive, to \nkeep them healthy?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator from Nevada. Isn't it ironic \nthat if you bought a hospitalization policy now, as an employee of a \ncompany, you would expect some sort of prescription drug benefit as \npart of it, that goes along with most policies?\n  Medicare does not include that. Seniors find themselves at a distinct \ndisadvantage. Many of the seniors I talked to the other day in East St. \nLouis, IL, had heart problems. Back 35 years ago, we didn't have the \nwide array of potential prescription drugs to deal with blood pressure \nproblems, for example. Now we do. The fact that these prescription \ndrugs are available means longer and better lives for seniors.\n\n[[Page S14844]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Also, while we are talking about prescription drugs, I \noffered an amendment in the Senate, which passed, that said for Federal \nemployees--I tried to broaden it to cover all insurance policies but \nwas unable to do that--health insurance programs, the people who are \nallowed to get prescription drugs should be allowed to get \nprescriptions for contraceptives. The reason is that there are 3.6 \nmillion unintended pregnancies in the United States and almost 50 \npercent of those wind up in abortion.\n  So if people really care about cutting back the number of abortions, \nwe should have prescription drugs available in the form of \ncontraceptives for people. But what the Senator didn't mention is \nhidden in this huge bill is language to lessen the effectiveness of \nthis program. For reasons unknown to anyone, other than a way to \nattempt to help the insurance companies, they have said there is going \nto be a conscience clause for pharmacists. I say to my friend, I \nunderstand there should be a conscience clause for physicians who might \nprescribe these drugs, but does the Senator see any reason why you \nshould weaken this most important piece of legislation in law and have \na so-called conscience clause for pharmacists?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I do not. I agree with the Senator from Nevada that it is \nextremely shortsighted. Perhaps we are striking a moralistic pose when \nwe say we are not going to allow prescriptions for contraception. In \nother words, we will acknowledge all of the other needs a woman may \nhave, but not provide for birth control pills. That seems to me to be \nout of step with what American families expect us to do. Let them make \nthe decision with their doctor. Instead, we are imposing on them what \nmay be viewed by many as a moralistic point of view that should not be \nin our province. This is the first I have heard of this conscience \nclause, where a pharmacist, for example, might refuse to fill a \nprescription for birth control pills. Under this amendment that is \nbeing put in the bill, he or she is not required to do so.\n  Mr. REID. It is in this bill on which we are going to vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think it really stretches credibility to think that a \npharmacist, in this situation, would be allowed to make that decision \nand perhaps disadvantage a woman who may not have easy access to \nanother pharmacy.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has said it all there. Not everybody lives in \nmetropolitan Chicago, where they can go to two or three different \npharmacies within a matter of a few blocks. In some places, there is \nonly one pharmacy.\n  I also say to my friend it seems unusual--while we are talking about \nhealth care--and the Senator did an excellent job in talking about the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We passed a patients' non-bill of rights. We \npassed a bill here that is a bill in name only. If you read the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, the Senator knows it is not a Patients' Bill \nof Rights.\n  It is unusual in this country--and the Senator and I are both \nlawyers, and I know sometimes the legal profession doesn't have the \ngreatest name, unless you need a lawyer. But in our great society, this \ncountry that we admire--and we salute the flag every day--it is \ninteresting that the only two groups of people you can't sue in America \nare foreign diplomats and HMOs.\n  Doesn't the Senator think that should be changed?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree completely with the Senator from Nevada. If we \ndid nothing else but change that to say these health insurance \ncompanies could be held liable in a court of law before a jury of \nAmericans for their decisions on health care, it would have a dramatic \novernight impact on their decisions also. They would think twice about \ndenying a doctor's recommendation for a surgical procedure or a \nhospitalization. They would think twice about delaying these decisions.\n  I have noticed, and I am sure the Senator from Nevada has noticed as \nwell, many times, poor families I represent in Illinois will get into a \nstruggle with an insurance company to try to get help, for example, for \na child with a serious illness or disease, and the struggle goes on for \nmonths; ultimately, the family prevails; but during that period of \ntime, the poor child is suffering and the family is suffering. I think \nthat giving those families across America the right to sue health \ninsurance companies and saying to the health insurance companies that, \nlike every other business in America, you will be held accountable for \nany wrongdoing, is just simple justice. To do otherwise is to suggest \nthat we are going to create some special, privileged class of companies \nand that, literally, the health insurance companies are above the law. \nThat is not America.\n\n  Mr. REID. My friend also knows that with part of the public relations \nmechanisms these giant HMOs have, they are going around saying, well, \nwhat these people in Washington want to do--the Congressmen--is allow \nsuits against your employer. Now, the Senator knows that is fallacious. \nAny litigation that would be directed against the wrongful acts of the \nentity that disallows the treatment has nothing to do with the \nemployer. Does the Senator understand that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is right. The Senator probably saw the survey that \nthere are people against giving families the right to hold health \ninsurance companies accountable in court, and they say, well, if you \nwork for an employer who provides health insurance, those families may \nturn around and sue the employer, as opposed to the health insurance \ncompany. So we looked at that and did a survey; we investigated. We \nfound out that only in a very rare situation has that occurred. Here is \nan example.\n  In one circumstance, the employer collected the health insurance \npremiums from the employee and then didn't pay the health insurance \ncompany. So when the family tried to get coverage for medical care, the \nnext thing that occurred was they found out the premiums had not been \npaid by the employer. That was the only example we could find. But if \nthe employer picks a health insurance company and they make a decision, \nwe could not find a single case where the employer was held liable \nbecause of the health insurance company's bad medical decision.\n  So that, I think, is a red herring, one that really does a disservice \nto American families who deserve this right.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator also gave an example of one of his constituents \nin Illinois whose child has Pompe's disease, who, as we speak, is not \nreceiving treatment for that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The child has passed away.\n  Mr. REID. He wanted to participate in what is called a clinical \ntrial. Is the Senator aware that HMOs almost universally deny the \nability of their enrollees to participate in clinical trials?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes. Frankly, during the course of the debate here, the \nSenator can remember that when they referred to reputable medical \nleaders in the United States, such as Sloan Kettering--which is a great \ninstitution when it comes to cancer treatment and research and is \nrespected around the world--they said, after their survey, that \nclinical trials really open the door for new treatments and therapies \nthat, frankly, save us money. They found better and more efficient ways \nto keep people healthy. Meanwhile, the health insurance companies won't \npay for them, and we are literally stopped in our tracks from moving \nforward with this kind of medical research and clinical trials.\n  In this case, with this little boy, Eric, who passed away from this \ndisease, he was closed out of a clinical trial. Would he have survived \nwith it? I am not sure, but because of the health insurance company, he \nnever got a chance.\n  Mr. REID. On the floor today, right next to the Senator, is the \nSenator from Minnesota, who has been a leader in Congress fighting for \nthe rights of those people who are disadvantaged because of mental \ndisease. Well, there was a big fanfare a week or two ago about some big \nhealth entity in the Midwest that had decided they were going to let \ndoctors make the decision, rather than checking them out. They looked \non their accounting and found they could spend a lot of money trying to \ndirect care. They said what they are going to do now is let doctors \nmake the decision. What they didn't tell us is that this would not \napply to people who had mental disease, who had emotional problems. Is \nthe Senator aware of that?\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am aware of it. I salute the Senator from Minnesota, my\n\n[[Page S14845]]\n\nfriend, Senator Paul Wellstone, and our colleague, Senator Domenici \nfrom New Mexico, for their leadership on this issue. It is a classic \nillustration of another problem facing American families which this \nCongress has refused to address. The problem is very straightforward.\n  An internist from Springfield, IL, came to see me and said, \n``Senator, I am literally afraid to put in a patient's record that I am \ngiving them medication for depression because the insurance company \nwill then label them as `victims of chronic depression,' a mental \nillness, and discriminate against them when it comes to future health \ninsurance coverage.''\n  That is outrageous. Mental illness is an illness, it is not a moral \nshortcoming. These people can and deserve to receive the very best \ncare. Unless and until the Senator from Minnesota and others of like \nmind prevail in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, we will \ncontinue to discriminate against the victims of mental illness. That is \nsomething this Congress can do something about. We will leave here \ntoday or tomorrow, again, with that unfinished item on the agenda.\n  Mr. REID. I also say to my friend that we were here last year \nwrapping up the congressional session. Is the Senator aware that since \nthat time we have had 1\\1/2\\ million new people in America added to the \nuninsured rolls?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The list grows. The Senator from Nevada knows as well as \nI do that unless and until we face the reality that every American \ncitizen and every American family deserves the peace of mind of health \ninsurance coverage, you will continue to see employers deciding not to \noffer health insurance protection, and working, lower income people in \nAmerica will be without the protection of either Medicaid or health \ninsurance at work. These people get sick as other people do. When they \npresent themselves to hospitals, they receive charity treatment which \nis paid for by everyone, instead of receiving quality health care from \nthe start. Preventive care can avoid serious illness.\n  Again, it is an issue that this Congress has refused to address.\n  Mr. REID. I wanted to say this--the Senator has said it, but I want \nto underline it and make it more graphic. The Senator who is on the \nfloor is the leader for the Democrats. I am the whip for the Democrats. \nWe spend a lot of time here on the floor. Have we missed something? Has \nthe Senator heard any debate dealing with the uninsured in this \ncountry?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No. We haven't missed it, as the Senator from Nevada \nknows very well. This is the third rail for a lot of politicians around \nhere because you have to start to talk about things that cost a lot of \nmoney. Doing nothing costs a lot more money. People get ill, they have \nto go to the doctor, and to the hospital. When they need to have \nserious treatment, or hospitalization, that is very expensive, too.\n  It strikes me that those of us who sought this office to serve in the \nSenate or the House of Representatives did not do it just to collect a \npaycheck and accumulate years toward a pension but to do something to \nhelp families across this country. This is the No. 1 concern of \nfamilies across the country.\n  If you have a child reaching the age of 23, and all of a sudden it \ndawns on you: Where is my daughter going to get her health insurance? I \ncan't bring her under my policy. You start thinking. I am sure the \nSenator from Nevada has. I have. As a parent, every day I call my \ndaughter in Chicago, who is an art student, and an artist, and say, \n``Jennifer, are you insured this month?'' ``Yes, dad.'' But I have to \nask the question because health insurance is not automatic.\n  This Congress has done little, if anything, to help families across \nAmerica who struggle with this every single day--not to mention those \nwith preexisting conditions. If you have a preexisting condition and it \nis a serious one, and you have to change insurers, good luck. Most \npeople find themselves being discriminated against.\n  I agree with the Senator from Nevada. We have been here day in and \nday out, and I have heard literally nothing suggested by the Republican \nleadership to deal with this.\n  Mr. REID. At the beginning of our August break, I traveled back to \nNevada with my wife. As we flew home, my wife became very sick. We got \noff the airplane and went immediately to the Sunrise Hospital emergency \nroom. As we walked in that room--she was wheeled into the room--there \nwere lots of people. It was very crowded. We were probably among the 10 \npercent of the fortunate ones in that room; we had insurance to cover \nmy wife's illness. She was there for 18 days. Ninety percent of the \npeople there had no health insurance of any kind. They were there \nbecause they had no place else to go.\n  Those uninsured people get care. The most expensive kind of care you \ncan get anyplace is in an emergency room. Who pays for that? You and I \npay for it. Everybody in America pays for it in the form of higher \ntaxes for indigent care--higher insurance premiums, higher insurance \npolicies, and higher hospital and doctor bills. We all pay for it \nanyway.\n\n  But we don't have the direction from the majority here to have a \ndebate on what we are going to do with the rapidly rising number of \npeople with no health insurance.\n  Next year, we are going to probably have 2 million more. It is going \nup every year. We have 45 million people--actually 44 million people \nnow--who have no health insurance. Next year, it will be close to 46 \nmillion people. Will the Senator agree with me that it is somewhat \nembarrassing for this great, rich country, the only superpower in the \nworld, that 44 million people will have no health insurance?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is an embarrassment, and it is sad. We have spent more \ntime this morning on the floor of the Senate talking about providing \nhealth insurance to the uninsured than we have spent in the entire \nsession this year debating any proposals to deal with the problem.\n  I would say to my friends on the Republican side of the aisle that if \nyou have an idea, or a concept, or a piece of legislation, come forward \nwith it. Let us put our best proposal on the table. That is what the \nSenate is supposed to be about. It is supposed to be a contest of \nideas, and the hope that when it is all said and done, the American \npeople will prosper because we will come out with something that \nimproves the quality of their lives. This year we have not.\n  Mr. REID. I want the Senator, also, to react to this. If we passed \nall of the programs the Republicans have talked about, the majority has \ntalked about, on rare occasions--medical savings accounts, tax breaks \nfor employers, and insurance--does the Senator realize that would cover \nless than 5 million of the 45 million people?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Nevada is right. We overlook the \nnumbers. The numbers are important. It is good to do something \nsymbolic, but it doesn't solve the problem. We know the problem grows, \nas the Senator from Nevada has indicated, by 1 or 2 million a year--\nmore people without health insurance coverage, more people who are \nvulnerable, and a Congress which has a tin ear when it comes to this \nissue.\n  We look at the Time magazine polls where it talks about the concern \nof the American people about health care. It doesn't get through to the \nleadership in Congress, and we will leave this year having done nothing \nto make it better.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator made an outstanding statement relating to guns, \njuvenile justice, kids getting killed, and people getting killed. So \nthat those people within the sound of our voice understand what we are \ntalking about, we are talking about people who purchase a gun shouldn't \nbe crazies or a criminal. Isn't that what we are saying?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is very basic. That is it.\n  Mr. REID. We are saying that we believe the legislation we passed, \nwith the Democrats voting for it and a few Republicans, basically said \nthat under this law if you are mentally deranged, a criminal, or a \nfelon, you shouldn't be able to buy a gun. It should apply to \npawnshops, and it should apply to gun shows. Is that what the \nlegislation we passed said, and we can't even get to conference on it?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is what it came down to. Those who would argue that \ngun control legislation and Capitol Hill want to take your gun away, \nthat is not the case at all. What it is all about here is to say if you \nwant to purchase a gun in America, whether it is from a licensed \ndealer, a pawnshop, or a gun show, we want to know a little about you. \nAre you a stable person? Do you\n\n[[Page S14846]]\n\nhave a criminal record? If the answer is yes to either of those, if you \nare unstable, or you have a criminal record, then we will deny you the \nright to own a gun. Who can argue with that? A person who may in a weak \nmoment do something to hurt an innocent person shouldn't be given \nadvantage or given an opportunity by the purchase of a firearm.\n\n  We passed that when Vice President Gore came to the floor and cast a \ndeciding vote just a few weeks after Columbine. And that issue died \nover in the U.S. House of Representatives when the gun lobby came \nthrough and said that is an outrageous suggestion--that you would keep \nguns out of the hands of kids and criminals.\n  I think American families see this a lot differently. I am hoping \nthat when Members of the Senate who voted with the gun lobby go home, \nthey will hear the other side of the story.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator also mentioned something we have not done--\ncampaign finance reform. I would like the Senator to reflect a minute \non how many people live in the State of Illinois, approximately.\n  Mr. DURBIN. About 12 million.\n  Mr. REID. In the State of Nevada, we have at least 2 million. But yet \nin a Senate race a little over a year ago in the State of Nevada, Harry \nReid and his opponent spent $20 million; that is, between the State \nparty moneys, our own money, $20 million. That doesn't count \nindependent expenditures by people who come from someplace and are \nspending money. You don't know who they are, and where they are from--\nanother probably $3 million. So in a small State of Nevada, about $23 \nmillion.\n  Does that sound a little excessive to the Senator from Illinois?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is more than a little excessive. It is outrageous. In \nIllinois, of course, we are faced with similar demands. If you want to \nbuy television time, you have to raise money. If you can't write a \npersonal check for it, you have to go out and beg for it.\n  Members of the Senate and House of Representatives who spend their \ntime on the telephone begging for money from individuals and special \ninterest groups are not using their time to represent people in \nCongress. They are, frankly, unfortunately bringing an element into \nthis political process that is not positive. And the voters know this.\n  Interestingly enough, since 1960, we have seen a dramatic increase in \nspending on Presidential election campaigns, for example. And we have \nseen a dramatic decline in voter turnout and the number of people who \nparticipate. Voters have decided to vote with their feet and stay home. \nThey are sick of the negative advertising. They are sick of the special \ninterest groups. They are sick of the fundraising involved in this. And \nthey are sick of the process. In a democracy, you can't stand that very \nlong because if democracy is going to work, people have to be involved \nin it. And that means cleaning up our acts. When Senators Feingold and \nMcCain came forward with campaign finance reform, 55 Senators--45 \nDemocrats, 10 Republicans--said we agree, at least with respect to \neliminating soft money. We should go forward with reform.\n\n  The Senator from Nevada, though, points to another problem: Even \neliminating soft money will not eliminate the expense of campaigns, \nuntil we find a way to put legitimate candidates on the television \nwithout the extreme costs they run into now.\n  (Mr. BROWNBACK assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. REID. Let me say to my friend from Illinois to show how the \nsystem has frayed, I was interviewed in Washington by a Reno TV station \nfor a half hour interview. During the interview, they said: How do you \nfeel about the present Senate race? The person I had the good fortune \nof being able to beat is running again for the Senate; Senator Bryan is \nnot running for reelection. I said nice things about my opponent. I \nsaid I have known him; he is a nice man; I have known his family, and \nthey always supported me. I said nice things about my opponent and I \nsaid nice things about the person who is going to be the Democratic \nnominee.\n  The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee issues a press release \nthey poured out to Nevada saying, ``Reid endorses Ensign,'' because I \nsaid something nice about my former opponent. They stooped to the level \nof saying, Reid endorses John Ensign.\n  I like John Ensign; he is a nice man.\n  The system has gotten so callous. After this came out, a radio talk \nshow host called me and said, I am a Republican but I want you to know \nI think what the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee did is \ndespicable. I think it is, too. We now are suspect because we say \nsomething nice about somebody who is running for office. Shouldn't it \nall be nice? We should be in a contest where we can determine who will \nbe the best for the State of Nevada, the State of Illinois, the State \nof Minnesota--not the worst.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator from Nevada. He came to \nCongress, as I did, in 1983. There has been a dramatic and palpable \nchange in the atmosphere on Capitol Hill in that period of time. I know \nhe can remember in the early days when there was real civility between \nthe political parties and real dialogue and parties at night. We went \nto dinner together even if we fought like cats and dogs on an issue on \nthe floor.\n  That has changed. The well has been poisoned by the obsession with \nnegative politics. I think that is one of the reasons the American \npeople are checking out. They said if that is the best that can be \ndone, you professionals in the business, we would just as soon stay \nhome and watch professional wrestling. Occasionally professional \nwrestlers are involved in politics. The point they make is they don't \napprove of what is happening as we sink to lower and lower depths in \nthe Democratic or Republican campaigns.\n  I agree with the Senator from Nevada. If one can't say something \nhonest and complimentary about someone across the aisle without another \nperson looking for a political advantage, that is a sorry commentary on \nthe state of political affairs in America.\n  Mr. REID. I very much appreciate the Senator's statement on \neducation. The Senator talked about how important it is to have \nadditional teachers in America to reduce class sizes.\n  My daughter is a second grade teacher. She said she can tell within \nthe first few days with these little kids who the smart ones are and \nthose who are not so smart. The problem is classes are so big, what can \nbe done about those in between, the average kid? Most people are \naverage. What happens to the average kids? Many times they are lost in \nour present system.\n  No matter how teachers struggle, work long hours, and prepare their \nlessons, they don't have time to do it all because the classes are too \nbig. What we have been able to do as a result of the President hanging \nin there is get more teachers to reduce class size. That is a positive \nstep.\n\n  One thing the Senator didn't mention, and I know we have spoken about \nit, is the problem we are having in America with high school dropouts. \nEvery day we have about 3,000 children drop out of high school, half a \nmillion a year. We have no specific programs to address that. The \nSenator from New Mexico and I have introduced legislation two \nsuccessive years. Last year, it passed; it was killed in the House when \nthe Gingrich Congress killed it. It would have set up within the \nDepartment of Education a dropout czar who would have been able to work \non programs that have been successful in other parts of the country \nand, in effect, give challenge grants to local school districts--they \nwould still control the programs, of course--giving them guidance and \ndirection in keeping kids in school.\n  This year on a strictly partisan vote the majority killed the \nBingaman-Reid amendment.\n  Would the Senator acknowledge the fact we have to do something about \nhigh school dropouts, we need to do something to keep kids in school?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Nevada knows that is the source of many \nproblems. At juvenile justice facilities across America, whether in the \ncourts or in the correctional system, we will generally find the kids \nwho are there dropped out of high school. Having dropped out, with time \non their hands and no skills to get a job, many of them veered toward \ndrugs and crime and a life that is not productive.\n  We end up paying for that over and over and over and over again. The \nold saying about an ounce of prevention is true. The Senator from \nNevada has been a leader on this, telling the Nation we have to look at \nhigh school\n\n[[Page S14847]]\n\ndropouts not just as a sad reality but as a challenge to all to do \nbetter.\n  I look at some of the things I have learned recently about the \nAmerican workforce. When I visited Dell Computer in Austin, TX, last \nweek and talked to their officers and leaders in their company, they \nsaid they hired some 6,000 people in the previous 3 months to work for \nDell Computer in Austin and Nashville, TN. I find their complaint or \nrequest similar to those I have heard in Illinois. We can't find enough \nskilled workers. That says to me that our educational system has to be \nbetter, it can't let any child fall behind and be forgotten. We have to \naddress dropouts. We have to address skilled training. We have to \naddress the kind of educational reform that goes way beyond the \nquestion about who wears a uniform to school and who doesn't. But we \nhaven't done it in this Congress.\n  I am glad the Senator from Nevada has been a leader on this issue of \ndropout.\n  Mr. REID. If for no other statistics, we should look at the \npenitentiaries and jails in America. Eighty-three percent of the people \nsentenced for crimes in America today are high school dropouts, 83 \npercent. That says it all as far as I am concerned as to why we need to \ndo something about dropouts.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, Judge Rick Solum from Minnesota told \nme--and I have to have this confirmed; it is dramatically jarring--\nthere is actually a higher correlation between high school dropout and \nincarceration than between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. It is \nquite predictable.\n  The Senator from Nevada was talking about his daughter's experience \nas a second grade teacher. In many ways we harp on the complexity of it \nall to the point it becomes the ultimate copout, but a lot of these \nkids by kindergarten are way behind. There is a learning gap and they \nfall further behind and then they drop out of school and wind up all \ntoo often in prison.\n  It does seem to me this is a full agenda that we barely touched.\n  Sorry to interrupt. I am enjoying listening to the discussion.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate hearing from the professor.\n  I want to talk with my friend from Illinois about Social Security. \nThe Senator mentioned Social Security. One of the things that puts a \nsmile on my face is when I hear the majority talking about having saved \nSocial Security. If that doesn't put a smile on your face, nothing \nwould because the Senator will recall a few years ago here in the \nCongress we were debating something called the constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget. As the Senator will recall, I offered the first \namendment to say, fine, we want a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget; let's exclude the Social Security trust fund from the \nbalancing.\n  The Senator is aware they defeated that because they wanted to have \ntheir calculations applying the vast surplus that we have had the last \nseveral years with our Social Security fund, they wanted to apply that \nto balance the budget.\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I remember that debate. Frankly, I think that was really \nthe critical debate, when it came to the future of that amendment and \nwhen the Republican majority rejected our attempts to protect the \nSocial Security trust fund in the balanced budget amendment debate. \nThat was the end of the debate. As I recall, that amendment lost by one \nor two votes at the most. I voted against it. I think the Senator from \nNevada did as well. If it was not going to protect Social Security, \nthen we should not go forward with it.\n  As I reflect on it, it is a little over 2\\1/2\\ years ago that the \nbattle cry on Capitol Hill was: The deficits, the balanced budget \namendment, let the courts step in and have Congress stop spending; that \nwas our only hope. Now we are in the era of surpluses. We have changed \nso dramatically without that constitutional amendment.\n  The Senator from Nevada recalls accurately the Social Security trust \nfund was a viable issue at that point.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator was also part of this Congress when, in 1993, \nwithout a single Republican vote, we passed the budget to address the \ndeficit. It passed. We had to have the Vice President come down and \nbreak the tie. The Senator recalls at that time clearly, we had \ndeficits of about $300 billion a year. Since then, we now have \nsurpluses. We have done very well with low inflation, low \nunemployment--40-year employment highs in that regard. We have created \nabout 20 million new jobs. We have about 350,000 fewer Federal \nemployees than we had then. We have a Federal Government about the same \nsize as when President Kennedy was President.\n  We could go on with other things that happened as a result of the \nhard vote we cast, without a single vote from the Republicans. Does the \nSenator remember that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was in the House of Representatives and cast a vote in \nfavor of the President's program. I can tell you, literally, there were \nDemocratic Members of the House of Representatives who lost in the next \nelection, in 1994, because of that vote they cast. It was a really \ncourageous effort on their part. It was exploited by those who said \nthey were going to somehow destroy the economy and raise taxes across \nAmerica. Yet look at what has happened. From 1993 to the current day, \nwe have seen the Dow Jones index go from 3,500 to over 11,000, and all \nthe things the Senator from Nevada has alluded to.\n  So that decision by President Clinton, supported exclusively by \nDemocrats on Capitol Hill, had a very positive impact on America and \nits future. We have gone through one of the longest and strongest \neconomic growth periods in our history. I think it relates back \ndirectly to that 1993 vote.\n  I can recall a number of my colleagues--Congresswoman Mezvinsky, a \nnew Congresswoman from Pennsylvania who only served one term because \nshe had the courage to cast that vote. If she had not, America might \nhave gone on a different course than we have seen recently.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize to my friend from Minnesota. I want to end by \nasking one final group of questions to the Senator from Illinois.\n  We are here in kind of a celebratory fashion. We are going to \ncomplete this bill tonight, unless certain Members of the Senate keep \nour staff in all night long. Otherwise, we will finish it very quickly.\n  Does the Senator understand getting to this point has been really \ndifficult and we, the minority, have had to hang very tough?\n\n  Remember, in an effort to get where we are, there have been a number \nof ways the majority has attempted to get to this point. You remember \nthe Wall Street Journal article where they talked about the two sets of \nbooks the Republicans were keeping? They would, for certain things, go \nwith the Office of Management and Budget and for certain things go with \nthe Congressional Budget Office. Does the Senator remember that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. You can't keep two sets of books. The Senator recalls that \ndidn't work. Does the Senator remember that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator also remember they came up with this \ningenious idea that they would add a month to the calendar? Does the \nSenator remember that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is right, 13 months.\n  Mr. REID. I remember the Senator from Illinois saying that is a great \nidea because we can just keep adding months to the year and we will \nnever have a Y2K problem.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. That was something also where we said: That is not fair, we \nare not going to do it. That didn't work.\n  Does the Senator also recall when they decided, with the earned-\nincome tax credit, the program that President Reagan said was the best \nwelfare program in the history of the country, where you would give the \nworking poor tax incentives to keep working--does the Senator recall \nthey wanted to withhold parts of those moneys to the poor in an effort \nto balance the budget?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I remember there was a certain Governor from Texas who \nadmonished the Republican Members in the House and Senate, the House in \nparticular, for their insensitivity. He said you should not balance the \nbudget\n\n[[Page S14848]]\n\non the backs of working people, and that was about the time they \nabandoned that particular gimmick.\n  Mr. REID. Then there was the across-the-board cut. Does the Senator \nunderstand when they were doing that, and it was decided to do all \nthese things, they did it without the offsets that would take an \nacross-the-board cut of 7 or 8 percent, but now they are declaring a \nvictory because they got an across-the-board cut--except the President \ncan decide what is going to be cut--of .37 percent? Does the Senator \nfrom Illinois understand that crying victory over having a .3-percent \nacross-the-board cut where the President can decide what would be cut \nis not something they should be crowing about victoriously?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is a face-saving gesture on their part. Once we got \ninto the budget negotiations and the Republican leadership was faced \nwith actually saying, no, we won't add additional teachers, we will not \nhave additional cops on the beat to address the crime problem across \nAmerica, they could not do it. They ended up saying we actually won \nbecause we got this so-called across-the-board cut of .37 percent.\n  I might say to the Senator from Nevada, as he well knows, this is \nentirely within the discretion of the President, so it is not across \nthe board. He can decide which areas of Federal spending to reduce to \nreach this target.\n  Mr. REID. I have enjoyed very much visiting with my friend from \nIllinois. As the session is drawing to a close, I want to express \nappreciation, on behalf of all the Democratic Senators, for the Senator \nbeing our floor leader. He has done an outstanding job. He has been \nhere. He has been able to express himself very well, as we all know he \ncan. I want to personally tell him how much I appreciate it. And on \nbehalf of the Democratic Senators, for all of them, I tell the Senator \nhow much we appreciate every word he has spoken, everything he has \ndone, and I will make sure the majority keeps their ear to what the \nSenator from Illinois is saying. He has done extremely well in \nexpressing what I believe are the views of the majority of the American \npeople.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. It could not have been done without \nSenator Daschle and Senator Reid and the leadership of my colleagues \nwho have joined me. I also say it could not have been done without \nhaving such good, strong issues the American people support, that we \ncan come talk about on the floor each day, pointing out that in this \nsession of Congress they have not been addressed.\n  I thank the Senator for his kind words.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S14848-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14848-S14849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE LACK OF SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, there are other \ncolleagues on the floor. I have waited for some time. I think it has \nbeen an important discussion, but I am going to try, since there are \nother Senators on the floor, to abbreviate my remarks. I actually could \nspeak for 3 or 4 or 5 hours right now. I will not. We will see when we \nare going to finish up today.\n  I would like to build on a little bit of the discussion I just heard, \nand then I would like to go to the issue at hand, which is the \nextension of the Northeast Dairy Compact, the way this was done, the \nimpact on my State of Minnesota, and why we have been fighting this \nout.\n  First of all, I also thank Senator Durbin for his very strong voice \non the floor of the Senate. I say to Senator Reid from Nevada, \nsometimes we come out here and compliment each other to the point it \nbecomes so flowery, people are not sure whether it is sincere or not. I \nbelieve it is sincere. Senator Reid is a good example of somebody in \npolitics who, if he suffers from anything, it is modesty. He rarely \ntakes credit. He really has done some tremendous work in the mental \nhealth field. He has probably done more than anybody in the Senate to \nget us to focus on the problem of depression. He never takes the \ncredit. He should have included himself in this discussion.\n  I am talking about Senator Reid.\n  Mr. President, I am not sure how exactly to view this overall omnibus \nconference report we now have before us. I am a little worried about \nsounding so negative that it will seem I only come to the floor to be \nnegative. I do not. I think some of what my colleagues have talked \nabout--given the framework we were working within and given where we \nstarted, I think there are some things people can feel good about.\n  I am pleased to give the administration and Democrats some credit for \nat least being able to get some resources for some areas of priorities, \nsuch as more teachers and schools and moving toward smaller class size. \nIt was a fix. I know for the State of Minnesota, and I am sure for many \nStates, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the cuts in Medicare \nreimbursement had, no pun intended, catastrophic consequences, \nespecially for our rural hospitals, some of the nursing homes, home-\nbased health care, and teaching hospitals. At least we were able to \nmake a difference for a couple of years, though, again, it is \ntemporary.\n  I feel pretty good about some investment of resources that are going \nto be helpful to people in Minnesota. If I had to pick out one \npriority, it would be $14 million for the Fon du Lac School, a pretty \nimportant commitment of resources. I count as one of the best days as a \nSenator the day I visited Fon du Lac School. It is a pretty horrendous \nfacility, and for years I have been trying to get some money to build a \nnew school for kids in the Indian community.\n  It is interesting, just this past week I was there, and at the end of \nthe discussion I said to the students: I have to leave in 30 seconds, \nand I am sorry we are finishing. Can any of you talk about one thing \nyou care more about than anything else?\n  This one student who is age 15 said: The thing I think the most about \nis I would like for the children--I viewed him as a child at age 15--I \nwould like the children to live a better life than we have been able to \nlive, and I would like to live a life that will help kids do better.\n  I said to this student: That was the most beautiful, powerful thing I \nheard said in any school I have visited, and I have been in a school \nevery 2 weeks for the last 9, 9\\1/2\\ years I have been in the Senate.\n  I tend to come down more on the side of the editorial debate of the \nWashington Post. I do not think this Congress has much to be proud of \nat all. Part of what has happened is we have been engaged in a lot of \nmutual self-deception. I came out to the floor quite a while ago on an \namendment dealing with veterans' health care. I said it was a \ndeliberate effort to bust the budget caps.\n  The ways in which we have been talking about ``not raiding the Social \nSecurity surplus'' has been ridiculous. President Clinton started to do \nit. Tom DeLay has done it. We have put ourselves in a straitjacket. We \nknow that is not what it is about, but it is great political \nsloganeering.\n  For Republicans who do not believe, when it comes to the most \ncritical issues of people's lives, there is nothing the Government can \nor should do, then I think you are consistent and I respect your point \nof view, for those Republicans who take that position, and this is not \na problem. But for Democrats and other Republicans who believe there \nare certain decisive areas of life in America, such as investment in \nchildren and education and opportunities for children, decent health \ncare coverage, environmental protection, making sure we have some \nsupport for the most vulnerable citizens in the Congress, whether it be \ncongregate dining or Meals on Wheels or affordable child care or, for \nGod's sake, making sure children are not hungry in America, I do not \nthink we have much to be proud of because we have done precious little.\n  As a matter of fact, I say to my colleagues on our side of the aisle, \nif you were to take the ``non-Social Security surplus,'' 75 percent of \nit because of cuts in the budget caps of 2 years ago in a lot of these \nareas we say we care the most about, in real dollar terms we are still \nnot spending as much as we spent several years ago.\n\n  I do not think we have all that much to be proud of and we have to do \na lot better. I said at the beginning I would talk about some positive \nthings. I do not want to come out here appearing to\n\n[[Page S14849]]\n\nbe shrill. I do think, unfortunately, this is a pretty rigorous \nanalysis.\n  We did not pass campaign finance reform. That is the core issue. That \nis the core issue, the core problem. We did not pass patient protection \nlegislation. We have done precious little to deal with the reality of \n44 million people without any health insurance coverage and many other \npeople having health insurance coverage but being underinsured.\n  Under title I--I saw this listed as one of our victories--we are \nfunding about one-third of the kids who are eligible to be helped. \nThese are some of our most vulnerable children in America, to the point \nwhere in Minnesota, in St. Paul, after you reach the threshold of a \nschool that has 65 percent low-income population, there is no money for \nany other schools. It is about a $16 billion shortfall, and we have \nincreased spending by $75 million.\n  We have done hardly anything for affordable child care. We did not \ninclude prescription drug coverage as a part of Medicare. On a whole \nhost of amendments I have worked on as a Senator, almost all of them \nwere eliminated in conference committee; whether it be at least some \nsupport for kids who witness violence in their homes or trying to deal \nwith the problem of exploitation of women in international sex \ntrafficking or juvenile justice mental health services or having an \nhonest policy evaluation of what the welfare ``reform'' is doing around \nthe country or increasing some funding--I mean real funding, a real \nincrease of funding--for Meals on Wheels or congregate dining or social \nservices support.\n  If you look at it from the point of view of how at least I think we \ncan make life better for others--I am not going to speak for others--I \nthink this has been a do-nothing Congress, I really do.\n  I will make one other point before I talk about this dairy compact, \nand it is this: I am hearing so much discussion about testing. George \nW. is talking about testing third graders, and if they do not pass \nthose tests, they do not go on to fourth grade. It is high-stakes \ntesting, and by the way, I will have an amendment next year to the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act which makes sure we do not start \ntesting at that young of an age.\n  Here is the point. Jonathan Kozol wrote a book ``Savage \nInequalities,'' in which he points out--and all of us know this about \nour States--some school districts have the best technology, a beautiful \nbuilding, recruit the best teachers, have the best lab facilities, the \nbest textbooks, and other schools have none of that. We do not do \nanything to change that.\n  I cite a second bit of evidence. We have all these reports and \nstudies, irrefutable evidence that if you do not get it right for \nchildren by kindergarten, many of them come to school way behind and \nthey fall further behind and then they drop out. This is critically \nimportant, and we invest hardly anything in affordable child care.\n  Third, we do not do anything about the concerns and circumstances of \nchildren's lives in New York City or Minneapolis-St. Paul or rural \nAitkin County or rural anywhere or inner-suburban anywhere in the \ncountry before they go to school and when they go home, whether it be \nthe violence in the homes, or the children who see the violence or the \nviolence in the communities or children who come to school hungry or \nchildren who come to school with an abscess because they do not have \ndental care. It is not very easy for children to do well in school \nunder these conditions. We do not do hardly anything to change any of \nthose conditions for children's lives in America so that we can truly \nlive up to the idea of equal opportunity for every child.\n\n  But we are going to flunk them. We are going to fail them. We are \ngoing to give them standardized tests and fail them. We already know \nwhich kids are going to do well and which kids are not. I would argue \nit is cowardly. I would argue it is a great political slogan, but it is \ncowardly. There is a difference between testing and standardized--we \nshould have accountability, but there are different ways of testing.\n  If you cannot prove you are giving every child the same opportunity \nto achieve and do well in the test, what are you doing giving these \nkids these standardized tests and flunking them and not letting them go \non to the next grade?\n  We have done so little when it comes to good health care for every \ncitizen, equal opportunity for every child, jobs at decent wages, and \ngetting money out of politics and bringing people back into politics \nand speaking to the economic pain that exists among citizens in our \ncountry.\n  I start with agriculture. I am from an agricultural State. We have a \nfailed farm policy that is driving family farmers off the land. We have \nnot done a thing about the price crisis. We have had another bailout. \nWe have some money for people so they can live to farm another day, but \nwe have not changed a thing when it comes to farmers being able to get \na decent price. We have not changed a thing when it comes to all the \nconcentration of power in agriculture and in the media and in banking \nand in energy and in health insurance companies. We do not want to take \non these big conglomerates. We do not want to talk about antitrust \naction.\n  So I argue that at the macrolevel this has been a do-nothing \nCongress. I think people in the country should hold us accountable. I \nsay to the majority party, I think they should especially hold the \nmajority party accountable because I think many of us have wanted to do \nmuch more. I think that is what the next election probably will be all \nabout.\n  If people believe education and health care and opportunities for \ntheir children and jobs at decent wages are important issues to them--\nthat is their center; that is the center of their lives--and they \nbelieve the Republican majority has not been willing to move on this \nagenda, and they feel as if there is a big disconnect between what is \ndone here and the lives of people who we are suppose to represent, then \nI say, let the next election be a referendum. But I certainly wish we \nhad done more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S14849-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14849-S14852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                A FAIR DEAL FOR MINNESOTA DAIRY FARMERS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, final point. Some of us have been \nfighting for several days. We are out of leverage now. It is toward the \nend. But to be real clear about it, there was a time, when the \nNortheast Dairy Compact was brought to the floor, it was going to be \npart of the 1996 ``Freedom to Farm.'' I think it is the ``Freedom to \nFail'' bill. It was defeated.\n  But this compact, which was not in the farm bill that passed in \neither House, was then put into the conference committee. There is a \nreform issue on which we ought to work. There is one in which I am \nreally interested. I do not think the conference committee, which has \nbecome the ``third House'' of the Congress, should be able to put an \namendment, a provision, into conference that was not passed in either \nHouse; or, for that matter, take out a provision that was passed in \nboth Houses.\n  So this got snuck in. It was part of a deal. It is how we got the \n``Freedom to Fail'' bill, which has visited unbelievable economic pain \nand misery.\n  The argument that was made for the Freedom to Farm bill was it should \nall be in the market; there ought not be any safety net; so a family \nfarmer should not have any real leverage for bargaining for a decent \nprice. You name it. It was a great bill for grain companies, a great \nbill for the packers, but not a very good bill for family farmers. On \nthe other hand, when it came to dairy, it was a different set of rules. \nAnd we were going to have these dairy compacts with administered \nprices.\n  Our dairy producers were just asking for a fair shot--dairy producers \nin States such as Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n  Let me explain. In my State, we have 8,700 dairy farms. We rank fifth \nin the Nation in milk production. These farms generate about $1.2 \nbillion for our farmers each year. The average size of the Minnesota \ndairy farm is about 60 cows--60 cows per farm. We are talking about \nfamily-size farm operations. We are going to lose many more because \nthis compact, for all sorts of reasons so negative, impacts on our \ndairy farmers.\n  Mr. President, I am disgraced by the recent action by the majority \nparty to include such harmful dairy provisions to the State of \nMinnesota as part of the final spending bill this year. The tactics \nused to include dairy as part of\n\n[[Page S14850]]\n\nthis bill is yet another illustration of the flagrant abuse of power. I \nand my fellow colleagues have fought hard and have been successful in \ndefeating previous attempts to extend the Northeast Dairy Compact. We \nfought openly and fairly on the Senate floor, and now our successful \nefforts may be unjustly curtailed by clandestine negotiations by those \nwho overtly misuse their power. This type of backroom negotiating style \nis clearly not the first time that harmful dairy provisions have been \nattached to the bill. We have been fighting such tactics since the \nauthorization of the compact. In fact, the authorization of the \nNortheast Dairy Compact was inserted into the 1996 farm bill as part of \na backroom deal. In 1996, I offered an amendment which successfully \nstruck the compact out of the Senate bill and the compact was not in \nthe farm bill initially passed by either House of Congress. Instead, it \nwas later inserted during the bill's conference in the passage of the \n1996 Freedom to Farm bill. Yet ironically, the 1996 Freedom to Farm \nbill was passed with the intent to remove government from the \nmarketplace. Although, I adamantly opposed the bill, many viewed the \n1996 farm bill as a way to decouple payments to family farmers. The \nthought at that time was that farmers should produce for the market and \nthat Congress should eliminate a safety net for our farmers.\n  For some reason, we seemed to play by a different set of rules when \nit comes to dairy. We told our corn and soybean farmers that to succeed \nin the 21st century they should pay close attention to market signals, \nbut at the same time we considered implementing compacts that drown out \nthose signals for dairy farmers. And yet even among dairy producers, we \nscrutinized and only allowed one region of the country to provide a \nsafety net for their farmers, while hurting farmers in other parts of \nthe country.\n  Minnesota is not asking for special favors. All Minnesota dairy \nproducers are asking for is a fair shot. I have spoken here before \nabout the importance of family dairy farming to my State's economy. \nMinnesota's dairy industry is one of the cornerstones of the State's \neconomy. We have 8,700 dairy farms in Minnesota, ranking fifth in the \nNation's milk production. The milk production from Minnesota farms \ngenerates more than $1.2 billion for our farmers each year. Yet, the \naverage herd size of a Minnesota dairy farm is about 60 cows. Sixty \ncows per farm. So we are really talking about family operations in my \nState. Family businesses with a total of $1.2 billion in sales a year, \ncontributing to their small-town economies, trying to live a productive \nlife on the land.\n  Let me read from a few farmers in my State of Minnesota who are \nhurting:\n  Eunice Biel, a Harmony, MN dairy farmer:\n\n       We currently milk 100 cows and just built a new milking \n     parlor. We will be milking 120 cows next year. Our 22-year-\n     old son would like to farm with us. But for us to do so he \n     must buy out my husband's mother (his grandmother) because my \n     husband and I who are 47-years-old, still are unable to take \n     over the family farm. Our son must acquire a beginning farmer \n     loan. But should he shoulder that debt if there is no stable \n     milk price? We continuously are told by bankers, \n     veterinarians and ag suppliers that we need to get bigger or \n     we will not survive. At 120 cows, we can manage our herd and \n     farm effectively and efficiently. We should not be forced to \n     expand in order to survive.\n\n  Lynn Jostock, a Waseca, MN dairy farmer:\n\n       I have four children. My 11-year-old son Al helps my \n     husband and I by doing chores. But it often is too much to \n     expect of someone so young. For instance, one day our son \n     came home from school. His father asked Al for some help \n     driving the tractor to another farm about 3 miles away. Al \n     was going to come home right afterward. But he wound up \n     helping his father cut hay. Then he helped rake hay. Then he \n     helped bale hay. My son did not return home until 9:30 p.m. \n     He had not yet eaten supper. He had not yet done his \n     schoolwork. We don't have other help. The price we get at the \n     farm gate isn't enough to allow us to hire any farmhands or \n     to help our community by providing more jobs. And it isn't \n     fair to ask your 11-year-old son to work so hard to keep the \n     family going. When will he burn out? How will he ever want to \n     farm?\n\n  Les Kyllo, a Goodhue dairy farmer:\n\n       My grandfather milked 15 cows. My dad milked 26. I have \n     milked as many as 100 cows, and I'm going broke. They made a \n     living out here and I didn't. Since my son went away to \n     college, my farmhands are my 73-year-old father and my 77-\n     year-old father-in-law who has an artificial hip.\n       I have a barn that needs repairs and updates that I can't \n     afford. I have two children that don't want to farm. At one \n     point, in a 30-mile radius, there were 15 Kyllos farming. Now \n     there are three. And now I'm selling my cows. My family has \n     farmed since my ancestors emigrated to the United States.\n       When I leave farming, my community will lose the $15,000 I \n     spend locally each year for cattle feed; the $3,000 I spend \n     at the veterinarian; the $3,600 I spend for electricity; or \n     the money I spend for fuel, cattle insemination and other \n     farm needs.\n\n  The testimony I just read were from MN farmers who felt comfortable \nto share their names. I have additional testimony, but the farmers who \nshared their stories, had requested that I not use their name. This is \ntestimony from a farmer in East Ottertail, MN:\n\n       Despite the ongoing difficulties, it is amazing the \n     steadfast willingness of this family to try and hold things \n     together. The farm is farmed by two families, a father and \n     his son.\n       Since dairy prices fell in the second quarter of 1999, \n     there was not enough income for this family to make the loan \n     payments and to provide for family living and cover farm \n     operating expenses. The Farm Credit Services would not \n     release a loan for farm operating assistance, and so the \n     family had to borrow money from the lender from which they \n     are already leasing their cows. They have not been able to \n     feed the cows properly because of the lack of funds. Because \n     they cannot adequately feed their dairy herd, their milk \n     production has fallen and is considerably lower than the \n     herd's average production. In addition, because there was no \n     money for family living, the parents had to cash out what \n     little retirement savings they had so that the two families \n     had something to live on day to day.\n       The son and wife had to let their trailerhouse go since \n     they could not make the payments and moved into a home owned \n     by a relative for the winter. Most of their machinery is \n     being liquidated. However, there are a few pieces of \n     machinery that go toward paying off their existing debt. The \n     family will be selling off 120 acres of land in their \n     struggle to reduce the debt. Recently, the father has been \n     having serious back troubles and has been unable to help his \n     son with the work. This is tremendous stress both physically \n     and mentally on the son. The son has decided he is going to \n     have to sell part of the herd in order to reduce the herd to \n     a number that is more manageable for one person. In addition, \n     the money acquired from selling off part of the herd will be \n     applied toward their debt. The son hopes that these three \n     items combined: selling machinery, land and part of the \n     herd can pay off enough of their debt that he might be \n     able to do some restructuring on the remainder of the farm \n     and to reduce loan payments to a manageable amount where \n     there is something left to live on after payments are \n     made.\n\n  These are just a few of the stories. I read these stories, because it \nis important that when we consider national dairy policy here in the \nSenate, we need to keep in mind that we are determining the future of \nan industry and a way of life that are basic not only to the \nagricultural economy, but to the very soul of America's rural \nheartland. I am concerned that the dairy provisions attached to this \nomnibus bill will hurt Minnesota dairy farmers and frankly dairy \nfarmers throughout the country. I have been on the floor before \ndiscussing how the dairy compacts and any reversal to the \nimplementation of an equitable milk marketing system will harm \nMinnesota dairy farmers. However, the dairy language included in this \nbill goes even further and could potentially threaten all family dairy \nfarmers throughout the nation.\n  What I am talking about and concerned about as are many Americans is \nthe trend towards factory-farm and concentration in dairy. It is \nunnecessary and unwise. There is no reason we cannot have a family-farm \nbased dairy system. A dairy system which promotes economic vitality in \nrural communities and one which is more environmentally sustainable \nthan a factory-farm system. Family dairy farms are efficient and \ninnovative. Family dairy farms can provide a plentiful supply of \nwholesome milk at a fair price. However, there is a provision stuck in \nthis bill which no one has really discussed, and would harm family \ndairy farmers everywhere. The provision would establish a pilot program \nallowing for the expansion of forward contracting of milk.\n  Forward contracting reduces competition in the marketplace and \nresults in lower prices to dairy producers. Forward contracting is not \nspecific to the dairy industry. In fact, one can note the effect of \nforward contracting by the recent events occurring in the hog industry. \nRecently, the hog industry has witnessed a significant increase in the \nnumber of producers who decided to forward contract. Hog producers will \ncontract with packers to guarantee\n\n[[Page S14851]]\n\nthem a minimum price for their pigs. Contracting is not inherently bad \nand there are some good contracts. However, what is occurring is that \nthese deals are made often in private and do not reflect the spot \nmarket. There is a strong argument that contracting is partly \nresponsible for the depressed hog prices and the rapid increase in the \nconsolidation of the hog industry. What is happening in the hog \nindustry is also happening in dairy.\n  This provision would expand forward contracting of milk by allowing \nprocessors to pay producers less than the federal milk price for milk. \nUnder current law, forward contracting is allowed, however, only if the \nbuyer is willing to offer at least as much as the federal minimum \nprice. In other words, this provision will remove an important safety \nnet for our dairy producers. Expanded forward contracting can also \nreduce the price for producers who do not forward contract by reducing \nthe competition for milk, thereby damaging the entire dairy market \nstructure. This provision could also discriminate against our family \nfarmers because the most likely scenario is that processors would offer \nforward contracts to the largest producers. Again, we would see the \ndomino effect of losing family farmers. By giving a better deal to \nlarger producers, our family farmers cannot compete and we would see \nmore losses of family farmers.\n  Those who support forward contracting contend that forward \ncontracting is a risk management tool; however, this argument doesn't \nhold water. In fact, National Farmers' Union and other groups contend \nthat the proposal for forward contracting will actually make it more \ndifficult to manage risk by forcing producers to guess whether the \nvolatile dairy market will go up or down. It is logically deduced that \nin the absence of an adequate support price, the market will continue \nto be highly volatile. What can happen is that anytime producers price \nguess wrong, they lose money under this proposal. The truth is that our \nfamily dairy farmers cannot compete in such a volatile market place. We \nmust set policy that keeps family dairy farms in business while \nensuring that consumer and taxpayer costs are kept at a reasonable \nlevel. What we need to achieve here is a fair, sustainable and stable \nprice system for all dairy farmers.\n  That has clearly not happened, and that's partly why Minnesota \ncontinues to lose dairy farmers at an appalling rate. Minnesota is \nlosing dairy farms at the rate of three per day due to base price that \nare already low and unstable. Let me read to you the past couple of BFP \nprices for family dairy farmers. The BFP is the basic formula price. It \nis the monthly base price per hundredweight paid to dairy farmers for \ntheir milk.\n  In August the BFP was $15.79 per hundredweight. That was quite high \nand it is a good price. Farmers could be pleased with that price. In \nSeptember the BFP rose a little higher to $16.26 per hundredweight. I \nhaven't seen the analysis of why the BFP price rose so high. Back in \nMay of 1999, the BFP was only $11.26. Some would argue that it was due \nto the drought in the East that prices rose so high for August and \nSeptember. The milk price was high because cows in the eastern region \nwere strained and produces less milk. Therefore, milk was in demand and \nthus the price rose. If this is the case, our farmers are getting a \ndecent price for their milk only at the expense of farmers in other \nparts of the country who are suffering.\n  In October, the BFP took a stumbling tumble from the $16.26-September \nprice to $11.49 per hundredweight. This is a dramatic drop price. The \nBFP for this month will not be released until December 3rd, but it is \npredicted to be even lower. Again, as I have stated before with such \nvolatility in the market, it is no question why our farmers are having \na difficult time to survive. And if dairy farmers are not struggling \nenough with the volatility of the market, Congress is now assisting and \nin some cases is making the price of my dairy farmers worse--and that \nis what has happened with the Northeast Dairy Compact. The Northeast \nDairy Compact gives six states the right to join together to raise \nprices to help producers in the region. While it may help the \nNortheast, it is cutting into our markets. It is true that the compact \nprovided a safety net this spring to certain farmers when dairy prices \nplunged. When the price of raw milk dropped by 37 percent, one \nMassachusetts farmer got a $2,100 check from the compact. Overall, that \nfarmer said, aid from the compact totaled seven percent of his gross \nincome during the first 12 months of its operation. Conversely, Midwest \ndairy farmers--who also confronted the sharp price decline--got no such \nprice.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact fixes fluid milk prices at artificially \nhigh prices for the benefit of dairy producers in just that region. \nThis artificial price boost of a compact may benefit the producers \ncovered by the compact, but it hurts all other dairy farmers. It is \nalso no secret that the extension of the Northeast Compact encourages \nother regions such as the Southeast to form their own compact. This \nwould be detrimental to the Upper Midwest. A recent report by \nUniversity of Missouri dairy economist Ken Baily found that Minnesota's \nfarm-level milk price would drop at least 21 cents per hundredweight if \na Southeast dairy compact were allowed to be implemented alongside \nexpanded Northeast dairy compact. This would translate into a $27.2 \nmillion annual reduction of Minnesota farm milk sales. The compacts in \nBaily's study would cover only 27 percent of U.S. milk production, yet \nwould have a sizable negative impact. If more regions adopted compacts \nMinnesota prices would drop even further.\n  Many, such as I heard Senator Leahy inquire, why doesn't the Upper \nMidwest form their own compact. Minnesota and Wisconsin farmers would \nnot benefit from organizing their own compact. A compact's price boost \napplies for only fluid milk. The percentage of Upper Midwest milk going \ninto fluid products is so low that any compact would do little for \nMinnesota's farmers' income. The negative impact of compacts would far \noutweigh any minimal boost to fluid prices here in Minnesota. Congress \nshould not accept a policy that so clearly provides benefits to the \nproducers of one region at the expense of consumers and producers \nelsewhere. Instead, there should be an effort to create a more uniform \nand rational national dairy policy--a policy without the regional \nfragmentation caused by compacts.\n  To put it simply, compacts erect trade barriers in our country. By \nfixing milk prices at artificially high levels, Compact proponents \nunderstand that their markets become vulnerable to market forces at \nwork elsewhere in the nation. So in order to prevent milk from other \nregions entering those Compact markets at lower prices, a tariff-like \nmechanism is established to ensure that all milk entering the Compact \narea is priced at the level fixed by the price-fixing commission in the \nregion. It is bad enough that the extension of the Northeast Dairy \nCompact is attached to this bill, but it is unacceptable for Congress \nto attempt to meddle with USDA's final plan by resurrecting an \nalternative similar to Option 1-A.\n  As you know, the referendum voted on by producers nationwide \noverwhelming passed this past summer. Given the prominence of \nMinnesota's dairy industry, it should be no surprise that I have pushed \nfor reform of the existing milk pricing system. The Secretary's reforms \nare a step forward in a long overhaul of dairy policy toward a more \nunified and simplified pricing system that benefits all producers. We \nneed to reduce and eliminate the regional inequities that exist within \nthe federal order system. The current pricing system regulates the \nprice of fluid milk based on the distance from Eau Claire, Wisconsin. \nThis policy causes market distortions that disadvantage producers in \nthe Upper Midwest. These reforms must move forward quickly, and be \nimplemented as soon as possible by the Secretary.\n  These dairy provisions are putting at great risk dairy farmers not \njust in my State, but across the country. It is imperative that we \nestablish a national and equitable dairy system for all. For this \nreason, and among numerous other inequities included as part of this \nmammoth omnibus package, I cannot vote for the bill.\n  Mr. President, milk prices per 100 weight were about $16. Now they \nare down to $11. They are going down further. We do not have any kind \nof national dairy policy that makes any sense.\n\n[[Page S14852]]\n\n  What has happened, which affects Eunice Biel and Lynn Jostock, and \nLes Kyllo, and all sorts of other farmers who will remain anonymous but \nwhose statements are included in the Record --they do not want their \nnames used--it is hard when you are going through pain, and you are \nworking 19 hours a day, and you are going to lose your farm.\n  What has happened, to add salt to the wound, insult to injury, is \nthat in the dark of night in a conference committee a few people--it \ndid not pass the Senate; they did not get it through--they put through \na provision that extended this Northeast Dairy Compact, which would \nhave run out, and they blocked the Secretary of Agriculture from being \nable to move forward with milk marketing order reform.\n  They have another provision which would allow for a pilot project for \nthe expansion of the forward contracting of milk. That is what we have \nhad in the hog industry. Contracting is not inherently bad, but what \nhappens is these arrangements are made in private; they do not reflect \nthe spot market. Basically, what happens is, you are going to have this \nconsolidated industry, as in the hog industry. And what will happen is \nthat the processors will be able to pay the producers less than the \nFederal milk price for milk. In other words, under current law, forward \ncontracting is allowed; however, only if the buyer is willing to offer \nat least as much as the Federal minimum price. But this little-known \nprovision--never debated on the floor of the Senate--would now remove \nthat important safety net for our dairy producers. Processors are going \nto offer better forward contracts to the larger producers, to the \nlargest producers, and our dairy farms are going to go under.\n  In Minnesota, we continue to lose dairy farms at an appalling rate. \nMinnesota is losing dairy farms at the rate of three per day due to a \nbase price that is already so low and so unstable.\n  I say to each and every one of my colleagues that it is a triple blow \nto agriculture, to dairy farmers, in Minnesota. First of all, again, \nthis horrendous piece of legislation, which was passed in 1996, that I \nthink the Senate should be ashamed of, took the bargaining power away \nfrom farmers. They cannot even get a price to survive.\n  We have a depression in agriculture. We are going to lose a whole \ngeneration of producers. The way this happened, with the Northeast \nDairy Compact, was to put that into the conference report. It never \npassed on the floor. It was part of the whole deal that made this bill \npossible.\n  Then this dairy compact was going to expire in 2 years. We had a vote \non it. It did not get through the Senate. It came back into the \nconference committee, in this horrendous process--which will be my last \npoint about this process--no vote, no public discussion, all sorts of \nprovisions, one of which I just mentioned, put into this amendment, and \nnow this omnibus conference report is brought to us, and we cannot \namend it. We can't amend it. I can't come to the floor of the Senate \nand deal with this forward contracting of milk without the safety net. \nI can't come to the floor of the Senate with an amendment to knock out \nthis amendment. You get a few people who decide in a closed room, \noutside of any scrutiny, and they put this back in.\n\n  I am outraged. But we fought this every way we know how. Today is the \nlast day. There will be a vote, and we can't stop that vote--whether it \nbe at 1 a.m. or in midafternoon. To me, that is no longer an issue. We \nhave done everything we can.\n  But I say to my colleagues that I think what has been done to the \ndairy farmers in the Midwest is an injustice. I think it is an \ninjustice in a piece of legislation that, in and of itself, doesn't \nrepresent all that much for America, even though I know everybody will \nbe talking about how great this is. I am certainly going to vote \nagainst it.\n  I also say to my colleagues that I hope we will, next year, think \nabout how we can reform the way we operate. On this, I hold the \nmajority leader accountable--to the extent that I can hold him \naccountable. And I will figure out every way I can next year, when we \ncome back, to keep raising this issue.\n  We didn't get a lot of these appropriations bills done. We had a lot \nof legislation that came to the floor. We weren't allowed to do \namendments. Frankly, I don't know how anybody in here thinks we can be \ngood legislators when we don't have the bills coming to the floor. We \nneed to get them out here in the open and have debates that are \nintroduced, have up-or-down votes, and then we move forward. And if we \nhave to work from 9 in the morning until 9 at night, so be it. But \ninstead, we don't do our work.\n  Those of us who believe the Senate floor is the place to fight for \nwhat we believe in and have the debates are not able to do so. Instead, \nwe have this process where six, seven, eight people decide what is in \nand what is out, and we have this huge monstrosity called the \n``omnibus'' bill that is presented to us, which none of us has read--or \nmaybe two people have. But none of us has read this from cover to \ncover. I doubt whether there are more than two Senators who know \neverything that is in here.\n  I would like to raise the question, How can we be good legislators \nwith this kind of process? We are not being good legislators. I am \nspeaking for myself. I am not able to be an effective legislator \nrepresenting Minnesota if we are going to continue making decisions in \nconference committees and rolling in six, seven, eight major pieces of \nlegislation with no opportunity for me as a Senator from Minnesota to \nbring amendments to the floor. That was done on the dairy compact, and \nthat is what has been done on a whole lot of other decisions. It is no \nway to legislate.\n  I contend that that is no way to legislate. I contend that this \nomnibus bill makes a mockery of the legislative process. I contend on \nthe floor of the Senate today, not only because of what happened to \ndairy farmers in Minnesota but because of the whole way in which this \ndecisionmaking process has worked, that this is unconscionable. I \ncontend that this kind of decisionmaking process is going to lead to \nmore and more disillusionment on the part of people in the country.\n  People hate the mix of money and politics. They don't like poison \npolitics. They don't like all the hack-attack politics my colleagues, \nSenator Reid and Senator Durbin, were talking about earlier because \nthey believe that is what is wrong. They don't like what, apparently, \nsome of us relish. They don't like backroom deals, decisionmaking that \nis not open, accountable, and that people can understand and \ncomprehend.\n\n  Now, my final point. I am not so sure that some of the major \ndecisionmakers, given the sort of deck of cards they had to work with--\nI don't know that I want to point the finger at any one person. I don't \nthink that is probably fair. I am making an argument about process, not \nabout a particular Senator. Some of them who were involved in this \nprobably did everything they could do from their point of view. They \nare very skillful. But I will tell you one thing. Minnesota dairy \nfarmers came out on the short end of the stick.\n  I regret the fact that this has been done and stuck into a conference \nreport and was not done in an honest way, with open debate on the floor \nof the Senate, where we could have amendments. I also regret a \nlegislative process where we didn't get to the bills on time, didn't \nhave the debate on the floor, didn't have amendments we could \nintroduce, didn't have the up-or-down votes, and it all got done by a \nfew people, really, basically, with very little opportunity for public \nscrutiny, for democratic accountability.\n  I am going to vote ``no'' on this bill. I think I would vote ``no'' \njust on the issue of the way in which these decisions have been made \nbecause, again, I think we have made a mockery of what should be the \nlegislative process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in my capacity as chairman of the \nInternational Trade Subcommittee and getting ready for the Seattle \nRound, as well as considering China's accession to the World Trade \nOrganization, I want to speak on Congress' power and our responsibility \non the whole issue of international trade.\n  It is very clear in the Constitution that the Congress of the United \nStates has the power, as one of the specifically delineated powers of \nCongress in the first article, to regulate interstate and foreign \ncommerce. So the United States has just concluded a bilateral market \naccess agreement with China. It should pave the way for China's \naccession to the World Trade Organization.\n  From what I have heard about this agreement--and, of course, we only \nhave summaries at this point--it is an exceptionally good one for the \nUnited States and especially for American agriculture. I said, when the \nagreement fell through on April 8, I was fearful that a lot of ground \nwould be lost. I don't think, from what I know, there has been any \nground lost with the renegotiation. Charlene Barshefsky, our U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, conducted herself in a highly professional way and \nnegotiated what appears to be an excellent agreement, and she did it \nunder very difficult circumstances.\n  Now that the negotiations are finished, the job of the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives becomes even more important. Our \nconstitutional responsibility requires that the Senate and the House \ncarefully review the agreement in its entirety, and the extent to which \nthere are changes in law, they obviously have to pass the Congress, as \nany law would, and be signed by the President.\n  It is a responsibility every Senator takes very seriously because it \nis assigned to us by the Constitution. And because the Congress has a \nunique and close relationship with the American people, we must also \nkeep faith with the people who sent us here to fulfill our \nconstitutional responsibilities.\n  That is why it is critical we know everything that was negotiated.\n  I want to put emphasis upon that statement.\n  That is why it is important that the Congress of the United States \nknow everything that was negotiated--everything, every issue, every \ndetail, and every interpretation--so there can be no surprises, no \nprivate exchanges of letters, no private understandings about the key \nmeanings of key phrases in the agreement, and no reservations \nwhatsoever that are kept just between negotiators.\n  In other words, if Congress is going to legislate these agreements \nand secure these agreements, Congress has a responsibility not only to \nmake sure everything is on the table but to make sure the \nadministration puts everything on the table.\n  Let me be clear about this. There is an absolute requirement of \ndisclosure. Congress must see everything that is negotiated. And it has \nnot always been this way, or I wouldn't be to the floor asking my \ncolleagues to consider this, and with an admonition to the \nadministration to make sure everything is given to Congress. When \ncongressional approval is required, only what we see and vote on should \nbecome the law. Nothing should become the law of the land that is \nsecretly negotiated and that isn't submitted to Congress for our \napproval.\n  Because there have been problems in this area in the past, Senator \nConrad of North Dakota and I have introduced legislation. This \nlegislation is contained in the African trade bill. That trade bill was \nrecently approved by the Senate. I will work very hard to see that this \nprovision is part of the final bill approved by conference committee \nbefore the African trade bill is sent to the President.\n  Why are we where we are today with what Senator Conrad and I have \ntried to accomplish, and did accomplish, as far as the Senate is \nconcerned? Unfortunately, past administrations have not complied with \ntheir basic principles of complete disclosure and complete openness in \ntheir submittal of agreements to the Congress. A prior administration--\nit happened to be a Republican administration--violated the spirit, if \nnot the letter, of this absolute good faith requirement of complete \ndisclosure. This incident occurred in 1988. I want to give background \non it because it was in regard to the Canadian Free Trade Agreement \nwhich became part of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n  At that time, there was disagreement about the meaning of a term \nrelating to Canada's price support system for wheat.\n  If anybody has heard the articulate speaking of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota on this issue--Senator Conrad has talked about this many \ntimes, about wheat unfairly coming into the northern United States in \nviolation of the free trade agreement but somehow being legal because \nof these side agreements that Congress didn't know about in the past.\n  There was a disagreement about the meaning of a term relating to \nCanada's price support system for wheat. The issue dealt with whether \nthe Canadians were manipulating their price support system by unfairly \ndefining a very key term in their favor, thus allowing them to sell \nwheat below cost in the United States market in violation of the clear \nmeaning of a provision of the Canadian-United States free trade \nagreement.\n  The United States insisted that Canada was, indeed, selling wheat \nbelow cost in violation of the agreement. Canada denied the violation. \nThe dispute was even taken to a binational panel for resolution.\n\n  In the argument before the binational panel for dispute resolution, \nthe Canadian side at that time produced a letter from a few years back \nfrom the United States Trade Representative to the Canadians supporting \nthe Canadian interpretation of the provision and very devastating to \nthe case brought by the United States.\n  The question now is whether the U.S. Trade Representative's letter, \nor his interpretation of this controversial and important provision, \nwas properly reported to the Congress before we considered that \nagreement, voted on it, and it became the law of the land. Some might \nargue that it was disclosed. Others say it was not.\n  In my view, because the issue of Canada's price support system for \nwheat was such a politically sensitive issue in the context of the \nNAFTA agreement, there should not have been any room for doubt what the \nadministration's interpretation was. The disclosure of the \nadministration's interpretation of this key language should have been \nfully and completely disclosed--not just in the fine print or in \nresponse to questions raised by a Senator at a hearing.\n  When important issues of foreign commerce are at stake and Congress \nis exercising its constitutional power of regulating foreign commerce, \nwe in the Congress should not have to guess what the answer is or even \nhave to figure out how to ask the right questions in the hearing at the \nright time and in the right way to get an honest answer, to have open \ndisclosure of what our agreements are and what the results of the \nnegotiation are.\n  This incident on the wheat and the Canadian Free Trade Agreement had \nunfortunate and profound consequences. It led some in Congress to \nbelieve they could not trust our negotiators. Some of us believed we \nweren't dealt with fairly. The American wheat farmer has been harmed as \na result of it.\n  Now, I want to say I have the highest regard for our negotiators, \nespecially for Ambassador Barshefsky. She has done a remarkable job. \nShe has my complete trust. So this is not about Ambassador Barshefsky. \nIt is not about any one of our negotiators. Nor is this a partisan \nconcern. The incident that sparked my concern occurred during a \nRepublican administration. I am concerned about one simple thing. The \nprinciple of openness and full disclosure to Congress.\n  This simple, basic principle applies not just to the agreement with \nChina. In about ten days, the United States will help launch a new \nround of global trade negotiations in Seattle. This new round of trade \nliberalization talks will\n\n[[Page S14854]]\n\ncover agriculture, services, and other key trade issues. Many of these \nissues are sensitive, and even controversial.\n  We must be confident that we will see everything that is negotiated \nin the new round before it can become law. The legislation Senator \nConrad and I wrote that is part of the Africa trade bill requires full \ndisclosure to Congress of all agreements or understandings with a \nforeign government relating to agricultural trade negotiations--what we \nrefer to here as agricultural trade negotiations, objectives, and \nconsultation.\n\n  Anyway, our provision says that any such agreement or understanding \nthat is not disclosed to Congress before legislation implementing a \ntrade agreement is introduced in the Congress shall not become law. In \nother words, if Congress doesn't know about the agreement, it should \nnot become law. That is very simple. It is very clear. It is a \nrestatement of the principle of full disclosure. It is consistent with \nCongress' constitutional responsibility for foreign commerce, but I \nunderstand the administration opposes this commonsense provision. They \nwant it removed from the bill.\n  Mr. President, it says in the Conrad-Grassley bill, no secret side \ndeals. The Congress agreed that there should be fully submitted to \nCongress all of the provisions of any negotiations that must be \napproved by Congress. I don't know why the administration wants this \nlanguage removed from the trade bill, but this is what they have sent \nto the conferees in the Congress of the United States. They list this \nsection that says no secret side deals. They are suggesting we strike \nthis subsection.\n  We cannot let this happen. I will do everything I can to make sure \nthis physical disclosure provision becomes the law of the land when the \nHouse and Senate conferees finally consider the African trade bill. I \nbelieve our Government should live by the same standards we expect from \nfarmers in my hometown of New Hartford, IA, or any businessman in Des \nMoines, IA. Tell us exactly what you mean. Show us everything in the \nagreement. Act in good faith.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this provision and vote for it when it \ncomes back from the conference committee so we have physical disclosure \nof everything so Congress isn't asked to vote on something that is \nsecret, that we don't know anything about. If we do that, we are \nviolating our constitutional responsibility to the people of this \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I am happy to say there is good \nnews in the omnibus budget bill for rural New Yorkers in two ways. The \nSatellite Home Viewer Act will finally allow rural residents in rural \nareas to receive local television programming, and the dairy language \nin the omnibus final package allows both option 1-A and the New England \nDairy Compact to continue. Let me touch on both of these. It is clearly \ntwo dollops of good news for rural New Yorkers.\n  On the satellite bill, I have had constituent after constituent in \nareas such as Allegany County and Chenango County and Steuben County \nand Ulster County, throughout New York State in rural areas, tell me \nall of a sudden they were unable to receive over the air signals to \nreceive local satellite programming. Imagine being cut off. Imagine for \nyears depending on the weather reports before you took your kids to \nschool or because you are a farmer and then not being able to get them. \nImagine having your local news shows cut off. Imagine not being able to \nsee things your family was accustomed to seeing, all because of a court \naction.\n  Today, that bill, that court action, is being overruled in the \nomnibus act. I am delighted to say half a million New York residents \nwill now be able to get their local signal from their satellite which \nthey were not able to do before--half a million people, all back the \nway they should be.\n  I hope we will continue the progress of the Satellite Home Viewer \nAct. The Federal provision was taken out. I understand the Senate \nBanking Committee plans to hold hearings next year to ensure that \nmultiservice providers are encouraged to extend competition. I want to \nwork with my colleagues to make sure my constituents in upstate rural \nNew York, central New York, the west and southern tier, and in the \nnorth country have the same viewing options as those in downstate.\n  The other bit of good news, of course, is the dairy language in the \nfinal bill. First, I know some of my colleagues from Wisconsin and \nMinnesota have labored long and hard on behalf of their constituents in \nthis regard. I salute their hard work, their tenacity, and their \ndiligence. I heard the Senator from Minnesota say the average dairy \nfarm in his State has 60 cows. It is no different in New York. We don't \nhave large farms, by and large. We shouldn't be pitting one against the \nother. Without 1-A and without the dairy compact we would have had \ndesperate times in rural New York for our dairy farmers. We are the \nthird largest dairy State. Dairy is a vital industry in much of New \nYork.\n  If option 1-B were allowed to be implemented, New York would \nexperience the single largest loss of any State, $30.5 million a year. \nCompacts, of course, are necessary. The 1-A option passed both Houses. \nThis is not something being done in the dark of night and not being \ndebated. Both Houses, after full debate, passed both compacts.\n  I say with all due respect to my colleagues from Minnesota and \nWisconsin, it is they who seek to thwart the will of the majority of \nthe House and the Senate when they try at the last minute to stop an \nomnibus bill from going through. We need this compact.\n  In New York and New England, the price of milk has not risen by more \nthan 4 cents over the national average in every given year. I say to my \ndownstate constituents, to keep an industry vital to all New Yorkers \ngoing, is it worth it to pay that 4 cents? Almost everyone says yes. \nWith senior citizen centers, WIC, and other types of good programs \nbeing exempt, this is a worthy piece of legislation. I think it is a \ngood day for the dairy farmers of New York.\n\n  It is not all we wanted; I admit that. We want New York to be added \nto the Northeast Dairy Compact, and we will fight like the devil to \nmake that happen in future years. Without 1-A and the existing dairy \ncompact, which still benefits New York dairy farms in the north country \nand places such as Washington and Warren Counties and in central New \nYork, those areas without the New England Dairy Compact, we would have \nsuffered dramatically. Adding insult to injury, not having option 1-A \nwould have been devastating.\n  In the last decade, New York State has lost one-third of its dairy \nfarms, 13,000 to 8,600. The dairy compact and option 1-A will help my \nState and region retain this vital and cherished industry. I believe \nthat can be done not at the expense of our counterparts in the Midwest.\n  In conclusion, it is a good day for rural New Yorkers in this omnibus \nbill. No. 1, the Satellite Home Viewer Act will allow half a million \nNew York families to receive local signal once again; and, an extension \nof the dairy compact, as well as extension of option 1-A, will allow \nour dairy farmers who have been struggling over the last decade to have \na better chance to survive, to grow, and to prosper in one of the \nindustries most vital to all of New York State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

For the information of all of our colleagues, I inform \nSenators that we are still working out some last-minute issues that \nwill then allow the Senate to move a number of important bills that \nhave been cleared on both sides. While we are waiting for these last-\nminute glitches to be resolved, I want to take this opportunity to \nrespond to some of the comments made by my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle this morning.\n  I am disappointed in some of the process, and I do not support all of \nthe provisions of the omnibus appropriations bill which we will \nconsider later this day, but I very much disagree with the assertions \nmade by some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle\n\n[[Page S14855]]\n\nthat we have not accomplished anything during this Congress. We have, \nin fact, accomplished a great deal of which we can be proud. Rather \nthan engaging in harsh partisan rhetoric, we should be coming together \nin these final hours of this session to celebrate what we have done for \nthe American people.\n  First of all, I think we can take great pride in the accomplishment \nthat we will be producing a balanced budget for the first time in \ndecades, one which does not raid the Social Security trust fund. This \nis a tremendous accomplishment and it establishes a new milestone in \nfiscal responsibility. It has been the Republican caucus that has held \nfirm in their determination to prevent one penny of the Social Security \ntrust fund from being diverted to support expensive new unrelated \nGovernment programs. We have succeeded. We have kept that commitment. \nWe have fulfilled our obligation to the senior citizens of this \ncountry. For the first time in 30 years, the Congress has produced a \nbalanced budget which will result in a surplus that does not rely on \nfunds from the Social Security trust fund. The raid on the Social \nSecurity trust fund has been stopped cold.\n  I give a great deal of credit to Senator Domenici, to Senator \nStevens, to Senator Abraham, and to all colleagues in the Republican \ncaucus who have united in their determination to secure the Social \nSecurity trust fund for our seniors and for future generations. That is \nan accomplishment of which we can be proud.\n  Second, I am delighted the omnibus appropriations bill includes what \nhas been my highest priority in the last few months and that is to \nrestore some of the unintended cuts made by the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997 as well as by onerous regulations imposed by the Clinton \nadministration that have impaired the ability of our rural hospitals, \nour home health care agencies, and our nursing homes to provide much \nneeded quality health care to our Nation's senior citizens.\n  The Presiding Officer has been an early supporter of legislation that \nI have introduced to provide financial relief to our distressed home \nhealth care agencies. America's home health care agencies allow our \nsenior citizens and our disabled citizens to receive the health care \nwhere they want it, in the security and the privacy of their own homes. \nUnfortunately, under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, and exacerbated \nby misguided policies of the Clinton administration, America's home \nhealth agencies have found their ability to provide this care has been \njeopardized. This care is so important to our Nation's senior citizens, \nparticularly those who are living in rural areas of our country where \naccess to home health care may spell the difference between staying in \ntheir own homes and having to travel many miles to receive health care.\n  Unfortunately, since cutbacks in home health care have gone into \neffect, there has been a devastating impact on the senior citizens of \nour country. Let me use the example of the State of Maine. As you can \nsee, in just a year's time, more than 6,000 Maine senior citizens have \nlost their access to home care. In fact, it is 6,600 Maine seniors who \nhave lost their access to home health care. The number of home health \ncare visits in Maine has declined by more than 420,000. Reimbursements \nto Maine's home health agencies have declined in a year's time by more \nthan $20 million.\n  Maine's home health agencies have had a long tradition of providing \nlow-cost compassionate care. We are not talking about home health \nagencies that were in any way abusing the system, making too many \nvisits, or overbilling Medicare. We are talking about home health \nagencies that were cost effective and efficient, providing quality low-\ncost care throughout the State of Maine.\n  I have visited with many of these seniors who have lost access to \nhome health care. One was a retired priest in my hometown of Caribou, \nME. He relied on his home health services and has now had to dig deeply \ninto his savings to provide for the care out of his own pocket because \nMedicare is no longer providing the services he needs.\n\n  In another case, I visited an elderly couple in rural Maine who were \nable to stay together in their own home rather than go into a nursing \nhome because of the valuable services provided by home health care \nnurses. The woman in this case was severely diabetic. She was confined \nto a wheelchair and had a wound that was not healing. It was home \nhealth care nurses who came three times a week to clean the wound, to \nchange the dressing, to take care of her other health care needs. Home \nhealth care allowed her and her elderly husband to stay together in \ntheir golden years.\n  It is that kind of service which has made such a difference to the \nquality of life of our senior citizens, and it was that kind of service \nwhich has been so jeopardized by the ill-advised Clinton administration \nregulations and the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1997.\n  The legislation I introduced was a bipartisan bill. It was \ncosponsored by more than 30 of my colleagues, to reverse these \nunintended consequences. The Balanced Budget Remedies Act that is \nincluded in the omnibus appropriations bill does not go as far as I \nwould like, frankly, but it is a good and necessary first step. I \ncommend the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, as well as \nSenator Moynihan, for working with us to come up with legislation that \nwe can enact to ensure our senior citizens do not lose access to much \nneeded health care.\n  That is also a very important bill to our rural hospitals. In our \nhospitals, in States such as Maine, we have been suffering from the \ncutbacks that jeopardize their ability to provide care. These \nhospitals, in most cases, are the only hospital in the community. If \nthey are forced to close because of unfair and inadequate \nreimbursements from Medicare, it will devastate the communities. It \nwill leave many of our senior citizens and others in the community \nwithout access to health care at all when they become ill and need \nhospitalization.\n  One of the features of the cutbacks in home health care troubles me. \nI wonder what has become of these nearly 7,000 Maine citizens. In some \ncases they have been forced to pay for the care themselves. Many of the \nseniors in Maine simply cannot afford that kind of out-of-pocket \nexpense. They are living on Social Security, on limited incomes. They \nalready have a very difficult time affording their prescription drugs. \nSome of them have become sicker because they have lost their access to \nhome health care and have prematurely been forced into nursing homes or \nhave been subject to repeated hospitalization which would have been \navoided had the home health care services been provided. The irony and \nthe wrongheaded effect of this policy is we are probably going to end \nup paying more for the care for these senior citizens who have lost \naccess to their home health care because hospitalization and nursing \nhome care is so much more expensive than home health care. Surely this \nhas been a shortsighted policy.\n  I am pleased this legislation is going to take the first steps we \nneed to provide much needed financial relief to our Nation's home \nhealth care agencies, our rural hospitals, and our nursing homes. It is \ngoing to make a real difference. There is much else that is very \nvaluable in this legislation for our Nation's families. Not only our \nsenior citizens but our children are going to benefit from this \nlegislation.\n  When you hear the rhetoric in this Chamber about education, you would \nthink that somehow there has been an attempt to slash education \nfunding. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the \nRepublican Senate increased--increased, Mr. President--education \nspending by $500 million beyond what was requested by President Clinton \nin his budget.\n  The increase also represents a substantial hike in spending for \neducation programs over last year's spending levels. In fact, the \nlegislation we are about to consider increases education spending by $2 \nbillion over the last fiscal year, and, again, the increase is $500 \nmillion over what the President proposed.\n  Clearly, there is a deep and heartfelt commitment in the Senate to \nincrease education spending and to recognize its importance to the \nfuture of this country and to ensuring a bright future for our Nation's \nchildren. The issue has not been about money. The issue has been who is \nbest able to make education decisions. That is the debate we will \ncontinue next year.\n\n[[Page S14856]]\n\n  To me, the answer is obvious. We do need to increase the Federal \ninvestment in education, but at the same time we need to empower our \nlocal school boards, our parents, our teachers, and our principals to \nmake the decisions and set the priorities. We need to hold them \naccountable for improved education achievement, but we do not need a \nWashington-knows-best, a one-size-fits-all approach to education \npolicy.\n  There is other good news in the omnibus appropriations bill, and that \nis good news for students and their families who are pursuing higher \neducation. Since I have come to the Senate, one of my highest \npriorities has been to increase Pell grants and student loans so that \nno qualified student faces a financial barrier that makes it impossible \nfor him or her to attend college.\n  Prior to coming to the Senate, I worked at a small business and \nhealth college in Bangor, ME, known as Husson College. It was there \nthat I first became aware of how critically important Federal financial \nassistance was for students who are attending college.\n  Eighty-five percent of the students at Husson College could not \nafford to attend college but for the assistance they were provided from \nstudent loans and from Pell grants. This assistance was absolutely \nessential in allowing them to attend college. Many of them were first-\ngeneration college students. They were the first people in their \nfamilies to have the opportunity to attend college. They were taking a \nbig step they knew would ensure a brighter future for them and more \nopportunities.\n  We know the vast majority of new jobs that are being created into the \nnext century will require some kind of postsecondary education, either \nattendance at a technical college, a private college, or a university. \nWe are going to need more and more skills, more and more education, if \nwe are to compete for the jobs of the future. That is why I am so \ndelighted the legislation provides a significant increase for Pell \ngrants.\n  As you can see, the maximum Pell grant will be increased in the \nappropriations bill. Currently, it is $3,125. The President proposed \n$3,250. The appropriations bill passed by the Senate proposed $3,325. \nThose are good steps. They will help make college a little bit more \naffordable for our Nation's young people; indeed, also for older adults \nwho are returning to college because they realize they need additional \nskills.\n  Once again, it is important we emphasize, the Senate increased \nspending for these essential Pell grants beyond what the President \nrecommended. This is a budget of which we can be proud. It does not \ninclude every provision each of us would like. It reflects hours, \nweeks, and months of work. It reflects compromise. That is what the \nsystem is all about.\n  Each of us would write this bill differently. Each of us wishes the \nprocess could be cleaner, that we could work to get our legislation \naccomplished earlier, that we had more cooperation with the White House \nin achieving this goal. But the fact is, this legislation will ensure \nbrighter futures for the families of America.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to set the record straight on these \nimportant issues. The bill, which will be before us later today, is not \nperfect but it is good legislation that deserves the support of all our \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nagree to the amendment of the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am delighted the Senate has now sent S. \n335, the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act that I \nintroduced to curb deceptive mailings, to the President for his \nsignature.\n  The Senate originally passed this legislation by a vote of 93-0 on \nAugust 2. It will impose new disclosure requirements on sweepstakes \nmailings to protect consumers. It will also provide new authority to \nthe Postal Service to take enforcement action against those companies \nsending deceptive mailings.\n  I want to thank several people whose hard work has made passage today \npossible. I particularly want to acknowledge the contributions of \nSenator Levin of Michigan, the ranking minority member of the permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, and the chief cosponsor of this \nimportant legislation. In addition, Senator Cochran and Senator Edwards \nwere real leaders in this effort and contributed greatly to the \nlegislation.\n  There were many other Senators, as well, who cosponsored this \nmeasure. In particular, I want to recognize the contributions of \nseveral members of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, including \nChairman Thompson, Senators Lieberman, Stevens, Durbin, Domenici, \nAkaka, and Specter. They were early cosponsors of this legislation.\n  Senator Campbell has also played an important role. He first \nintroduced legislation to curb some of the deceptive practices of \nsweepstakes companies.\n  In addition, there are several Members of the House of \nRepresentatives who have also worked very hard to bring to about \npassage today. They include Congressman John McHugh, who is chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on the Postal Service; Congressman Fattah, who is the \nranking minority member of the subcommittee; Congressman LoBiondo, \nCongressman Rogan, Congressman McCollum, Congressman and Chairman Dan \nBurton, and Congressman Henry Waxman. All of them worked very hard to \nforge workable legislation that is going to make a real difference.\n  I also want to express my thanks to the members of my staff who \nworked very hard on this. On the subcommittee staff, Lee Blalack and \nKirk Walder were instrumental, and on my personal staff, Michael Bopp, \nmy legislative director--all of them worked very hard.\n  The requirements in this legislation will reduce the deceptive \ntechniques that have caused countless Americans, hundreds of thousands \nof Americans, many of them elderly, to purchase products they do not \nneed nor do they want. Once this legislation takes effect, mailings \nwill be required to make crystal clear to consumers that no purchase is \nnecessary to enter a sweepstakes and that making a purchase will not \nimprove your chances of winning.\n  That is the primary misconception our investigation identified. Too \nmany consumers believe if they make a purchase, somehow they will \nimprove their chances of winning, but nothing could be further from the \ntruth. It is easy to see why they have that misconception because that \nis exactly the impression these deceptive mailings are intended to \nleave.\n  In addition, the legislation will prohibit sweepstakes companies from \ntelling people they are a winner unless they really have won a prize.\n  Enactment of this legislation concludes a year-long investigation by \nthe Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair. Prompted \nby\n\n[[Page S14861]]\n\ncomplaints from my constituents in Maine, I began an investigation to \nexamine deceptive mailings. Hearings before the subcommittee \ndemonstrated that the deceptive techniques of major sweepstakes \ncompanies were misleading thousands of Americans into making purchases \nof products. Further investigation into the activities of the smaller \nsweepstakes companies, the ones that I call the ``stealth companies,'' \nshowed that their practices were even more deceptive. In some cases, \nthey bordered on outright fraud.\n  The subcommittee heard heartbreaking testimony that deceptive \nsweepstakes can induce trusting consumers to buy thousands of dollars \nof unnecessary and unwanted merchandise. One example was a magazine \nsubscription extending to the year 2018 that one witness testified that \nher 82-year-old father-in-law purchased because of sweepstakes \npromotions.\n\n  We found that our senior citizens are particularly vulnerable to \nthese kinds of deceptive mailings. They are a trusting generation. Many \nseniors tend to believe what they read, particularly if it is endorsed \nby a trusted spokesman, comes from a well-known company, or involves a \nmailing that has been designed to appear as if it is from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Family members told us of loved ones who were so convinced that they \nhad won a sweepstakes that they refused to leave their home for fear \nthey would miss the Prize Patrol. One constituent of mine actually \ncanceled needed surgery because she did not want to miss Ed McMahon's \nvisit. Sadly, of course, Ed McMahon never showed up.\n  We found cases of seniors enticed by the bold promises of sweepstakes \nwho spent their Social Security checks, squandered their life's \nsavings, and even borrowed money to buy unwanted magazines and other \nmerchandise.\n  I will never forget the testimony of one man who broke down in tears \nas he recounted how the sweepstakes companies had deceived him into \npurchasing $15,000 worth of products in an effort to win the big prize.\n  The loss suffered by consumers cannot be measured in dollars alone. \nAs one elderly gentleman put it:\n\n       My wife has finally come to realize that she has been duped \n     by the sweepstakes solicitations for all these years. \n     Although the financial train is now halted, the loss of her \n     dignity is incalculable.\n\n  Unfortunately, these are not isolated examples. According to a survey \ncommissioned by the AARP, 40 percent of seniors surveyed believe there \nis a connection between purchasing and winning. It is easy to see why \nconsumers believe they have already won or that they will win if they \njust purchase something as a result of these mailings.\n  I would like to show you, Mr. President, and read from a sweepstakes \nmailing that I received last week at my home in Bangor, ME. As you can \nsee, in bold print, it proclaims: ``Our sweepstakes results are now \nfinal.'' ``Ms. Susan M. Collins has won a cash prize of $833,337.'' ``A \nbank check for $833,337 is on its way to''--my address--``in Bangor.'' \nIt further warns that I will forfeit the entire amount if I refuse to \nrespond to this notice. On the back it says, again, ``A bank check for \n$833,337 in cash will be sent to you by certified mail if you respond \nnow.''\n  I have a feeling you will not be surprised to learn that I am not the \nbig winner. But if I relied on the information in this mailing, it \nwould be easy to see why many people would be deceived into thinking \nthey have, indeed, won the grand prize.\n  Now, in the small print--not in the bold type--but in the small print \nit explains that I have to have the winning number to really win the \nprize.\n  That message is overwhelmed by the bold proclamations telling me I am \na winner. Of course, in case I am tempted not to enter, there is what \nappears to be a personal note that says, ``Please don't say no now,'' \nand implores me to enter and to buy the product offered. This is not \nunusual. This is typical of the kinds of deceptive mailings that are \nall too common and that flood the mailboxes of American consumers with \nmore than a billion pieces of mail a year.\n  You shouldn't have to be a lawyer, you shouldn't have to have a \nmagnifying glass, to figure out the rules of the game and the odds of \nwinning. Our legislation will make a real difference by requiring \nhonest disclosures, by preventing sweepstakes companies from telling \npeople they have won when they have not, and, most importantly, by \nmaking crystal clear to consumers that you don't have to make a \npurchase to win and that making a purchase will not increase your \nchances of winning.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I am pleased that the Senate is now poised \nto send my legislation to curb deceptive mailings to the President for \nhis signature.\n  As I have described to my colleagues previously, you only have to \nlook at some of these sweepstakes mailings to understand why. For \nexample, one mailing by Publisher's Clearing House, which is famous for \nits Prize Patrol, tells the consumer to ``Open Your Door To $31 Million \non January 31.'' This mailing suggests to the reader that his or her \npast purchases are paying off. Specifically, the mailing states: ``You \nsee, your recent order and entry has proven to us that you're indeed \none of our loyal friends and a savvy sweepstakes player. And now I'm \npleased to tell you that you've passed our selection criteria to \nreceive this special invitation.''\n  Another mailing from American Family Publishers stated, ``It's Down \nto a 2 person race for $11,000,000--You And One Other Person In Georgia \nWere Issued the Winning Number . . . Whoever Returns It First Wins It \nAll!'' Most people probably didn't see the fine print that declared, \n``If you have the winning number.'' Unless the contestant reads and \nunderstands this fine print, the mailing leaves the unmistakable \nimpression that the recipient and one other person have the winning \nnumber for the $11 million prize.\n  Mr. President, the bill adopted by the Senate would curb these \nproblems by, for the first time, establishing federal standards for a \nvariety of promotional mailings, including sweepstakes mailings. Such \nmailings must clearly and conspicuously display several important \ndisclosures, including statements that no purchase is necessary to \nenter the contest and that a purchase will not improve your chances of \nwinning; the odds of winning; the value and nature of each prize; and \nthe name and address of the sponsor. Sweepstakes mailings would also be \nrequired to include all the rules and entry procedures for the \nsweepstakes.\n  This legislation also addresses another problem consumers experience \nin dealing with sweepstakes companies. The Subcommittee heard from many \nindividuals who found it difficult to have their name or a parent's \nname removed from the mailing lists of sweepstakes companies, or who \nwere told that the name removal process might take as long as six \nmonths. To address this problem, this legislation includes a section \ndeveloped by Senator Edwards that would require companies sending \nsweepstakes or skill contests to establish a system allowing consumers \nto call or write to have their names removed from the companies' \nmailing lists.\n  The House made several modifications to this section of the bill, \nincluding extending the time from 35 days to 60 days by which companies \nmust remove names of consumers who do not wish to receive future \nsweepstakes or skill contest mailings. Non-profit mailers who use \nsweepstakes contests requested a time limit of longer than 35 days, \narguing that their limited resources might not allow the establishment \nof a system to quickly remove names. The 60-day limit in the bill, \nhowever, should not be used by any company to continue to inundate with \nmore mailings those consumers who have asked to be removed from \nsweepstakes mailing lists. Accordingly, companies should make every \neffort to remove names as quickly as possible.\n  The House also added provisions to allow consumers to bring a private \nright of action in state court if they receive a mailing after \npreviously requesting to be removed from the mailing list of a skill \ncontest or sweepstakes promoter. Sweepstakes promoters will have an \naffirmative defense if they have established and implemented, with due \ncare, reasonable practices and procedures to effectively prevent \nmailings that would violate the section on name removal.\n  The notification system in the bill passed by the Senate, and \nmodified by the House, requires companies to include in every mailing \nthe address or a\n\n[[Page S14862]]\n\ntoll-free telephone number of the notification system, but does not \nrequire that consumers submit their name in writing to comply with the \nremoval system. Companies are encouraged to adopt a consumer friendly \nsystem for the removal of names from their mailing lists, which may \ninclude the ability to have names removed by calling a toll-free \nnumber. Under this legislation, companies using a toll-free number to \npermit the removal of names would not need to require a consumer to \nalso provide their name in writing. Any appropriate method of \nestablishing a record of removal requests by consumers would comply \nwith the requirements of Section 8(d) of the legislation. For example, \ncompanies may wish to electronically verify the consumer's election to \nbe removed from their mailing list.\n  The legislation would strengthen the ability of the Postal Service to \ninvestigate, penalize, and stop deceptive mailings. It grants the \nPostal Inspection Service subpoena authority, nationwide stop mail \nauthority, and the ability to impose tougher civil penalties. The House \nmade several changes in the subpoena authority, including requiring the \nPostal Service to develop procedures for the issuance of subpoenas and \ntheir approval by the General Counsel or a Deputy General Counsel of \nthe Postal Service. The new subpoena authority will give the Postal \nInspection Service better ability to investigate and stop deceptive \nmailings, and I encourage the General Counsel of the Postal Service to \nrecognize that effective enforcement of this legislation requires the \ntimely issuance of subpoenas.\n  Mr. President, S. 335 will provide important new consumer protections \nagainst the many deceptive techniques currently used in promotional \nmailings. I thank my colleagues for their support of this measure.\n  I yield to the subcommittee's ranking minority member, Senator Levin. \nAs I explained earlier in my remarks, he has been the chief cosponsor \nof this legislation and a true leader in the effort to crack down on \ndeceptive mailings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the good Senator from Maine for her \nleadership in this and so many other consumer issues. This bill would \nnot be here on the floor of the Senate without her leadership on the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which has taken \nresponsibility for getting this bill passed.\n  S. 335, the bill we have just passed and sent to the President is \ngoing to crack down on deceptive sweepstakes practices that have \naffected people in all of our States. Most of us have personal \nknowledge of the kind of egregious deceptive practices which have been \nperpetrated by too many companies, including some otherwise reputable \ncompanies that are using deceptive practices to suck into their net \npeople who will be lured into believing that if they buy something or \nsubscribe to something, somehow or other that will increase their \nchances of winning a prize.\n  The bill we are passing today is similar to one I had introduced in \nthe 105th Congress to curb abuse of sweepstakes solicitations and \nprovide for additional enforcement tools against deceptive mailings by \nthe Postal Service. There were hearings held in September of 1998 in \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee Federal Services Subcommittee that \nwas then chaired by Senator Cochran.\n  We learned from witnesses at that hearing, including the Florida \nattorney general, the Michigan assistant attorney general, and the \nPostal Inspection Service, that senior citizens in particular are \nvulnerable to these deceptive solicitations and that the financial cost \nto seniors for deceptive and fraudulent sweepstakes is a serious \nproblem. Deceptive sweepstakes solicitations not only cause significant \nfinancial losses but frequently carry heavy emotional losses as well.\n  We have constituents in Michigan, seniors, who have lost tens of \nthousands of dollars to deceptive sweepstakes. Their houses are \nfrequently filled with hundreds of items they don't need that they \nbought because they thought somehow or other it might help them win the \npromised prize.\n  The Postal Service has inadequate tools to effectively shut down \nthese deceptive marketing people, so we have added some tough \nenforcement tools in this bill.\n  Until this bill becomes law, the Postal Service, for instance, cannot \nimpose a fine against a promoter who uses deceptive practices until the \nPostal Service first issues a stop order. Now, if you wait for a stop \norder to be violated before you can impose an administrative fine, what \nthe deceptive sweepstakes promoter does is slightly modify in some way \nthe deceptive mailing that is the subject of the stop order so they can \navoid being caught by a violation of the Postal Service stop order. The \nPostal Service currently is too often powerless to stop these kinds of \ndeceptive practices and the slight changes which are made in them which \nallow the companies that are using these practices to continue and \nignore what appears to be a stop order.\n  In March and July of this year, Senator Collins chaired hearings in \nthe Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, where I serve as ranking \nmember. The bill we are taking up today, S. 335, reflects what we \nlearned at those hearings as well. Senator Collins has set forth for us \nsome of the egregious examples. I will not take the time of this body \nto go through some of these additional examples we have. We have seen \nthem all. We have seen the big print that says, ``you have just won a \nbig prize;'' we have seen the fine, unreadable print that says but only \n``if you have the winning number;'' the headline which says ``a million \ndollars is yours'' or ``just submit this number'' and you will have \nthis big prize. The fine print says ``no,'' you haven't. We have all \nseen those kinds of examples and the way people are taken in.\n\n  Fortunately, most people aren't taken in, but enough people are, so \nthat a billion pieces of this kind of mail, sweepstakes mail, is sent \nout each year, including by some companies that are otherwise companies \nthat have good reputations. We have had these kinds of deceptive \nmailings sent out by Time Warner, by Reader's Digest, by other \ncompanies whose names have generally prompted positive responses in \npeople because their products have been good products. Yet they have \nstooped, in the case of sweepstakes, to deceptive practices in order to \nlull the people who receive these sweepstakes mailings into believing \nthat if they will just buy that magazine or just buy that product, they \nwill really seal the deal and the truck will really show up with the \ncheck. We have seen these ads on television, the come-ons. Thank God, \n90 or 95 percent of the people look at them and can see them for what \nthey are. It is that 5 or 10 percent, frequently seniors, who are taken \nin. We are trying to stop these practices. This bill, hopefully, will \ndo exactly that.\n  We are going to require that the statement that a purchase will not \nincrease an individual's chances of winning and that no purchase is \nnecessary to win be clearly and conspicuously displayed in the \nmailing--in fact more conspicuously displayed than the other \ninformation in the mailing.\n  The House changed the term ``prominently'' in our Senate bill, which \nwas used to describe how these two key required statements must be \ndisplayed and substituted ``more conspicuously'' for ``prominently'' to \nbetter match previous uses of the term. The intent of both houses on \nthis subject is the same, however, and we have emphasized that point in \nthe committee report. There should be no misunderstanding by the Postal \nService and by the direct mail industry on what we intend by this.\n  S. 335 is also going to provide the Postal Service with authority to \nissue a civil penalty for the first-time violation of the statute, and \nwe are going to give the Postal Service subpoena authority. Those are \nsome of the things we have done.\n  Again, I thank the good Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, her staff, \nmy staff, Linda Gustitus and her good crew, who have made it possible \nfor this bill to happen. Senator Edwards has been extremely helpful \nwith his provision requiring a delisting of persons not wanting to \nreceive sweepstakes mailings. Senator Cochran has been very much in the \nforefront of this effort. Again, the majority and minority staffs of \nthe\n\n[[Page S14863]]\n\nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations have done an absolutely superb \njob of putting together these hearings and developing this legislation.\n  I am confident that with the Senate's passage today, the President \nwill sign the bill into law. It is a bill that will help end the abuses \nwhich too often occur in this area and which take advantage of people \nwho are too often vulnerable to the power of suggestion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S14863-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

I also want to acknowledge the role of Senator Campbell in \nhelping ensure that the legislation addressed issues of concern to \nIndian tribes, and Senator Leahy, the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, who helped advance S. 692 notwithstanding his differences \nwith some of its features. Finally, I want to thank all of my \ncolleagues who joined the legislation as cosponsors following its \nintroduction.\n  S. 692 enjoys extraordinarily broad public support. Those supporting \nit--ranging from Federal and State law-enforcement authorities to \nreligious, consumer, and family groups, from the professional and \namateur sports leagues to the thoroughbred racing industry--are fully \nidentified in the Judiciary Committee report accompanying the bill. I \nwant to acknowledge, in particular, the support of the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, the National Football League, and the \nNational Collegiate Athletic Association, and the constructive role \nplayed by the American Horse Council, the Major League Baseball Players \nAssociation, and America Online, which spearheaded a coalition of \nInternet service providers and others interested in this legislation. I \nwould particularly like to thank David Remes, Gerry Waldron, Marty \nGold, Daniel Nestel, and Stephen Higgins, whose hard work and \ndiplomatic skills played an important role in securing the passage of \nthe bill by unanimous consent.\n  The bill we are voting on today, which the Judiciary Committee \napproved in June by a recorded vote of 16-1, is the culmination of \nefforts begun in the last Congress, when Senator Bryan and I first \nintroduced legislation to prohibit Internet gambling. That legislation, \nS. 474, was approved by the Judiciary Committee in August 1997 and \npassed by a 90-10 vote as an amendment to the Commerce-Justice-State \nappropriations bill in July 1998. The Subcommittee on Crime of the \nHouse Judiciary Committee held hearings on an Internet gambling bill in \nthat the last Congress (H.R. 2380) and approved a revised version of \nthe bill (H.R. 4427), but the House did not complete action on the \nlegislation due to the lateness of the session, and the Senate language \nwas not included in the final version of the appropriations measure. \nNew legislation, similar to S. 692, has been introduced in the House in \nthis Congress, and I am quite hopeful that Internet gambling \nlegislation will be enacted into law early next year.\n  Mr. President, as documented in the Judiciary Committee's report, \nboth the number of Internet gambling sites, and Internet gambling \nrevenues, have grown rapidly since Internet gambling first appeared in \nthe summer of 1995. Two studies cited by the National Gambling Impact \nStudy Commission in its ``Final Report'' to Congress this summer \nindicate that Internet gambling revenues have doubled every year for \nthe past three years. One study reported growth from $300 million in \n1998 to $651 million in 1999, and projected revenues of $2.3 billion by \n2001. Another study reported growth from $445.4 million in 1997 to \n$919.1 million in 1998. The Commission noted estimates by the Financial \nTimes and Smith Barney that Internet gambling will reach annual \nrevenues of $10 billion early in the new millennium. A third study \ncited by the Commission found that the number of online gamblers had \nincreased from 6.9 million to 14.5 million between 1997 and 1998. \nAccording to the Commission, ``virtually all observers assume the rapid \ngrowth of Internet gambling will continue.''\n  It is no exaggeration to say that the Internet has brought gambling \ninto every home that has purchased a computer and chosen to go online. \nAccording to the Department of Commerce, 26.2 percent of U.S. \nhouseholds had Internet access at the end of 1998, representing 27 \nmillion households. That percentage will undoubtedly continue to grow \n(millions of other U.S. households have computers but simply have not \nyet chosen to go online) until, not long from now, online home \ncomputers will be as commonplace as the humble telephone--which, like \nthe telegraph before it, seemed as revolutionary and wondrous, in its \nday, as the Internet seems today.\n\n  As a new technology, the Internet presents new problems that current \nlaw must be updated to address. These problems, which S. 692 is \ndesigned to remedy, are extensively documented in the Judiciary \nCommittee's report. They include, among others, serious harms to our \nyoung people, who are the most adept users of Internet; harms from \ngambling on professional and amateur sports events and athletic \nperformances; and harms relating to pathological gambling and criminal \nactivity. It is vital that we legislate to prevent the Internet from \nbeing used as an instrument of gambling and establish an effective \nmechanism--specifically tailored to this new medium--for enforcing that \nprohibition. In establishing such a mechanism, however, it is also \nimportant to avoid impeding or disrupting the use of the Internet as an \ninstrument of lawful activity. I am confident that S. 602 meets these \nobjectives. Moreover, the fact that the legislation is strongly \nsupported by the chief law enforcement officers of the States is \ncompelling evidence that it strikes the right balance between Federal \nand State authority in this area.\n  S. 692 creates a new section 1085 of title 18. It prohibits any \nperson engaged in a gambling business from using the Internet to place, \nreceive, or otherwise make a bet or wager, or to send, receive, or \ninvite information assisting in the placing of a bet or wager, and it \nestablishes mechanisms tailored to the Internet to enforce this \nprohibition. The new section provides criminal penalties for \nviolations, authorizes civil enforcement proceedings by Federal and \nState authorities, and establishes mechanisms for requiring Internet \nservice providers to terminate or block access to material or activity \nthat violates the prohibition.\n  Because section 1085, as reported by the Judiciary Committee, is \ncomprehensively analyzed in the Judiciary Committee's report, I will \nonly describe its structure here. Section 1085(a) contains definitions. \nSection 1085(b) contains the prohibitions and criminal penalties. \nSection 1085(c) provides for civil actions by the United States and the \nStates to prevent and restrain violations, applicable to persons other \nthan Internet service providers. Section 1085(d) establishes \nresponsibilities for Internet service providers, enforceable through \ncivil injunction actions by Federal and State authorities, and grants \nproviders specified immunities from liability. Section 1085(e) \nspecifies that the availability of relief under subsections (c) and \n(d), which is civil in nature, is independent of any criminal action \nunder subsection (b) or any other Federal or State law. Section 1085(f) \nspecifies categories of activities that, if otherwise lawful, are not \nsubject to the prohibition of subsection (b). This subsection addresses \nState lotteries, pari-mutuel animal wagering, Indian gaming, and \nfantasy sports league games and contests. Section 1085(f) specifically \npreserves the regulatory authority of the States with respect to \ngambling and gambling-related activities not subject to the prohibition \nof subsection (b), but nothing in section 1085 authorizes \ndiscriminatory or other action by a State that would otherwise violate \nthe Commerce Clause. Section 1085(g) specifies that section 1085 does \nnot create immunity from any criminal prosecution under any provision \nof Federal or State law, except as provided in subsection (d), and does \nnot affect any prohibition or remedy applicable to a person engaged in \na gambling business under any other provision of Federal or State law.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are voting on today has been modified in \nseveral\n\n[[Page S14867]]\n\nrespects from the version reported by the Judiciary Committee. All but \none of those modifications affect section 1085. The other affects \nsection 3 of the bill, which calls for a report to Congress by the \nDepartment of Justice two years after enactment.\n  Proceedings by Sports Organizations. The bill has been amended by \nadding a new subparagraph (C) to section 1085(c)(2) to authorize a \nprofessional or amateur sports organization whose games, or the \nperformances of whose athletes in such games, are alleged to be the \nbasis of a violation of section 1085 to institute civil proceedings in \nan appropriate district court of the United States to prevent or \nrestrain the violation. The right of action provided by this \nsubparagraph is similar to the right of action for sports organizations \nprovided in the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, 28 \nU.S.C. 3701 et seq., which Congress passed in 1992 to halt the spread \nof legalized sports betting and S. 692 is intended to reinforce. The \nnew subparagraph limits proceedings, by sports organizations against \ninteractive computer service providers.\n\n  Advertising and promotion of Non-Internet Gambling. The bill has been \namended by adding a new paragraph (4) to section 1085(d) to address the \nresponsibilities and immunities of an Internet service provider \nrelating to the use of its facilities by another person to advertise or \npromote non-online gambling. Paragraph (4) generally mirrors the \napproach of paragraph (1), which addresses the responsibilities and \nimmunities of an Internet service provider relating to the use of its \nfacilities by another person to engage in online gambling activity. \nParagraph (4) provides that, if specified conditions are met, a \nprovider shall not be liable, under any provision of Federal or State \nlaw prohibiting or regulating gambling or gambling-related activities, \nor under any State law prohibiting or regulating advertising and \npromotional activities, either (1) for content, provided by another \nperson, that advertises or promotes non-Internet gambling activity that \nis unlawful under such Federal or State law, arising out of any of the \nactivities described in section 1085(d)(1)(A)(i) or (ii); or (2) for \ncontent, provided by another person, that advertises or promotes non-\nInternet gambling activity that is lawful under both Federal law and \nthe law of the State where the gambling activity is being conducted. To \nbe eligible for immunity under paragraph (4), a provider must, among \nother things, offer residential customers at reasonable cost computer \nsoftware, or another filtering or blocking system, that includes the \ncapability of filtering or blocking access by minors to Internet \ngambling sites that violate section 1085. Paragraph (4) provides for \ninjunctive relief under specified circumstances.\n  Horse Racing. The bill has been amended by adding language to \nsubsection (f)(1)(B)(v)(I) to recognize, expressly, the authority of \nthe State in which the bet or wager originates to prohibit or regulate \nthe activity relating to live horse races described in subparagraph \n(B). this authority was implicit; the amendment makes it explicit.\n  Indian Gaming. The bill has been amended to address Indian gaming by \nadding a new paragraph (4) to section 1085(f). The new paragraph \nspecifies that the prohibitions of section 1085 regarding the use of \nthe Internet or other interactive computer service do not apply to any \notherwise lawful bet or wager that is placed, received, or otherwise \nmade on any game that constitutes class II gaming or class III gaming \n(as those terms are defined in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act), or \nthe sending, receiving, or inviting of information assisting in the \nplacing of any such bet or wager, as applicable, if four conditions are \nmet.\n  First, the game must be one that is permitted under and conducted in \naccordance with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n  Second, each person placing, receiving, or otherwise making such bet \nor wager, or transmitting (i.e., sending, receiving, or inviting) such \ninformation, must be physically located in a gaming facility on Indian \nlands when such person places, receives, or otherwise makes the bet or \nwager, or transmits such information.\n  Third, the game must be conducted on a closed-loop subscriber-based \nsystem or a private network.\n  Fourth, in the case of a game that constitutes class III gaming, the \ngame must be authorized under, and be conducted in accordance with, the \nrespective Tribal-State compacts that govern gaming activity on the \nIndian lands on which each person placing, receiving, or otherwise \nmaking such bet or wager, or transmitting such information, is \nphysically located when such person places, receives, or otherwise \nmakes the bet or wager, or transmits such information. In addition, \neach such Tribal-State compact must expressly provide that the game may \nbe conducted using the Internet or other interactive computer service \nonly on a closed-loop subscriber-based system or a private network.\n\n  To illustrate one application of the fourth condition, suppose that \nPerson A, a player who is physically located on Indian lands in \nFlorida, by using the Internet or other interactive computer service, \nplaces or makes a bet or wager with Person B, a person operating or \nemployed by a casino who is physically located on Indian lands in \nIdaho. To be lawful under section 1085 in this illustration, the game, \namong other things, must be one that is expressly authorized (1) by the \ncompact that governs gaming activity on the Indian lands in Florida on \nwhich Person A is physically located when he places or makes the bet or \nwager, and (2) by the compact that governs gaming activity on the \nIndian lands in Idaho on which Person B is physically located when the \nbet is placed, received, or otherwise made. In addition, both compacts \nmust expressly provide such gaming activity may be conducted using the \nInternet or other interactive computer service only on a closed-loop \nsubscriber-based system or a private network.\n  Paragraph (4) further provides that the requirement of compact \nlanguage expressly allowing the game to be conducted using the Internet \nor other interactive computer service, if a closed-loop subscriber-\nbased system or a private network is used, as set forth in paragraph \n(4)(A)(iv)(II), shall not apply in the case of gaming activity, \notherwise subject to section 1085, that was being conducted on Indian \nlands using the Internet or other interactive computer service on \nSeptember 1, 1999, with the approval of the State gaming commission or \nlike regulatory authority of the State in which such Indian lands are \nlocated, but without the compact language required by paragraph \n(4)(A)(iv)(II). The exemption applies only until the date on which the \ncompact governing gaming activity on such Indian lands expires \n(exclusive of any automatic or discretionary renewal or extension of \nsuch compact), and only to the extent that the gaming activity is \nconducted using the Interned or other interactive computer service on a \nclosed-loop subscriber-based system or a private network. This \nexemption avoids the need to renegotiate compacts currently in effect \nif the specified conditions are satisfied. The exemption waives only \nthe requirement of subparagraph (A)(iv)(II). It does not in any manner \nwaive the compact authorization requirement of subparagraph (A)(iv)(I), \nthe physical location requirement of subparagraph (A)(ii), the closed-\nloop or private network requirement of subparagraph (A)(iii), or any \nother requirement of subparagraph (A).\n  To use the previous illustration, if the compact that currently \ngoverns gaming on the Indian lands in Florida on which Person A is \nphysically located when Person A places or makes the bet or wager does \nnot expressly specify that the game may be conducted using the Internet \nor other interactive computer service (if a closed-loop subscriber-\nbased system or a private network is used), the game may nevertheless \nbe conducted on those Indian lands using the Internet or other \ninteractive computer service (if a closed-loop subscriber-based system \nor a private network is used), notwithstanding section 1085, until that \ncompact expires, if the game was one that was conducted on those Indian \nlands in Florida using the Internet or other interactive computer \nservice on September 1, 1999, with the approval of the gaming \ncommission or like regulatory authority of Florida. After the compact \nexpires, however, any gaming\n\n[[Page S14868]]\n\non those Indian lands using the Internet or other interactive computer \nservice is subject to the requirement of express approval (limited to \nuse of a closed-loop subscriber-based system or a private network) in \nsubsequent compacts governing gaming activity on those Indian lands.\n  Rule of Construction. The bill has been amended by adding a new \nparagraph to section 1085(g) to make even more explicit that, except as \nprovided in subsection (d), section 1085 does not create immunity from \nany criminal prosecution under any provision of Federal or State law. \nThis amendment responds to a concern expressed by Senator Leahy.\n  Report on Enforcement. Section 3 of S. 692 has been amended to \nrequire the Justice Department to include in the required report to \nCongress further information specified by the Gambling Impact Study \nCommission in its ``Final Report''.\n  Mr. President, S. 692 is urgently needed to address a serious social \nproblem. It reflects the very best thinking on how to update existing \nlaw to meet the challenges of a new technology. I respectfully urge its \npassage.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have long been an advocate for \nlegislation that ensures that existing laws keep pace with developing \ntechnology. It is for this reason that I have sponsored and supported \nover the past few years a host of bills to bring us into the 21st \nCentury.\n  This same impetus underlies my support of legislation to ensure our \nnation's gambling laws keep pace with developing technology, \nparticularly the Internet. The Department of Justice has noted that \n``the Internet has allowed for new types of electronic gambling, \nincluding interactive games such as poker or blackjack, that may not \nclearly be included within the types of gambling currently made \nillegal. . . .'' This new technology clearly has the potential to \ndiminish the effectiveness of current gambling statutes.\n  Vermonters have spoken clearly that they do not want certain types of \ngambling permitted in our state, and they do not want current laws to \nbe rendered obsolete by the Internet. Vermont Attorney General William \nSorrell strongly supports federal legislation to address Internet \ngambling, as do other law enforcement officials in Vermont.\n  I believe, therefore, that there is considerable value in updating \nour federal gambling statutes, which is why I voted for S. 692, the \n``Internet Gambling Prohibition Act,'' during Senate Judiciary \nCommittee consideration. I support the bill as a step forward in our \nbipartisan efforts to make sure our federal laws continue to keep pace \nwith emerging technologies.\n  I do, however, have concerns that S. 692 might unnecessarily weaken \nexisting federal and state gambling laws.\n  My first concern is that the bill provides unnecessary exemptions \nfrom its Internet gambling ban for certain forms of gambling activities \nwithout a clear public policy justification. For example, the bill \nexempts parimutuel wagering on horse and dog racing from its ban on \nInternet gambling. The sponsors of S. 692 have offered no compelling \nreason for this special treatment of one form of gambling. Indeed, the \nDepartment of Justice is ``especially troubled by the broad exemptions \ngiven to parimutuel wagering, which essentially would make legal on the \nInternet types of parimutuel wagering that are not legal in the \nphysical world,'' according to its June 9, 1999 views letter on S. 692.\n  Broad exemptions from the Internet gambling ban also contradict the \nrecent recommendations to Congress of the National Gambling Impact \nStudy Commission. After 2 years of taking testimony at hearings across \nthe country, the Commission has endorsed the need for Federal \nlegislation to prohibit Internet gambling. But the Commission clearly \nrejected adding new exemptions to the law in such a ban.\n  Indeed, in a letter to me dated June 15, 1999, Kay C. James, Chair, \nand William Bible, Commissioner, of the National Gambling Impact Study \nCommission, wrote:\n\n       The Commission recommends to the President, Congress, and \n     the Department of Justice (DOJ) that the Federal government \n     should prohibit, without allowing new exemptions or the \n     expansion of existing federal exemptions to other \n     jurisdictions, Internet gambling not already authorized \n     within the United States or among parties in the United \n     States and any foreign jurisdiction. (emphasis in the \n     original)\n\n  My second concern is that the bill unnecessarily creates a new \nsection in our Federal gambling statutes, which may prove inconsistent \nwith existing law and established legal precedent. Instead of updating \nsection 1084 of title 18, which has prohibited interstate gambling \nthrough wire communications since 1961, S. 692 creates a new section \n1085 to title 18 to cover Internet gambling only. Creating a new \nsection out of whole cloth with different definitions and other \nprovisions from existing Federal gambling statutes creates overlapping \nand inconsistent Federal gambling laws for no good reason.\n  According to its views letter on S. 692, the Department of Justice \nbelieves overlapping and inconsistent Federal gambling laws can be \neasily avoided by amending section 1084 of title 18 to cover Internet \ngambling:\n\n       We therefore strongly recommend that Congress address the \n     objective of this legislation through amending existing \n     gambling laws, rather than creating new laws that \n     specifically govern the Internet. Indeed, the Department of \n     Justice believes that an amendment to section 1084 of title \n     18 could satisfy many of the concerns addressed in S. 692, as \n     well as ensure that the same laws apply to gambling \n     businesses, whether they operate over the Internet, the \n     telephone, or some other instrumentality of interstate \n     commerce.\n\n  I want to thank the sponsors of the legislation, Senators Kyl and \nBryan, for addressing my third concern in their substitute amendment. I \nwas concerned that the bill might unnecessarily create immunity from \ncriminal prosecution under State law for Internet gambling. Any new \nimmunity would have been in sharp contrast to existing Federal law, \nwhich specifically does not grant immunity from State prosecution for \nillegal gambling over wire communications.\n\n  To address this concern, the substitute amendment adds a new Rules of \nConstruction section, section 2 (g)(1), which I authored. This section \nmakes it clear that, except for the liability limits provided to \nInteractive Computer Service Providers in section 2 (d) of the bill, S. \n692 does not provide any other immunity from Federal or State \nprosecution for illegal Internet gambling.\n  Indeed, the New York Attorney General recently prosecuted an offshore \nInternet gambling company, World Interactive Gaming Corporation, for \ntargeting New York citizens in violation of State and Federal anti-\ngambling statutes. This past July, the New York State Supreme Court \nupheld that prosecution.\n  As a former State prosecutor in Vermont, I strongly believe that \nCongress should not tie the hands of our State crime-fighting partners \nin the battle against Internet gambling when we do not mandate Federal \npreemption of state criminal laws for other forms of illegal gambling. \nInstead, we need to foster effective Federal-State partnerships to \ncombat illegal Internet gambling.\n  During our consideration of the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act in \nthis Congress and the last, the sponsors of the bill and members of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee have improved and refined the bill on a \nbipartisan basis. The bill now applies only to gambling businesses, \ninstead of individual betters. This will permit Federal authorities to \ntarget the prosecution of interstate gambling businesses, while rightly \nleaving the prosecution of individual bettors to the discretion of \nstate authorities acting under state law.\n  As Senators continue to work together to enact a ban on Internet \ngambling, we should keep these words from the Department of Justice \nforemost in our minds: ``[A]ny prohibitions that are designed to \nprohibit criminal activity on the Internet must be carefully drafted to \naccomplish the legislation's objectives without stifling the growth of \nthe Internet or chilling its use as a communication medium.''\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle and the administration to enact into law carefully drafted \nlegislation to update our Federal gambling statutes to ensure that new \ntypes of gambling activities made possible by emerging technologies are \nprohibited.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I express my deep appreciation and \nthanks to Senator Kyl for his diligent\n\n[[Page S14869]]\n\nwork to help resolve my concerns. This compromise is reflected in \nsection 1085. This language is very important to permitting parimutuel \nwagering on horse racing to be exempted from the prohibition on \nInternet gambling that we are enacting.\n  The new language makes explicit which was implicit and assures that \nevery State has the right to establish requirements for Internet and \nphone wagering that will best serve the public and governmental \ninterests of the State and to do so, if it wishes, before such wagering \ntakes place. I believe this is so important because it ensures that a \nState will have its traditional authority to safeguard the interests of \nits consumers and racing industry through the regulatory and approval \nprocess of proposed phone or Internet wagering.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today the Senate considers S. 692, \nentitled the ``Internet Gaming Prohibition Act.'' As my colleagues \nknow, I support this measure but from the day this bill was introduced \nI have had concerns about its scope. As Chairman of the Committee on \nIndian Affairs I have been concerned that existing law, namely the \nIndian Gaming Regulatory Act, would be irreparably harmed unless we \nmade certain changes to the bill.\n  This is an important bill and I support the intent of the bill's \nsponsors to make it more difficult for this kind of gaming to be \nconducted, particularly by underage players.\n  If enacted, this bill would prohibit Internet gambling, but make \nexceptions for certain segments of the gaming industry which currently \nuse a variety of technologies to enhance traditional gaming.\n  It is important for my colleagues to realize that the bill does not \nprohibit all forms of gaming using available high-technology. When I \nreviewed S. 692 for the first time, I realized that certain gaming \nactivities currently being conducted by Indian tribes would be \nprohibited by this bill.\n  My concerns centered on the fact that the same or similar activities \nwere allowed to other entities--such as the states, the horse-racing \nindustry and others--that were disallowed to tribes. This fundamental \ninequity is what led me to propose fair treatment for tribal \ngovernmental gaming.\n  In addition to issues of equity, the economic impacts of Indian \ngaming are substantial and should be acknowledged. These revenues \nprovide an important source of development capital and jobs for many \ntribes across the country. Contrary to the views many here hold, Indian \ngaming is very highly regulated by federal, state and tribal officials, \nand has been subject to federal law for eleven years.\n  I addressed my concerns to the Senate Judiciary Committee in June of \nthis year and began discussions on how best to address currently-legal \nIndian gaming in S. 692. My main concerns with drafting any language \ndealing with Indian gaming and the IGRA centered on the following \nrequirements:\n  1. All gaming must be legal under current federal law;\n  2. All class III gaming (casino style) must be conducted pursuant to \na tribal state compact; and\n  3. All aspects of the game must take place on Indian Lands (game, \nplayer, facility, server, etc.).\n  It is critical to note that there is no tribe in the U.S. that is \ncurrently offering online/Internet betting. Instead, several tribes \ncurrently use widely-available technology to broadcast bingo to \nnumerous operations located on Indian lands or to link class III games \nfor the purpose of determining an aggregate betting pool for the \npurpose of offering bigger prizes.\n  It is my understanding in supporting the substitute along with my \namendment, that S. 692 allows tribes to continue their current \npractices regarding the use of technology to enhance the effectiveness \nand profitability of their operations, but does not authorize any tribe \nto operate betting on the Internet as it currently perceived by the \ngeneral public.\n  The specific provisions of my amendment address all currently legal \nclass II and class III gaming, as defined in the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. Sec. 2701 et seq.\n  Accordingly, for Indian gaming activities to not run afoul of the \nprovisions of S. 692\n  1. The game must be conducted according to the requirements of IGRA.\n  2. All persons making or receiving a bet, or transmitting information \nregarding a bet must be on Indian lands. That means all aspects of the \ngame must be located on tribal land, including the person playing the \ngame, the actual machine which is the game, and any computer server \nwhich may be used to keep track of information relating to the play of \nthe game. In the case of a satellite (which cannot be located on Indian \nland), all machinery used to receive the signal must be located on \nIndian land.\n  3. The game must be conducted on an interactive computer service \nwhich uses a closed-loop subscriber based service or a private network.\n  4. Where class III games are conducted, each tribe participating in a \nnetwork must have a compact which authorizes games to be conducted \nusing the technology described, that is, an interactive computer \nservice which uses a closed-loop subscriber-based service or a private \nnetwork. It is critical to understand that this means that a tribe must \nhave a compact only in the state in which they are located, not that \nthey compact with every state in which the network is located.\n  5. In jurisdictions where class III gaming is currently using \ntechnology to link games, but either have compacts which do not \nspecifically authorize networked games, or that do authorize these \ngames, but do not contain the specific authorization required in S. \n692, the amendment allows them to continue the operations of those \ngames until the expiration of their current compact. The current \nlanguage addressing technology that is included in most compacts does \nnot contain the exact terminology as defined in S. 692.\n  Additionally, there are other states where language that addresses \nthe use of technology is not contained in the compact, but the state \nhas consented to the use of technology. My amendment contains a \n``grandfather clause'' for those operations, which will run until their \ncompacts expire by their own terms. Once a tribe's compact expires, the \ncompact must be renegotiated and will be required to contain language \nwhich conforms to the requirements of S. 692.\n  Contrary to the views of some, Indian tribes are not generally \ninterested in operating games which are broadcast on the ``world wide \nweb'' or the Internet, and in which a person sitting in their home may \n``log on'' to a computer and begin placing bets.\n  Indian tribes are, however, interested in continuing the operation of \nthe games they currently have, and which they have agreed with their \nstates are legal. This amendment allows them to do just that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe Internet Gambling Prohibition Act of 1999. I voted against this \nbill when it was brought to the floor last year as an amendment to an \nappropriations bill and again this year when it came through the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I am pleased to see that Senator Kyl was able to reach an agreement \nwith Senator Campbell and others to address Indian gaming issues. The \nbill's special treatment of certain forms of gambling was one of the \nreasons I voted against this bill when it was before the Judiciary \nCommittee. It allowed state lotteries, fantasy sports leagues, and \nhorse and dog track racing to continue to operate over the Internet, \nbut prohibited use of the Internet for Indian gaming, which is \nexpressly authorized by federal law. Under Senator Campbell's amendment \nto S. 692, Indian gaming can continue to operate over the Internet \nunder certain circumstances.\n  While I am glad to see the Indian gaming issue addressed, I \nnevertheless remain concerned with the fact that this bill singles out \none emerging technology, the Internet, to try to attack the broad, \ncomplex social problems associated with gambling. The Internet is an \nevolving technology, and its full potential as a medium of expression \nhas not been reached. While I share some of the concerns about the \ndangers of gambling that have inspired the sponsors of this \nlegislation, I am reluctant to start down the path of restricting the \nuse of the Internet for any particular lawful purpose. Once we have \nprohibited gambling on the Internet, what will be the next on-line \nactivity that we will try\n\n[[Page S14870]]\n\nto ban? We need to be very careful not to create a precedent that might \nstifle the commercial and educational development of this very exciting \ntechnological tool with unhealthy implications for the First Amendment. \nI fear that this bill starts us down a road in that direction.\n  Mr. President, in light of the expressed sentiment of this body last \nyear, I did not object to the unanimous consent request to pass this \nbill in the closing days of this session, but I would like the record \nto reflect my continuing opposition to this bill.\n  Thank you.

Farias and \n     Samantha Reid Date-Rape Drug Prohibition Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Gamma hydroxybutyric acid (also called G, Liquid X, \n     Liquid Ecstasy, Grievous Bodily Harm, Georgia Home Boy, \n     Scoop) has become a significant and growing problem in law \n     enforcement. At least 20 States have scheduled such drug in \n     their drug laws and law enforcement officials have been \n     experiencing an increased presence of the drug in driving \n     under the influence, sexual assault, and overdose cases \n     especially at night clubs and parties.\n       (2) A behavioral depressant and a hypnotic, gamma \n     hydroxybutyric acid (``GHB'') is being used in conjunction \n     with alcohol and other drugs with detrimental effects in an \n     increasing number of cases. It is difficult to isolate the \n     impact of such drug's ingestion since it is so typically \n     taken with an ever-changing array of other drugs and \n     especially alcohol which potentiates its impact.\n       (3) GHB takes the same path as alcohol, processes via \n     alcohol dehydrogenase, and its symptoms at high levels of \n     intake and as impact builds are comparable to alcohol \n     ingestion/intoxication. Thus, aggression and violence can be \n     expected in some individuals who use such drug.\n       (4) If taken for human consumption, common industrial \n     chemicals such as gamma butyrolactone and 1.4-butanediol are \n     swiftly converted by the body into GHB. Illicit use of these \n     and other GHB analogues and precursor chemicals is a \n     significant and growing law enforcement problem.\n       (5) A human pharmaceutical formulation of gamma \n     hydroxybutyric acid is being developed as a treatment for \n     cataplexy, a serious and debilitating disease. Cataplexy, \n     which causes sudden and total loss of muscle control, affects \n     about 65 percent of the estimated 180,000 Americans with \n     narcolepsy, a sleep disorder. People with cataplexy often are \n     unable to work, drive a car, hold their children or live a \n     normal life.\n       (6) Abuse of illicit GHB is an imminent hazard to public \n     safety that requires immediate regulatory action under the \n     Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.).\n\n     [SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan, Mr. Abraham, who has been a real leader on this bill, for any \ncomments he might have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I wanted to make a few comments about the \nlegislation we are about to pass. Before I do so, I would like to thank \na number of people for their help in this effort.\n  First, I would like to thank my colleagues who cosponsored this \nlegislation: Senators Feinstein, Lieberman, DeWine, Grassley, \nCoverdell, and Graham. Their support was crucial to moving forward with \nthis bill and doing so in a timely fashion. Second, I would like to \nthank Senator Hatch, his Judiciary Chief Counsel Manus Cooney, his \nDeputy Chief Counsel Sharon Prost, his Chief of Staff Patricia Knight, \nand Bruce Artim and Pattie DeLoatche, all of whose commitment to seeing \nthis effort through to fruition I appreciate both for the advice and \nguidance they provided and as the act of friendship I recognize it to \nbe. Third, I would like to thank Senator Biden and his staff, \nespecially Marcia Lee, whose assistance and cooperation in working out \na final version of this bill acceptable to all involved, including the \nAdministration, was indispensable. I would also like to thank my good \nfriend Fred Upton, who first brought the serious problem that is the \nfocus of this legislation to my attention, and Congressman Bliley and \nhis able staff, especially John Manthei, who patiently tolerated and \nassisted with the vagaries of bicameral legislative drafting. Finally, \nI would like to thank my own staff, especially my Subcommittee General \nCounsel Chase Hutto, who worked tirelessly and creatively on this \neffort, and Lee Otis, my Subcommittee Chief Counsel.\n  S. 1561, and its counterpart, H.R. 2130, are named for a young woman \nby the name of Samantha Reid. Samantha was born in the Henry Ford \nHospital in Detroit on January 2, 1984. She grew up in Lincoln Park. \nShe played trumpet in her elementary school band. She was a girl scout \nfor eight years, with the help of her mother, Judi Clark, who was a \ntroop leader. She was an ``all star'' 6th grade baseball player. She \nwent on to attend Carlson High School in Gibraltar, where she played \nfreshman basketball. Her favorite restaurant was McDonald's, and her \nfavorite meal there was a Big Mac. She loved to go to Cedar Point \nAmusement Park, and got mad if she couldn't go at least twice a year. \nShe earned her spending money by helping around the house with chores \nand babysitting, and indeed, on February 11, 1995, she earned an award \nfor outstanding performance in completing babysitting training from the \nCity of Lincoln Park. Her mother called her ``Hammy Sammy'' because of \nthe way she always smiled in pictures. Her older brother Charles Reid, \nwho is 18, remembers and misses her loud voice.\n\n[[Page S14873]]\n\n  On January 17, 1999, Samantha died a few weeks after turning 15. She \nand two friends, none of them yet 16, were at a party given by a 25 \nyear-old man in Woodhaven, Michigan. Samantha Reid drank a Mountain \nDew--a soft drink--and passed out within minutes. She vomited in her \nsleep, and she died. Her friend, Melanie Sindone, also 15, passed out \nas well. Melanie lapsed into a coma, but she has survived.\n  These two girls had no reason to believe that they were drinking \nanything dangerous. But they were wrong. Their drinks had been laced \nwith the drug GHB, commonly known as a ``date rape drug.'' Samantha was \nundoubtedly slipped it for the purpose that this name suggests, \nalthough she died before that purpose was accomplished.\n  Mr. President, GHB and its analogues are becoming increasingly common \nin our nation. They are finding their way into nightclubs, onto \ncampuses and into homes. They are being used by sexual predators \nagainst young--sometimes very young--women. Their unwitting victims may \nbe raped, become violently ill, and even die.\n  GHB is especially dangerous because it is relatively easy to produce. \nAccording to the DEA, the clandestine synthesis involves the use of two \ncommon, non-regulated chemicals: gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), the primary \nprecursor chemical, and sodium hydroxide (lye). GBL is a solvent with a \nwide range of industrial uses. Tens of thousands of metric tons are \nproduced annually and it is readily available from chemical supply \ncompanies. The synthesis is a simple one-pot method requiring no \nspecial chemical expertise. In addition, kits for making GHB containing \nGBL and sodium hydroxide are being sold on the Internet. GBL, once \nabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration, is \nreadily converted to GHB in the body and produces the same profile of \nphysiological and behavioral effects as GHB. The combination of the \nease with which GHB can be produced and widespread ignorance about \nGHB's dangers especially among our nation's youth has led the law \nenforcement community to view GHB as a serious and growing threat.\n  The Controlled Substances Act provides an administrative mechanism \nfor the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of HHS, to \nplace dangerous substances susceptible of abuse on a ``schedule'' of \ncontrolled substances, thereby restricting access to them and imposing \ncriminal penalties for their illicit sale and manufacture. The Attorney \nGeneral and the Secretary are in agreement that GHB should in fact be \nscheduled, but they are in disagreement over which schedule it should \nbe placed on. This is because GHB is currently under investigational \nuse as a means of treating narcolepsy and cataplexy, afflictions \naffecting about 70,000 Americans, and HHS has been understandably \nreluctant to agree that GHB belongs on Schedule I or II, which would \ncarry the most serious penalties for illicit sale, because the security \nrequirements that would accompany such scheduling would interfere with \nthis medical research. On the other hand, the DEA has been \nunderstandably reluctant to agree to any lesser scheduling, because the \nresult would be lower penalties for the unauthorized sale and \ndistribution of this drug. Moreover, under the Controlled Substances \nAct, the fact that GHB is under investigation for possible medical use \nprecludes the Attorney General from using her emergency authority to \nschedule it as an ``imminent hazard to the public safety.''\n  The result has been an administrative deadlock that has resulted in a \ncomplete failure to schedule GHB at all. Hence legislative intervention \nis needed.\n  This legislation has been drafted as a specific response to these \nvarious competing considerations, which the current scheduling \ncategories are not all that well suited to handle in any event. \nNotwithstanding the current investigational medical use, the \nlegislation determines that GHB is an imminent hazard to public safety. \nIt therefore directs the Attorney General to place it on the schedule \non which imminent hazards are ordinarily placed, which is Schedule I. \nIt relaxes the physical security requirements that would ordinarily \napply to Schedule I substances for the investigational medical uses of \nthe drug, however, following the recommendation of the Secretary of HHS \non what is appropriate in that area and thereby avoiding interfering \nwith the ongoing research. It also makes clear that should this \nresearch pay off with a drug that the FDA approves because it concludes \nthat it can responsibly be prescribed to treat narcolepsy, cataplexy, \nor other diseases, the FDA approved drug will be classified as a \nSchedule III drug, although the Attorney General can impose additional \nrecord keeping requirements to help assure that it is not diverted to \nimproper uses. Finally, anyone involved in selling or distributing the \ndiverted product will be subject to the same tough ``Schedule I'' \npenalties that apply to the sale or distribution of the illicit or \nunapproved drug.\n  In practice, this means that while medical research will continue \nunhampered by the most cumbersome consequences of placing this drug in \nSchedule I, the harsh penalties provided for the sale, manufacture, and \ndistribution of all Schedule I substances will apply to any and all \nillicit trafficking in GHB, whether the drug originated in a bathtub or \na medical facility. This means that traffickers will be subject to a 20 \nyear statutory maximum for distributing this drug, and that if, as in \nthe case of Samantha Reid, the drug is slipped to someone who dies, or \nif it is slipped to someone who is raped or suffers serious bodily \ninjury, that 20 year maximum become a 20 year minimum.\n  This legislation also addresses three other major problems society \nhas had in responding to the threat posed by this drug. First, it would \nrequire the Attorney General to develop, and make available to Federal, \nState, and local authorities, model protocols for taking toxicology \nspecimens and victim statements in connection with suspected crimes \ninvolving GHB and other controlled substances or so-called designer \ndrugs. The Attorney General also would be required to provide training \nmaterials for law enforcement officials responsible for investigating \nthese offenses. And finally, she would be directed to make a grant for \nthe development of standardized tests that could be used in the field \nto test for the presence of these drugs.\n  The reason for these requirements is that even many in law \nenforcement are unfamiliar with the operation of GHB. As a result, they \nmay defer testing for it or taking victim statements on the mistaken \nassumption that the victim is drunk and will be more coherent later, \nwhereas in fact this drug can be processed very quickly by the body and \nno longer be detectable at that time. Moreover, the victim's memory may \nbe impaired by the substance and she may forget events that she would \nhave remembered had her statement been taken more quickly. Hence the \nneed for model protocols, training, and tests.\n  Second, the legislation directs the Secretary of HHS to conduct a \nNational Awareness Campaign about the dangers of GHB. Consciousness of \nthe dangers of this drug is lagging far behind the threat the drug \npresents, and it is critical that we make it a national priority to \nremedy that problem.\n  Finally, the legislation would direct the Attorney General to examine \nand recommend improvements to current mechanisms for coordinating \nfederal, state and local investigations and prosecutions in this area. \nAnd it would establish a special unit within the DEA to assess the \nfederal response to the abuse and trafficking of GHB, other controlled \nsubstances, and other designer drugs associated with sexual assault, \nrecommended any reallocations of enforcement resources necessary to \nimprove that response, and direct the Attorney General to make any such \nreallocations she believes are appropriate.\n  It is time to act, Mr. President, to save young people, and young \nwomen in particular, from these deadly drugs and the predators who use \nthem.\n  I ask my colleagues to give their full support to this amendment.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that a number of letters from families \nand victims of date-rape drugs be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S14874]]\n\n\n         Trinka D. Porrata, Designer Drugs--Teaching & Consulting,\n                                    Pasadena, CA, October 3, 1999.\n     Senator Spencer Abraham,\n     329 Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: I'm writing in support of Senate Bill \n     1561. For four years, my life has revolved around a world of \n     drug abuse little known by law enforcement, medical \n     personnel, politicians and parents. I've watched MDMA explode \n     worldwide in the rave, college and club scenes. I've seen \n     flunitrazepam (Rohypnol, aka roofies) make its mark on sexual \n     assaults. I've seen LSD resurface. And, I've watched in \n     horror as the drug gamma hydroxy butyrate (GHB) has marched \n     coast to coast, plucking out young lives in its path, picking \n     up momentum as it goes. I consider it simply the most \n     dangerous drug I've encountered in 25 years as a police \n     officer. This is because of the overwhelming amount of \n     misinformation spread about GHB, the dramatic lack of real \n     scientific knowledge of it,the difficulty in testing for it \n     and recognizing it in the street, and how easily and \n     unpredictably it kills. GHB is indeed the Bad Child of the \n     Internet. And, it has forever change the face of sexual \n     assault investigations.\n       Despite a world brimming with technology and communication \n     devices, knowledge of this drug has been based primarily on \n     information via the Internet that runs the gamut from \n     outdated to totally false. Any drug abuser or drug pusher can \n     go on the Internet and pump out volumes of lies and half \n     truths unabated. There are thousands of websites claiming GHB \n     to be the wonder drug that will cure anything you can think \n     of and instructing everyone NOT to call 911 for the victim of \n     a GHB overdose. Deadly advice indeed. Meanwhile, government, \n     law enforcement and the medical world have failed to make \n     significant gain in countering the flood of bad information, \n     identifying and making available accurate testing methods \n     for it and providing even the most basic education about \n     GHB. The ``system'' has truly failed the American public \n     on this drug. As a friend of Samantha Reid, the 15-year-\n     old Michigan victim of GHB, so aptly put it, ``You tell us \n     every day about marijuana and other drugs. Why didn't you \n     tell us about GHB?'' Daily, I am asked by the families who \n     have lost loved ones to GHB--``I've never heard of this \n     drug. Why, why didn't we know about this drug?''\n       Each day that GHB is not a federally controlled substance \n     is another day of failure by the ``system.'' No, controlling \n     a drug does not solve the problem, but it allows additional \n     resources to be plugged into the tasks of educating the \n     public, providing more standardized information to law \n     enforcement, and developing testing procedures. It would be a \n     giant step toward stopping the lies about GHB as a totally \n     safe, wonder drug.\n       There isn't a meaningful data collection mechanism to \n     capture drug trends like this. Existing systems are \n     cumbersome, far behind in reporting statistics, and non-\n     responsive to changing trends. In early 1997, the tally of \n     GHB-related deaths kept by the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration was seven. We knew that there was no way to \n     put a figure on the possible number of deaths related to GHB \n     where neither law enforcement nor the coroners knew to test \n     for it. During our hearings before the California \n     Legislature, Dennis Fraga showed up on the witness list. He \n     arrived with autopsy report in hand, showing that his 25-\n     year-old son, Jeffery, had died from alcohol and GHB \n     ingestion. We realized that if we hadn't known about this \n     death, there were undoubtedly more where the coroner knew \n     that GHB was involved but hadn't known to report it to \n     anyone. Dr. Jim Tolliver, who was at that time tracking GHB \n     information for the DEA, began to make inquiries around the \n     country, and the death count rapidly jumped to 26. The death \n     toll continued to slowly increase, based on word of mouth, \n     followed by the DEA obtaining a copy of the autopsy to review \n     before including each death in the tally. Still, there was no \n     reporting mechanism, no blanket means of obtaining \n     information. Despite DEA polling its offices, where knowledge \n     of this drug was limited by DEA agents and local authorities, \n     it was obvious that not all cases were being spotted. I have \n     personally worked closely with Dr. Chris Sannerud, who is now \n     tracking GHB data for the DEA, and have referred numerous \n     leads about deaths to her for investigation.\n       The count recently jumped to 49. I would like to point out \n     to you that of the 49, ten have been in 1999. Furthermore, 25 \n     additional cases have come to light, all but one of them in \n     1999. These cases are now being reviewed. That would mean \n     more than 30 in 1999 to date. The victims get younger. More \n     of them involve GHB and its analogs only (no alcohol or other \n     drugs). I receive leads on GHB related death and rape cases \n     virtually daily. And, we have only scratched the surface at \n     this point. Law enforcement, legislators, doctors and parents \n     are still largely unfamiliar with GHB. Remember too, these \n     figures do not reflect the victims of impaired drivers under \n     the influence of GHB.\n       Meanwhile, the drug company and the pro-drug abuse element \n     want to divert attention saying that it is the homebrew \n     aspect of GHB that is the problem and that it is only \n     dangerous with alcohol and other drugs. The homebrew aspect \n     occasionally adds an extra element of burns from high pH \n     levels. But that isn't the problem. It is GHB that impairs, \n     resulting in dangerous  users behind the wheel causing \n     accidents and deaths and resulting in victims unable to \n     protect themselves from sexual assault. Look beyond the \n     smoke and mirrors. The fact remains: 25-year-olds don't \n     die from a .17 blood alcohol; Jeffery Fraga died that \n     night BECAUSE he took GHB. Samantha Reid was drinking a \n     Mountain Dew the night she died. And 20-year olds don't \n     die from sleeping face down on a pillow . . . unless in \n     coma from GHB ingestion. Kyle Hagmann took it as a sleep \n     aid (after reading on the Internet that it is ``totally \n     safe''), not a recreational drug. It is GHB that kills.\n       Not nearly enough is known about this drug from a medical \n     and scientific viewpoint. The literature is old and outdated. \n     New information is being learned daily and still not nearly \n     enough is known. The old literature says GHB is not \n     addictive. We know this to be untrue. In fact, withdrawal \n     from GHB addiction is life threatening. This is simply not a \n     market-ready product--any drug that is leaving 13-year olds \n     suffering pulmonary edema in our nation's hospitals and \n     alleys is not ready for market. One doctor with nine years of \n     GHB research walked away from it, saying a much safer, longer \n     acting product is needed. One doctor currently researching \n     GHB for narcolepsy first told me personally that it was eight \n     to ten years away for being ready and changed his story only \n     after claims were publicized that the supply would cease for \n     research if it became a Schedule I drug. There is simply no \n     reason to give concessions to future issues re this drug. Let \n     the research take its course and determine the future. Other \n     drugs have been developed in Schedule I. I personally do not \n     believe it will be GHB, but a safer, longer acting cousin \n     that is yet to be developed. Don't let them bypass proper \n     research and development!!!!!\n       I have no doubt that if GHB is ever approved for \n     narcolepsy, the horror of abuse will only skyrocket as \n     doctors blatantly abuse the controversial, dangerous ``off \n     label use'' policy that would enable them to prescribe it for \n     anything, not just the combination of narcolepsy and \n     cataplexy of which it is being researched. There is simply no \n     mechanism in place that will prevent such abuse (there is \n     plenty of evidence of abuse of other drugs because of this \n     policy). And, I cannot imagine in my wildest dreams a company \n     saying, ``Oh excuse me, we are making too much money!!!!'' If \n     the Legislature is determined to deal with future issues, \n     then I adamantly urge that this drug be specifically excluded \n     from the ``off label use'' policy. Any use of GHB beyond \n     narcolepsy/cataplexy would require its own proper research \n     and development. If, as the drug company claims, their only \n     interest is for narcolepsy/cataplexy patients, then there is \n     simply no reason they would protest such a clause being \n     included.\n       There is much work to be done on this drug in all arenas. \n     The dangers of GHB need to made crystal clear to America's \n     youth and parents. Law enforcement, prosecutors and medical \n     personnel are not uniformly prepared to handle cases \n     involving GHB. GHB has brought to the sexual assault \n     investigation a unbelievably challenge to overcome and an \n     added horror for rape victims that I cannot even begin to \n     address in this document. As a start, we need to standardize \n     all sexual assault medical kits nationwide to include urine \n     samples from victims and upgrade investigative and testing \n     procedures. Changes need to be made in the impaired driving \n     world as well. Aggressive federal/state prosecution is needed \n     against manufacturers and distributors of GHB and analogs.\n       The GHB death toll speaks for itself. Legislation and \n     strong federal backing for education and enforcement is \n     clearly overdue and urgently needed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Trinka D. Porrata,\n     Drug Consultant.\n                                  ____\n\n     To the members of the judiciary committee:\n       On Jan. 17, 1999 I lost my only daughter, Samantha Reid, \n     when GHB and/or GBL was slipped into her Mountain Dew soft \n     drink. I knew nothing about GHB before this tragic event. I \n     took six months off of work and began educating myself on \n     GHB. The more I learn about this invisible predator the more \n     concerned for our nations safety I become.\n       I have joined Spencer Abraham on campaigning to pass S. \n     1561. This bill is long overdue in our country and contains \n     many positive programs for awareness and will give law \n     enforcement the much needed tools necessary to prosecute GHB \n     cases. S. 1561 will allow for education targeting teens who \n     are now receiving false information on GHB.

Mr. President, I would like to close by reading one of\n\n[[Page S14875]]\n\nthose letters, the letter I received from Judi Clark, Samantha Reid's \nmother, that, better than anything I can say, makes the case as to why \nthis legislation is needed now. She wrote this letter to the members of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  It is as follows:\n\n     To the Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee:\n       On January 17, 1999, I lost my only daughter, Samantha \n     Reid, when GHB and/or GBL was slipped into her Mountain Dew \n     soft drink. I knew nothing about GHB before this tragic \n     event. I took six months off of work and began educating \n     myself on GHB. The more I learned about this invisible \n     predator the more concerned for our nations safety I become.\n       I have joined Spencer Abraham on campaigning to pass S. \n     1561. This bill is long overdue in our country and contains \n     many positive programs for awareness, and will give law \n     enforcement the much needed tools necessary to prosecute GHB \n     cases. S. 1561 will allow for education targeting teens who \n     are now receiving false information on GHB. A nationwide \n     awareness campaign will give many young ladies the \n     information necessary to protect and ultimately save \n     themselves from GHB. Parents can be reached through public \n     service announcements giving them the opportunity to \n     communicate the dangers of GHB to their children.\n       Samantha and I were not given the opportunity that S. 1561 \n     has to offer. Lets not wait for one more senseless death \n     before passing this legislation. Not one more mother should \n     have to water the grass of a fresh grave, or place wind \n     chimes on a tender young tree planted to shade the site of \n     their daughter. Pumpkins for Halloween should be carved at \n     the kitchen table together, not placed by a headstone.\n       Our country is in desperate need of all the good this bill \n     has to offer.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                       Judi Clark,\n                                               Rockwood, Michigan.\n\n  Mr. President, I would say in closing that I am happy we have finally \ntaken the action which Judi Clark and other parents across this country \nhave been asking us to take, to make sure that other children will be \nmade aware of the dangers of GHB. Hopefully the predators who use drugs \nsuch as this will be treated in the fashion they deserve, which is to \nbe prosecuted effectively and put behind bars where they belong.\n  No one else should have to go through what this family has suffered.\n  I am very determined to not only see this legislation pass, but also \nto work closely with the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement \nAgency, and State and local law enforcement agencies, to make sure this \nis just the first step in what will ultimately be a successful campaign \nto rid this Nation of the illicit use of this drug, and to make sure \nthe children of our country are no longer the victims of predators who \nuse it for criminal purposes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Michigan for \nhis leadership and his eloquent statement.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Today, the Senate adopted a significant \nmeasure against date rape and other heinous crimes associated with \nabusing certain types of drugs. I want to make a few comments on this \nbill, S. 1561, which addresses the abuse of the dangerous drug GHB \nwhich has been used to commit date rape and other crimes.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am proud that it was \na member of our Committee, Senator Spencer Abraham, who introduced and \nhas played the key leadership role in Senate passage of S. 1561, The \nSamantha Reid and Hillory J. Farias Date Rape Prohibition Act of \n1999.'' I am also proud that other members of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenators DeWine, Feinstein, and Grassley have joined Senator Abraham in \nco-sponsoring this legislation.\n  It is only through the hard work and insistence of Senator Abraham \nthat this bill will pass the Senate today. I also want to commend his \nable staff, especially Lee Otis and Chase Hutto, who have spent \nconsiderable time and effort in improving this legislation. Their \nefforts were in the best tradition of staff of the United States \nSenate.\n  I also want to thank my friend on the other side of the aisle, \nSenator Biden, who has long been in the forefront of controlled \nsubstances and other drug abuse issues. I must also recognize the \nefforts of Ms. Marcia Lee of his staff for her diligence and creativity \nin developing this language.\n  I must also recognize the efforts of Chairmen Thomas Bliley and Fred \nUpton for their work in developing and sheparding the House companion \nto S. 1561, H.R. 2310, through that body. In this regard, I must \nmention the efforts of John Manthei of the House Commerce Committee as \nwell as Ms. Jane Williams of Rep. Upton's staff. Both of them deserve \nrecognition for their dedication to passing this bill.\n  S. 1561 is concerned with the proper regulation of gamma hydrobutyric \nacid, the chemical known on the street as GHB which has both hateful \nand hopeful uses. On one hand, many families across America have \nsuffered due to abuse of this agent which has been used to lull \nunsuspecting women into a date-rape situation and has even resulted in \ndeath through overdose. On the other hand, GHB holds unprecedented \npromise to those one-quarter million Americans suffering from extreme \nsleep disorders such as cataplexy and narcolepsy.\n  Cataplexy is a debilitating condition suffered by some 70,000 \nAmericans that results in an inability of the muscles to function. \nNarcolepsy, which attacks 170,000 Americans, causes a person suddenly \nand unpredictably to fall asleep. Neither of these terrible diseases \nhave an effective treatment today. As author of the 1984 Orphan Drug \nAct which creates incentives for private sector drug firms to \ninvestigate treatments for rare diseases, I am particularly sensitive \nto the needs of families suffering from low-prevalence conditions. We \nneed to do everything we can to get academic researchers and the \npharmaceutical industry to find cures for the hundreds of currently \nuntreatable rare diseases.\n  The problem for policymakers, both in the Congress and at the DEA, is \nhow to encourage the use of the medically promising uses of GHB while \ndiscouraging and outlawing the illicit uses such as date rape.\n  While there are no known cases of diversion of this drug from the on-\ngoing and highly promising clinical trials of GHB as a treatment for \ncataplexy and narcolepsy, the problem of GHB abuse demands our \nattention.\n  According to DEA, hospital and law enforcement officials have \nreported about 5,500 cases of GHB abuse, including 49 deaths. Aggregate \nstatistics, as alarming as they may be, cannot convey the absolute \nupheaval that GHB abuse can cause for an individual and a family.\n  Senator Abraham has told me the story about the untimely death of a \nbright and vivacious 15-year-old young woman from Michigan, Samantha \nReid. She went to a small gathering of friends, was given a drink from \na soft drink bottle laced with GHB, and died. Samantha did nothing \nwrong. Her mother, Judi Clark, did nothing wrong. Unfortunately, this \ntragedy has struck this family.\n  Four young men have been charged under Michigan law for involuntary \nmanslaughter and poisoning. But, given the prevalence and, as the Reid \ncase highlights, the potential severity of GHB abuse, it seems clear--\nand both public health and law enforcement officials agree on this--\nthat this chemical warrants regulation under the Controlled Substances \nAct. That's exactly what S. 1561 and its House companion accomplish.\n  Some may raise a question about whether the federal Controlled \nSubstances Act failed to operate in a fashion that could have prevented \ndeaths or sexual assaults through abuse of GHB.\n  Although there have been reports of substantial GHB abuse for several \nyears now, I do not know why the Attorney General and Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services have been unable to resolve the matters that \nhave precluded this drug from being scheduled through the normal \nprocedures under the Controlled Substances Act. I don't know why it \ntook until September of 1997 for the DEA to request FDA to analyze the \nmedical and scientific matters relating to GHB. I don't know why it \ntook until May 19, 1999 to get a response to this request. I don't know \nwhy DEA has not acted in the last six months to bring this matter to a \nconclusion through administrative means. It should not take an act of \nCongress to schedule a dangerous drug under the Controlled Substances \nAct.\n\n  I do know that part of the unjustifiable delay in the scheduling of \nGHB\n\n[[Page S14876]]\n\nstemmed from the fact that there is a difference of opinion between DEA \nand FDA about how to schedule this drug. But that answer is not good \nenough. It is simply inadequate to tell a mother of a child like \nSamantha Reid, a promising young woman with her whole life ahead of \nher, that the system ``just takes time'' because two bureaucracies \ndisagreed about how something so serious should be handled.\n  This situation points out that a significant breakdown in the system \nhas occurred with respect to the scheduling of GHB. It behooves the \nCongress to deliberate more over ways to make the key agencies, DEA and \nFDA, be more responsive in the future, rather than be forced to do \ntheir jobs for them. The lesson of GHB should not be to teach the \nagencies to wait for Congressional action whenever the bureaucracy \ncannot act.\n  Let me just say that as a general matter I do not favor legislative \nscheduling or rescheduling. By statute, the responsibility for \nscheduling is delegated to the experts at DOJ and HHS. The world is \nturned upside down when DOJ informs Congress, as if did on May 3, 1999, \nthat: ``DOJ believes that it is appropriate for Congress to schedule \nGHB at this time.''\n  By any measure, a fair reading of the Controlled Substances Act \nplaces the primary responsibility for regulating dangerous drugs upon \nlaw enforcement and public health experts at the appropriate federal \nagencies. I do have a concern about Congress legislating on the safety \nand efficacy of individual drug products, especially before clinical \ntesting or introduction into commerce commences. Nor should we allow \nthe Congress to be placed in the position of making technical, \nscientific and law enforcement judgment whenever an individual drug \nproduct with an actual or potential legitimate medicinal use is \ndetermined by experts to warrant the application of the CSA.\n  I am firmly behind efforts to stop so-called ``date rapes,''; this is \na despicable crime and the Federal Government should take action to \nmake sure it does not occur. While I wholeheartedly applaud the efforts \nof the House to strike a blow against abuse of GHB, I am concerned \nabout Congress getting directly involved in the scheduling process as \nthe House mandated in adopting H.R. 2130. In this regard, it was my \nstrong sense that rather than for Congress to legislatively schedule \nGHB, it would have more impact to amend the statute and direct DEA to \nimplement the Surgeon General's recommendations that were issued back \non May 19, 1999.\n  I will not take the time today to consider the full implications of a \npolicy of legislative rescheduling. I do plan in the future to re-\nexamine the scheduling provisions of the Controlled Substances Act.\n  At this point, let me elaborate further on some of the issues I have \nraised.\n  Subsections (b) and (c) of section 201 of the Controlled Substances \nAct identify eight criteria that must be taken into account in \nscheduling a drug. With respect to scheduling a drug, these factors \nare:\n\n       (1) Its actual or relative potential for abuse.\n       (2) Scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, if \n     known.\n       (3) The state of current scientific knowledge regarding the \n     drug or other substance.\n       (4) Its history and current pattern of abuse.\n       (5) The scope, duration, and significance of abuse.\n       (6) What, if any, risk there is to the public health.\n       (7) Its psychic or physiological dependence liability.\n       (8) Whether the substance is an immediate precursor of a \n     substance already controlled under this title.\n\n  The statute proscribes that.\n\n       The recommendations of the Secretary (of Health and Human \n     Services) to the Attorney General shall be binding on the \n     Attorney General as to such scientific and medical matters, \n     and if the Secretary recommends that a drug or other \n     substance not be controlled, the Attorney General shall not \n     control the drug or other substances.\n\n  This is the section of the law which appears not to have functioned \noptimally in the case of GHB. We can, and should, do better in \nanticipating and combating the next GHB.\n  To a large degree, the legislation we adopt today implements the May \n19, 1999 HHS recommendations and the accompanying ``Eight Factor \nAnalysis Report'' that take into account both the illicit abuse of GHB \nas well as the highly promising legitimate uses of this substance. \nWhile I believe that the language worked out by Senators Abraham and \nBiden, Chairman Bliley, Chairman McCollum, and the DEA, is preferable \nto the earlier versions of the bill, I remain troubled by some aspects \nof how the current statute has worked and may work in the future.\n\n  First, I am troubled that if we place promising pharmaceutical \ncandidates such as GHB into Schedule I of the Controlled Substance Act \nwe undermine its integrity of the CSA and will discourage the \nlegitimate, potential life-saving uses of such compounds. According to \nthe statute, one of the three requirements of schedule I is that there \nis ``no accepted medical use'' in the United States. But the May 19, \n1999 HHS recommendation has already found that the cataplexy product \nhas cleared this hurdle:\n\n       . . . the abuse potential of GHB, when used under an \n     authorized research protocol, is consistent with substances \n     typically controlled under Schedule IV . . . An authorized \n     formulation of GHB is far enough along in the development \n     process to meet the standard under Schedule II of a drug or \n     substance having a ``currently accepted medical use with \n     severe restrictions.'' Under these circumstances, HHS \n     recommends placing authorized formulations of GHB in Schedule \n     III.\n\n  On October 12, 1999 DOJ sent a letter that disregards the May 19th \nHHS schedule III recommendation. DOJ first states ``. . . the DEA \nstrongly supports the control of GHB in Schedule I of the CSA'' and \nthen asserts: ``The data collected to date would support control of the \nGHB product in Schedule II.''\n  Second, in addition to giving no apparent deference to HHS on matters \nsupposedly binding on DOJ under section 201(b) of the CSA, DOJ almost \nseems to be interpreting the statute as requiring full FDA approval \nbefore the ``currently accepted medical use'' language of the CSA can \nbe satisfied. Such an outcome is neither compelled by the statute, nor \ndoes it reflect sound public health policy as it acts to discourage \ndrug development and patient access to promising drugs in clinical \ntrials.\n  I hasten to point out that I have advocated stiffening the penalties \nfor abuse of date-rape drugs such as GHB. In 1997 I successfully led \nthe charge to enact a law that imposed schedule I-level penalties for \nanother date rape drug, flunitrazepam. This product was marketed for \nlegitimate medical purposes overseas and did not meet the Schedule I \nrequirement that ``there is lack of accepted safety for use of the drug \nor other substance under medical supervision.'' Therefore, the Congress \npassed, and the President signed, my legislation to increase the \npenalties for this drug. But we stopped short of scheduling the \npharmaceutical into Schedule I, recognizing that the product does have \naccepted medical uses. It was my hope that this could be the model for \nGHB legislation as well.\n  I want to work constructively with my colleagues in Congress to \nachieve our common goals of taking immediate action against GHB, \npreserving the integrity of the CSA, and sending a strong message to \nthose agencies charged with implementing the CSA that they must work \ntogether in a cooperative and expeditious way to protect the American \npublic.\n  While I think the bill we adopt today might have been written \ndifferently, I agree with my colleagues that our foremost goal must be \nto take quick and decisive action with respect to the criminalization \nof GHB used for non-medical purposes. Senator Abraham's bill is a good \nbill and he deserves a lot of credit for putting this improved \nlegislative package together.\n  Let me also note that the bill we have just passed includes language \nI drafted requiring DEA to create a Special Unit to assess the abuse \nand trafficking of GHB and other date rape drugs, and will identify the \nthreat posed by date rape drugs on a national and regional basis. I am \npleased to be the sponsor of S. 1947, the bill that creates this \nSpecial Unit. S. 1947 has been incorporated in the final language that \nwe adopt today. I can assure all my colleagues that this is one Senator \nthat will closely review the Attorney General's report on the \nallocation and reallocation of resources to combat date rape and other \ncrimes related to designer drugs.\n  We can and should look further into the problems associated with the\n\n[[Page S14877]]\n\nscheduling of drugs under CSA and whether we need to change the \nrelevant laws. But today we honor the memory of Hillory Farias and \nSamantha Reid by taking an act that will hopefully reduce the risk of \nGHB abuse being visited upon unsuspecting women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S14877-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14877-S14878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ELECTRONIC BENEFIT TRANSFER INTEROPERABILITY AND PORTABILITY ACT OF \n                                  1999\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the passage \nof the Electronic Benefit Transfer Interoperability and Portability Act \nof 1999. This legislation addreses the problem of food stamp \nbeneficiaries being unable to redeem their benefits in authorized \nstores that may be located outside their state of residence.\n  As you may know, Congress passed legislation in 1996 that required \nthe federal government to deliver food stamp benefits electronically, \nrather than using paper coupons. Most states have started the process \nof issuing plastic cards, very similar to ATM cards, to access these \nbenefits. The federal government termed this new process, electronic \nbenefits transfer (EBT).\n  You may have noticed a separate button on the payment terminal in \nyour local supermarket with the designation ``EBT'' or a separate \nstand-along payment terminal to handle these new transactions.\n  More than half of the country has already switched from the paper \ncoupons\n\n[[Page S14878]]\n\nto this new EBT card. However, one significant issue is causing \nproblems in the program for retailers, states, and recipients. That \nissue is the inability of recipients to use their state-issued cards \nacross state lines. This is especially true in communities that are \nnear a state border.\n  Under the old paper system, recipients could use the coupons in any \nstate in the country. Under the new electronic system, that is the case \nCustomers go into a food store expecting to use their federal benefits \nto purchase food. When they cannot use their EBT cards, they become \nfrustrated and dissatisfied with the food stamp program.\n  For example, under the old system, a food stamp recipient living in \nPalmyra, Missouri could use his food stamp coupons in his favorite \ngrocery store in Quincy, Illinois, just over the border. Similarly, a \nrecipient living in Illinois could visit family in Tennessee and still \npurchase food for his children. Food stamp beneficiaries are not unlike \nthe average shopper. Cross-border shopping occurs for a variety of \nreasons. One reason is convenience; another equally important reason is \nthe cost of groceries. The supermarket industry is very competitive. \nCustomers paying with every type of tender except EBT have the ability \nto shop around for the best prices. Shouldn't recipients of our \nnation's federal food assistance benefits be able to stretch their \ndollars without regard to state borders?\n  Another reason for cross-border shopping is convenience. While one of \nmy constituents may live in the metro east area of Illinois, he or she \nmay work in St. Louis. Under the current situation, if the only grocery \nstore between work and home is in Missouri, the recipient cannot \npurchase food without traveling miles out of the way.\n  The legislation would once again provide for the portability of food \nassistance benefits and allow food stamp recipients the flexibility of \nshopping at locations that they choose.\n  Interoperability works well today with ATM/Debit cards, the type of \ncards that EBT was modeled after. Consumers and merchants are confident \nthat when a MAC card issued by a bank in Pittsburgh is presented, \nauthorization and settlement of that transaction will work the same as \nwhen a Star card, issued by Bank of America in California is presented. \nThis occurs regardless of where the merchant is located.\n  Unfortunately, this is currently not the case with EBT cards. If \nevery state operated their EBT program under a standard set of \noperating rules, as this legislation requires, companies operating in \nmultiple states could be more efficient, resolve any discrepancies in \ncustomer accounts more quickly, and ultimately hold down the price of \ngroceries for all consumers.\n  This legislation is more about good government than it is about food \nstamps. Since 1996, the transition from paper coupons to electronic \nbenefit transfers has saved the federal government a significant amount \nof money. For example, while the food stamp caseload decreased 24 \npercent from fiscal year 1995 to 1998, food stamp production and \nredemption costs dropped by an impressive 39 percent. While it is \nestimated that the bill's implementation will cost the federal \ngovernment no more than $500,000 annually, it will save at least $20 \nmillion per year when paper coupons are a thing of the past.\n  This legislation is sound public policy that enjoys strong bipartisan \nsupport. I thank my colleagues, Senators Leahy, Lugar, Harkin, Craig, \nCochran, Crapo, Kohl, and Kerrey for joining me as co-sponsors of this \nbill. This legislation is vitally important to every food stamp \nrecipient, every state food stamp program administrator, and every \ngrocery store in the country.\n  I thank the presiding officer, and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

(a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the \n     ``Continued Reporting of Intercepted Wire, Oral, and \n     Electronic Communications Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Section 2519(3) of title 18, United States Code, \n     requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the \n     United States Courts to transmit to Congress a full and \n     complete annual report concerning the number of applications \n     for orders authorizing or approving the interception of wire, \n     oral, or electronic communications. This report is required \n     to include information specified in section 2519(3).\n       (2) The Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 \n     provides for the termination of certain laws requiring \n     submittal to Congress of annual, semiannual, and regular \n     periodic reports as of December 21, 1999, 4 years from the \n     effective date of that Act.\n       (3) Due to the Federal Reports Elimination Act and Sunset \n     Act of 1995, the Administrative Office of United States \n     Courts is not required to submit that annual report described \n     in section 219(3) of title 18, United States Code, as of \n     December 21, 1999.\n       (c) Continued Reporting Requirements.--\n       (1) Continued reporting requirements.--Section 2519 of \n     title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(4) The reports required to be filed by subsection (3) \n     are exempted from the termination provisions of section \n     3003(a) of the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of \n     1995 (Public Law 104-66).''.\n       (2) Exemption.--Section 3003(d) of the Federal Reports \n     Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-66) is \n     amended--\n       (a) in paragraph (31), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (b) in paragraph (32), by striking the period and inserting \n     ``; or''; and\n       (c) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(33) section 2519(3) of title 18, United States Code.''.\n       (d) Encryption Reporting Requirements.--\n       (1) Section 2519(2)(b) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``and (iv)'' and inserting ``(iv) the \n     number of orders in which encryption was encountered and \n     whether such encryption prevented law enforcement from \n     obtaining the plain text of communications intercepted \n     pursuant to such order, and (v)''.\n       (2) The encryption reporting requirement in subsection (a) \n     shall be effective for the report transmitted by the Director \n     of the Administrative Office of the Courts for calendar year \n     2000 and in subsequent reports.\n       (e) Reports Concerning Pen Registers and Trap and Trace \n     Devices.--Section 3126 of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking the period and inserting ``, which report \n     shall include information concerning--\n       ``(1) the period of interceptions authorized by the order, \n     and the number and duration of any extensions of the order;\n       ``(2) the offense specified in the order or application, or \n     extension of an order;\n       ``(3) the number of investigations involved;\n       ``(4) the number and nature of the facilities affected; and\n       ``(5) the identity, including district, of the applying \n     investigative or law enforcement agency making the \n     application and the person authorizing the order.''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is today \nconsidering for final passage S. 1769, as amended by the House. I \nintroduced S. 1769 with Chairman Hatch on October 22, 1999 and it \npassed the Senate on November 5, 1999. This bill will continue and \nenhance the current reporting requirements for the Administrative \nOffice of the Courts and the Attorney General on the eavesdropping and \nsurveillance activities of our federal and state law enforcement \nagencies. The House amendment is the text of H.R. 3111, a bill to \nexempt from automatic elimination and sunset certain reports submitted \nto Congress that are useful and helpful in informing the Congress and \nthe public about the activities of federal agencies in the enforcement \nof federal law. I am also glad to support this amendment.\n  For many years, the Administrative Office (AO) of the Courts has \ncomplied with the statutory requirement, in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2519(3), to \nreport to Congress annually the number and nature of federal and state \napplications for orders authorizing or approving the interception of \nwire, oral or electronic communications. By letter dated September 3, \n1999, the AO advised that it would no longer submit this report because \n``as of December 21, 1999, the report will no longer be required \npursuant to the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995.'' I \ncommend the AO for alerting Congress that their responsibility for the \nwiretap reports would lapse at the end of this year, and for doing so \nin time for Congress to take action.\n  The AO has done an excellent job of preparing the wiretap reports. We \nneed to continue the AO's objective work in a consistent manner. If \nanother agency took over this important task at this juncture and the \nnumbers came out in a different format, it would immediately generate \nquestions and concerns over the legitimacy and accuracy of the contents \nof that report.\n  In addition, it would create difficulties in comparing statistics \nfrom prior years going back to 1969 and complicate the job of \ncongressional oversight. Furthermore, transferring this reporting duty \nto another agency might create delays in issuance of the report since \nno other agency has the methodology in place. Finally, federal, state \nand local agencies are well accustomed to the reporting methodology \ndeveloped by the AO. Notifying all these agencies that the reporting \nstandards and agency have changed would inevitably create more \nconfusion and more expense as law enforcement agencies across the \ncountry are forced to learn a new system and develop a liaison with a \nnew agency.\n  The system in place now has worked well and we should avoid any \ndisruptions. We know how quickly law enforcement may be subjected to \ncriticism over their use of these surreptitious surveillance tools and \nwe should avoid aggravating these sensitivities by changing the \nreporting agency and methodology on little to no notice. I appreciate, \nhowever, the AO's interest in transferring the wiretap reporting \nrequirement to another entity. Any such transfer must be accomplished \nwith a minimum of disruption to the collection and reporting of \ninformation and with complete assurances that any new entity is able to \nfulfill this important job as capably as the AO has done.\n  S. 1769 would update the reporting requirements currently in place \nwith one additional reporting requirement. Specifically, the bill would \nrequire the wiretap reports prepared beginning in calendar year 2000 to \ninclude information on the number of orders in which encryption was \nencountered and whether such encryption prevented law enforcement from \nobtaining the plain text of communications intercepted pursuant to such \norder.\n  Encryption technology is critical to protect sensitive computer and \nonline information. Yet, the same technology poses challenges to law \nenforcement when it is exploited by criminals to hide evidence or the \nfruits of criminal activities. A report by the U.S. Working Group on \nOrganized Crime titled, ``Encryption and Evolving Technologies: Tools \nof Organized Crime and Terrorism,'' released in 1997, collected \nanecdotal case studies on the use of encryption in furtherance of \ncriminal activities in order to estimate the future impact of \nencryption on law enforcement. The report noted the need for ``an \nongoing study of the effect of encryption and other information \ntechnologies on investigations, prosecutions, and intelligence \noperations''. As part of this study, ``a database of case information \nfrom federal and local law enforcement and intelligence agencies should \nbe established and maintained.'' Adding a requirement that reports be \nfurnished on the number of occasions when encryption is encountered by \nlaw enforcement is a far more reliable basis than anecdotal evidence on \nwhich to assess law enforcement needs and make sensible policy in this \narea.\n  The final section of S. 1769 would codify the information that the \nAttorney General already provides on pen register and trap and trace \ndevice orders, and would require further information on where such \norders are issued and the types of facilities--telephone, computer, \npager or other device--to which the order relates. Under the Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act (``ECPA'') of 1986, P.L. 99-508, codified at \n18 U.S.C. Sec. 3126, the Attorney General of the United States is \nrequired to report annually to the Congress on the number of pen \nregister orders and orders for trap and trace devices applied for by \nlaw enforcement agencies of the Department of Justice. As the original \nsponsor of ECPA, I believed that adequate oversight of the surveillance \nactivities of federal law enforcement could only be accomplished with \nreporting requirements such as the one included in this law.\n\n[[Page S14880]]\n\n  The reports furnished by the Attorney General on an annual basis \ncompile information from five components of the Department of Justice: \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the United \nStates Marshals Service and the Office of the Inspector General. The \nreport contains information on the number of original and extension \norders made to the courts for authorization to use both pen register \nand trap and trace devices, information concerning the number of \ninvestigations involved, the offenses on which the applications were \npredicted and the number of people whose telephone facilities were \naffected.\n  These specific categories of information are useful, and S. 1769 \nwould direct the Attorney General to continue providing these specific \ncategories of information. In addition, the bill would direct the \nAttorney General to include information on the identity, including the \ndistrict, of the agency making the application and the person \nauthorizing the order. In this way, the Congress and the public will be \ninformed of those jurisdictions using this surveillance technique--\ninformation which is currently not included in the Attorney General's \nannual reports.\n  The requirement for preparation of the wiretap reports will soon \nlapse so I am delighted to see the Congress take prompt action on this \nlegislation to continue the requirement for submission of the wiretap \nreports and to update the reporting requirements for both the wiretap \nreports submitted by the AO and the pen register and trap and trace \nreports submitted by the Attorney General.\n  Mr. President, I am also pleased that the Senate is today considering \nH.R. 3111 to exempt from automatic elimination and sunset certain \nreports submitted to Congress that are useful and helpful in informing \nthe Congress and the public about the activities of federal agencies in \nthe enforcement of federal law. Senator Hatch and I offer as an \namendment to H.R. 3111 the text of a bill S. 1769, which I introduced \nwith Chairman Hatch on October 22, 1999 and which passed the Senate on \nNovember 5, 1999.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The growth of electronic commerce and electronic \n     government transactions represent a powerful force for \n     economic growth, consumer choice, improved civic \n     participation and wealth creation.\n       (2) The promotion of growth in private sector electronic \n     commerce through Federal legislation is in the national \n     interest because that market is globally important to the \n     United States.\n       (3) A consistent legal foundation, across multiple \n     jurisdictions, for electronic commerce will promote the \n     growth of such transactions, and that such a foundation \n     should be based upon a simple, technology neutral, non-\n     regulatory, and market-based approach.\n       (4) The Nation and the world stand at the beginning of a \n     large scale transition to an information society which will \n     require innovative legal and policy approaches, and \n     therefore, States can serve the national interest by \n     continuing their proven role as laboratories of innovation \n     for quickly evolving areas of public policy, provided that \n     States also adopt a consistent, reasonable national baseline \n     to eliminate obsolete barriers to electronic commerce such as \n     undue paper and pen requirements, and further, that any such \n     innovation should not unduly burden inter-jurisdictional \n     commerce.\n       (5) To the extent State laws or regulations do not provide \n     a consistent, reasonable national baseline or in fact create \n     an undue burden to interstate commerce in the important \n     burgeoning area of electronic commerce, the national interest \n     is best served by Federal preemption to the extent necessary \n     to provide such consistent, reasonable national baseline \n     eliminate said burden, but that absent such lack of \n     consistent, reasonable national baseline or such undue \n     burdens, the best legal system for electronic commerce will \n     result from continuing experimentation by individual \n     jurisdictions.\n       (6) With due regard to the fundamental need for a \n     consistent national baseline, each jurisdiction that enacts \n     such laws should have the right to determine the need for any \n     exceptions to protect consumers and maintain consistency with \n     existing related bodies of law within a particular \n     jurisdiction.\n       (7) Industry has developed several electronic signature \n     technologies for use in electronic transactions, and the \n     public policies of the United States should serve to promote \n     a dynamic marketplace within which these technologies can \n     compete. Consistent with this Act, States should permit the \n     use and development of any authentication technologies that \n     are appropriate as practicable as between private parties and \n     in use with State agencies.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to permit and encourage the continued expansion of \n     electronic commerce through the operation of free market \n     forces rather than proscriptive governmental mandates and \n     regulations;\n       (2) to promote public confidence in the validity, integrity \n     and reliability of electronic commerce and online government \n     under Federal law;\n       (3) to facilitate and promote electronic commerce by \n     clarifying the legal status of electronic records and \n     electronic signatures in the context of writing and signing \n     requirements imposed by law;\n       (4) to facilitate the ability of private parties engaged in \n     interstate transactions to agree among themselves on the \n     terms and conditions on which they use and accept electronic \n     signatures and electronic records; and\n       (5) to promote the development of a consistent national \n     legal infrastructure necessary to support of electronic \n     commerce at the Federal and State levels within existing \n     areas of jurisdiction.\n\n     SEC. 4.

STUDY OF LEGAL AND REGULATORY BARRIERS TO ELECTRONIC \n                   COMMERCE.\n\n       (a) Barriers.--Each Federal agency shall, not later than 6 \n     months after the date of enactment of this Act, provide a \n     report to the Director\n\n[[Page S14882]]\n\n     of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of \n     Commerce identifying any provision of law administered by \n     such agency, or any regulations issued by such agency and in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act, that may impose \n     a barrier to electronic transactions, or otherwise to the \n     conduct of commerce online or be electronic means. Such \n     barriers include, but are not limited to, barriers imposed by \n     a law or regulation directly or indirectly requiring that \n     signatures, or records of transactions, be accomplished or \n     retained in other than electronic form. In its report, each \n     agency shall identify the barriers among those identified \n     whose removal would require legislative action, and shall \n     indicate agency plans to undertake regulatory action to \n     remove such barriers among those identified as are caused by \n     regulations issued by the agency.\n       (b) Report to Congress.--The Secretary of Commerce, in \n     consultation with the Director of the Office of Management \n     and Budget, shall, within 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and after the consultation required by \n     subsection (c) of this section, report to the Congress \n     concerning--\n       (1) legislation needed to remove barriers to electronic \n     transactions or otherwise to the conduct of commerce online \n     or by electronic means; and\n       (2) actions being taken by the Executive Branch and \n     individual Federal agencies to remove such barriers as are \n     caused by agency regulations or policies.\n       (c) Consultation.--In preparing the report required by this \n     section, the Secretary of Commerce shall consult with the \n     General Services Administration, the National Archives and \n     Records Administration, and the Attorney General concerning \n     matters involving the authenticity of records, their storage \n     and retention, and their usability for law enforcement \n     purposes.\n       (d) Include Findings If No Recommendations.--If the report \n     required by this section omits recommendations for actions \n     needed to fully remove identified barriers to electronic \n     transactions or to online or electronic commerce, it shall \n     include a finding or findings, including substantial reasons \n     therefor, that such removal is impracticable or would be \n     inconsistent with the implementation or enforcement of \n     applicable laws.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2787\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Senators Abraham, Wyden, and Leahy have \nan amendment at the desk, and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] for Mr. Abraham, for \n     himself, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2787.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n  The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.''\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2787) was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. It is my understanding the Senator from Michigan, \nSenator Abraham, has a statement to make on this important legislation.\n  I yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will briefly comment on this \nlegislation. First, I thank the cosponsors of this legislation, the \nMillennium Digital Commerce Act, and Senator Wyden, the lead cosponsor \nof the legislation, and Senators McCain, Burns, and Lott, who joined as \ncosponsors. I also thank Senator Leahy, Senator Sarbanes, Senator \nHollings, Senator McCain and others who have worked with Senator Wyden \nand me in moving this through the legislative process. I express my \nappreciation to all my colleagues.\n  As we move into the era of e-commerce it is important that people who \nwish to engage in commercial transactions online over the Internet be \nable to do so as effectively and efficiently as possible. Part of the \nchallenge we confront is when people are entering into contracts in \nthis nonwritten context, the potential exists for questions to be \nraised as to the validity of the contractual arrangements. Without \ngetting into all the details, the goal of the Millennium Digital \nCommerce Act is to address this issue. Approximately 42 States have \nalready passed what in effect are digital signature authentication laws \nwhich address contracts entered into online or which address the \nvalidity of contracts entered into through the web. The problem is \nthose 42 bills are all different. It is possible for people to argue \nthat a contract is valid in one State and not valid in the State of the \nother contracting party and, thus, is an invalid document.\n  The purpose of our legislation is to try to make all such agreements \nvalid if they fit or meet some parameters, identical to the ones the \nStates are moving toward; a uniform system. In short, we believe this \nwill be an interim approach until the States have passed a model \nuniform act. If we don't do this, impediments will exist between \nparties who wish to contract via the Internet and through electronic \ncommerce. We believe the passage of this bill will relieve those \nimpediments and allow for e-commerce to continue to expand and grow and \nstrengthen our economy.\n  I am very pleased at the passage of the bill today, and look forward \nto working with our counterparts in the House, they have passed a \nslightly different bill, to pound out a final consensus through the \nconferencing process and bring back to the Senate the output of that \nprocess. I hope to do this very early in the next session, so we can \nenact this legislation and move it to the President for his signature, \nand, as I said at the outset, improve the efficiency with which we \nengage in an expanded e-commerce universe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the significant \nefforts of Senator Abraham to author and pass legislation aimed at \nfacilitating the growth of electronic commerce. Commerce that everyone \nagrees is a significant driving force behind our nation's robust and \nexpanding economy.\n  Today, the Senate passed by unanimous consent an Abraham substitute \nfor S. 761, the Millennium Digital Commerce Act. This measure is \nimportant because it would ensure the legal certainty of electronic \nsignatures in interstate commerce.\n  Mr. President, right now, there are over forty different state \nelectronic authentication regimes in play. This patchwork of \ninconsistent and often conflicting state laws makes it difficult to \nconduct business-to-business and business-to-consumer transactions over \nthe Internet. Those involved in electronic transactions want assurance \nthat their contractual arrangements are legally binding.\n  Senator Abraham took the lead on this issue and crafted a bill to \nensure that a national framework would govern the use of electronic \nsignatures. It is a rational, coherent, and minimalist approach. An \napproach supported by America Online, American Bankers Association, \nAmerican Council of Life Insurance, the American Electronics \nAssociation, American Financial Services Association, American \nInsurance Association, Apple, Business Software Alliance, Charles \nSchwab, the Coalition for Electronic Authentication, Consumer Mortgage \nCoalition, DLJ Direct, the Electronic Industry Alliance, FORD, \nGateway2000, General Electric Company, GTE, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, \nIntel, Intuit, the Information Technology Association of America, the \nInformation Technology Industry Council, Microsoft, NCR, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, National Retail Federation, and the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, among others.\n  Mr. President, in drafting his legislation, Senator Abraham included \nkey concepts and provisions developed by the National Conference of \nCommissioners on Uniform State Law (NCCUSL). A NCCUSL working group, \nwhich included legal scholars, experts on electronic commerce, state \nofficials and other interested stakeholders, spent the better part of \ntwo years drafting the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). This \nmodel legislation was formally approved in August and is expected to be \nenacted on a state-by-state basis, much like the process followed in \napproving the Uniform Commercial Code, over the next three to five \nyears.\n  Senator Abraham's electronic signatures measure is timely in that it \nserves as an interim solution needed to fill the void until states \napprove the model UETA package.\n  I applaud the junior Senator from Michigan for his continuing \nleadership on technology issues and commend the Senate's action today. \nThis is definitely a significant step in the right direction.\n  Mr. President, Senator Abraham, my colleagues on this side of the \naisle, and I agree that the measure passed today, while a significant \naccomplishment, only gets consumers to the 50-yard line when it comes \nto e-commerce. In order to get to the end-zone, Congress still needs to \naddress the issue of electronic records.\n\n[[Page S14883]]\n\n  The Millennium Digital Commerce Act that was unanimously approved by \nthe Senate Commerce Committee in July would have also provided legal \ncertainty to electronic records. However, eleventh hour objections from \nthe minority, some of which were completely unrelated to this bill, \nthwarted repeated efforts to bring this crucial measure to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I would point out that the reported bill, with its \nelectronic records provisions, had bipartisan support and was strongly \nendorsed by the Administration, not once, but twice. In fact the Office \nof Management and Budget's Statement of Administration Policy noted \n``the Administration supports the passage of S. 761 . . . [Its] \nprovisions strike the appropriate balance between the needs of each \nState to develop its own laws in relation to commercial transactions \nand the needs of the Federal government to ensure that electronic \ncommerce will not be impeded by the lack of consistency in the \ntreatment of electronic authentication.''\n  The Commerce Committee reported measure did not, as some contend, \nalter federal or state consumer protection laws. Instead, Senator \nAbraham's bill simply held that records could not be denied legal \neffect solely, and the key word is ``solely,'' because such records \nwere in electronic form.\n  Mr. President, consumers stand the most to gain from electronic \nrecords and the most to lose if such records are not clearly granted \nlegal effect, validity, and enforceability. In order to further assuage \nconcerns, Senator Abraham, in earnest, offered a substitute version \nthat largely incorporated key provisions of UETA, verbatim. Even so, \nand as perplexing as it would seem, his UETA substitute was opposed by \nthe minority. Remember, these are the words developed and agreed to by \nan esteemed panel of national and state legal experts, and these are \nthe same words that will go into effect as states adopt UETA during the \nnext few years.\n  I would point out that the Department of Commerce, in its June 22, \n1999 position letter supporting the Abraham substitute bill that passed \nthe Commerce Committee, noted that ``In the view of the Administration, \nthe current UETA draft adheres to the minimalist `enabling' framework \nadvocated by the Administration, and we believe that UETA will provide \nan excellent domestic legal model for electronic transactions, as well \nas a strong model for the rest of the world.''\n  With these glowing endorsements of both the Commerce Committee \nreported measure and UETA, both of which provide legal certainty to \nelectronic records, I was surprised and dismayed that the \nAdministration flip-flopped on the records issue at the last moment. \nOne has to wonder what motivated this 180-degree change in position and \nwhy the Administration went to great lengths to stall and eventually \noppose electronic transactions legislation that included digital \nrecords.\n  Consumers want and need electronic records, not only because \ndigitized records are the equivalent of paper-notices, records, and \ndisclosures, but also because such information is often easier to \naccess, read, store and maintain. Electronic records will save \nconsumers time, money, and the hassle of waiting for paper notices and \ndisclosures. Used in conjunction with an electronic signature, \nelectronic records, with appropriate and effective electronic \ndisclosures, allow anyone, with a hook-up to the borderless World Wide \nWeb, to transact business at any time and at any place.\n  Mr. President, it is the seamless nature of the Internet that makes \nit such a phenomenal communications and business medium. To ensure that \nno one is left out of this new millennium paradigm, the legal certainty \nof electronic records must be codified in federal statute--at least \nuntil UETA is adopted nationally. It is my sincere hope that Congress \nwill address the legality of electronic records in the near term so \nconsumers will experience the full benefits and to reap the rewards of \nthe Internet.\n  Again, I want to applaud the efforts of the Senate in passing S. 761, \nSenator Abraham's electronic signatures bill. This action is good for \nAmerica's consumers, good for America's businesses, and good for our \nnation's economy and prosperity.\n  Mr. President, Senator Abraham has once again proven that he is a \nchampion of technology, a guardian of the consumer, and an extremely \neffective legislator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today is \npassing the Abraham-Leahy substitute amendment to S.761, the Millennium \nDigital Commerce Act. This bill seeks to permit and encourage the \ncontinued expansion of electronic commerce, and to promote public \nconfidence in its integrity and reliability. These are worthy goals--\ngoals that I have long sought to advance. In the last Congress, many of \nus worked together to pass the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, \nwhich established a framework for the federal government's use of \nelectronic forms and electronic signatures. Today's legislation is part \nof our continuing efforts to ease the burdens of conducting business \nelectronically.\n  This is an important bill on an issue of paramount concern to \nAmerican businesses that engage in electronic commerce. It has had a \nlong journey since it was reported by the Commerce Committee in June. \nAs reported, the bill took a sweeping approach, preempting untold \nnumbers of federal, state and local laws that require contracts, \nrecords and signatures to be in traditional written form. I was \nconcerned that such a sweeping approach would radically undermine \nlegislation that is currently in place to protect consumers.\n  For example, the Committee-passed bill would have enabled businesses \nto use their superior bargaining power to compel or confuse consumers \ninto waiving their rights to insist on paper disclosures and \ncommunications, even when they do not have the technological capacity \nto receive, retain, and print electronic records. Could a borrower be \ncompelled to receive delinquency or foreclosure notices by electronic \nmail, even if she did not have a computer, or her computer could not \nread the notices in the electronic format in which they were sent? \nWould she be entitled to revert to paper communications if her computer \nbroke or became obsolete? Could a company require customers to check \nits Web site for important safety information regarding its products, \nor for recall notices?\n  Under S.761 as reported, the company would not have been required to \nprovide any information on paper, even if a state consumer protection \nlaw so required. Crucial information about the consumer's rights and \nobligations would not be received. It was federal preemption beyond \nneed, to the detriment of American consumers.\n  The problem did not stop there. When information is provided \nelectronically, for it to be useful at a later time to prove its \ncontents, the electronic file must be tamperproof. Otherwise, a \nconsumer could inadvertently change a single byte on the file and thus \nmake it technically different from the original, and useless to prove \nits contents. The consumer would be left without any means of proving \ncritical terms of the contract, including the terms of the warranty.\n  I have been working with Senator Abraham and others since August to \naddress these and other concerns I had with the bill. We crafted a \nbipartisan compromise several weeks ago, but it fell apart after \ncertain industry representatives complained that it did not go far \nenough to relieve them of federal and state regulatory authority. \nFortunately, other industry representatives recognized that this was \nnot the primary or even an intended purpose of this legislation, and \nworked to get the legislative process back on track. I am pleased that \nwe were able to do this and that we were able to reach agreement, for \nthe second time, on an Abraham-Leahy substitute that encourages the \ncontinued expansion of electronic commerce, while leaving in place \nessential safeguards protecting the nation's consumers.\n  In a letter dated November 5, 1999, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures identified what it believed were four essential criteria \nfor any federal legislation related to electronic signatures:\n\n       (1) Any preemption of state law and authority must be \n     limited in duration. The idea should be to ensure the \n     validity of most electronic signatures for a period of time, \n     thus giving the states time to act. (2) States\n\n[[Page S14884]]\n\n     must be allowed to adopt the Uniform Electronic Transactions \n     Act or some similar legislation. (3) Essential state consumer \n     protections must be preserved, along with the capacity of \n     states to enact consumer protection measures in the future. \n     (4) Any federal legislation must be limited to the topic of \n     electronic signatures. It must not embrace any preemption of \n     state regulatory and record keeping authority.\n\n  The Abraham-Leahy substitute meets these criteria.\n  Most importantly, the scope of the bill has been limited to address \nthe principal concern of industry. When Senator Abraham introduced \nS.761 earlier this year, he said it was designed to eliminate \nuncertainty about the legality of electronic contracts signed with \nelectronic signatures. Consistent with this design, the Abraham-Leahy \nsubstitute ensures that contracts will not be denied legal effect that \nthey otherwise have under state law solely because they are in \nelectronic form or because they were signed electronically. However, as \nsection 4(4) of the bill makes clear, an electronic signature is valid \nonly if executed by a person who intended to sign the contract.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to facilitate electronic commerce \nover the Internet. It is not intended that this legislation be the \nbasis for unfair or deceptive attempts by some to avoid providing \nmandated information, disclosures, notices or content. For example, \nwhen the parties have conducted a transaction entirely in person, the \nfine print of a form contract cannot include an agreement that the \ncontract can be provided electronically rather than on paper. The basic \nrules of good faith and fair dealing apply to electronic commerce, and \nthis legislation is not intended to be a basis upon which consumers can \nbe asked to agree to terms and conditions for using electronic \nsignatures and electronic records which are unreasonable based on the \ncircumstances surrounding the transaction.\n  Further, accurate copies of contracts must be delivered to consumers. \nThe Abraham-Leahy substitute amendment therefore provides that if a law \nrequires a contract to be in writing, an electronic record of the \ncontract will not satisfy such law unless it is delivered to all \nparties in a form that can be retained for later reference and used to \nprove the terms of the agreement. This important provision is intended \nto protect consumers who execute contracts online, by ensuring that \ncontracts are provided in a tamperproof, or ``read-only'' format. The \ndelivery of any other type of electronic record would make it useless \nto prove its terms in court.\n\n  The new legislation also improves on the Committee-passed version by \neliminating its ``intent'' section, which established interpretive \nrules regarding the intent of the parties to an electronic transaction. \nThese rules inappropriately allowed businesses to put the risk of \nforgery, unauthorized use, and identity theft on consumers, by making \nit easier for the proponent of an electronic record or electronic \nsignature to prove its authenticity. By eliminating these rules, we \nhave ensured that current contract and evidence laws remain in place. A \nperson is always entitled to assert that an electronic signature is a \nforgery, was used without authority, or otherwise is invalid for \nreasons that would invalidate the effect of a signature in written \nform.\n  Having just last year worked with Senator Kyl on passage of the Kyl-\nLeahy substitute to S.512, the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence \nAct, to combat identity theft, we should be careful to avoid taking \nactions that could have the unintended consequence of making such \ncrimes easier to commit.\n  In his introductory floor statement, Senator Abraham stressed that \nS.761 was an interim measure, which would provide a national baseline \nfor the use of electronic signatures only until the states enacted \ntheir own e-signature legislation. To ensure the temporary nature of \nthe federal preemption, the Abraham-Leahy substitute which passes the \nSenate today includes a significant change from earlier versions of \nS.761, including the version reported by the Commerce Committee. The \nCommittee bill preempted a state's laws until the state enacted the \nUniform Electronic Transactions Act (``UETA'') as reported by the \nNational Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Law, or any \nvariation that was ``authorized or provided for in such report.'' The \nfull Senate votes today on language that gives states more leeway on \nthe version of the UETA that they choose to pass--including more leeway \nto adopt strong consumer protections. The revised definition is meant \nto cover the electronic transactions legislation passed earlier this \nyear by the State of California, and will preserve the capacity of \nstates to perform their traditional role in protecting the health and \nsafety of their citizens.\n  Nothing in this bill would allow any of the notices that may \naccompany an electronic contract to be provided electronically. This is \nespecially important to ensure that consumers are apprised of all their \nrights under federal and state laws. It was the records language of \nS.761 that held the greatest potential to harm consumers, with its \nacross-the-board invalidation of hard-won consumer protections embodied \nin such laws as the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Credit Reporting \nAct, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and others. I am \npleased that the sponsors of this legislation agreed to remove the \nelectronic records language so that we can allow the critical \nprovisions regarding contracts and signatures to move forward. There \nwill be time in the coming months to revisit the broader issue of \nelectronic records, and to craft legislation that will not place \nconsumers at risk.\n  In the meantime, contrary to some of the rhetoric that has been heard \nof late, nothing prevents companies from providing notices and \ndisclosures to consumers electronically, so long as they also provide \npaper notices and disclosures in the limited set of circumstances in \nwhich a law so requires. Requirements that certain information be \nprovided in a particular format, or by a particular method of delivery, \nare often adopted to serve consumers' interests by providing them with \ninformation critical to making informed choices in the marketplace, \nunderstanding their rights and obligations during commercial \ntransactions, and enforcing their rights when transactions go sour. \nSuch laws should not be swept away without adequate assurance that \nconsumers will be able to receive and retain the information \nelectronically.\n  The AARP made this point in a letter to all Senators dated November \n15, 1999, with respect to the more sweepingly preemptive H.R. 1714: \n``The time to investigate the implications of such a pivotal change in \nestablished consumer protections . . . is before, not after, \nlegislation is enacted. Measures to take advantage of electronic market \nefficiencies must be tempered by a concern for legal and technological \nresponsibilities that are being shifted to the consumer.''\n  The benefits of electronic commerce should not, and need not, come at \nthe expense of increased risk to consumers. I commend the Department of \nCommerce for its help in crafting a substitute amendment that is more \ncarefully tailored to protect the interests of America's consumers. I \nalso thank Senators Sarbanes, who shared many of my concerns about the \noriginal bill's impact on consumers, and Senators Abraham and Wyden, \nfor agreeing to address our concerns.\n  This bill shows what can be achieved by bipartisan cooperation and \ncompromise. It enjoys broad support from the Administration, the \nstates, consumer representatives, and responsible companies and trade \nassociations that care about their customers. I urge its speedy \nenactment into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a Statement of \nAdministration Policy dated November 8, 1999, in support of the \nAbraham-Leahy substitute amendment; a letter dated November 8, 1999, \nfrom the National Automobile Dealers Association, and a letter dated \nNovember 5, 1999, from the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\n     Statement of Administration Policy, November 8, 1999 (Senate)\n\n    (This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the concerned \n                               agencies.)\n\n\n S. 761--Millennium Digital Commerce Act (Abraham (R) Michigan and 11 \n                              cosponsors)\n\n       Electronic commerce can provide consumers and businesses \n     with significant benefits in terms of costs, choice, and \n     convenience. The Administration strongly supports the \n     development of this marketplace and supports legislation that \n     will advance that development, while providing appropriate \n     consumer protection. Many businesses and\n\n[[Page S14885]]\n\n     consumers are still wary of conducting extensive business \n     over the Internet because of the lack of a predictable legal \n     environment governing transactions. Both the Congress and the \n     Administration have been working to address this important \n     potential impediment to commerce.\n       S. 761 addresses important concerns associated with \n     electronic commerce and the rise of the Internet as a \n     worldwide commercial forum and marketplace. The \n     Administration supports Senate passage of the amendment in \n     the nature of a substitute to S. 761 expected to be offered \n     by Senator Abraham, based on an agreement with Senators Leahy \n     and Wyden. The Administration supports this version of S. 761 \n     because the bill, as proposed to be amended, would: Ensure \n     the legal validity of contracts between private parties that \n     are made and signed electronically; preserve the ability of \n     States to establish safeguards, such as consumer protection \n     laws, to promote the public interest in electronic commerce \n     among private parties just as they can now establish \n     safeguards for paper-based commerce; cover only commercial \n     transactions between private parties that affect interstate \n     commerce; not affect Federal laws or regulations, but instead \n     would give Federal agencies six months to conduct a careful \n     study of barriers to electronic transactions under Federal \n     laws or regulations and to develop plans to remove such \n     barriers, where appropriate; and sunset completely as to the \n     law of any State that enacts the Uniform Electronic \n     Transactions Act.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Automobile Dealers Association, Office of \n           Legislative Affairs,\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 1999.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the National Automobile \n     Dealers Association (NADA), I am writing to express our views \n     on S. 761, the Millennium Digital Commerce Act.\n       Like many entrepreneurs throughout the country, America's \n     new car and truck dealers are using today's technological \n     advances to better serve customers, and at NADA we understand \n     the desire to accelerate the role of electronic commerce. \n     Even so, we share your desire to preserve the state's role in \n     this process.\n       The automobile is one of the single biggest purchases that \n     a consumer makes. As a result, state legislatures throughout \n     the country have enacted various requirements and disclosures \n     governing the purchase and sale of motor vehicles. In light \n     of this extensive body of existing state law, an overly \n     preemptive federal statute would deny the states the ability \n     to protect their citizens in the manner they deem appropriate \n     in these types of transactions.\n       NADA does not oppose a temporary federal rule to ensure \n     that contracts can not be invalidated solely because they are \n     in electronic form or because they are signed electronically. \n     We believe, however, that any federal legislation should only \n     be an interim measure to provide stability while the states \n     consider the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). Once \n     a state adopts the UETA, the temporary federal rule should \n     sunset.\n       We understand that some drafts of the legislation that have \n     been put forward would allow the federal rule to preempt the \n     UETA in effect in a state, thus denying the states the \n     opportunity to be more protective of consumers should they so \n     desire. If that provision is retained, we believe that motor \n     vehicle transactions should not be covered by the federal \n     rule. This exception would be necessary to ensure that the \n     states could still perform their traditional role of \n     establishing the legal framework for major purchases.\n       We appreciate the opportunity to bring our concerns to your \n     attention, and we appreciate all your efforts in addressing \n     these matters before the legislation moves forward in the \n     Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 H. Thomas Greene,\n     Chief Operating Officer, Legislative Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            national Conference of\n\n\n                                           State Legislatures,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 5, 1999.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The National Conference of State \n     Legislatures understands the need to revise federal and state \n     laws as a means of encouraging electronic commerce. In \n     particular, NCSL understands that legislation is needed to \n     allow the more widespread use of electronic signatures as a \n     means of encouraging such commerce.\n       Over 40 state legislatures have addressed various state law \n     issues related to the validity of electronic signatures. \n     Nevertheless, NCSL has in principle no objection to federal \n     legislation on this same topic, provided that it is tightly \n     focused on removing barriers to legitimate electronic \n     commerce and does not broadly preempt essential elements of \n     state consumer protection and contract law.\n       NCSL believes that federal legislation related to \n     electronic signatures must meet four criteria: (1) Any \n     preemption of state law and authority must be limited in \n     duration. The idea should be to ensure the validity of most \n     electronic signatures for a period of time, thus giving the \n     states time to act. (2) States must be allowed to adopt the \n     Uniform Electronic Transactions Act or some similar \n     legislation. (3) Essential state consumer protections must be \n     preserved, along with the capacity of states to enact \n     consumer protection measures in the future. (4) Any federal \n     legislation must be limited to the topic of electronic \n     signatures. It must not embrace any preemption of state \n     regulatory and record keeping authority.\n       The version of S. 761 that is now being presented comes \n     closer to meeting NCSL's criteria than earlier versions of \n     the bill. In general, this ``compromise'' version is taking \n     the right approach to the issue. NCSL looks forward to \n     working with the sponsors and others to resolve any remaining \n     issues of preemption and consumer protection. NCSL much \n     prefers the new compromise to other earlier versions of \n     electronic signatures legislation which we vigorously opposed \n     because of its unnecessary preemption of state consumer \n     protection and contract law.\n       For additional information about NCSL's position, please \n     call Neal Osten (202-624-8660) or Michael Bird (202-624-\n     8686).\n           Sincerely,\n         Joanne G. Emmons, Michigan State Senate, Chair, NCSL \n           Commerce and Communications Committee.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the Senate is soon expected to pass the \nMillennium Digital Commerce Act--a bill introduced by Senators Wyden, \nMcCain, Burns, Lott and myself which is designed to promote electronic \ncommerce. I rise today to speak in support of this legislation and to \nthank the cosponsors for their tireless efforts to pass this \nlegislation. I believe it will have a profound impact on the way \ncommerce is conducted on the Internet.\n  By now, all of us have heard the prophetic pronouncements: ``The \nInternet will change of all of our lives.'' ``The Computer Age is \nreshaping the world.'' And so on. These words are true, and a review of \nthe indicators which document the Internet's extraordinary growth bear \nthis out. In 1993 about 90,000 Americans had access to these on-line \nresources. By early 1999 that number had grown to about 81 million, an \nincrease of about 900 percent. The Computer Industry Almanac predicts \n320 million Internet users world-wide by the end of the year 2000.\n  And now the figures are coming in on how electronic commerce is \ntransforming the way we do business. They are equally impressive. E-\ncommerce between businesses has grown to an estimate $64.8 billion for \n1999. 10 million customers shopped for some product using the Internet \nin 1998 alone. And 5.3 million households had access to financial \ntransactions like electronic banking and stock trading by the end of \n1999.\n  While the Internet has experienced almost exponential growth since \nits inception, there is still room to expand. Today, new technologies \nenable the Internet to serve as an efficient new tool for companies to \ntransact business as never before. This capability is provided by the \ndevelopment of secure electronic authentication methods. These \ntechnologies permit an individual to positively identify the person \nwith whom they are transacting business and to ensure that information \nbeing shared by the parties has not been tampered with or modified \nwithout the knowledge of both parties. While such technologies are \nseeing limited use today, the growth of this application has out-paced \ngovernment's ability to appropriately modify the legal framework \ngoverning the use of electronic signatures and other authentication \nmethods.\n  The growth of electronic signature technologies will increasingly \nallow organizations to enter into contractual arrangements without ever \nhaving to drive across town or fly thousands of miles to personally \nmeet with a client or potential business partner. The Internet is \nprepared to go far beyond the ability to buy a book or order apparel \non-line. It is ready to lead a revolution in the execution of business \ntransactions which may involve thousands or millions of dollars in \nproducts or services; transactions so important they require that both \nparties enter into a legally binding contract.\n  Mr. President, the Millennium Digital Commerce Act is designed to \npromote the use of electronic signatures in business transactions and \ncontracts. At present, the greatest barrier to such transactions is the \nlack of a consistent and predictable national framework of rules \ngoverning the use of electronic signatures. Over forty States have \nenacted electronic authentication laws, and no two laws are the same. \nThis inconsistency deters businesses from\n\n[[Page S14886]]\n\nfully utilizing electronic signature technologies for contracts and \nother business transactions. The differences in our State laws create \nuncertainty about the effectiveness or legality of an electronic \ncontract signed with an electronic signature. This legal uncertainty \nlimits the potential of electronic commerce, and, thus, our nation's \neconomic growth.\n  Fortunately, the need for uniformity in electronic authentication \nrules was recognized early by the States. For the past two years, the \nNational Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Law, an \norganization comprised of e-commerce experts from the States, has been \nworking to develop a uniform system for the use of electronic \nsignatures for all fifty States. Their product, the Uniform Electronic \nTransactions Act, or UETA, was finished in July. As was expected, the \nUETA is an excellent piece of work and I look forward to the day when \nthis model legislation is enacted by each of the 50 states.\n  But agreement on the final language of the UETA proposal is not the \nsame as enactment, and despite the hard work of the Commissioners, \nuniformity will not occur until all fifty States actually enact the \nUETA. That will likely take some time. Because some State legislatures \nare not in session next year and other States have more pressing \nlegislative items, it could take three to four years for forty-five or \nfifty States to enact the UETA. When you consider the changes that have \ntaken place in just the last two years, it is obvious that in the high-\ntechnology sector four years is an eternity.\n\n  The Digital Millennium Commerce Act is therefore designed as an \ninterim measure to provide relief until the States adopt the provisions \nof the UETA. It will provide companies the federal framework they need \nuntil a national baseline governing the use of electronic \nauthentication exists at the State level. Once States enact the UETA, \nthe Federal preemption is lifted.\n  To be specific, this legislation promotes electronic commerce in the \nfollowing manner. First and foremost, the legislation provides that the \nelectronic signatures used to agree to a contract shall not be denied \neffect solely because they are electronic in nature. This provision \nassures that a company will be able to rely on an electronic contract \nand that another party will not be able to escape such certainty, this \nbill will reduce the likelihood of dissatisfied parties attempting to \nescape electronic contractual agreements and transactions.\n  To ensure a level playing field for all types of authentication, the \nbill grants parties to a transaction the freedom to determine the \ntechnologies to be used in the execution of an electronic contract. In \nessence, this assures technology neutrality because businesses and \nconsumers, not government, will make the decisions as to what type of \nelectronic signatures and authentication technologies will be used in \ntransactions.\n  Since the Internet is inherently an international medium, \nconsideration must also be given to the manner in which the U.S. \nconducts business with overseas governments and businesses. This \nlegislation therefore sets forth a series of principles for the \ninternational use of electronic signatures. In the last year, U.S. \nnegotiators have been meeting with the European Commissioners to \ndiscuss electronic signatures in international commerce. In these \nnegotiations, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the State Department \nhave worked in support of an open system governing the use of \nauthentication technologies. Some European nations oppose this concept, \nhowever. For example, Germany insists that electronic transactions \ninvolving a German company must utilize a German electronic signature \napplication. I applaud the Administration for their steadfast \nopposition to that approach. This bill will bolster and strengthen the \nU.S. position in these international negotiations by establishing the \nfollowing principles as the will of the Congress:\n  One, paper-based obstacles to electronic transactions must be \neliminated.\n  Two, parties to an electronic transaction should choose the \nelectronic authentication technology.\n  Third, parties to a transaction should have the opportunity to prove \nin court that their authentication approach and transactions are valid.\n  Fourth, the international approach to electronic signatures should \ntake a non-discriminatory approach to electronic signature. This will \nallow the fees market--not a government--to determine the type of \nauthentication technologies used in international commerce.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that adoption of these principles will \nincrease the likelihood of an open, market-based international \nframework for electronic commerce.\n  Finally, the bill directs the Department of Commerce and Office of \nManagement and Budget to report on Federal laws and regulations that \nmight pose barriers to e-commerce and report back to Congress on the \nimpact of such provisions and provide suggestions for reform. Such a \nreport will serve as the basis for Congressional action, or inaction, \nin the future.\n  Mr. President, Senator Wyden, Senator McCain, Senator Burns, the \nMajority Leader and I worked very hard to address the multiple of \nissues and concerns raised by those most affected by this legislation, \nnamely the high-tech industry, the states and the consumer. I also want \nto recognize the considerable time and effort dedicated to this \nlegislation by Senator Leahy, Senator Hollings and Senator Sarbanes. \nSenators Leahy and Sarbanes worked diligently with the sponsors of this \nbill to address protection issues. In particular, my colleagues were \nconcerned about the effects of this legislation on the notification and \ndisclosure requirements required by law. I understand very well the \nconcerns my colleagues raised and I agree with many, but not all, of \ntheir conclusions.\n  I believe the use of electronic records in electronic transactions is \ncrucial to real growth in electronic commerce. And if e-commerce is to \ntruly expand the opportunities for individuals, businesses and \nconsumers must have the freedom to agree to the types of documents and \ninformation they receive electronically. This right to choose to \nreceive records electronically must be provided by Congress. The best \nway to do that is to pass laws which establish legal certainties for \nthe sending, receipt and storage for the broad range of electronic \nrecords, and in particular, for records associated with loans and \nmortgages. Today, a vacuum exists with respect to these records. \nAggressive businesses and small banks are filling this vacuum by \nproviding loans and mortgages electronically even though there is \nquestion as to whether such transactions are protected under law. The \nincreasing demand for such services demonstrates the popularity for \nelectronic loans. By making applications easier and reducing associated \nconsumer costs, these businesses are providing a service which is \nbecoming increasingly popular with the American public. Rather than \nignore this new market, or worse, condemn it, Congress should work with \nthe industry and the proper regulatory agencies to ensure that these \nincreased consumer opportunities are maintained and that relevant \nconsumer protection provisions are modernized. I believe my proposal to \npermit individuals to opt-in to the receipt of records and to opt-out \nof receipt at any time represented reasonable middle ground on this \nissue, and am disappointed that my colleagues and I could not agree on \na framework for records based on this model.\n\n  I intend to continue working toward a resolution which will permit \nindividuals to have access to electronic records. It is simply in the \nlong-term best interest of both consumers and the economy. And I am \nsure I will not labor on this effort alone. I am pleased to note that, \namong parties familiar with this debate, there is growing support for \nlegislation to quickly address this important issue.\n  Mr. President, despite our philosophical differences, it was clear \nfrom the beginning that everyone involved was interested in working \ncooperatively to enact good legislation. And while I wish this bill \ncould go further, I am nevertheless pleased with the product that we \nhave passed today. So I want to thank Senator Leahy and Senator \nSarbanes for their cooperation and hard work. I also want to recognize \nthe efforts of the Ranking Member of the Commerce Committee, Senator \nHollings. Senator Hollings made\n\n[[Page S14887]]\n\nit clear very early that he had concerns surrounding the issue of \npreemption. His staff and mine worked quickly and effectively to find \ncommon ground on this legislation and his spirit of compromise allowed \nus to move forward on a bill that I do not doubt he would have written \ndifferently. I want to thank him for his contribution.\n  Finally, I wish to express my thanks to the Technology Division of \nthe State of Massachusetts. Governor Paul Cellucci's staff provided \nindispensable counsel on existing State law governing the use of \nelectronic signatures and the manner in which Federal law can bolster \nor hamstring State contract law. I value the Governor's input and will \ncontinue to work with him to address the extent to which the States are \nimpacted by this legislation as it advances. Of course, the business \nand technology sectors have also been crucial in helping to craft this \nbill. Representatives from the Information Technology Association of \nAmerica, Ford, the Coalition for Electronic Authentication, the \nInformation Technology Industry Council, Apple, the American \nElectronics Association, NCR, America Online, the Electronic Industry \nAlliance, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and the National Association \nof Manufacturers have each lent their time and expertise to this \neffort. I appreciate their contributions and look forward to continuing \nthis effort to ensure that we develop the best approach possible to \npromote use of electronic signatures in business transactions.\n  Mr. President, despite the great work that has taken place here in \nthe Senate, there is more work to do on this legislation. The House is \ncurrently working on a companion bill and I look forward to working \nwith the Chairman of the Commerce Committee and other Representatives \nto ensure that the legislation sent to the President for his signature \nis the best and most effective approach to expanding electronic \ncommerce possible.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S. 761, the \nThird Millennium Digital Commerce Act. This is an important bill at a \npivotal time in our nation's history. The rapid growth of the Internet, \nand its transformation from an academic research tool to a truly global \ncommunications network, is exerting its influence in more and more \nareas of our daily lives.\n  One are of enormous change is the way in which Americans buy, sell, \nand trade products and services. Just as the general store gave way to \nthe shopping mall and mail order catalogues, these now ``traditional'' \nforms of retailing are being supplanted by electronic commerce over the \nInternet. Electronic retailers are providing consumers with a broad \nrange of new choices in goods and services.\n  Electronic transactions are also becoming an integral part of \nbusiness-to-business relationships. Ordering, billing, and a host of \nother activities are now being handled by electronic means, cutting \nboth costs and transaction times. These techniques will make our \noverall economy more efficient, and the benefits should eventually be \npassed on to consumers.\n  The world of electronic commerce is not without its problems, \nhowever. One of the largest of these is the lack of coherent legal \nframework for the conduct of electronic transactions. The commercial \nworld is governed by a patchwork of Federal, state, and local laws. \nBecause electronic commerce is such a recent phenomenon, it can be \ndifficult to apply existing commercial codes and statutes to these new \nkinds of transactions. Often the laws are simply silent on electronic \nissues, leading to uncertainty for businesses and consumers alike.\n  One such area is electronic signatures. Technology now exists that \ncan replace written signatures on paper documents with computer code \nthat performs the same functions. However, many states have not yet \nenacted laws to ensure that digital signature technologies, when used \nin a reasonable and appropriate manner, will be considered valid. \nAccording to business groups, this uncertainty has had a dampening \neffect on the growth of electronic commerce.\n  Many state legislatures are hard at work to devise a workable, \nconsistent legal framework for electronic records and signatures. Until \ntheir efforts are complete, however, S. 761, the bill introduced by \nSenator Abraham, will serve as a stop-gap measure. It will provide a \nmeasure of legal certainty, while protecting the rights of consumers \nunder existing laws governing many types of transactions.\n  I am pleased to have worked closely with Senator Abraham, Senator \nLeahy, Senator Wyden, members of the Commerce Committee, industry, and \nconsumer groups to craft a bill that answers the legal need, yet \nprovides for continued consumer protections. I would like briefly to \ndescribe some of these critical consumer protection aspects of the \nbill.\n  While electronic commerce can provide consumers with enormous \nbenefits, a sad stream of news articles over the past few years show \nclearly that there are unscrupulous operators on the Internet. The \npassage of this Act is intended to serve as a means of protecting \nconsumers from deceptive practices.\n  To provide businesses with greater legal certainty, the bill \nstipulates that contracts cannot be deemed unenforceable solely because \nthey involved the use of an electronic signature. Under this bill, \ncompanies and consumers should only be able to agree to reasonable and \nappropriate electronic signature technologies that provide adequate \nsecurity to both parties. However, as the definition of the electronic \nsignature makes clear, the electronic signature is only valid under \nthis Act if the person intended to sign the contract.\n  The basic rules of good faith and fair dealing apply to electronic \ncommerce, and this Act should not be the basis upon which parties to a \ncontract can be asked to agree to terms and conditions for using \nelectronic signatures and electronic contracts which are unreasonable \nbased on the circumstances surrounding the transaction. For example, \nwhen the parties have conducted a transaction entirely in person, the \nfine print of a form contract should not include an agreement that the \ncontract can be provided electronically rather than on paper. In \naddition, companies must deliver to consumers electronic records of the \ncontract in a form they can receive, retain, and use to prove the terms \nof an agreement. Such an electronic record would have to be provided in \na ``locked,'' or tamper proof, format.\n  Regarding new laws on electronic transactions, the states have been \nengaged for some time, through the National Conference of Commissioners \non Uniform State Laws, in the formulation of a model Uniform Electronic \nTransactions Act (UETA). Versions of the UETA will be enacted by the \nindividual states. The bill we are considering today includes a revised \ndefinition of UETA, changed from the bill reported by the Commerce \nCommittee, that gives states more flexibility to pass versions of UETA \nthat best meet the needs of their citizens. It is intended that \nCalifornia's recently passed version of UETA, for example, meet this \ntest.\n  I would like once again to thank my colleagues, Senator Abraham, \nSenator Leahy, and Senator Wyden for their hard work on this issue. I \nbelieve that we have reached an accommodation on this legislation that \nprovides industry with the provisional legal certainty they seek, while \nensuring that existing consumer laws are not diluted by the increasing \nuse of electronic commerce. This is an important step toward making our \ncommercial laws ready for the twenty-first century.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe Millennium Digital Commerce Act of 1999. I thank Senators Abraham, \nLeahy, and Wyden for their leadership on this important issue. As a \ncosponsor of this legislation, I am proud of the steps it takes to \nsupport an important and still emerging technology and industry. The \nMillennium Digital Commerce Act will facilitate the continued growth of \nthe Internet and of electronic commerce. With this legislation, the \nSenate recognizes the significant transformations taking place in our \neconomy and how we do business today and into the future.\n  I think we all recognize that we are witnessing an electronic \nrevolution. There is no shortage of statistics to prove what we are \nseeing all around us. According to a recent U.S. Department of Commerce \nreport, approximately one third of the U.S. economic growth\n\n[[Page S14888]]\n\nin the past few years has come from information technologies (over $1.1 \ntrillion). Just this year, venture capitalists have invested more than \n$8 billion in Internet companies--twice the rate of last year.\n  According to a University of Texas report, e-commerce is growing at a \nmuch faster rate than many had expected. The digital economy generated \nmore than $300 billion in revenue in 1998 and was responsible for 1.2 \nmillion jobs. Many e-commerce companies in my State of Connecticut, \nlike Micro-Warehouse in Norwalk, Coastal Tool & Supply in West \nHartford, and Sagemaker Inc. of Fairfield, are leading the way in the \ndigital economy.\n  In the Senate, I have worked to support the growth of e-commerce by \ncosponsoring the Internet Tax Freedom Act which places a three year \nmoratorium on new state and local taxes on the Internet in order to \ngive the digital economy some breathing room to evolve.\n  This legislation takes further steps to continue the growth of e-\ncommerce and is a powerful follow-on to the Internet Tax Freedom Act. \nWith this legislation we will eliminate a major barrier to e-commerce \nby providing for the legal recognition of electronic signatures in \ncontracting and by creating a consistent, but temporary, national \nelectronic signatures law to preempt a multitude of sometimes \ninconsistent state laws. This bill is technology neutral, allowing \ncontracting parties to determine the appropriate electronic signature \ntechnology for their transaction. Importantly, this legislation is the \nresult of thoughtful compromise. It gives electronic signatures more \nlegal certainty but also provides for consumer protection. It deals \nwith electronic signatures only in creating contracts. It preempts \nstate law only until the states enact their own statutes and standards \nas provided for by the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA).\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank those who have worked so \ndiligently to create this Act. Through the considerate and \ncollaborative approach of several of my colleagues, including Senators \nAbraham, Leahy, and Wyden, we now have legislation with language that \nachieves a broad public purpose. We are now able to continue supporting \nthe growth and evolution of electronic commerce and technologies that \nwill effectively bring us into the next century.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, for the past several years, Congress has \nbeen working in a bipartisan way to write the rules of the digital \neconomy. We have made significant progress on Internet taxes, privacy, \nencryption and the Y2K problem. Now is the time to move forward on \nrules for electronic signatures.\n  The bill before us today, S. 761, is based on the premise that it's \nbetter to be online than waiting in line. A growing number of Americans \nwho now have to wait in line for things like a driver's license or \nconstruction permit, could see their business expedited by a few clicks \nof their mouse.\n  We live in an increasingly mobile society, where young people get \nrecruited for jobs clear across the country. They may need to move in a \nhurry but don't have the time, for example, to pack up a home in \nVirginia and look for another one in Portland, Oregon. With the \nInternet, they can shop for a house in another town. With this \nelectronic signatures bill, they can pretty much conclude the whole \ntransaction of purchasing the house online.\n  The legislation puts electronic and paper contracts and agreements on \nequal footing legally. Like the Internet Tax Freedom Act, the bill \nwould establish technological neutrality between electronic and paper \ncontracts and agreements. This means consumers will enjoy the same \nlegal protections when purchasing a car or home online as when they \nwalk into an auto dealership or real estate office and sign all the \ndocuments in person. We worked long and hard to make sure that the \nsystem established here benefits consumers who wish to receive \ninformation electronically without treating those without computers as \nsecond class citizens.\n  This legislation does not address the issue of electronic records \nbecause this matter deserves more thorough study and discussion. I \nintend to work with all interested parties on this--from consumer \ngroups to financial services firms--over the course of the coming \nmonths to craft legislation that will extend the benefits of this \nmeasure to electronic records in a way that continues consumer \nprotections.\n  Commercial transactions have traditionally been governed by State \nlaws which are modeled on the Uniform Commercial Code. Forty-two states \nhave some law in place relating to digital authentication. But \ndifferences between and among these laws can create confusion for e-\nentrepreneurs. The unstoppable growth of electronic commerce has led \nthe States recently to develop a Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, \nor UETA (as part of the Uniform Commercial Code), to serve as a model \nfor each State legislature in developing further its own electronic \nsignatures law. However, only one State--California--has enacted a \nUETA. The purpose of this legislation is to provide interim Federal \nlegal validity for electronic contracts and agreements until each state \nenacts its own UETA. This means e-commerce will not be hamstrung by the \nlack of legal standing.\n  I would like to take a minute to run through the highlights of S. \n761:\n  Technological neutrality: It allows electronic signatures to replace \nwritten signatures. In interstate commerce a contract cannot be denied \nlegal effect solely because of an electronic signature, electronic \nrecord or an electronic agent was used in its formation.\n  Choice of technology: It does not dictate the type of electronic \nsignature technology to be used; it allows the parties to a transaction \nto choose their own authentication technology.\n  Consumer protections: It protects consumer rights under State laws; \nit does not preempt State consumer protection laws. It assures that \nconsumers without a computer are not treated as second class citizens. \nIf a consumer buys a car online, the consumer cannot be forced to use \nthe computer to receive important recall or safety notices but retains \nthe option to continue to get such notices through the mail.\n  No State preemption: Its provisions sunset when a State enacts UETA.\n  Excludes matters of family law: It specifically excludes agreements \nrelating to marriage, adoption, premarital agreements, divorce, \nresidential landlord-tenant matters because these are not commercial \ntransactions.\n  Report on Federal statutory barriers to electronic transactions: It \nrequires OMB to report to Congress 18 months after enactment \nidentifying statutory barriers to electronic transactions and \nrecommending legislation to remove such barriers.\n  In conclusion, M. President, I wish to acknowledge the leadership of \nSen. Abraham in moving this legislation forward. He and I have teamed \nup successfully on other legislation, and it was a pleasure to work \nwith him and his tireless staff on this bill. I also want to recognize \nthe contribution of Senator Leahy, particularly with regard to the \nconsumer protection provisions, as well as the effort of Senator \nHollings. It took a bipartisan team to get this bill through the Senate \ntoday, and I look forward to continuing to work with this team as we go \nto conference with the House on S. 761.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my statement be printed in the record \nfollowing Senator Abraham's statement on the passage of S. 761.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe Millennium Digital Commerce Act of 1999. I thank Senators Abraham, \nLeahy, and Wyden for their leadership on this important issue. As a \ncosponsor of this legislation, I am proud of the steps it takes to \nsupport an important and still emerging technology and industry. The \nMillennium Digital Commerce Act will facilitate the continued growth of \nthe Internet and of electronic commerce. With this legislation, the \nSenate recognizes the significant transformations taking place in our \neconomy and how we do business today and into the future.\n  I think we all recognize that we are witnessing an electronic \nrevolution. There is no shortage of statistics to prove what we are \nseeing all around us. According to a recent U.S. Department of Commerce \nreport, approximately one third of the U.S. economic growth in the past \nfew years has come from information technologies (over $1.1 trillion). \nJust this year, venture capitalists have invested more than $8 billion\n\n[[Page S14889]]\n\nin Internet companies--twice the rate of last year.\n  According to a University of Texas report, e-commerce is growing at a \nmuch faster rate than many had expected.

Mr. President, the Senate is today passing an important \nbill, S. 1257, the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer ``Digital Theft Deterrence and \nCopyright Damages Improvement Act of 1999.'' This legislation should \nhelp our copyright industries, which in turn helps both those who are \nemployed in those industries and those who enjoy the wealth of consumer \nproducts, including books, magazines, movies, and computer software, \nthat makes the vibrant culture of this country the envy of the world. \nThis legislation has already traveled an unnecessarily bumpy road to \nget to this stage, and it is my hope that it will be sent promptly to \nthe President's desk.\n  On July 1, 1999, the Senate passed four intellectual property bills \nwhich Senator Hatch and I had joined in introducing and which the \nJudiciary Committee had unanimously reported. Each of these bills (S. \n1257, which we consider today; S. 1258, the Patent Fee Integrity and \nInnovation Protection Act; S. 1259, the Trademark Amendments Act; and \nS. 1260, the Copyright Act Technical Corrections Act) make important \nimprovements to our intellectual property laws, and I congratulate \nSenator Hatch for his leadership in moving these bills promptly through \nthe Committee.\n  Three of those four bills then passed the House without amendment and \nwere signed by the President on August 5, 1999. The House sent back to \nthe Senate S. 1257, the Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright Damages \nImprovement Act, with two modifications which I will describe below.\n  I have long been concerned about reducing the levels of software \npiracy in this country and around the world. The theft of digital \ncopyrighted works and, in particular, of software, results in lost jobs \nto American workers, lost taxes to Federal and State governments, and \nlost revenue to American companies. A recent report released by the \nBusiness Software Alliance estimates that worldwide theft of \ncopyrighted software in 1998 amounted to nearly $11 billion. According \nto the report, if this ``pirated software has instead been legally \npurchased, the industry would have been able to employ 32,700 more \npeople. In 2008, if software piracy remains at its current rate, 52,700 \njobs will be lost in the core software industry.'' This theft also \nreflects losses of $991 million in tax revenue in the United States.\n  These statistics about the harm done to our economy by the theft of \ncopyrighted software alone, prompted me to introduce the ``Criminal \nCopyright Improvement Act'' in both the 104th and 105th Congresses, and \nto work for passage of this legislation, which was finally enacted as \nthe ``No Electronic Theft Act of 1997,'' Pub. L. 105-147. The current \nrates of software piracy show that we need to do better to combat this \ntheft, both with enforcement of our current copyright laws and with \nstrengthened copyright laws to deter potential infringes.\n  The Hatch-Leahy-Schumer ``Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright \nDamages Improvement Act'' would help provide additional deterrence by \namending the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 504(c), to increase the \namounts of statutory damages recoverable for copyright infringements. \nThese amounts were last increased in 1988 when the United States \nacceded to the Berne Convention. Specifically, the bill would increase \nthe cap on statutory damages by 50 percent, raising the minimum from \n$500 to $750 and raising the maximum from $20,000 to $30,000. In \naddition, the bill would raise from $100,000 to $150,000 the amount of \nstatutory damages for willful infringements.\n  Courts determining the amount of statutory damages in any given case \nwould have discretion to impose damages within these statutory ranges \nat just and appropriate levels, depending on the harm caused, ill-\ngotten profits obtained and the gravity of the offense. The bill \npreserves provisions of the current law allowing the court to reduce \nthe award of statutory damages to as little as $200 in cases of \ninnocent infringement and requiring the court to remit damages in \ncertain cases involving nonprofit educational institutions, libraries, \narchives, or public broadcasting entities.\n  Finally, the bill provides authority for the Sentencing Commission \nexpeditiously to fulfill its responsibilities under the No Electronic \nTheft Act, which directed the Commission to ensure that the guidelines \nprovide for consideration of the retail value and quantity of the items \nwith respect to which the intellectual property offense was committed. \nSince the time that this law became effective, the Sentencing \nCommission has not had a full slate of Commissioners serving. In fact, \nwe have had no Commissioners since October, 1998. This situation was \ncorrected last week with the confirmation of seven new Commissioners.\n  As I noted, the House amended the version of S. 1257 that the Senate \npassed in July in two ways. First, the original House version of this \nlegislation, H.R. 1761, contained a new proposed enhanced penalty for \ninfringers who engage in a repeated pattern of infringement, but \nwithout any scienter requirement. I shared the concerns raised by the \nCopyright Office that this provision, absent a willfulness scienter \nrequirement, would permit imposition of the enhanced penalty even \nagainst person who negligently, albeit repeatedly, engaged in acts of \ninfringement. Consequently, the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer bill, S. 1257, that \nwe sent to the House in July avoided casting such a wide net, which \ncould chill legitimate fair uses of copyrighted works. Instead, the \nbill we sent to the House would have created a new tier of statutory\n\n[[Page S14891]]\n\ndamages allowing a court to award damages in the amount of $250,000 per \ninfringed work where the infringement is part of a willful and repeated \npattern or practice of infringement. The entire ``pattern and \npractice'' provision, which originated in the House, has been removed \nfrom the version of S. 1257 sent back to the Senate.\n  Second, the original House version of this legislation provided a \ndirection to the Sentencing Commission to amend the guidelines to \nprovide an enhancement based upon the retail price of the legitimate \nitems that are infringed and the quantity of the infringing items. I \nwas concerned that this direction would require the Commission and, \nultimately, sentencing judges to treat similarly a wide variety of \ninfringement crimes, no matter the type and magnitude of harm. This was \na problem we avoided in the carefully crafted Sentencing Commission \ndirective originally passed as part of the No Electronic Theft Act. \nConsequently, the version of S. 1257 passed by the Senate in July did \nnot include the directive to the Sentencing Commission. The House then \nreturned S. 1257 with the same problematic directive to the Sentencing \nCommission.\n  I appreciate that my House colleagues and interested stakeholders \nhave worked over the past months to address my concerns over the \nbreadth of the proposed directive to the Sentencing Commission, and to \nfind a better definition of the categories of cases in which it would \nbe appropriate to compute the applicable sentencing guideline based \nupon the retail value of the infringed upon item. A better solution \nthan the one contained in the No Electronic Theft Act remains elusive, \nhowever.\n  For example, one recent proposal seeks to add to S. 1257 a direction \nto the Sentencing Commission to enhance the guideline offense level for \ncopyright and trademark infringements based upon the retail price of \nthe legitimate products multiplied by the quantity of the infringing \nproducts, except where ``the infringing products are substantially \ninferior to the infringed upon products and there is substantial price \ndisparity between the legitimate products and the infringing \nproducts.'' This proposed direction appears to be under-inclusive since \nit would not allow a guideline enhancement in cases where fake goods \nare passed off as the real item to unsuspecting consumers, even though \nthis is clearly a situation in which the Commission may decide to \nprovide an enhancement.\n  In view of the fact that the full Sentencing Commission has not had \nan opportunity for the past two years to consider and implement the \noriginal direction in the No Electronic Theft Act, passing a new and \nflawed directive appears to be both unnecessary and unwise. This is \nparticularly the case since the new Commissioners have already \nindicated a willingness to consider this issue promptly. In response to \nquestions posed at their confirmation hearings, each of the nominated \nSentencing Commissioners indicated that they would make this issue a \npriority. For example, Judge William Sessions of the District of \nVermont specifically noted that:\n\n       If confirmed, our first task must be to address Congress' \n     longstanding directives, including implementation of the \n     guidelines pursuant to the NET Act. Congress directed the \n     Sentencing Commission to fashion guidelines under the NET Act \n     that are sufficiently severe to deter such criminal activity. \n     I personally favor addressing penalties under this statute \n     expeditiously.\n\n  I fully concur in the judgment of Chairman Hatch that the Sentencing \nCommission directive provision added by the House and to send, again, \nS. 1257 to the House for action.\n  This bill represents an improvement in current copyright law, and I \nhope that it will soon be sent to the President for enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S14891-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TO AMEND THE CONSOLIDATED FARM AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Tribal Justice \n     Technical and Legal Assistance Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) there is a government-to-government relationship \n     between the United States and Indian tribes;\n       (2) Indian tribes are sovereign entities and are \n     responsible for exercising governmental authority over Indian \n     lands;\n       (3) the rate of violent crime committed in Indian country \n     is approximately twice the rate of violent crime committed in \n     the United States as a whole;\n       (4) in any community, a high rate of violent crime is a \n     major obstacle to investment, job creation and economic \n     growth;\n       (5) tribal justice systems are an essential part of tribal \n     governments and serve as important forums for ensuring the \n     health and safety and the political integrity of tribal \n     governments;\n       (6) Congress and the Federal courts have repeatedly \n     recognized tribal justice systems as the most appropriate \n     forums for the adjudication of disputes affecting personal \n     and property rights on Native lands;\n       (7) enhancing tribal court systems and improving access to \n     those systems serves the dual Federal goals of tribal \n     political self-determination and economic self-sufficiency;\n       (8) there is both inadequate funding and an inadequate \n     coordinating mechanism to meet the technical and legal \n     assistance needs of tribal justice systems and this lack of \n     adequate technical and legal assistance funding impairs their \n     operation;\n       (9) tribal court membership organizations have served a \n     critical role in providing training and technical assistance \n     for development and enhancement of tribal justice systems;\n       (10) Indian legal services programs, as funded partially \n     through the Legal Services Corporation, have an established \n     record of providing cost effective legal assistance to Indian \n     people in tribal court forums, and also contribute \n     significantly to the development of tribal courts and tribal \n     jurisprudence; and\n       (11) the provision of adequate technical assistance to \n     tribal courts and legal assistance to both individuals and \n     tribal courts is an essential element in the development of \n     strong tribal court systems.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Tribal Justice \n     Technical and Legal Assistance Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) there is a government-to-government relationship \n     between the United States and Indian tribes;\n       (2) Indian tribes are sovereign entities and are \n     responsible for exercising governmental authority over Indian \n     lands;\n       (3) the rate of violent crime committed in Indian country \n     is approximately twice the rate of violent crime committed in \n     the United States as a whole;\n       (4) in any community, a high rate of violent crime is a \n     major obstacle to investment, job creation and economic \n     growth;\n       (5) tribal justice systems are an essential part of tribal \n     governments and serve as important forums for ensuring the \n     health and safety and the political integrity of tribal \n     governments;\n       (6) Congress and the Federal courts have repeatedly \n     recognized tribal justice systems as the most appropriate \n     forums for the adjudication of disputes affecting personal \n     and property rights on Native lands;\n       (7) enhancing tribal court systems and improving access to \n     those systems serves the dual Federal goals of tribal \n     political self-determination and economic self-sufficiency;\n       (8) there is both inadequate funding and an inadequate \n     coordinating mechanism to meet the technical and legal \n     assistance needs of tribal justice systems and this lack of \n     adequate technical and legal assistance funding impairs their \n     operation;\n       (9) tribal court membership organizations have served a \n     critical role in providing training and technical assistance \n     for development and enhancement of tribal justice systems;\n       (10) Indian legal services programs, as funded partially \n     through the Legal Services Corporation, have an established \n     record of providing cost effective legal assistance to Indian \n     people in tribal court forums, and also contribute \n     significantly to the development of tribal courts and tribal \n     jurisprudence; and\n       (11) the provision of adequate technical assistance to \n     tribal courts and legal assistance to both individuals and \n     tribal courts is an essential element in the development of \n     strong tribal court systems.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) to carry out the responsibility of the United States to \n     Indian tribes and members of Indian tribes by ensuring access \n     to quality technical and legal assistance.\n       (2) To strengthen and improve the capacity of tribal court \n     systems that address civil and criminal causes of action \n     under the jurisdiction of Indian tribes.\n       (3) To strengthen tribal governments and the economies of \n     Indian tribes through the\n\n[[Page S14901]]\n\n     enhancement and, where appropriate, development of tribal \n     court systems for the administration of justice in Indian \n     country by providing technical and legal assistance services.\n       (4) To encourage collaborative efforts between national or \n     regional membership organizations and associations whose \n     membership consists of judicial system personnel within \n     tribal justice systems; non-profit entities which provide \n     legal assistance services for Indian tribes, members of \n     Indian tribes, and/or tribal justice systems.\n       (5) To assist in the development of tribal judicial systems \n     by supplementing prior Congressional efforts such as the \n     Indian Tribal Justice Act (Public Law 103-176).\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, today the Senate is taking up for its \nconsideration H.R. 1094, a bill to amend the Federal Reserve Act to \nbroaden the range of discount window loans which may be used as \ncollateral for Federal Reserve notes. This legislation will expand the \nfield of assets that the Federal Reserve may use to collateralize \nFederal Reserve notes. All currency in circulation must be backed by \nspecific assets, but much of the collateral that the Federal Reserve \naccepts for discount window loans is ineligible under current law for \nuse to back the currency. The changes put in place by this legislation \nwill allow the Federal Reserve to apply all eligible discount loan \nassets to collateralize the currency.\n  This legislation poses some risks unless adequate safeguards are in \nplace. The Federal Reserve applies a discount to each type of asset \nused as collateral. Broadening the scope of eligible assets makes it \neven more imperative that strict and aggressive discounting be applied \nto any assets used to back U.S. currency. The Federal Reserve should \ndiscount aggressively these assets through an objective and clearly \ndefined process that leaves no room for doubt that our currency is \nfully backed by reliable assets. At the most basic level, when valuing \nthese assets this should be our general rule: when in doubt, discount.\n  Failure to discount collateral assets aggressively would do more than \nthreaten the safety and soundness of the Federal Reserve's balance \nsheet; it would threaten the U.S. economy and all economies that rely \non a stable dollar. Many countries around the world recently have \nlearned a painful lesson on the value of a sound currency.\n  We must remember that any country can engage in monetary \nmismanagement, and most have at some point in time. The United States \nmust avoid that path. With a currency that is considered a stable \nmedium by U.S. citizens and a store of value by both domestic and \nforeign investors, the Federal Reserve must hold sound money paramount \nas it implements this important change in currency collateral \nrequirements.

Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of November 16, 1999.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act of \n1999. On Veterans Day, many of the members honored America's veterans \nand acknowledged our debt to them for their service. This legislation \ngives the Senate an opportunity to do something tangible to honor our \nveterans.\n  The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act of 1999 contains \n74 substantive provisions; I refer the Members to the conference report \ntext for a complete description. Let me highlight just a few provisions \nnow.\n  Long-term care for veterans is one of the most pressing issues facing \nAmerica--and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). A half century \nago, the 16 million youthful veterans of World War II looked forward to \nbuilding new civilian lives. Today, only about 6 million survive, and \ntheir average age is 75. Health care is their primary concern, the \nlong-term care is a critical component of their health care needs. \nSimply put, what World War II veterans need from VA is long-term care. \nSoon, so too will the 4 million Korean war veterans, now in their mid-\nsixties, and the 8 million Vietnam veterans, now in their fifties, who \nfollow them.\n  Under current law, VA is not required to provide long-term care to \nany veteran. Such care is purely discretionary to VA; it is supplied on \na space available basis only. Under this ``discretionary'' authority--\nas inadequate as it has been--VA has made a substantial contribution to \nthe long term care needs of veterans--by directly providing (at an \nannual cost of $1.1 billion) nursing home care to an average of \napproximately 13,000 veterans per day; by paying for nursing home care \nreceived by approximately 6,500 veterans per day in private nursing \nhomes (at as annual cost of $316.8 million); by subsidizing (at an \nannual cost approximately $200 million per year) nursing home care \nprovided to approximately 14,000 veterans per day in State veterans' \nhomes; and by providing non-institutional alternatives to nursing home \ncare to an average of 11,000 veterans at any given time at an annual \ncost of $154 million.\n  Notwithstanding these significant contributions by VA, there is \nincreasing evidence that the discretionary nature of VA's long-term \ncare mission has created an incentive for VA to divert resources to \nother missions and reduce its capacity to provide long-term care. This \nbill responds to that negative trend by requiring VA to maintain long \nterm capacity at least the 1998 level. In addition, this legislation \nwould, for the first time, require--not authorize--VA to provide \nnursing home care to veterans who need it to treat service-connected \nconditions, and to severely service-disabled veterans who need it to \ncope with other conditions.\n  Nursing home care is the most expensive form of long-term care and, \nfrom the veterans' standpoint, the form of care which is to be avoided \nif possible, or delayed until it is inevitable. This bill will assure \nthat non-institutional alternatives to nursing home care--home-\nbased primary care, home health aide visits, adult day health care, and \nsimilar services--will be available to veterans who need such services \nby requiring that VA include them in the package of medical services to \nwhich each veteran who enrolls for VA care is entitled. The provision \nof such services, as an alternative to much more expensive inpatient \nnursing home care, will save money and improve aging veterans' lives.\n\n  This legislation also directs VA to operate pilot programs to \nidentify the best--and most cost-effective--ways to meet veterans' long \nterm needs. Armed with the data generated by these pilot programs, \nCongress will reevaluate VA nursing home and non-institutional long \nterm care after three years and determine how best to proceed at the \nfour-year ``sunset'' point of this legislation. I might add that the \nconferees were all in agreement that, when we get to the point where we \nconsider renewal of this legislation, we will be looking for ways to \nimprove it, not to repeal it.\n  There is one additional key feature of this legislation that merits \nmention: this bill will plug a substantial hole in VA health care \ncoverage by allowing VA to fund the emergency care needs of all \nenrolled veterans who do not have other health care coverage to fund \nsuch care. The President has stated that all Americans should have \naccess to emergency care. This bill assures that veterans who rely on \nVA for care will.\n  I am particularly pleased that this bill will extend, expand, and \nimprove VA's authority to provide counseling to the victims of sexual \ntrauma while on active duty. It will also extend and improve services \nfor homeless veterans; it will liberalize eligibility for survivors' \nbenefits for widows of totally disabled ex-POWs; it will expand \nbenefits available to veterans exposed to radiation while in service; \nand--importantly--it will ensure that the World War II Veterans' \nMemorial is constructed in a timely manner by facilitating fund raising \nfor that monument.\n  This legislation does many positive things, particularly for our \nolder veterans. The Committee on Veterans' Affairs, however, must also \nrespond to the needs of veterans who are leaving the service today. \nEducational assistance is the most important benefit that our Nation \nprovides to young veterans. Earlier this year, the Senate passed \nlegislation which would have substantially improved benefits under the \nMontgomery GI bill. Unfortunately, budgetary pressures compelled the \nconferees to set these provisions aside for now. I know, however, that \nthe House supports improvements in Montgomery GI bill benefits, and we \nwill take that issue up again in the second session.\n  This legislation reflects the hard work and dedication of many \nmembers of the Senate and the other body. I particularly acknowledge \nthe contribution of the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, Senator Rockefeller, and our Committee's longest-\nserving member and a member of the conference committee, Senator \nThurmond. The conference committee could not have reached a successful \nconclusion without them, or without the energy and commitment of the \nchairman of the House Committee, Bob Stump and his ranking member, Lane \nEvans. I thank them. And I urge the Senate to approve this conference \nreport.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise \ntoday to talk about the Senate passage of the Veterans' Millennium \nHealth Care Act.\n\n[[Page S14905]]\n\n  I am extremely pleased the act contains a provision that will extend \nthe useful life of the Santa Fe National Cemetery in New Mexico. I also \nwant to thank Senator Specter for his assistance in making passage of \nthis Bill possible.\n  The men and women who have served in the United States Armed Forces \nhave made immeasurable sacrifices for the principles of freedom and \nliberty that make this Nation unique throughout civilization. The \nservice of veterans has been vital to the history of the Nation, and \nthe sacrifices made by veterans and their families should not be \nforgotten.\n  These veterans at the very least deserve every opportunity to be \nburied at a National Cemetery of their choosing. Unfortunately, \nprojections show the Santa Fe National Cemetery will run out of space \nto provide casketed burials for our veterans at the conclusion of 2000. \nHowever, with Senate passage of this bill we are ensuring the continued \nviability of the Santa Fe National Cemetery.\n  I believe all New Mexicans can be proud of the Santa Fe National \nCemetery that has grown from 39/100 of an acre to its current 77 acres. \nThe cemetery first opened in 1868 and within several years was \ndesignated a National Cemetery in April of 1875.\n  Men and women who have fought in all of nation's wars hold an honored \nspot within the hallowed ground of the cemetery. Today the Santa Fe \nNational Cemetery contains almost 27,000 graves that are mostly marked \nby upright headstones.\n  The Senate's action today guarantees the Santa Fe National Cemetery \nwill not be forced to close next year. A provision in the bill passed \ntoday allows the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide for the use \nof flat grave markers that will extend the useful life of the cemetery \nuntil 2008.\n  While I wish the practice of utilizing headstones could continue \nindefinitely if a veteran chose, my wishes are outweighed by my desire \nto extend the useful life of the cemetery. I would note that my desire \nis shared by the New Mexico Chapter of the American Legion, the \nAlbuquerque Chapter of the Retired Officers' Association, and the New \nMexico Chapter of the VFW who have all endorsed the use of flat grave \nmarkers.\n  Finally, this is not without precedent because exceptions to the law \nhave been granted on six prior occasions with the most recent action \noccurring in 1994 when Congress authorized the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs to provide for flat grave markers at the Willamette National \nCemetery in Oregon.\n  Mr. President, I again want to thank Senator Specter for his \nassistance and state how pleased I am with the final passage of this \nimportant bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am enormously pleased that the \nCongress has passed this comprehensive bill which would make extensive \nchanges to a wide range of veterans' benefits and services. This \nlegislation is the culmination of extensive oversight and \ninvestigation, as well as the normal process of developing \nlegislation--hearings and markups in both the House and Senate. \nFurther, the bill represents compromise on both sides of the aisle and \nin both Houses of Congress. It represents many, many hours of staff and \nMembers' work, and for that, I thank everyone involved.\n  The bill covers a wide spectrum of issues--from long-term care to new \neducational benefits for servicemembers. I will address some of the \nmore substantive provisions.\n  Mr. President, H.R. 2116, as amended, represents a comprehensive \neffort to address the long-term care needs of our veterans.\n  We know that there is an expanding need for long-term care in our \ncountry, and in the VA, the demand is even more pressing. About 35 \npercent of the veteran population is 65 years or older, and that number \nwill grow dramatically in the next few years. With this legislation, we \nare taking an important step forward for our veterans, and I am hopeful \nthat it signals a new concern for providing long-term care for all \nelderly Americans.\n  For the first time, the VA will be required to provide extended care \nservices to enrolled veterans. Section 101 directs the VA to provide \nnursing home care to any veteran who is in need of such care for a \nservice-connected condition, or who is 70 percent or more service-\nconnected disabled. In addition, the VA is directed to provide \nnoninstitutional care, such as home care and adult day health care, to \nall enrolled veterans. This latter provision was included in the \nVeterans' Long-term Care Enhancement Act of 1999 which I introduced \nthis summer. Within three years of the bill's enactment, VA would \nevaluate and report to the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' \nAffairs on its experience in providing services under both of these \nprovisions.\n  Under the bill, the VA is also required to operate and maintain \nextended care programs so as to ensure that the level of extended care \nservices is not less than the level of such services provided during \nfiscal year 1998.\n  Finally, in order to offset the cost of this new program expansion, \nthe conference agreement requires new long-term care copayments for \nservices exceeding 21 days in any year. Veterans who have compensably \nrated service-connected conditions and veterans with incomes below the \npension rate are exempted from these copayments. Under this provision, \nVA would be required to develop a methodology for establishing the \namount of copayments, taking into account the income of the veterans, \nthe need to protect the veteran's spouse from financial difficulties, \nand the desire to allow the veteran to retain a personal allowance. \nFurther, it was the conferees' desire that copayments would not apply \nto patients who are currently receiving long-term care services.\n  Section 102--also based on the Veterans' Long-term Care Enhancement \nAct of 1999 which I authored--mandates that the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs carry out a series of pilot programs, over a period of three \nyears, which would be designed to gauge the best way for VA to meet \nveterans' long-term care needs: either directly, through cooperative \narrangements with community providers, or by purchasing services from \nnon-VA providers.\n  While VA has developed significant expertise in long-term care over \nthe past 20-plus years, it has not done so with any mandate to share \nits learning with others, nor has it pushed its program development \nbeyond that which met the current needs at the time. Some experts even \nbelieve that VA's expertise is gradually eroding. For VA's expertise to \nbe of greatest use to others, it needs both to better capture what it \nhas done and to develop new learning that would be most applicable to \nother health care entities.\n  A key purpose of the pilot program would be to test and evaluate \nvarious approaches to meeting the long-term care needs of eligible \nveterans, both to develop approaches that could be expanded across VA, \nas well as to demonstrate to others outside of VA the effectiveness and \nimpact of various approaches to long-term care. To this end, the pilot \nprogram would include specific data collection on matters such as cost \neffectiveness, quality of health care services provided, enrollee and \nhealth care provider satisfaction, and the ability of participants to \ncarry out basic activities of daily living.\n  Another provision based on my veterans' long-term care legislation \nwould authorize the VA to establish a pilot program for assisted living \nservices. Assisted living is the last remaining gap in VA's long-term \ncare continuum, and the Federal Advisory Committee on the Future of VA \nLong-Term Care recommended that VA be granted the authority to provide \nassisted living services. I urge VA to undertake this pilot program, as \nit will provide a basis on which to recommend expanding the authority.\n  Mr. President, earlier this year I joined with Senator Daschle as an \noriginal cosponsor to S. 1146, the Veterans' Access to Emergency Care \nAct of 1999. In June, I offered the provisions included in this bill as \nan amendment to a veterans omnibus measure being discussed at a Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs markup. The amendment was agreed to by a \nmajority of the Committee members.\n  Just this week I was reminded of the need for better coverage for \nnon-VA emergency care. The wife of a seriously ill veteran in my state \nof West Virginia called my office. Her husband is a non-\n\n[[Page S14906]]\n\nservice-connected, low income veteran with no health insurance. \nRecently, severe chest pains sent him to a VA medical center. Because \nhe is a cardiac patient and because he was in so much distress, his \nfamily wanted to call the rescue squad to transport him to the VA \nmedical center. The veteran refused. Why? Because he had used the \nambulance service before in an emergency situation, leaving the family \nwith a sizeable bill that they are unable to pay. So, this sick veteran \nalmost crawled to the family car, insisting that his family drive him. \nOnce there, the VA medical staff told the veteran and his family that \nby not calling for an ambulance, the veteran was placed at risk.\n  Section 111 would authorize the VA to make non-VA emergency care \nreimbursement payments on behalf of enrolled veterans in all priority \ngroups, provided the veteran has received VA care within a two-year \nperiod prior to the emergency and has no other health insurance \noptions.\n  While this emergency care provision is significantly more restrictive \nthan I had wanted, it is a valuable first attempt at ensuring that \nveterans who do not have other health insurance options--like the \nseriously ill West Virginia veteran who refused when his family tried \nto call for an ambulance--will be reimbursed for their non-VA emergency \ncare services. In negotiating this provision, I was resolute in pushing \nfor all enrolled veterans to have this coverage. I will be watching \nclosely to ensure that this more limited emergency care provision is \nworking for our veterans.\n  Section 112 is based on legislation introduced by Senator Robb. It \nwould establish a specific eligibility for VA health care for veterans \nwho were awarded the Purple Heart. This provision is designed to \nprovide priority for enrollment to these veterans who have no other \nspecial eligibility for care.\n  According to the Military Order of the Purple Heart, there are about \none-half million veterans with this award. Roughly half of these \nhonored veterans already would qualify for high priority care based on \na service-connected disability or because of income.\n  The recipients of the Purple Heart award are American heroes, and I \nthank Senator Robb for his leadership on this measure, which will \nensure that the remaining 500,000 Purple Heart veterans will have \nunfettered access to VA health care services.\n  Military retirees have had a difficult time accessing various health \ncare programs. Reductions in military treatment facilities, in \nparticular, have restricted military retirees' health care options. \nSection 113 attempts to improve their situation.\n  Under the bill, the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs will \nbe directed to enter into an agreement to allow for VA reimbursement \nfor health care services provided to military retirees. Veterans who \nhave retired from military service and who are not otherwise eligible \nfor VA care will not be responsible for copayments.\n  In order to protect current enrollees, the Secretary must document \nthat VA--in a given area--has the capacity in such an area to provide \ntimely care to enrollees and has determined that VA would recover its \ncost of providing such care.\n  I am very pleased that House and Senate conferees were able to reach \nagreement on this provision to improve care for military retirees.\n  Section 117 is of particular interest to me as it addresses VA's \nspecialized mental health services for veterans.\n  Last year, I directed my staff on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs \nto undertake a study of the services the Department of Veterans Affairs \noffers to veterans with special needs. Earlier this summer, I received \nthe report my Committee staff wrote based on their 8-month oversight \ninvestigation, which sought to determine if VA is complying with a \nCongressional mandate to maintain capacity in five of the specialized \nprograms: Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Services, Blind Rehabilitation, \nSpinal Cord Injury (SCI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD), and \nSubstance Use Disorders. I was dismayed to learn that because of staff \nand funding reductions, with the resulting workload increases and \nexcessive waiting times, the latter two programs are failing to sustain \nservices at the needed levels.\n  With specific regard to PTSD, VA has been moving to reduce inpatient \ntreatment of PTSD, while expanding its use of outpatient programs. VA's \ndecision has been fueled in part by studies of the cost effectiveness \nof various treatment approaches. The potential to stretch limited VA \ndollars to be able to treat more veterans is appealing. However, VA \nneeds to be cautious before subscribing to the idea that outpatient \ncare is as good as inpatient care for all veterans with PTSD. For some \nof the more seriously affected veterans--those who have not succeeded \nin shorter inpatient or outpatient programs, are homeless or \nunemployed, or have dual diagnoses--longer inpatient or bed-based care \nmay be a necessity.\n\n  Substance use disorders also present complex treatment problems and \nhave taken the brunt of reductions in specialized programs. Some \nsubstance use disorder programs have terminated inpatient treatment \ncompletely, except for veterans requiring short detoxifications in \nextreme situations. While some medical centers have closed inpatient \nsubstance use disorder beds, they have worked to provide alternative, \nsheltered living arrangements. Unfortunately, not all facilities have \nmade these efforts. Many have moved directly to the closure of \ninpatient units without first developing these other alternatives.\n  As an outgrowth of this oversight effort, I developed legislation to \nrequire that VA provide better care for veterans in need. I thank \nChairman Specter for accepting this legislation and including it in S. \n1076, the Veterans Benefits Act of 1999.\n  Under section 117, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required to \ncarry out programs to enhance the provision of specialized mental \nhealth services to veterans. The conference agreement specifically \ntargets services for those afflicted with PTSD and substance use \ndisorders. The legislation also requires that $15 million in funding \nwill be made available, in a centralized manner, to fund proposals from \nthe VISNs and the individual facilities to provide specialized mental \nhealth services. The legislation specifically ensures that this $15 \nmillion in grant funding will be over and above what VA currently \nspends on these programs.\n  The focus of Section 117 is on expanding outpatient and residential \ntreatment facilities, developing better case management, and generally \nimproving the availability of services. Though not specifically \nmentioned in the legislation, I encourage VA to carry out programs for \nthe following: (1) additional outpatient and residential treatment \nfacilities for PTSD in areas that are underserved by existing programs; \n(2) short-term or long-term care services that combine residential \ntreatment of PTSD; (3) dedicated case management services on an \noutpatient basis for veterans suffering from PTSD; (4) enhanced \nstaffing of existing PTSD programs; (5) additional community-based \nresidential treatment facilities for substance use disorder programs; \n(6) expanded opioid treatment services; and (7) enhanced substance use \ndisorder services at facilities where such services have been \neliminated.\n  In my view, VA's mental health treatment programs, in general, have \nbeen cut back to the point that veterans in some areas of the country \nare suffering needlessly. That is why I am so pleased that H.R. 2116 \nincludes provisions to prompt VA to begin to rebuild some of what has \nbeen lost.\n  Section 201--based on the House bill--would allow the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs the authority to set copayments, both for \npharmaceuticals and for outpatient treatment. Currently, all veterans \nwho are below 50 percent service-connected disabled, and veterans whose \nincome is below the pension level, are required to pay $2 for each 30-\nday supply of medication. And all ``category C'' veterans are required \nto pay copayments based on the estimated average cost of an outpatient \nvisit--currently $45.80.\n  The outpatient copayment rate needs to be adjusted. This charge is \nincurred each and every time a category C veteran receives outpatient \ncare, regardless of the services provided. There is no doubt that $45 \nfor a routine outpatient visit is unreasonable at best, and at its \nworst, may, in fact, discourage veterans from getting the primary care \nthey need. I am confident that VA will study this issue closely and \nwill\n\n[[Page S14907]]\n\nset the outpatient copayment to be more in line with managed care plans \nwhich charge either $5 or $10.\n  While I am supportive of adjusting the outpatient copayment, I have \nserious concerns about increasing the pharmaceutical drug copayment. \nThe House Committee on Veterans' Affairs was adamant that the Senate \nrecede to this increase to help offset the Senate-sponsored program \nexpansions in long-term care and emergency care. And although the $2 \nper prescription charge that veterans are paying now may seem like an \ninsignificant amount to some, I can assure my colleagues that to the \nveteran and his family living on a very limited income, it is quite \nsignificant. I hear from a number of veterans whose income hovers just \nabove the pension level, who must pay the assigned copayment for their \npharmaceuticals. Many of them are older veterans who are on a number of \ndifferent medications for multiple medical conditions.\n  It is critically important that we do not place this segment of our \nveteran population in the same situation as many of our aging \npopulation receiving care in the private sector--having to choose \nbetween buying their medication or putting food on the table.\n  In an effort to prevent this from happening, I strongly urge the VA \nto set maximum monthly and annual copayment amounts which are sensitive \nto the financial situation of veterans for those who have multiple \noutpatient prescriptions. I will be closely watching the implementation \nof this provision to ensure that it does not impose an undue burden on \nour veterans.\n  While the Senate was not able to stave off the House in increasing \nprescription copayments, we were able to flatly reject a House \nprovision to require copayments for hearing aids and eyeglasses. Such a \nprovision would penalize veterans who are taking advantage of a needed \nbenefit.\n  Section 206 extends the VA's program for the evaluation of the health \nof spouses and children of Gulf War veterans for four years. I pushed \nfor the original legislation providing for these health evaluations \nafter hearing about Gulf War veterans and their families who reported \nmiscarriages, birth defects, and other reproductive problems.\n  Last year, the Congress modified this program to allow VA to use fee-\nbasis care. It seems that these modifications are working well, as many \nnew dependants have applied and are now waiting to be seen.\n  I am delighted that this program has been extended because the need \nfor assessments continues. By this time last year, 2,800 dependents had \napplied for the program, and this year that total is up to 4,000. \nHowever, although 4,000 dependents have applied for the evaluations, VA \nhas only completed 1,140 examinations. I urge VA to process these \nexaminations as rapidly as possible. These dependents of servicemembers \nshould not be delayed in their quest for answers.\n  Section 208 contains provisions to improve VA's enhanced use lease \nauthority. I am delighted with these provisions, because I believe \nenhanced use leases are a critical component of VA's management \nstrategy for its property. Many terrific projects that better serve \nveterans and assist the VA have been developed under this authority. By \nway of this legislation, we are encouraging VA to develop more enhanced \nuse lease projects to leverage its assets, rather than begin to dispose \nof irreplaceable property.\n  Since VA received enhanced use authority, it has been used in a \nvariety of ways. One approach has been to lease land to companies that \nbuild nursing homes where VA can place veterans at discounted rates, \nresulting in savings of millions of dollars. Another use has been to \nprovide transitional housing for homeless veterans. Other projects have \ncreated reliable child care and adult day care facilities for VA \nemployees' families, so that they can care for veterans without having \nto worry about the health and safety of their loved ones. In other \nlocations, VA regional offices are moving onto VA medical center \ncampuses, resulting in more convenient access for veterans and better \ncooperation between the Veterans Benefits Administration and the \nVeterans Health Administration.\n  Section 208 of H.R. 2116 would remove many of the current barriers \npreventing VA from having an even more successful enhanced use lease \nprogram. It would allow VA to enter into leases with terms of up to 75 \nyears, rather than the current 20 and 35 years, while eliminating the \ndistinction in lease terms that exists between leases involving new \nconstruction or substantial renovation, and those involving current \nstructures.\n  I am very interested in seeing VA engage in more of these projects, \nso I am pleased to see that H.R. 2116 would require the Secretary to \nprovide training and outreach regarding enhanced use leasing to \npersonnel at VA medical centers. The bill also requires the Secretary \nto contract for independent assessments of opportunities for enhanced \nuse leases. These assessments would include surveys of suitable \nfacilities, determinations of the feasibility of projects at those \nfacilities, and analyses of the resources required to enter into a \nlease. I hope that more training--which until now has been sporadic and \nprovided primarily on a by-request basis--and a more systematic and \ncentralized approach would assist the VA in maximizing its enhanced use \nlease opportunities.\n  While VA currently has a policy which allows for fee-basis care for \nchiropractic care, section 303 of H.R. 2116 requires the VA Under \nSecretary for Health, in consultation with chiropractors, to establish \na wider VA policy on chiropractic care. While conferees have agreed \nthat VA should establish a policy regarding chiropractic care, they \nhave remained silent on mandating that VA furnish veterans with \nchiropractic treatment. Indeed, it is Congress' intent that this \nprovision not be read as an endorsement for chiropractic care.\n  Complementary and alternative medicine, including chiropractic care, \nare important aspects of health care. I urge VA to use this opportunity \nto develop a policy on all forms of complementary and alternative \nmedicine. In particular, the report ``VHA Complementary and Alternative \nMedicine Practices and Future Opportunities'' recommended that VHA \nconsider providing acupuncture, following guidelines set forth by the \nNational Institutes of Health, since NIH has already approved \nacupuncture as an effective treatment for back pain.\n  I am extremely disappointed that the House would not move the Senate \nMontgomery GI Bill (MGIB) enhancement legislation. The Senate passed \nMGIB enhancements on three occasions this year, but the House did not \nrespond.\n  S. 1402, the education bill reported out of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, contained a provision, among others, to increase the \nmonthly benefit provided to current servicemembers from $528 to $600. \nThis more than 12 percent increase would have followed on the heels of \na 20 percent increase last year. Additionally, the Senate bill would \nhave allowed servicemembers to elect to contribute up to an additional \n$600, in exchange for receiving four times their contribution. Although \nthese increases fall short of the full tuition recommended by the so-\ncalled Transition Commission, they would have provided a substantial \nassistance to veterans. The costs of tuition and fees for public and \nprivate educational institutions rose approximately 90 percent from \n1980-1995, while the MGIB benefit rates only increased 42 percent from \n1985 to 1995.\n  The statistics regarding education and employment for veterans are \nalso revealing. Despite almost full enrollment in the program by \nservicemembers, the number of eligible veterans who take advantage of \ntheir MGIB benefits is startlingly low, around 50 percent. Less than 20 \npercent of those who use the MGIB attend private institutions. And the \nTransition Commission reports that the unemployment rate for veterans \nages 20-24 and 35-39 is higher than their non-veteran counterparts. All \nthese are reasons why I believe that there is more that we can and must \ndo. Unfortunately, we will need to wait until at least next year to \ntackle these issues.\n  H.R. 2116 does provide for two provisions--relating to test \npreparation and Officer Candidate Training--which while small, can make \na significant difference to the individual veterans affected.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs currently has authority to provide \nMGIB benefits for post-graduate exam preparatory courses that are \nrequired\n\n[[Page S14908]]\n\nfor a particular profession, such as CPA exam or bar review courses. \nHowever, it does not have authority to provide for pre-admission \npreparatory coursework.\n  Nevertheless, studies by national consulting companies have shown \nimprovement of over 100 points on the SAT exam and an average \nimprovement of seven points in LSAT scores for students who take exam \npreparatory courses. An article in the April 13, 1998, New Republic \nstated, ``[t]horough, expertly taught preparation can raise a student's \nability to cope with, and hence succeed on, a particular exam. In many \ncases, then, test prep can make the difference between getting into a \ntop-flight law school and settling for the second tier.'' At some of \nthe nation's top schools, scores on entrance exams can count for half \nof the total application.\n  The problem is that many of these exam preparatory courses are quite \ncostly. One national provider charges as much as $750 for a two-month, \npart-time, SAT preparatory course. One educational advocacy group, \nFairtest, argues that ``[t]he SAT has always favored students who can \nafford coaching over those who cannot . . .'' To be able to compete, it \nis critical that veterans have access to such courses.\n  That is why I am pleased that section 701 corrects that disparity by \nallowing veterans to use their MGIB benefits for preparatory courses \nfor entrance examinations required for college and graduate school \nadmission (``test prep''). By giving veterans the opportunity to better \ntheir admissions test scores, this amendment would expand the choices \navailable to veterans in their course of higher education. It will also \nimprove access to the top educational institutions for veterans.\n  Section 702 allows servicemembers who failed to complete their \ninitial period of service--because of entry to Officer Candidate School \nor Officer Training School (``OCS'')--to retain their eligibility for \nMGIB benefits. This would allow their OCS service to count toward that \ninitial obligated period of service (generally three years total).\n  In most instances, these servicemembers had already made a $1,200 \ncontribution to the MGIB, which cannot be refunded, by law. Rather than \nrefund this money, the House and Senate agree that we should allow \nthese men and women to retain their MGIB eligibility and further their \neducation.\n  Like the test prep provision, it should be our policy to always \nencourage servicemembers and veterans to strive for greater \nachievement. This provision corrects an oversight in the MGIB statutes \nthat penalizes servicemembers for seeking promotions.\n  As we are all sadly aware, the veteran population is aging rapidly. \nIn 1997, 537,000 veterans died. Projections of the veteran death rate \nshow an increase through the year 2008, when the death rate of the WWII \nand Korea-era veterans will peak at 620,000 veterans. Unless expanded, \n21 national cemeteries are scheduled to close to inground burial or \nclose completely by FY 2005. National cemeteries take an average of \nseven years to open. That is why I felt it was critical to address now \nVA's plan to provide burial sites for our nation's veterans.\n  VA conducted studies in 1987 and 1994 that identified the top 10 \nveteran population areas that are not served by a national cemetery. \nPursuant to those studies, VA has begun, and in some cases completed, \nconstruction of six cemeteries in: Cleveland (OH), Chicago (IL), \nSeattle (WA), Dallas (TX), Saratoga (NY), and San Joaquin Valley (CA).\n  However, there has been no activity in the remaining six locations \ncontained on the 1987 and 1994 lists: Detroit (MI), Sacramento (CA), \nMiami (FL), Atlanta (GA), Pittsburgh (PA), and Oklahoma City (OK). That \nis why I am pleased that H.R. 2116 authorizes VA to build cemeteries in \nthe top areas in need. I am hopeful that the Appropriations Committee \nwill fund construction of these cemeteries, particularly in light of \ntheir direction of advanced planning funds in this year's VA-HUD \nAppropriations bill.\n  Sections 601-603 authorize the American Battle Monuments Commission \nto borrow funds from the Treasury Department to construct the WWII \nmemorial on the Mall if it is unable to raise sufficient funds through \nprivate donations. It also extends the authority to break ground for \nfour years. This will ensure that the veterans who are to be honored by \nthis memorial will be able to see it constructed.\n  I have agreed to a study, based on a House provision, of the current \nstate of cemeteries to assess repair needs, ways to improve appearance, \nand the number of cemeteries needed to serve veterans who die after \n2005. Finally, section 621 requires that the VA study the adequacy and \neffectiveness of burial benefits that a veteran's dependents receive, \nas well as options to better serve veterans and their families. In \nlight of inflation in the cost of burials, as well as the increase in \noptions such as cremation and burial at sea, it is appropriate that VA \nreevaluate this program.\n  This bill contains a number of benefits provisions that will aid \nveterans. For example, section 503 will add bronchiolo-alviolar \ncarcinoma to the list of presumptive conditions associated with \nexposure to ionizing radiation. Bronchiolo-alviolar carcinoma is a type \nof lung cancer. The Senate has passed provisions adding lung cancer to \nthe list of presumptive conditions on several occasions, but the House \nhas not moved similar legislation.\n  Section 711 will extend the reservist home loan guaranty authority to \nDecember 31, 2007. The current authority is set to expire in 2003. \nHowever, a reservist must serve six years before being eligible for the \nhome loan guaranty. Therefore, in order for it to be used as a \nrecruiting incentive, the authority must be extended beyond 2006.\n\n  I am extremely gratified that section 501 authorizes payment of \ndependency and indemnity compensation (``DIC'') to the surviving spouse \nof a former POW veteran who dies of a non-service-connected condition \nif the former POW was rated totally disabled due to a POW-related \npresumptive condition for a period of one or more years immediately \nprior to death. In the case of former POWs, this reduces the 10-year \nperiod prior to death that a veteran must be rated 100 percent service-\nconnected for the spouse to receive DIC if the veteran dies of a non-\nservice-connected condition. This provision recognizes that former \nPOW's suffered extreme hardships and that their spouses cared for them \nthroughout the years that VA did not recognize their health conditions \nas being service-related. I am proud that we named this provision of \nthe bill the ``John William Rolen Act.'' John passed away this year. He \nwas a tireless advocate for America's former POWs, and I will miss him.\n  Section 502 of H.R. 2116 corrects an oversight in last year's \ntransportation bill (TEA 21) that reinstated DIC to remarried widows of \nveterans whose remarriages have now been terminated. The benefit had \npreviously been cut off as a budget reconciliation item. While \nreinstating DIC payments, however, the transportation bill failed to \nrestore the limited ancillary benefits that accompany the receipt of \nDIC: CHAMPVA, home loan guaranty, and educational benefits. This bill \nrestores those ancillary benefits.\n  Finally, I am so glad that we will maintain our commitment to \nhomeless veterans by reauthorizing the Homeless Veteran Reintegration \nProgram (HVRP). Section 901 authorizes increased funding levels for job \ntraining for veterans for four consecutive years, beginning with $10 \nmillion additional in the first year, $15 million additional in the \nsecond year, and $20 million additional in each of the third and fourth \nyears. We have also required, in section 903, that VA formulate a \ncomprehensive plan that includes the Departments of Labor and Housing \nand Urban Development, to conduct a cross-cutting report evaluating the \neffectiveness of homeless programs beyond six months of placement or \nservice delivery.\n  Title XI of H.R. 2116 provides VA with authority to offer voluntary \nseparation incentives through December 31, 2000, to a specified number \nof FTEE. As is well known, inadequate VA budgets in the last several \nyears have forced VA to make sweeping changes, (many of which were \nwarranted, including the downsizing of employees. VHA has already \neliminated thousands of employees via ``reductions in force'' \n(``RIFs''). VHA FTEE staff now stands at 182,000, down from 218,000 in \n1994. VBA FTEE has also declined, from 13,500 in 1994 to\n\n[[Page S14909]]\n\n11,200 today. All this is occurring at a time when VA is treating more \npatients and deciding more claims.\n  Usually, a condition of voluntary separation incentives--or buyouts \nas they are known--is that the FTEE slot is eliminated in a one-for-one \nreduction, i.e. downsizing. But I believe that VA has already reached \nthe precipice of staff reductions--the point beyond which we should not \ngo if quality of VA health care is to be maintained. However, VA says \nthat it still requires buyouts in order to ``rightsize.'' That is, VA \nmust let go of employees who do not have the needed skills, in order to \nfree up FTEE positions so that VA can hire the most appropriately \nqualified people. The buyout language in this bill prohibits VA from \neliminating the FTEE positions of employees who have received buyouts.\n  If we do not provide VA with buyout authority, VA will proceed down \nthe path of reductions regardless. For example, VHA will RIF thousands \nof employees next year. However, RIFs are an inexact management tool. \nRIFs would not necessarily result in the skills mix VA needs, due to \nthe civil service employment rights that allow senior employees to take \nthe job of junior employees. I believe that buyouts offer a better \noption, but one that must still be used wisely and monitored \ncarefully--which is why H.R. 2116 allows only limited buyouts under \nvery strict conditions.\n  I am very disappointed that we were unable to move the Senate \nprovision overturning the ``$1,500 rule.'' Since 1933, the law has \nrequired VA to suspend the compensation or pension benefits of \nincompetent veterans who have no dependents and are hospitalized at \ngovernment expense. This suspension is triggered when the veteran's \nestate exceeds $1,500, and VA benefits are cut off until the veteran's \nestate is spent down to $500. At that time, the VA commences \nreinstating the veteran's compensation, until such time the veteran is \nhospitalized again and the estate exceeds $1,500, when the benefits are \ncut off again. No similar suspension is made for competent veterans or \nfor incompetent veterans who are not hospitalized.\n  The rationale for cutting off benefits was that these veterans might \nhave been institutionalized for years, and that it was not good policy \nto allow their estates to build up when they have no dependents to \ninherit them. There was also a fear of fraud on the part of the \nveteran's guardian or fiduciary.\n  The dollar amounts have not changed since 1933, when $1,500 equaled \nalmost three years' worth of VA benefits at a 100 percent rating level. \nIn today's dollars, this is less than one month's benefit at a 100 \npercent rating level.\n  Although veterans are generally being hospitalized for shorter \nperiods of time, based on the low dollar limit, the rule may be applied \nvery quickly, sometimes immediately, when it does apply. Further, it \ntakes VA an average of 66 days to restore the benefits to incompetent \nveterans once their estates have been spent down. Since incompetent \nveterans are no longer routinely institutionalized for years at a time, \nit is very difficult for a non-Medicaid eligible veteran (which would \nbe any veteran receiving any significant amount of VA compensation) to \nbe released from the hospital and placed in either a private assisted \nliving or group home with only $500 in his bank account. I fear some of \nthese veterans may end up on the streets because of this policy, \ndespite the best efforts of VHA to place them at discharge.\n  I believe that this outdated and indefensible policy discriminates \nagainst incompetent veterans--those who are least likely to be able to \nfight for themselves. The fact is, we are means testing VA compensation \nfor this one class of veterans. Why is a competent veteran with no \ndependents entitled to receive his compensation, but an incompetent \nveteran not entitled? There is no justification for this \ndiscrimination. It may also have some harmful effects for a small \npopulation of veterans, facilitating their downward spiral into \nhomelessness. That may be too much of a price to pay for the government \nto save some money from reverting to the state if that veteran died \nwhile hospitalized. While we were not successful in addressing this \nissue in this bill, I plan to readdress this policy until it is \ncorrected.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I want to acknowledge the work of our \nCommittee's Chairman, Senator Specter, in developing this comprehensive \nlegislation. Through his efforts, and that of his staff--especially the \nformer Committee Staff Director, Charles Battaglia, and the new \nCommittee Staff Director, William Tuerk--the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs has fully met its responsibilities and can be proud \nof the legislation we consider today.\n  I appreciate the willingness of the House Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, especially Chairman Bob Stump and Ranking Member Lane Evans, \nto work together to reach compromise on so many vital issues.\n  And I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the efforts of my own \nstaff, Minority Staff Director, Jim Gottlieb, Professional Staff \nMember, Kim Lipsky, and Counsel, Mary Schoelen. I am enormously \ngrateful for their diligence, and for their commitment to the work we \ndo in this Committee on behalf of our Nation's veterans.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2116, the \nVeterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act of 1999.\n  I would like to begin by thanking my colleague, Senator Specter, \nchairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, for his leadership \non issues of importance to veterans. H.R. 2116 contains a number of \nprovisions that will benefit veterans in Maine and elsewhere because of \nhis strong leadership. I applaud Senator Specter for his efforts.\n  I would especially like to thank the chairman for his efforts to \naddress a concern I had about a specific provision in the House-passed \nversion of the bill, which would have jeopardized millions of dollars \nin grant funding for the Maine State Veterans Homes system.\n  H.R. 2116 contains a provision which fundamentally reorders the \nmanner in which VA construction grants will be awarded in the future, \nplacing the focus on renovation of existing facilities so that \nmaintenance projects will take precedence in grant awards over \nproposals to construct new facilities. The House-passed version of the \nbill would have made Maine veterans homes and state homes in a number \nof states ineligible for funding, even through they had already \nprepared and filed grant applications under existing law and \nregulations.\n  In an effort to address this concern, I worked closely with Senator \nSpecter to craft a transition provision balancing the need to treat \ncurrent state home applicants fairly and not change the rules in the \nmiddle of the game, while at the same time implementing the new rules \nas soon as possible.\n  I am very pleased that the conference for H.R. 2116 agreed to the \nmeasure I helped author that grandfathers proposals already filed by \nveterans homes, thereby exempting them from new criteria in the bill \nthat would have precluded funding in this and coming fiscal years.\n  I believe this compromise remains true to the intent of the new \ncriteria included in the House-passed version of the bill, while at the \nsame time protecting the interests of states that had already submitted \napplications for funding.\n  In addition to work with Senator Specter personally, I wrote a letter \nto the chairman in September alerting him to my concerns, followed by a \nletter to my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins. In addition, last \nmonth, I spearheaded a letter with 14 other Senators urging \nmodification of the House construction grant provision to grandfather \nproposals made by Maine and other states under existing law, so that it \nwould not change the methodology in the middle of the current fiscal \nyear--after applications have been filed; after architectural, \nengineering, and legal fees have been incurred, and after local \nmatching funds have been appropriated or borrowed by states for these \nprojects.\n  If the House-passed provision had been enacted without this change, \nmany states veterans homes would have lost their positions for Fiscal \nYear 2000 grants because these applications would have been judged \naccording to a new set of criteria.\n  In Maine, this would have jeopardized funding for the entire Maine \nVeterans Homes system, which earlier this year applied for about $9.3 \nmillion in grant\n\n[[Page S14910]]\n\nfunding, and is seeking to construct new veterans' residential care \nfacilities in Augusta, Bangor, Caribou, and Scarborough. In their \napplications, the Maine Veterans Home System notes that more than half \nof Maine's veterans population is reaching the age where long-term \nnursing care or domicillary care is typically required. Since 1991, the \nnumber of Maine veterans aged 75-79 has doubled, from 6,000 to 12,500. \nOver the same time period, the numbers of veterans aged 80-84 has \ndoubled from 2,400 to 6,000; and veterans over the age of 85 has \nincreased by 50 percent from 1,200 to 1,800.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Specter for supporting another \nprovision in H.R. 2116 based on legislation I introduced in the Senate, \nS. 1579, the Veterans Sexual Trauma Treatment Act. S. 1579 extends a VA \nprogram that offers counseling and medical treatment to veterans who \nwere sexually abused while serving in the military, and requires a VA \nmental health professional to determine when counseling is necessary. \nCurrently, the VA Secretary makes this determination. The bill also \ncalls for the dissemination of information concerning the availability \nof counseling services to veterans through public service \nannouncements.\n  According to the Department of Defense, at least 55 percent of active \nduty women and 14 percent of active duty men have been subjected to \nsexual harassment. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nI credit the DoD with working to reduce the prevalence of sexual \nharassment in the military. However, as long as there is harassment in \nthe military, it is vital that victims have access to treatment, and \nH.R. 2116 provides the tools to do this.\n  Finally, I would like to commend the Senate and House Veterans' \nAffairs Committees and the conferees for H.R. 2116 for their efforts to \nexpand a whole range of benefits for veterans in this conference \nreport. For example, the bill expands long-term care for veterans, and \nwill increase home and community-based care and assisted-living options \nfor veterans. It expands mental health services, and requires the VA to \nenhance specialized services for PTSD and drug abuse disorders. It \nprovides coverage for uninsured veterans who need care but who do not \nhave access to a VA facility. It expands VA authority to provide \nservices to homeless veterans. It improves Montgomery GI bill benefits \nby providing benefits for students in preparatory courses and to those \nwhose enlistment is interrupted to attend officers training school. And \nthese are just a few of the important provisions in this bill.\n  Mr. President, this is a strong bill, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in a strong show of support.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                              Section 207\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I too, would like to \nrecognize Senator Specter, for his tremendous work and skillful \nleadership and sensitivity in bringing the Veterans Millennium Health \nCare bill (H.R. 2116) to the floor. As a veteran myself, I can assure \nyou that this bill means a great deal in providing for the health and \nwelfare of our veterans both in my state of New Hampshire as well as \nthose veterans throughout the country. I congratulate Senator Specter's \nleadership on issues that are of particular importance to our veteran \ncommunity.\n  If I may also ask the senator to clarify the transition clause of \nSection 207(c) of the bill. Does the Senator mean that provided that \nstate home grant applicants covered by the transition clause follow all \napplicable laws and regulations in effect on November 10, 1999, that \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall award grants to all \napplications remaining unfunded for fiscal year 1999 priority one \nprojects first, then proceed to awarding grants to priority one \nprojects as outlined and in the order in which they appeared in the \nDepartment of Veteran Affairs Fiscal Year 2000 priority list as covered \nby Section 207(c) of the bill, prior to awarding grants to any other \napplicants?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes, the Senator is correct. The purpose of this section \nis to reform the priorities under which state home grant applications \nare considered so that much needed renovation and maintenance projects \nwill receive more appropriate consideration for funding than under the \ncurrent system.\n  I am pleased that we were able to craft a transition provision that \nbalanced the desire to ensure that all states had an opportunity to \nparticipate under the old rules, with the desire to implement the new \nrules as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Thank you Mr. Chairman and again I \nappreciate your consideration and sensitivity to the veteran community. \nYour leadership on this issue will enable the Veterans Home in Tilton, \nNew Hampshire to better meet the medical needs of veterans in New \nHampshire. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I commend my colleague, Senator Specter, chairman of the \nSenate Veteran's Affairs Committee, for the remarkably responsive and \nskillful manner in which he managed the progress of H.R. 2116. This \nbill means a lot to veterans throughout the nation, and especially in \nmy home state of Maine. I applaud Senator Specter's leadership on \nissues of importance to veterans.\n  I have only one point of clarification. Does the transition clause of \nSection 207(c) of the bill mean, that for all state home grant \napplications covered by the transition clause and otherwise in \ncompliance with applicable law and regulations in effect on November \n10, 1999, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall award grants first to \nall unfunded applications remaining for fiscal year 1999 priority one \nprojects? And that following those projects, the Secretary shall next \nfund those FY 2000 applications and which both meet the criteria set \nforth in the bill and which were accorded priority one status for FY \n2000? And that the Secretary would fund these projects in the order in \nwhich they would appear on the fiscal year 2000 priority one list, \nprior to awarding grants to any other applications?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes, the Senator is correct. The purpose of this section \nis to reform the priorities under which state home grant applications \nare considered so that much needed renovation and maintenance projects \nwill receive more appropriate consideration for funding than under the \ncurrent system. I am pleased that we were able to craft a transition \nprovision that balanced the desire to ensure that all states had an \nopportunity to participate under the old rules, with the desire to \nimplement the new rules as quickly as possible.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the chairman once again, and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent the conference report be agreed \nto, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements \nrelated to the conference report be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 410, S. 1453.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1453) to facilitate famine relief efforts and a \n     comprehensive solution to the war in Sudan,\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nbill, which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign Relations, \nwith an amendment to strike all after the enacting clause and inserting \nin lieu thereof the following:\n\n                                S. 1453\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sudan Peace Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) With clear indications that the Government of Sudan \n     intends to intensify its prosecution of the war against areas \n     outside of its control, which has already cost nearly \n     2,000,000 lives and has displaced more than 4,000,000, a \n     sustained and coordinated international effort to pressure \n     combatants to end hostilities and to address the roots of the \n     conflict offers the best opportunity for a comprehensive \n     solution to the continuing war in Sudan.\n       (2) A viable, comprehensive, and internationally sponsored \n     peace process, protected from manipulation, presents the best \n     chance for a permanent resolution of the war, protection of \n     human rights, and a self-sustaining Sudan.\n\n[[Page S14911]]\n\n       (3) Continued strengthening of humanitarian relief \n     operations in Sudan is an essential element in the effort to \n     bring an end to the war.\n       (4) Continued leadership by the United States is critical.\n       (5) Regardless of the future political status of the areas \n     of Sudan outside of the control of the Government of Sudan, \n     the absence of credible civil authority and institutions is a \n     major impediment to achieving self-sustenance by the Sudanese \n     people and to meaningful progress toward a viable peace \n     process.\n       (6) Through manipulation of traditional rivalries among \n     peoples in areas outside their full control, the Government \n     of Sudan has effectively used divide and conquer techniques \n     to subjugate their population, and Congress finds that \n     internationally sponsored reconciliation efforts have played \n     a critical role in reducing the tactic's effectiveness and \n     human suffering.\n       (7) The Government of Sudan is increasingly utilizing and \n     organizing militias, Popular Defense Forces, and other \n     irregular troops for raiding and slaving parties in areas \n     outside of the control of the Government of Sudan in an \n     effort to severely disrupt the ability of those populations \n     to sustain themselves. The tactic is in addition to the overt \n     use of bans on air transport relief flights in prosecuting \n     the war through selective starvation and to minimize the \n     Government of Sudan's accountability internationally.\n       (8) The Government of Sudan has repeatedly stated that it \n     intends to use the expected proceeds from future oil sales to \n     increase the tempo and lethality of the war against the areas \n     outside its control.\n       (9) Through its power to veto plans for air transport \n     flights under the United Nations relief operation, Operation \n     Lifeline Sudan (OLS), the Government of Sudan has been able \n     to manipulate the receipt of food aid by the Sudanese people \n     from the United States and other donor countries as a \n     devastating weapon of war in the ongoing effort by the \n     Government of Sudan to subdue areas of Sudan outside of the \n     Government's control.\n       (10) The efforts of the United States and other donors in \n     delivering relief and assistance through means outside OLS \n     have played a critical role in addressing the deficiencies in \n     OLS and offset the Government of Sudan's manipulation of food \n     donations to advantage in the civil war in Sudan.\n       (11) While the immediate needs of selected areas in Sudan \n     facing starvation have been addressed in the near term, the \n     population in areas of Sudan outside of the control of the \n     Government of Sudan are still in danger of extreme disruption \n     of their ability to sustain themselves.\n       (12) The Nuba Mountains and many areas in Bahr al Ghazal, \n     Upper Nile, and Blue Nile regions have been excluded \n     completely from relief distribution by OLS, consequently \n     placing their populations at increased risk of famine.\n       (13) At a cost which can exceed $1,000,000 per day, and \n     with a primary focus on providing only for the immediate food \n     needs of the recipients, the current international relief \n     operations are neither sustainable nor desirable in the long \n     term.\n       (14) The ability of populations to defend themselves \n     against attack in areas outside the Government of Sudan's \n     control has been severely compromised by the disengagement of \n     the front-line sponsor states, fostering the belief within \n     officials of the Government of Sudan that success on the \n     battlefield can be achieved.\n       (15) The United States should use all means of pressure \n     available to facilitate a comprehensive solution to the war, \n     including--\n       (A) the maintenance and multilateralization of sanctions \n     against the Government of Sudan with explicit linkage of \n     those sanctions to peace;\n       (B) the support or creation of viable democratic civil \n     authority and institutions in areas of Sudan outside \n     government control;\n       (C) continued active support of people-to-people \n     reconciliation mechanisms and efforts in areas outside of \n     government control;\n       (D) the strengthening of the mechanisms to provide \n     humanitarian relief to those areas;\n       (E) cooperation among the trading partners of the United \n     States and within multilateral institutions toward those \n     ends; and\n       (F) the use of any and all possible unilateral and \n     multilateral economic and diplomatic tools to compel Ethiopia \n     and Eritrea to end their hostilities and again assume a \n     constructive stance toward facilitating a comprehensive \n     solution to the ongoing war in Sudan.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Government of sudan.--The term ``Government of Sudan'' \n     means the National Islamic Front government in Khartoum, \n     Sudan.\n       (2) IGAD.--The term ``IGAD'' means the Inter-Governmental \n     Authority on Development.\n       (3) OLS.--The term ``OLS'' means the United Nations relief \n     operation carried out by UNICEF, the World Food Program, and \n     participating relief organizations known as ``Operation \n     Lifeline Sudan''.\n\n     SEC. 4. CONDEMNATION OF SLAVERY, OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, \n                   AND NEW TACTICS BY THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN.\n\n       Congress hereby--\n       (1) condemns--\n       (A) violations of human rights on all sides of the conflict \n     in Sudan;\n       (B) the Government of Sudan's overall human rights record, \n     with regard to both the prosecution of the war and the denial \n     of basic human and political rights to all Sudanese;\n       (C) the ongoing slave trade in Sudan and the role of the \n     Government of Sudan in abetting and tolerating the practice; \n     and\n       (D) the Government of Sudan's increasing use and \n     organization of ``murahalliin'' or ``mujahadeen'', Popular \n     Defense Forces (PDF), and regular Sudanese Army units into \n     organized and coordinated raiding and slaving parties in Bahr \n     al Ghazal, the Nuba Mountains, Upper Nile, and Blue Nile \n     regions; and\n       (2) recognizes that, along with selective bans on air \n     transport relief flights by the Government of Sudan, the use \n     of raiding and slaving parties is a tool for creating food \n     shortages and is used as a systematic means to destroy the \n     societies, culture, and economies of the Dinka, Nuer, and \n     Nuba peoples in a policy of low-intensity ethnic cleansing.\n\n     SEC. 5. SUPPORT FOR THE IGAD PEACE PROCESS.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--Congress hereby--\n       (1) declares its support for the efforts by executive \n     branch officials of the United States and the President's \n     Special Envoy for Sudan to lead in a reinvigoration of the \n     IGAD-sponsored peace process;\n       (2) calls on IGAD member states, the European Union, the \n     Organization of African Unity, Egypt, and other key states to \n     support the peace process; and\n       (3) urges Kenya's leadership in the implementation of the \n     process.\n       (b) Relation to United States Diplomacy.--It is the sense \n     of Congress that any such diplomatic efforts toward \n     resolution of the conflict in Sudan are best made through a \n     peace process based on the Declaration of Principles reached \n     in Nairobi, Kenya, on July 20, 1994, and that the President \n     should not create any process or diplomatic facility or \n     office which could be viewed as a parallel or competing \n     diplomatic track.\n       (c) United States Diplomatic Support.--The Secretary of \n     State is authorized to utilize the personnel of the \n     Department of State for the support of--\n       (1) the secretariat of IGAD;\n       (2) the ongoing negotiations between the Government of \n     Sudan and opposition forces;\n       (3) any peace settlement planning to be carried out by the \n     National Democratic Alliance and IGAD Partners' Forum (IPF); \n     and\n       (4) other United States diplomatic efforts supporting a \n     peace process in Sudan.\n\n     SEC. 6. INCREASED PRESSURE ON COMBATANTS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President, acting \n     through the United States Permanent Representative to the \n     United Nations, should--\n       (1) sponsor a resolution in the United Nations Security \n     Council to investigate the practice of slavery in Sudan and \n     provide recommendations on measures for its eventual \n     elimination;\n       (2) sponsor a condemnation of the human rights practices of \n     the Government of Sudan at the United Nations conference on \n     human rights in Geneva in 2000;\n       (3) press for implementation of the recommendations of the \n     United Nations Special Rapporteur for Sudan with respect to \n     human rights monitors in areas of conflict in Sudan;\n       (4) press for UNICEF, International Committee of the Red \n     Cross, or the International Federation of Red Cross and Red \n     Crescent Societies, or other appropriate international \n     organizations or agencies to maintain a registry of those \n     individuals who have been abducted or are otherwise held in \n     bondage or servitude in Sudan;\n       (5) sponsor a condemnation of the Government of Sudan each \n     time it subjects civilian populations to aerial bombardment; \n     and\n       (6) sponsor a resolution in the United Nations General \n     Assembly condemning the human rights practices of the \n     Government of Sudan.\n\n     SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENT.\n\n       Beginning 3 months after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and every 3 months thereafter, the President shall submit a \n     report to Congress on--\n       (1) the specific sources and current status of Sudan's \n     financing and construction of oil exploitation infrastructure \n     and pipelines;\n       (2) the extent to which that financing was secured in the \n     United States or with involvement of United States citizens;\n       (3) such financing's relation to the sanctions described in \n     subsection (a) and the Executive Order of November 3, 1997;\n       (4) the extent of aerial bombardment by the Government of \n     Sudan forces in areas outside its control, including targets, \n     frequency, and best estimates of damage;\n       (5) the number, duration, and locations of air strips or \n     other humanitarian relief facilities to which access is \n     denied by any party to the conflict; and\n       (6) the status of the IGAD-sponsored peace process and any \n     other ongoing effort to end the conflict, including the \n     specific and verifiable steps taken by parties to the \n     conflict, the members of the IGAD Partners Forum, and the \n     members of IGAD toward a comprehensive solution to the war.\n\n     SEC. 8. REFORM OF OPERATION LIFELINE SUDAN (OLS).\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President should \n     organize and maintain a formal consultative process with the  \n     European Union, its member states, the members of the \n     United Nations Security Council, and other relevant \n     parties on coordinating an effort within the United \n     Nations to revise the terms of OLS to end the veto power \n     of the Government of Sudan over the plans by OLS for air \n     transport relief flights.\n\n     SEC. 9.

CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR ANY BAN ON AIR TRANSPORT RELIEF \n                   FLIGHTS.\n\n       (a) Plan.--The President shall develop a detailed and \n     implementable contingency plan to provide, outside United \n     Nations auspices, the greatest possible amount of United \n     States Government and privately donated relief to all \n     affected areas in Sudan, including the Nuba Mountains, Upper \n     Nile, and Blue Nile, in the event the Government of Sudan \n     imposes a total, partial, or incremental ban on OLS air \n     transport relief flights.\n       (b) Element of Plan.--The plan developed under subsection \n     (a) shall include coordination of other donors in addition to \n     the United States Government and private institutions.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 2 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall submit a \n     classified report to Congress on the costs and startup time \n     such a plan would require in the event of a total ban on air \n     transport relief flights or in the event of a partial or \n     incremental ban on such flights if the President has made the \n     determination required by subsection (a)(2).\n       (d) Reprogramming Authority.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, in carrying out the plan developed under \n     subsection (a), the President may reprogram up to 100 percent \n     of the funds available for support of OLS operations (but for \n     this subsection) for the purposes of the plan.\n\n     SEC. 11. NEW AUTHORITY FOR USAID'S SUDAN TRANSITION \n                   ASSISTANCE FOR REHABILITATION (STAR) PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--Congress hereby expresses its \n     support for the President's ongoing efforts to diversify and \n     increase effectiveness of United States assistance to \n     populations in areas of Sudan outside of the control of the \n     Government of Sudan, especially the long-term focus shown in \n     the Sudan Transition Assistance for Rehabilitation (STAR) \n     program with its emphasis on promoting future democratic \n     governance, rule of law, building indigenous institutional \n     capacity, promoting and enhancing self-reliance, and actively \n     supporting people-to-people reconciliation efforts.\n       (b) Allocation of Funds.--Of the amounts made available to \n     carry out chapter 1 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act \n     of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq:, relating to development \n     assistance) for the period beginning on October 1, 2000, and \n     ending on September 30, 2003, $16,000,000 shall be available \n     for development of a viable civil authority, and civil and \n     commercial institutions, in Sudan, including the provision of \n     technical assistance, and for people-to-people reconciliation \n     efforts.\n       (c) Additional Authorities.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the President is granted authority to \n     undertake any appropriate programs using Federal agencies, \n     contractual arrangements, or direct support of indigenous \n     groups, agencies, or organizations in areas outside of \n     control of the Government of Sudan in an effort to provide \n     emergency relief, promote economic self-sufficiency, build \n     civil authority, provide education, enhance rule of law and \n     the development of judicial and legal frameworks, support \n     people-to-people reconciliation efforts, or implementation of \n     any programs in support of any viable peace agreement at the \n     local, regional, or national level.\n       (d) Implementation.--It is the sense of Congress that the \n     President should immediately and to the fullest extent \n     possible utilize the Office of Transition Initiatives at the \n     Agency for International Development in an effort to pursue \n     the type of programs described in subsection (c).\n       (e) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     enhancing and supporting education and the development of \n     rule of law are critical elements in the long-term success of \n     United States efforts to promote a viable economic, \n     political, social, and legal basis for development in Sudan. \n     Congress recognizes that the gap of 13-16 years without \n     secondary educational opportunities in southern Sudan is an \n     especially important problem to address with respect to \n     rebuilding and sustaining leaders and educators for the next \n     generation of Sudanese. Congress recognizes the unusually \n     important role the secondary school in Rumbek has played in \n     producing the current generation of leaders in southern \n     Sudan, and that priority should be given in current and \n     future development or transition programs undertaken by the \n     United States Government to rebuilding and supporting the \n     Rumbek Secondary School.\n       (f) Programs in Areas Outside Government Control.--Congress \n     also intends that such programs include cooperation and work \n     with indigenous groups in areas outside of government control \n     in all of Sudan, to include northern, southern, and eastern \n     regions of Sudan.\n\n     SEC. 12. ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING FOR NUBA MOUNTAINS AND OTHER \n                   AREAS SUBJECT TO BANS ON AIR TRANSPORT RELIEF \n                   FLIGHTS.\n\n       (a) Finding.--Congress recognizes that civilians in the \n     Nuba Mountains, Red Sea Hills, and Blue Nile regions of Sudan \n     are not receiving assistance through OLS due to restrictions \n     by the Government of Sudan.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should--\n       (1) conduct comprehensive assessment of the humanitarian \n     needs in the Nuba Mountains, Red Sea Hills, and Blue Nile \n     regions of Sudan;\n       (2) respond appropriately to those needs based on such \n     assessment; and\n       (3) report to Congress on an annual basis on efforts made \n     under paragraph (2).\n\n     SEC. 13.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sudan Peace Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) With clear indications that the Government of Sudan \n     intends to intensify its prosecution of the war against areas \n     outside of its control, which has already cost nearly \n     2,000,000 lives and has displaced more than 4,000,000, a \n     sustained and coordinated international effort to pressure \n     combatants to end hostilities and to address the roots of the \n     conflict offers the best opportunity for a comprehensive \n     solution to the continuing war in Sudan.\n       (2) A viable, comprehensive, and internationally sponsored \n     peace process, protected from manipulation, presents the best \n     chance for a permanent resolution of the war, protection of \n     human rights, and a self-sustaining Sudan.\n       (3) Continued strengthening of humanitarian relief \n     operations in Sudan is an essential element in the effort to \n     bring an end to the war.\n       (4) Continued leadership by the United States is critical.\n       (5) Regardless of the future political status of the areas \n     of Sudan outside of the control of the Government of Sudan, \n     the absence of credible civil authority and institutions is a \n     major impediment to achieving self-sustenance by the Sudanese \n     people and to meaningful progress toward a viable peace \n     process.\n       (6) Through manipulation of traditional rivalries among \n     peoples in areas outside their full control, the Government \n     of Sudan has effectively used divide and conquer techniques \n     to subjugate their population, and Congress finds that \n     internationally sponsored reconciliation efforts have played \n     a critical role in reducing the tactic's effectiveness and \n     human suffering.\n       (7) The Government of Sudan is increasingly utilizing and \n     organizing militias, Popular Defense Forces, and other \n     irregular troops for raiding and slaving parties in areas \n     outside of the control of the Government of Sudan in an \n     effort to severely disrupt the ability of those populations \n     to sustain themselves. The tactic is in addition to the overt \n     use of bans on air transport relief flights in prosecuting \n     the war through selective starvation and to minimize the \n     Government of Sudan's accountability internationally.\n       (8) The Government of Sudan has repeatedly stated that it \n     intends to use the expected proceeds from future oil sales to \n     increase the tempo and lethality of the war against the areas \n     outside its control.\n       (9) Through its power to veto plans for air transport \n     flights under the United Nations relief operation, Operation \n     Lifeline Sudan (OLS), the Government of Sudan has been able \n     to manipulate the receipt of food aid by the Sudanese people \n     from the United States and other donor countries as a \n     devastating weapon of war in the ongoing effort by the \n     Government of Sudan to subdue areas of Sudan outside of the \n     Government's control.\n       (10) The efforts of the United States and other donors in \n     delivering relief and assistance through means outside OLS \n     have played a critical role in addressing the deficiencies in \n     OLS and offset the Government of Sudan's manipulation of food \n     donations to advantage in the civil war in Sudan.\n       (11) While the immediate needs of selected areas in Sudan \n     facing starvation have been addressed in the near term, the \n     population in areas of Sudan outside of the control of the \n     Government of Sudan are still in danger of extreme disruption \n     of their ability to sustain themselves.\n       (12) The Nuba Mountains and many areas in Bahr al Ghazal, \n     Upper Nile, and Blue Nile regions have been excluded \n     completely from relief distribution by OLS, consequently \n     placing their populations at increased risk of famine.\n\n[[Page S14913]]\n\n       (13) At a cost which can exceed $1,000,000 per day, and \n     with a primary focus on providing only for the immediate food \n     needs of the recipients, the current international relief \n     operations are neither sustainable nor desirable in the long \n     term.\n       (14) The ability of populations to defend themselves \n     against attack in areas outside the Government of Sudan's \n     control has been severely compromised by the disengagement of \n     the front-line sponsor states, fostering the belief within \n     officials of the Government of Sudan that success on the \n     battlefield can be achieved.\n       (15) The United States should use all means of pressure \n     available to facilitate a comprehensive solution to the war, \n     including--\n       (A) the maintenance and multilateralization of sanctions \n     against the Government of Sudan with explicit linkage of \n     those sanctions to peace;\n       (B) the support or creation of viable democratic civil \n     authority and institutions in areas of Sudan outside \n     government control;\n       (C) continued active support of people-to-people \n     reconciliation mechanisms and efforts in areas outside of \n     government control;\n       (D) the strengthening of the mechanisms to provide \n     humanitarian relief to those areas;\n       (E) cooperation among the trading partners of the United \n     States and within multilateral institutions toward those \n     ends; and\n       (F) the use of any and all possible unilateral and \n     multilateral economic and diplomatic tools to compel Ethiopia \n     and Eritrea to end their hostilities and again assume a \n     constructive stance toward facilitating a comprehensive \n     solution to the ongoing war in Sudan.\n\n     SEC. 3.

CONDEMNATION OF SLAVERY, OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, \n                   AND NEW TACTICS BY THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN.\n\n       Congress hereby--\n       (1) condemns--\n       (A) violations of human rights on all sides of the conflict \n     in Sudan;\n       (B) the Government of Sudan's overall human rights record, \n     with regard to both the prosecution of the war and the denial \n     of basic human and political rights to all Sudanese;\n       (C) the ongoing slave trade in Sudan and the role of the \n     Government of Sudan in abetting and tolerating the practice; \n     and\n       (D) the Government of Sudan's increasing use and \n     organization of ``murahalliin'' or ``mujahadeen'', Popular \n     Defense Forces (PDF), and regular Sudanese Army units into \n     organized and coordinated raiding and slaving parties in Bahr \n     al Ghazal, the Nuba Mountains, Upper Nile, and Blue Nile \n     regions; and\n       (2) recognizes that, along with selective bans on air \n     transport relief flights by the Government of Sudan, the use \n     of raiding and slaving parties is a tool for creating food \n     shortages and is used as a systematic means to destroy the \n     societies, culture, and economies of the Dinka, Nuer, and \n     Nuba peoples in a policy of low-intensity ethnic cleansing.\n\n     SEC. 5. SUPPORT FOR THE IGAD PEACE PROCESS.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--Congress hereby--\n       (1) declares its support for the efforts by executive \n     branch officials of the United States and the President's \n     Special Envoy for Sudan to lead in a reinvigoration of the \n     IGAD-sponsored peace process;\n       (2) calls on IGAD member states, the European Union, the \n     Organization of African Unity, Egypt, and other key states to \n     support the peace process; and\n       (3) urges Kenya's leadership in the implementation of the \n     process.\n       (b) Relation to United States Diplomacy.--It is the sense \n     of Congress that any such diplomatic efforts toward \n     resolution of the conflict in Sudan are best made through a \n     peace process based on the Declaration of Principles reached \n     in Nairobi, Kenya, on July 20, 1994, and that the President \n     should not create any process or diplomatic facility or \n     office which could be viewed as a parallel or competing \n     diplomatic track.\n       (c) United States Diplomatic Support.--The Secretary of \n     State is authorized to utilize the personnel of the \n     Department of State for the support of--\n       (1) the secretariat of IGAD;\n       (2) the ongoing negotiations between the Government of \n     Sudan and opposition forces;\n       (3) any peace settlement planning to be carried out by the \n     National Democratic Alliance and IGAD Partners' Forum (IPF); \n     and\n       (4) other United States diplomatic efforts supporting a \n     peace process in Sudan.\n\n     SEC. 6. INCREASED PRESSURE ON COMBATANTS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President, acting \n     through the United States Permanent Representative to the \n     United Nations, should--\n       (1) sponsor a resolution in the United Nations Security \n     Council to investigate the practice of slavery in Sudan and \n     provide recommendations on measures for its eventual \n     elimination;\n       (2) sponsor a condemnation of the human rights practices of \n     the Government of Sudan at the United Nations conference on \n     human rights in Geneva in 2000;\n       (3) press for implementation of the recommendations of the \n     United Nations Special Rapporteur for Sudan with respect to \n     human rights monitors in areas of conflict in Sudan;\n       (4) press for UNICEF, International Committee of the Red \n     Cross, or the International Federation of Red Cross and Red \n     Crescent Societies, or other appropriate international \n     organizations or agencies to maintain a registry of those \n     individuals who have been abducted or are otherwise held in \n     bondage or servitude in Sudan;\n       (5) sponsor a condemnation of the Government of Sudan each \n     time it subjects civilian populations to aerial bombardment; \n     and\n       (6) sponsor a resolution in the United Nations General \n     Assembly condemning the human rights practices of the \n     Government of Sudan.\n\n     SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENT.\n\n       Beginning 3 months after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and every 3 months thereafter, the President shall submit a \n     report to Congress on--\n       (1) the specific sources and current status of Sudan's \n     financing and construction of oil exploitation infrastructure \n     and pipelines;\n       (2) the extent to which that financing was secured in the \n     United States or with involvement of United States citizens;\n       (3) such financing's relation to the sanctions described in \n     subsection (a) and the Executive Order of November 3, 1997;\n       (4) the extent of aerial bombardment by the Government of \n     Sudan forces in areas outside its control, including targets, \n     frequency, and best estimates of damage;\n       (5) the number, duration, and locations of air strips or \n     other humanitarian relief facilities to which access is \n     denied by any party to the conflict; and\n       (6) the status of the IGAD-sponsored peace process and any \n     other ongoing effort to end the conflict, including the \n     specific and verifiable steps taken by parties to the \n     conflict, the members of the IGAD Partners Forum, and the \n     members of IGAD toward a comprehensive solution to the war.\n\n     SEC. 8. REFORM OF OPERATION LIFELINE SUDAN (OLS).\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President should \n     organize and maintain a formal consultative process with the \n     European Union, its member states, the members of the United \n     Nations Security Council, and other relevant parties on \n     coordinating an effort within the United Nations to revise \n     the terms of OLS to end the veto power of the Government of \n     Sudan over the plans by OLS for air transport relief flights.\n\n     SEC. 9. CONTINUED USE OF NON-OLS ORGANIZATIONS FOR RELIEF \n                   EFFORTS.\n\n       (a) Finding.--Congress recognizes the progress made by \n     officials of the executive branch of Government toward \n     greater utilization of non-OLS agencies for more effective \n     distribution of United States relief contributions.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should continue to increase the use of non-OLS \n     agencies in the distribution of relief supplies in southern \n     Sudan.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall submit a detailed \n     report to Congress describing the progress made toward \n     carrying out subsection (b).\n\n     SEC. 10. CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR ANY BAN ON AIR TRANSPORT RELIEF \n                   FLIGHTS.\n\n       (a) Plan.--The President shall develop a detailed and \n     implementable contingency plan to provide, outside United \n     Nations auspices, the greatest possible amount of United \n     States Government and privately donated relief to all \n     affected areas in Sudan, including the Nuba Mountains, Upper \n     Nile, and Blue Nile, in the event the Government of Sudan \n     imposes a total, partial, or incremental ban on OLS air \n     transport relief flights.\n       (b) Element of Plan.--The plan developed under subsection \n     (a) shall include coordination of other donors in addition to \n     the United States Government and private institutions.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 2 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall submit a \n     classified report to Congress on the costs and startup time \n     such a plan would require in the event of a total ban on air \n     transport relief flights or in the event of a partial or \n     incremental ban on such flights if the President has made the \n     determination required by subsection (a)(2).\n       (d) Reprogramming Authority.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, in carrying out the plan developed under \n     subsection (a), the President may reprogram up to 100 percent \n     of the funds available for support of OLS operations (but for \n     this subsection) for the purposes of the plan.\n\n     SEC. 11. NEW AUTHORITY FOR USAID'S SUDAN TRANSITION \n                   ASSISTANCE FOR REHABILITATION (STAR) PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--Congress hereby expresses its \n     support for the President's ongoing efforts to diversify and \n     increase effectiveness of United States assistance to \n     populations in areas of Sudan outside of the control of the \n     Government of Sudan, especially the long-term focus shown in \n     the Sudan Transition Assistance for Rehabilitation (STAR) \n     program with its emphasis on promoting future democratic \n     governance, rule of law, building indigenous institutional \n     capacity, promoting and enhancing self-reliance, and actively \n     supporting people-to-people reconciliation efforts.\n\n[[Page S14914]]\n\n       (b) Allocation of Funds.--Of the amounts made available to \n     carry out chapter 1 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act \n     of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq:, relating to development \n     assistance) for the period beginning on October 1, 2000, and \n     ending on September 30, 2003, $16,000,000 shall be available \n     for development of a viable civil authority, and civil and \n     commercial institutions, in Sudan, including the provision of \n     technical assistance, and for people-to-people reconciliation \n     efforts.\n       (c) Additional Authorities.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the President is granted authority to \n     undertake any appropriate programs using Federal agencies, \n     contractual arrangements, or direct support of indigenous \n     groups, agencies, or organizations in areas outside of \n     control of the Government of Sudan in an effort to provide \n     emergency relief, promote economic self-sufficiency, build \n     civil authority, provide education, enhance rule of law and \n     the development of judicial and legal frameworks, support \n     people-to-people reconciliation efforts, or implementation of \n     any programs in support of any viable peace agreement at the \n     local, regional, or national level.\n       (d) Implementation.--It is the sense of Congress that the \n     President should immediately and to the fullest extent \n     possible utilize the Office of Transition Initiatives at the \n     Agency for International Development in an effort to pursue \n     the type of programs described in subsection (c).\n       (e) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     enhancing and supporting education and the development of \n     rule of law are critical elements in the long-term success of \n     United States efforts to promote a viable economic, \n     political, social, and legal basis for development in Sudan. \n     Congress recognizes that the gap of 13-16 years without \n     secondary educational opportunities in southern Sudan is an \n     especially important problem to address with respect to \n     rebuilding and sustaining leaders and educators for the next \n     generation of Sudanese. Congress recognizes the unusually \n     important role the secondary school in Rumbek has played in \n     producing the current generation of leaders in southern \n     Sudan, and that priority should be given in current and \n     future development or transition programs undertaken by the \n     United States Government to rebuilding and supporting the \n     Rumbek Secondary School.\n       (f) Programs in Areas Outside Government Control.--Congress \n     also intends that such programs include cooperation and work \n     with indigenous groups in areas outside of government control \n     in all of Sudan, to include northern, southern, and eastern \n     regions of Sudan.\n\n     SEC. 12.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Satellite \nHome Viewer Act, which is part of the Intellectual Property and \nCommunications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999. There are approximately half \na million direct broadcast satellite households in New York State that \nhave been disadvantaged by the restrictions currently facing satellite \nservice providers. There are countless others who would like the \nprivilege of having satellite service as a multi-channel video program \nprovider.\n  Earlier this year, direct broadcast satellite customers in many areas \nof New York State had their local network service shut-off as a result \nof a court order. This meant that satellite service customers were \nunable to receive their local news, weather, and major broadcast \nstations from their local broadcast companies. We now have a bill that \nwill allow direct broadcast satellite companies the ability to provide \ntheir local customers with local programming. For small, rural \ncommunities, it is imperative that residents be allowed to receive \nnotice of local events, like school closings, weather reports, cultural \nhappenings, and local business developments. In addition, New York is \none of the two states that will benefit from retroactive local \nprogramming via satellites.\n  For residents of New York rural counties like Allegheny, Chenango, \nClinton, Niagara, Ulster, and many others, that rely on distant \nbroadcast network programming because they are typically unable to \nreceive over-the-air broadcast signals, this bill allows them to \ncontinue to receive faraway television networks.\n  While I am pleased that we were able to pass the Satellite Home \nViewer Act before it expired on December 31, 1999, I hope we will \ncontinue to further its progress. The federal loan provision that was \nincluded during conference, and regrettably taken out of the Senate \nconference report, must be revisited. It is my understanding that the \nSenate Banking committee plans on holding hearings next year to ensure \nthat multi-channel service providers are encouraged to extend satellite \nservice to rural and underserved communities. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on that committee to make sure my constituents in \nWestern and Northern New York have the same viewing options as those in \ndownstate New York.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (42 U.S.C. 2210 \n     note) recognized the responsibility of the Federal Government \n     to compensate individuals who were harmed by the mining of \n     radioactive materials or fallout from nuclear arms testing;\n       (2) a congressional oversight hearing conducted by the \n     Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate \n     demonstrated that since enactment of the Radiation Exposure \n     Compensation Act (42 U.S.C. 2210 note), regulatory burdens \n     have made it too difficult for some deserving individuals to \n     be fairly and efficiently compensated;\n       (3) reports of the Atomic Energy Commission and the \n     National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health testify \n     to the need to extend eligibility to States in which the \n     Federal Government sponsored uranium mining and milling from \n     1941 through 1971;\n       (4) scientific data resulting from the enactment of the \n     Radiation Exposed Veterans Compensation Act of 1988 (38 \n     U.S.C. 101 note), and obtained from the Committee on the \n     Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiations, and the \n     President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments \n     provide medical validation for the extension of compensable \n     radiogenic pathologies;\n       (5) above-ground uranium miners, millers and individuals \n     who transported ore should be fairly compensated, in a manner \n     similar to that provided for underground uranium miners, in \n     cases in which those individuals suffered disease or \n     resultant death, associated with radiation exposure, due to \n     the failure of the Federal Government to warn and otherwise \n     help protect citizens from the health hazards addressed by \n     the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. \n     2210 note); and\n       (6) it should be the responsibility of the Federal \n     Government in partnership with State and local governments \n     and appropriate healthcare organizations, to initiate and \n     support programs designed for the early detection, prevention \n     and education on radiogenic diseases in approved States to \n     aid the thousands of individuals adversely affected by the \n     mining of uranium and the testing of nuclear weapons for the \n     Nation's weapons arsenal.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 3373, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3373) to require the Secretary of the Treasury \n     to mint coins in conjunction with the minting of coins by the \n     Republic of Iceland in commemoration of the millenium of the \n     discovery of the new world by Leif Ericson.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. \n3373, the Leif Ericson Millennium Commemorative Coin Act. This bill \nauthorizes three separate commemorative coin programs which will \ncommemorate the following historic events: the millennial anniversary \nof Leif Ericson's discovery of the New World, the bicentennial of the \nLewis and Clark expedition, and the bicentennial of the first meeting \nof the United States Congress in the Capitol building after moving to \nWashington, D.C.\n  Companion bills for each of the three coin programs included in H.R. \n3373 have also been introduced separately in the Senate. All three of \nthe free-standing bills, S.1710, S. 1187, and S. 1468, have satisfied \nthe rules of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs on commemorative coin legislation, including having obtained a \nminimum of sixty-seven Senate cosponsors. The effort to combine the \nthree bills and pass them as one coin package has been worked out by \nthe House and Senate Banking Committees, and this bill was subsequently \nintroduced and passed by the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, this legislation has the support of the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs as it fully meets the standards set \nforth by the committee and furthermore, each bill adheres to the \ncommemorative coin reforms enacted in the 104th Congress. Those reforms \nwere necessary to keeping the time-honored pasttime of coin collecting \nfrom becoming overrun with far too many coin programs commemorating \nevents or figures of lesser national recognition. I look forward to \nswift enactment of this legislation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support H.R. 3373, \nproviding for the minting of a Leif Ericson Millennium Commemorative \ndollar coin. This bipartisan legislation would authorize the U.S. Mint \nto issue a coin jointly with the Icelandic National Bank in \ncommemoration of Leif Ericson and his voyage and exploration of North \nAmerica. The part of the measure concerning Leif Ericson is identical \nto S. 1710 that Senator Grams and I introduced which has the support of \n74 Senators. The House bill was introduced by Congressman Jim Leach of \nmy home state of Iowa who has worked hard toward the passage of this \nmeasure. I want to commend him for his good work.\n  The famous Viking explorer is regarded as the first European to set \nfoot on North American soil in the year 1000 AD. In a time of sea \nvoyages and land exploration, perhaps the most recognized Viking in \nhistory is Leif Ericson. Ericson's determination, nobility and spirit \nof exploration are demonstrated in his Voyage of Discovery. Next year \nmarks the 1000th anniversary of Leif Ericson's Voyage of Discovery and \nthis coin will commemorate this landmark event in North American \nhistory.\n  Leif Ericson, son of Eric the Red, was born in Iceland in the mid \n900's AD. There he learned about reading and writing runes, the Celtic \nand Russian tongue and the ways of trade. Ericson was also taught the \nold sagas, plant studies and the use of weapons. As a young boy, \nEricson and his friends would spend time watching ships coming in and \nout of the harbor and dream about someday going on voyage of their own. \nEricson grew to be a large and imposing man, one known for his far \njudgment and honesty. Having his father's adventurous hand, Ericson had \na strong urge to travel and explore.\n  Ericson was able to do some traveling between Iceland and Greenland, \nbut his major Voyage of Discovery did not occur until 1000 AD, when \nexplorer Bjarni Herjolfsson relayed exciting news of a new land that he \nhad seen when he lost his course in the fog. Ericson bought \nHerjolfsson's ship, gathered a crew of 35, and sailed westward. Unlike \ntoday, Ericson's voyages on the sea were without many modern \nconveniences. He did not travel by a motor-powered ship, nor have any \nof today's advanced technological navigational tools. Instead, Ericson \nand his small crew used the wind and tides as their primary source of \nmotive power, relying on the weather as the engine for his vessel. His \nViking ship did not do too well against hard winds with their single \nsails, but fortunately, fair weather allowed Ericson to navigate 600 \nmiles west up the western coast. Soon he was following the outlines of \nthe new lands he had heard of.\n  The first island Ericson landed on was among glaciers and seemed to \nbe one huge slab of rock. Because of this he named it Helluland (Slab \nLand or Flat Rock Land), which is now believed to be Baffin Island. \nEricson then sailed south and found another land that was flat with \nwhite beaches and some trees. He named this land Markland (Woodland) \nwhich today is believed to be Labrador on the eastern coast of Canada.\n  Finally, Ericson sailed southeast for two days and came to an island \nwith a mainland. On this land the Viking explorer and his crew came \nupon an abundance of grapes as well as vegetation. they had never seen \nbefore. They also were astounded by the size of fish and other animal \nlife they saw while exploring this land. Ericson and his crew settled \nin for the winter, but the winter here was very peculiar. No frost came \nto the grasses. They also noticed that the days and nights were of more \nequal length here. When spring came and the men were ready to go, \nEricson gave this land the name Vinland, which either means Wineland or \nPastureland. Vinland is believed to be today's L'Anse aux Meadows in \nNewfoundland and archaeological findings of this winter camp seem to \nconfirm this belief.\n\n  Ericson's Voyage of Discovery is a significant event in North \nAmerican history and symbolizes a long relationship between the U.S. \nand Iceland. The Government of Iceland is an important North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization (NATO) ally and this action would reiterate our \nstrong relationship with and support for their nation. Iceland votes \nwith the United States on virtually all United Nations and NATO issues \nand has formulated foreign policies parallel to ours. They also are \ncutting costs at our military base in Keflavi. Iceland has refrained \nfrom whaling, encouraged more U.S. trade and investment and initiated a \npartnership with the state\n\n[[Page S14923]]\n\nof Alaska. The Government of Iceland has already approved a silver 1000 \nKroner Icelandic coin to be produced by the U.S. Mint that will be \npackaged and issued simultaneously with the U.S. Leif Ericson \nCommemorative Coin. We believe jointly issuing these coins will help \nfurther relations between our nations.\n  The United States Congress strengthened U.S.-Icelandic relations in \n1930 by presenting a statue of Leif Ericson as a gift to Iceland \nmemorializing Ericson's Voyage of Discovery. In 1964, President Lyndon \nB. Johnson made October 9 ``Leif Ericson Day'' in commemoration of the \nfamous Viking explorer. The Leif Ericson Commemorative Coin in the year \n2000 would commemorate the millennial anniversary of Ericson's voyage \nand would display our commitment to continuing this relationship for \nthe coming millennium.\n  H.R. 3373 allows a simultaneous issuance of a commemorative U.S. \nsilver dollar coin and a silver 1000 Kroner Icelandic coin. Both coins \nare to be produced in limited mintages, with U.S. Mint issuing a boxed \nset. Mint and surcharge proceeds from the coins will fund scholarships \nand student exchange programs between Iceland and United States. The \nU.S. Mint has read and approved the identical House version as meeting \nall the guidelines contained in the 1995 Congressional House Banking \nCommittee Commemorative Coin Reforms Act, which protects the taxpayer \nfrom any costs. We feel such a coin is an important step in recognizing \nthe important role Iceland has played in North American history. H.R. \n3373 also provides for a Lewis and Clark Expedition Commemorative Coin \nwhich I strongly support and a Capitol Visitor Center Commemorative \nCoin.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I rise in support of S. Res. 217, \nwhich calls upon the Government of the People's Republic of China to \nrelease all prisoners of conscience, to end its persecution of people \nof faith, and to abide by internationally accepted human rights \nstandards. This resolution is cosponsored by Senators Lott, Nickles, \nMack, Coverdell, Collins, Feingold, Durbin, Leahy, Snowe, Gorton, and \nWellstone.\n  Mr. President, the crackdown in China is escalating. The most \nimmediate target is Falun Gong--a movement which combines traditional \nbreathing exercises with elements of Buddhism, Taoism and the beliefs \nof its founder. Since April, when more than 10,000 practitioners of \nFalun Gong shocked the Chinese government by gathering in front of the \nleadership compound in Beijing, the Chinese government has tried to \nsystematically eradicate the practice.\n  The Beijing regime rounded up thousands of practitioners, arrested \nits leaders, ransacked homes, confiscated and burned Falun Gong \nmaterials, and forced adherents to renounce their beliefs. The \ngovernment then banned the practice of Falun Gong in July and \nofficially labeled it a cult as part of a nationwide propaganda \ncampaign to discredit practitioners. But this was not enough. On \nOctober 30, 1999, in a perverse maneuver, the National People's \nCongress raised the stakes of persecution by adopting a new law banning \nand criminalizing groups deemed by the Chinese government to be cults--\nperverse because this is the Chinese government's way of legitimizing \ntheir abuses of human rights--perverse because the law is being applied \nretroactively.\n  Protestors of this law faced police who beat, kicked, and yanked the \nhair of several elderly women protestors. Practitioners, mostly middle-\naged or senior citizens, sitting or standing in silent meditation were \ndragged away from Tiananmen square. But they remained peaceful.\n  The Chinese government has wasted no time in arresting Falun Gong \nleaders and charging them under this law. As of November 9, 1999, \naccording to Chinese officials, 111 people had been formally arrested \non charges ranging from disrupting state security to stealing state \nsecrets. Many more have been detained and sent to re-education programs \nor labor camps. Now, at least four leaders have been convicted, with \nsentences ranging from two to twelve years. Many more will be \nconvicted.\n  The truth of the matter is that the Chinese government is insecure \nand cannot tolerate any group that is outside of its control. That is \nwhy it is engaged in this crackdown. That is why it sentenced four pro-\ndemocracy activists to jail terms ranging from four to 11 years. That \nis why it continues to persecute people of faith.\n  In August, police detained a 65-year-old bishop of China's \nunderground Roman Catholic Church in Hebei province and convicted seven \nlay members of the underground Catholic church in Jiangxi province.\n  In October, in Guangzhou, some 200 police officers demolished a \nshelter used by House Church Christians. They detained, brutalized, and \nwarned five House Church Christians against preaching or practicing \ntheir faith. I am extremely concerned about the well being of \nChristians who are suffering in detention for their faith, including \nPastor Li Dexian, one of the Guangzhou House Church members, Zhang \nRonglian from Henan, and Zheng Xinqi from Anhui.\n  These incidents re simply anecdotal. They reflect a greater pattern \nof ongoing religious persecution.\n  Mr. President, at the same time that the Chinese government is \ncracking down on its own citizens, at the same time it is authorizing \nharsher punishments for believing outside of government control, the \nBeijing regime is flouting international norms, and even tossing aside \nits own constitution, which supposedly provides for the freedom of \nreligious belief and the freedom not to believe.\n  The freedoms of thought, conscience, religion, expression, and \nassembly are not ``western values'' or ``American values'' that we are \ntrying to impose on China. These values have been embraced by the \ninternational community. And it is up to the international community to \nuphold them when they are being trampled--to speak out in the face of \ninjustice.\n  This resolution is part of our responsibility. With this resolution, \nwe urge the Chinese government to step back into the realm of \ninternational standards, to end its crackdown, and to release its \nprisoners of conscience. We urge the Chinese government to end its \n``campaign for stability,'' which has only caused far greater \ninstability.\n  Mr. President, I expect that this resolution will be adopted. I also \nexpect that the Clinton Administration will not offer silence as a \nhidden concession for the WTO agreement signed with China but will \ninstead use this statement by the Senate to strengthen its hand in \nadvocating an end to persecution in China.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 371, H.J. Res. \n65.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Clerk will report the joint resolution by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 65) commending the World War \n     II veterans who fought in the Battle of the Bulge, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. \n65, which commends the World War II veterans who fought bravely in the \nBattle of the Bulge. This resolution was passed unanimously by the \nHouse on October 5, 1999 and mirrors S.J. Res. 32, which I introduced \nearlier this year.\n  Mr. President, in mid-1994, the Allies were hopeful. The Russian Red \nArmy was closing in on the German army on the Eastern front and German \ncities were being devastated by American bombing. The Allies had taken \nParis, Casablanca, Tripoli, Naples, and Rome, and they were looking \ntoward an end to the war in Europe. Hitler was on the run.\n  In desperation, Hitler planned a surprise counterattack on the Allies \non an 80 mile front running from southern Belgium to the middle of \nLuxembourg. Hitler hoped to break through this thinly held line in the \nArdennes forest region, cripple Allied fuel supply lines, and inflame \ntensions within the alliance.\n  On the harsh winter morning of December 16, 1944, five months after \nthe Allied landings at Normandy, France, eight German armored divisions \nand thirteen Germany infantry divisions launched a brutal onslaught \nagainst five divisions of the United States first Army. A screaming \nhail of artillery fire sent many men to their deaths. Roger Rutland, \nFirst Sergeant in the 106th Infantry, described the devastation. ``We \nlost many men that first day. An infantry company was approximately 200 \nmen. A Company was 21 men after the first day. C Company could account \nfor 59 men, and in my company, I lost only 28 men the first day. Every \ncompany commander was missing the first day except my company's \ncommander . . . some of my better men in garrison were some of the \nfirst to crack under combat conditions. They were like hugging each \nother and just shivering . . . They never had seen such a thing \nbefore.'' The American forces were pushed back. Many ran out of \nammunition. After three days of fighting, more than 4,000 of the 106th \nwere forced to surrender. But the American forces regrouped and pressed \non.\n  For forty-one days, American forces fought against two enemies, \nGerman forces and the worst European winter in memory. Freezing \nconditions made it difficult to see more than ten or twenty yards \nahead, much less fight out of frozen foxholes. Halfway through the \nbattle, American troops were still waiting for the main shipment of \nwinter boots. Men became cut off from their division. They lost the \nfeeling in their feet as their toes froze. Some had to have their feet \namputated at the ankles. Fifteen thousand soldiers were taken off the \nline because they suffered from frostbite. Some wounded soldiers froze \nto death. But the American forces did not give in. They pushed on. They \nwere met with brutality.\n  On December 17th, 140 Americans were taken prisoner at Baugnez. While \non the road headed for Malmedy, 86 of these unarmed American soldiers \nwere shot by their German captors in cold blood in what is now known as \nthe Malmedy Massacre.\n  In spite of this horror, American soldiers fought on and took the key \nBelgian town of Bastogne. One of the heroes at Bastogne was James \nHendrix, a Private in the 53rd Armored Infantry Battalion. 4th Armored \nDivision and a native of Lepanto, Arkansas. On the night of December \n26th, Private Hendrix was part of the leading element in the final \nthrust to break through to Bastogne. He and his fellow soldiers were \nmet with fierce artillery and small arms fire. But he did not back \ndown. Instead, he advanced against two 88mm guns and overpowered them. \nHe saved two of his fellow soldiers who were wounded, helpless, and at \nthe mercy of intense machine gun fire. He fought on and in another \nselfless act, Private Hendrix ran through sniper fire and exploding \nmines to pull a soldier out of a burning half-track. Because of his \ncourage and valor, because of men who fought like him, because of the \nheroic efforts of the 101st Airborne. American forces fought \nsuccessfully at Bastogne. Private Hendrix was later awarded a Medal of \nHonor for his selfless heroism.\n  When the skies cleared at the end of December, Allied air forces were \nable to assist the ground forces. By early January 1945, Allied forces \nbegan pushing Hitler's troops back. At the end of January, American \ntroops made their way back to the lines they had held when the battle \nbegan. Three months later, Allied forces put an end to Nazi Germany.\n  Six hundred thousand American troops, 55,000 British soldiers, and \nother Allied participated in the Battle of the Bulge. With catastrophic \ncasualties, the Army constantly had to find\n\n[[Page S14926]]\n\nnew men to take the place of fallen soldiers. Training was cut. \nPhysical standards were lowered. Many of these soldiers were only 18 or \n19 years old. At the end of these forty-one days, over 80,000 American \nsoldiers were maimed, captured, or killed. Nineteen thousand gave their \nlives to stave off the forces of tyranny.\n  They made sure that we could live in freedom today. I believe that \nRonald Reagan put it well when he said. ``If we look to the answer as \nto why for so many years we achieved so much, prospered as no other \npeople of Earth, it was because here in this land we unleashed the \nenergy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever \nbeen done before. Freedom and the dignity of the individual have been \nmore available and assured here than in any other place on Earth. The \nprice for this freedom at times has been high.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nJudiciary Committee be discharged from consideration of S. Res. 225 and \nthe Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 225) to designate November 23, 2000, \n     Thanksgiving Day, as a day to ``Give Thanks, Give Life'' and \n     to discuss organ and tissue donation with other family \n     members.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senators Frist, DeWine, Kennedy, Levin and \nothers in supporting the passage of Senate Resolution 225, which \ndesignates November 23, 2000, Thanksgiving Day, as a day for families \nto discuss organ and tissue donation with other family members and to \nGive Thanks, Give Life. The purpose of this legislation is to encourage \ndiscussions concerning family members' intentions to donate their \norgans so that informed decisions can be made if the occasion to donate \narises.\n  As we prepare to recess for the Thanksgiving holiday, we are all \naware that this is one of the few times throughout the year for \nfamilies to take time out of their busy lives to come together and give \nthanks for the many blessings in their lives. This occasion presents an \nideal opportunity for family members to have frank discussions about \ntheir intentions on the issue of organ and tissue donation. This is a \ndiscussion about life and sharing the gift of life and fits perfectly \nwith the theme of Thanksgiving Day. Although family members may have \nalready designated themselves as organ donors on their driver's license \nor voter registration, that step does not ensure donation will take \nplace since the final decision on whether a potential donor will share \nthe gift of life is usually made by surviving family members regardless \nof their loved one's initial intent.\n  There are approximately 21,000 men, women, and children in the United \nStates who receive the gift of life each year through transplantation \nsurgery made possible by the generosity of organ and tissue donors. \nThis is only a small proportion of the more than 66,000 Americans who \nare on the waiting list, hoping for their chance to prolong their lives \nby finding a matching donor. Tragically, nearly 5,000 of these patients \neach year, or 13 patients each day, die while waiting for a donated \nheart, liver, kidney, or other organ.\n  In order to narrow the gap between the supply and the increasing \ndemand for donated organs, we must step up our effort to encourage \nwilling donors to make their desire to donate clear to the only people \nusually able to make the decision if the occasion should arise--their \nimmediate family members. Although there are up to 15,000 potential \ndonors annually, families' consent to donation is received for less \nthan 6,000 donors. As the demand for transplantation increases due to \nprolonged life expectancy and increased prevalence of diseases that \nlead to organ damage and failure, including hypertension, alcoholism, \nand hepatitis C infection, this shortfall will become even more \npronounced. Additionally, the need for a more diverse donor pool, \nincluding a variety of racial and ethnic minorities, will also continue \nto grow with the predicted population trends.\n  Many Americans will spend part of the Thanksgiving Day with some of \nthose family members who would be most likely approached to make the \nimportant decision of whether or not to donate. Therefore, this would \nbe a good time for families to spend a portion of that day discussing \nhow they might give life to others on a day devoted to giving thanks \nfor their own blessings. Open family discussions on this topic on a day \nof relaxation and family togetherness will increase awareness of the \nintentions of those willing to make the courageous and selfless \ndecision to be organ donors, leading to more lifesaving transplants in \nthe future. Designation of November 23, 2000, Thanksgiving Day, as a \nday for families to Give Thanks, Give Life is an important next step to \npromoting the dialogue between willing donors and their families, so \nthat family members will know their loved ones' wishes long before the \nissue arises.\n  We have received a great outpouring of support for this resolution \nfrom many of the national organ and tissue donation organizations, \nincluding the American Heart Association, American Kidney Fund, \nAmerican Liver Foundation, American Lung Association, American Society \nof Transplant Surgeons, American Thoracic Society, Association of Organ \nProcurement Organizations, Coalition on Donation, Eye Bank Association \nof America, James Redford Institute for Transplant Awareness, National \nKidney Foundation, National Minority Organ and Tissue Transplant \nEducation Program (MOTTEP), Transplant Recipients International \nOrganization (TRIO), United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), and the \nWendy Marks Foundation for Organ Donor Awareness. The tireless efforts \nof these groups and others have been critical in increasing donor \nawareness and education of the public on this extremely important \ncause. Their willingness to become involved with the Give Thanks, Give \nLife resolution and to provide their expertise in the development and \nimplementation of a national campaign targeted at Thanksgiving 2000 \nwill be invaluable in making this a national event with far-reaching \neffects.\n  The adoption of this resolution is a small victory for the organ \ndonation awareness cause, but we must not forget the many casualties \nwho have died awaiting a donated organ. One tragic loss that so many of \nus can relate to is the recent death of Walter Payton, an American \nhero. He contracted a rare liver disease that is often cured if the \npatient can receive a liver transplant. In Payton's case, the risk of \ndeadly complications grew too quickly for him to be saved. He likely \nwould have had to wait for years for his life-saving organ. The \nprevention of deaths like that of this great man and of so many other \nsilent heroes is why our efforts in this life-saving cause must \ncontinue. A\n\n[[Page S14928]]\n\nday must come when no one dies because there is no available liver, \nkidney, heart, lung or other organ to save his or her life.\n  Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues for joining me in \nsupporting this worthwhile resolution designating Thanksgiving day of \n2000 as a day for families to discuss organ and tissue donation with \nother family members, a day to ``Give Thanks, Give Life.''\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Res. 225\n\n       Whereas traditionally, Thanksgiving is a time for families \n     to take time out of their busy lives to come together and to \n     give thanks for the many blessings in their lives;\n       Whereas approximately 21,000 men, women, and children in \n     the United States are given the gift of life each year \n     through transplantation surgery, made possible by the \n     generosity of organ and tissue donations;\n       Whereas more than 66,000 Americans are awaiting their \n     chance to prolong their lives by finding a matching donor;\n       Whereas nearly 5,000 of these patients each year (or 13 \n     patients each day) die while waiting for a donated heart, \n     liver, kidney, or other organ;\n       Whereas nationwide there are up to 15,000 potential donors \n     annually, but families' consent to donation is received for \n     less than 6,000;\n       Whereas the need for organ donations greatly exceeds the \n     supply available;\n       Whereas designation as an organ donor on a driver's license \n     or voter's registration is a valuable step, but does not \n     ensure donation when an occasion arises;\n       Whereas the demand for transplantation will likely increase \n     in the coming years due to the growing safety of \n     transplantation surgery due to improvements in technology and \n     drug developments, prolonged life expectancy, and increased \n     prevalence of diseases that may lead to organ damage and \n     failure, including hypertension, alcoholism, and hepatitis C \n     infection;\n       Whereas the need for a more diverse donor pool, including a \n     variety of racial and ethnic minorities, will continue to \n     grow in the coming years;\n       Whereas the final decision on whether a potential donor can \n     share the gift of life usually is made by surviving family \n     members regardless of the patient's initial intent;\n       Whereas many Americans have indicated a willingness to \n     donate their organs and tissues but have not discussed this \n     critical matter with the family members who are most likely \n     to make the decision, if the occasion arises, as to whether \n     that person will be an organ and tissue donor;\n       Whereas some family members may be reluctant to give \n     consent to donate their deceased loved one's organs and \n     tissues at a very difficult and emotional time if that person \n     has not clearly expressed a desire or willingness to do so;\n       Whereas the vast majority of Americans are likely to spend \n     part of Thanksgiving Day with some of those family members \n     who would be approached to make such a decision; and\n       Whereas it is fitting for families to spend a portion of \n     that day discussing how they might give life to others on a \n     day devoted to giving thanks for their own blessings: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates November 23, 2000, \n     Thanksgiving Day, as a day to ``Give Thanks, Give Life'' and \n     to discuss organ and tissue donation with other family \n     members so that informed decisions can be made if the \n     occasion to donate arises.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S14928-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14928-S14929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING CONTRIBUTIONS OF OLDER PERSONS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 234 recognizing the \ncontribution of older persons to their communities, submitted earlier \ntoday by Senator Bayh and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. 234) recognizing the contribution of older \n     persons to their communities and commending the work of \n     organizations that participate in programs assisting elderly \n     persons and that promote the goal of the International Year \n     of Older Persons.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I rise as the author of the \nInternational Year of the Older Persons resolution to recognize the \ncontributions of all the individuals, organizations and agencies that \nhave worked hard to participate in the United Nations declared \n``International Year of the Older Persons.'' Since 1999 has been \ndeclared the Year of the Older Persons, around the world seniors, \norganizations active in senior issues, and representatives of all \ngenerations have spread the message that collectively we should create \nan environment in which seniors can remain active in their communities \nduring each and every stage of their life. This resolution pays tribute \nto all the United States' participants for representing our country in \nthe various events held in celebration of the International Year of the \nOlder Persons. They have been active throughout the year. It is time \nCongress added its voice and support the efforts of these organizations \nand individuals. This resolution serves as a first step in the role \nCongress can play to assist with the advancement of this year's theme \nand goals.\n  The theme of the year, a ``society for all ages,'' recognizes that \nlongevity is relevant to all stages of the life cycle, and that \nsuccessful aging is a product of long-term planning, lifelong \ndecisions. It is important for the world to reflect upon this theme. \nToo often in America we focus on the negative images associated with \naging and not the contributions that are made when people remain \nproductive throughout their lifetime. America needs to celebrate that \nAmericans are living longer! We need to acknowledge that aging can be a \npositive process that benefits everyone in our communities.\n  The most important goals of the year are to increase awareness about \naging within countries and across national boundaries and to formulate \npolicies and programs to promote the well-being of older persons. The \nprinciples highlighted by the resolution include independence, \nparticipation, care, self-fulfillment, and dignity. The purpose of the \nyear is to empower people to spend their senior years happy and \nhealthy. Although the goals and principles of this year have been \nadvanced internationally, we need to particularly acknowledge that the \nUnited States has been well represented by several organizations such \nas the Federal Committee to Prepare for the International Year of Older \nPersons, the Leadership Council of Aging Organizations, and the \nAmerican Association for International Aging.\n  While America's senior organizations have been deeply involved, it is \nmy hope is this resolution will serve as a signal that it is important \nfor Congress to take the goals set forth this year and continue the \nefforts to achieve them. Congress should take the leadership the United \nNations has provided on this issue and continue to build momentum. We \nneed to not only recognize and assist those spreading the message but \nimplement legislation that actively addresses the needs of seniors. As \na member of the Special Committee on Aging, I have learned about the \nissues that seniors face and have explored viable administrative and \nlegislative solutions.\n  I know America needs to be better prepared for its future aging \npopulation. Currently, about 12.8 million Americans report needing \nlong-term care. By 2018, it is estimated that there will be 3.6 million \nelderly persons in need of a nursing home bed, an increase of two \nmillion from the current future. By 2030, the number of Americans in \nnursing homes will double and the cost of caring for them will \nquadruple. Part of creating a society for all ages includes addressing \nthe needs of all ages.\n  Long-term care insurance is an option that should be more widely \ndiscussed among younger people as they begin to prepare for their \nretirement or senior years. However, often we need raise awareness and \nencourage people to take responsibility. That is why I support a tax \ndeduction for the purchase of long-term care insurance. In addition, \nwith an increasing number of people needing long-term care, we should \nmake various options for long-term care more available and affordable.\n  While long-term care insurance for community-based care is one \noption, being cared for by a loved one at home should be another \noption. Therefore, in August, I introduced S. 1518, the Caregivers \nAssistance and Resources Enhancement (CARE) tax credit. It takes \ncourage and dedication to take care of\n\n[[Page S14929]]\n\na loved one at home and the least we can do is make the process less \nfinancially burdensome. Research indicates that the services provided \nby family caregivers annually are valued at $196 billion. The care \nthese families provide at home is not only more compassionate, it saves \nthe government billions of dollars. Annually, we spend $83 billion in \nnursing home care and $32 billion in formal home health care, we should \nthank caregivers by providing them with some economic relief.\n  There is still a great deal of work that can be done to take care of \ncurrent seniors and prepare for the future. We need to have the \ndifficult discussions and search for the solutions.\n  I want to thank Senator Grassley and Senator Breaux for their support \nand involvement on this resolution and for their leadership on the \nSpecial Committee on Aging.\n  I commend all the organizations and individuals who have worked so \nhard throughout the year to help spread the message associated with the \nInternational Year of the Older Persons. As America works the remainder \nof this year and in the years to come to achieve the goals set forth by \nthe International Year of the Older Persons, we need to seriously \nconsider what we in Congress can do to create a society for all ages.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

HOLLAND on April 11, \n     1900;\n       Whereas in overcoming destruction resulting from the attack \n     of United States forces at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December \n     7, 1941, and difficulties with defective torpedoes, the \n     submarine force destroyed 1,314 enemy ships in World War II \n     (weighing a cumulative 5,300,000 tons), which accounts for 55 \n     percent of all enemy ships lost in World War II;\n       Whereas 16,000 United States submariners served with \n     courage during World War II, and 7 United States submariners \n     were awarded Congressional Medals of Honor for their \n     distinguished gallantry in combat above and beyond the call \n     of duty;\n       Whereas in achieving an impressive World War II record, the \n     submarine force suffered the highest casualty rate of any \n     combatant submarine service of the warring alliances, losing \n     375 officers and 3,131 enlisted men in 52 submarines;\n       Whereas from 1948 to 1955, the submarine force, with \n     leadership provided by Admiral Hyman Rickover and others, \n     developed an industrial base in a new technology, pioneered \n     new materials, designed and built a prototype reactor, \n     established a training program, and took to sea the world's \n     first nuclear-powered submarine, the U.S.S. NAUTILUS, thus \n     providing America undersea superiority;\n       Whereas subsequent to the design of the U.S.S.

The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for Mr. Hatch, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2794.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to.\n\n[[Page S14937]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2794) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my fellow Senators \nfor unanimously supporting the passage of S. 486, the Methamphetamine \nAnti-Proliferation Act of 1999. This bill, introduced by Senator \nAshcroft and amended in committee to include provisions from bills that \nI and Senator Grassley had introduced, passed by acclamation in the \nJudiciary Committee earlier this year and represents a significant \nbipartisan effort to combat the scourge of methamphetamine. With this \nbill we are arming our communities with responsible, innovative \nenforcement tools designed to curb the manufacturing and trafficking of \nthis most destructive drug.\n  I want to take a moment to highlight some of the provisions in this \nbill that will assist Federal, State, and local law enforcement in \ntheir efforts against drug traffickers:\n  (1) The bill bolsters the DEA's ability to combat the manufacturing \nand trafficking of methamphetamine by authorizing the creation of \nsatellite offices and the hiring of additional agents to assist State \nand local law enforcement officials. More than any other illicit drug, \nmethamphetamine manufacturers and traffickers operate in small towns \nand rural areas. And, unfortunately, rural law enforcement agencies \noften are overwhelmed and in dire need of the DEA's expertise in \nconducting methamphetamine investigations.\n  (2) The bill will assist State and local officials in handling the \ndangerous toxic waste left behind by methamphetamine labs.\n  (3) Another section of the bill will help prevent the manufacture of \nmethamphetamine by prohibiting the dissemination of drug ``recipes'' on \nthe Internet.\n  (4) The bill amends the Federal antidrug paraphernalia statute to \nclarify that the ban includes Internet advertising for the sale of \ncontrolled substances and drug paraphernalia.\n  (5) To counter the dangers that manufacturing drugs like \nmethamphetamine inflict on human life and on the environment, the bill \nimposes stiffer penalties on manufacturers of all illegal drugs when \ntheir actions create a substantial risk of harm to human life or to the \nenvironment.\n  (6) The bill also works to keep all drugs away from children and to \npunish severely those who prey on our children, especially while at \nschool away from their parents. The bill does this by increasing the \npenalties for distributing illegal drugs to minors and for distributing \nillegal drugs near schools and other locations frequented by juveniles.\n  (7) Finally, the bill increases penalties for manufacturing and \ntrafficking the drug amphetamine, a lesser-known, but no-less dangerous \ndrug than methamphetamine. Other than for a slight difference in \npotency, amphetamine is manufactured, sold, and used in the same manner \nas methamphetamine. Moreover, amphetamine labs pose the same dangers as \nmethamphetamine labs. Not surprisingly, every law enforcement officer \nwith whom I have spoken agreed that the penalties for amphetamine \nshould be the same as those for methamphetamine. For these reasons, the \nbill equalizes the punishment for manufacturing and trafficking the two \ndrugs.\n  In addition to these law enforcement tools, the bill establishes and \nfunds prevention measures and a creative new treatment program for \nhelping those trapped in drug addiction. Specifically, it contains \nprovisions from S. 324, the ``Drug Addiction Treatment Act,'' which I \nand my good friend Senator Levin introduced earlier this session. These \nprovisions undoubtedly will usher in a new generation of drug \ntreatments. Senators Levin, Biden, and Moynihan, as well as my \ncolleague in the House, Chairman Bliley, and experts at the Departments \nof Justice and Health and Human Services, deserve special thanks for \ntheir bipartisan efforts in developing this new treatment paradigm. \nWhile we know that vigorous law enforcement is the key to defeating \nthose who manufacture and sell drugs, we must also embrace proven \nprevention and treatment programs that hold out the promise of turning \nAmericans away from drug use.\n  Mr. President, as I stated on the floor just last week, the \ntimeliness of this bill cannot be overstated. According to a report \nprepared by the Community Epidemiology Work Group, which is part of the \nNational Institute on Drug Abuse, methamphetamine abuse levels ``remain \nhigh . . . and there is strong evidence to suggest this drug will \ncontinue to be a problem in west coast areas and to spread to other \nareas of the United States.'' This threat is real and immediate, and \nthe numbers are telling. According to the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration the number of labs cleaned up by the Administration has \nalmost doubled each year since 1995. Last year, more than 5,500 \namphetamine and methamphetamine labs were seized by DEA and State and \nlocal law enforcement officials, and millions of dollars were spent on \ncleaning up the pollutants and toxins created and left behind by \noperators of these labs. In Utah alone, there were 266 lab seizures \nlast year, a number which elevated Utah to the unenviable position of \nbeing ranked third in the nation for highest per capita clandestine lab \nseizures.\n  Mr. President, this bill furnishes the means for our ongoing battle \nagainst those who manufacture and sell illicit drugs. Perhaps even more \nimportant, this bill underscores our unwavering commitment to win this \nbattle. Let there be no misunderstanding; we will not throw up our \nhands and surrender our streets to those who sell misery and \ndestruction. For the sake of our children and grandchildren, we will \ndefeat this plague. I again thank my colleagues for joining with me in \nthis effort.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The manufacture and distribution of methamphetamines and \namphetamines is an increasingly serious problem, and this bill would \nprovide significant additional resources for both law enforcement and \ntreatment. It was unfortunate that the majority has played politics \nwith this important issue and strained the strong bipartisan support \nfor this bill by including its provisions in a larger, controversial \namendment to S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999, which amendment \nwas approved by a vote of 50-49 on November 10, 1999. I strongly \nopposed that amendment, which significantly increased the use of \nmandatory minimum penalties for powder cocaine offenses and unwisely \ndiminished local control of schools.\n  That amendment to the bankruptcy bill mandated a 10-year mandatory \nminimum sentence for crimes involving 500 grams or more of powder \ncocaine, instead of the current 5 kilogram threshold. It also \ninstituted a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence for crimes involving 50 \ngrams or more of powder cocaine, instead of the current 500-gram \nthreshold. I oppose mandatory minimums both because they are \nextraordinarily costly for taxpayers and because they are \ncounterproductive to our law enforcement efforts. The Justice \nDepartment estimated that the amendment's powder cocaine provision \nwould cost more than $10 billion over the next 30 years simply to build \n11,000 more prison beds. Moreover, the use of mandatory minimums for \nsmaller and smaller quantities of drugs gives federal prosecutors \nfurther incentive to prosecute lower-level drug offenders, further \ndistorting the balance between state and federal law enforcement \nresponsibilities. It simply makes no sense--except perhaps as a matter \nof politics--to federal our Nation's drug laws to such an extreme \nextent.\n  In addition, that amendment provided the wrongheaded approach to the \nnecessary task of rectifying the disparity between sentences for powder \nand crack cocaine. Under current law, the quantity threshold to trigger \nmandatory minimum penalties for crack offenders is 100 times more \nsevere than for powder cocaine offenders. Under this amendment the \nquantity threshold to trigger mandatory minimums for crack offenders \nwould still be 10 times more severe, and the amendment would do nothing \nto mitigate the unnecessary federalization and extreme penalties that \nthe criminal justice system imposes for lower-level crack offenses.\n  Finally, that amendment contained education provisions that would \ntake funding and control away from local school authorities. First, it \ndictates that local school boards adopt certain\n\n[[Page S14938]]\n\nspecific policies on illegal drug use by students, including mandatory \nreporting of students to law enforcement and mandatory expulsion for at \nleast one year of students who possess illegal drugs on school \nproperty. Second, it authorizes the use of public funds to pay tuition \nfor any private schools, including parochial schools, for students who \nwere injured by violent criminal offenses on public school grounds. \nThis provision raises serious constitutional and policy questions, and \nshould not have been slipped into an end-of-session amendment to a \nbankruptcy bill.\n  Because of the extreme reservations that I and many of my colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle expressed about that amendment to the \nbankruptcy bill, I pressed for the original methamphetamine bill to be \nconsidered as a separate matter. I am pleased that we have an \nopportunity to consider and pass this legislation without the poison \npills that the Republican leadership inserted.\n  I continue to have some reservations about this bill. For example, I \ndisapprove of its order to the Sentencing Commission to increase \npenalties for certain amphetamine and methamphetamine crimes by a \nspecific number of base offense levels. I oppose such specific \ndirectives for some of the same reasons that I oppose mandatory \nminimums--they subvert the considered sentencing process that Congress \nwanted when it established the Sentencing Commission.\n  But the good in this bill outweighs the bad. In addition to creating \ntougher penalties for those who manufacture and distribute amphetamines \nas illicit drugs, this bill allocates additional funding to assist \nlocal law enforcement, allows for the hiring of new DEA agents, and \nincreases research, training and prevention efforts. This is a good and \ncomprehensive approach to America's growing amphetamine problem.\n  We significantly improved this bill during committee considerations. \nAs the comprehensive substitute for the original bill was being \ndrafted, I had three primary reservations: First, earlier versions of \nthe bill imposed numerous mandatory minimums. As I stated earlier, I \ncontinue to believe that mandatory minimums are generally an \ninappropriate tool in our critically important national fight against \ndrugs. Simply imposing or increasing mandatory minimums subverts the \nmore considered process Congress set up in the Sentencing Commission. \nThe Federal Sentencing Guidelines already provide a comprehensive \nmechanism to equalize sentences among persons convicted of the same or \nsimilar crime, while allowing judges the discretion they need to give \nappropriate weight to individual circumstances.\n  The Sentencing Commission goes through an extraordinary process to \nset sentence levels. For example, pursuant to our 1996 \nantimethamphetamine law, the Sentencing Commission increased meth \npenalties after careful analysis of recent sentencing data, a study of \nthe offenses, and information from the DEA on trafficking levels, \ndosage unit size, price and drug quantity. Increasing mandatory \nminimums takes sentencing discretion away from judges. We closely \nexamine judges' backgrounds before they are confirmed and should let \nthem do their jobs.\n  Mandatory minimums also impose significant economic and social costs. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the annual cost of \nhousing a federal inmate ranges from $16,745 per year for minimum \nsecurity inmates to $23,286 per year for inmates in high security \nfacilities. It is critical that we take steps that will effectively \ndeter crime, but we should not ignore the costs of the one size fits \nall approach of mandatory minimums. We also cannot ignore the policy \nimplications of the boom in our prison population. In 1970, the total \npopulation in the federal prison system was 20,686 prisoners, of whom \n16.3 percent were drug offenders. By 1997, the federal prison \npopulation had grown to almost 91,000 sentenced prisoners, \napproximately 60 percent of whom were sentenced for drug offenses. The \ncost of supporting this expanded federal criminal justice system is \nstaggering. We ignore at our peril the findings of RAND's comprehensive \n1997 report on mandatory minimum drug sentences: ``Mandatory minimums \nare not justifiable on the basis of cost-effectiveness at reducing \ncocaine consumption, cocaine expenditures, or drug-related crime.''\n  This is why I have repeatedly expressed my concerns about creating \nnew mandatory minimum penalties, including as recently as last October, \nwhen another antimethamphetamine bill was before the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Second, earlier drafts of this bill would have contravened the \nSupreme Court's 1999 decision in Richardson versus U.S. I, along with \nsome other members of the Committee, believed that it would be \ninappropriate to take such a step without first holding a hearing and \ngiving thorough consideration to such a change in the law. The Chairman \nof the Committee, Senator Hatch, was sensitive to this concern and I \nthank him for agreeing to remove that provision from this legislation.\n  Third, an earlier version of the bill contained a provision that \nwould have created a rebuttable presumption that may have violated the \nConstitution's Due Process Clause. Again, I believed that we needed to \nseriously consider and debate such a provision before voting on it. And \nagain, the Chairman was sensitive to the concerns of some of us on the \nCommittee and agreed to remove that provision.\n  By reaching an accord on each of those issues, I was able to join as \na cosponsor of this bill. I support it strongly, and I look forward to \nseeing it become law.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues to express \nmy support for the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999, of \nwhich I am proud to be a cosponsor. This bipartisan measure is a \ncrucial step in the battle against the spread of Methamphetamine, also \nknown as ``Meth.'' It sets forward a comprehensive approach including \ntargeted enforcement through increased resources, training and \npenalties, expansion of prevention and intervention programs, \nenvironmental cleanup, and research.\n  The Meth problem is growing rapidly--not only across the country \nwestward, but also in my home state: our Wisconsin State Crime \nLaboratory has tripled the number of Meth examinations since 1996, with \nprosecutions doubling from previous years; thefts of the precursor \nchemical Anhydrous Ammonia from farmers and retailers are becoming \nroutine; and more Meth producers are emptying out shelves of ``blister \npacks''--packages of Sudafed and other cold remedies which are legal \nproducts used as precursor chemicals and sold in our markets and retail \nstores. Just last week, law enforcement officers in Fox Valley, \nWisconsin reported their first seizure of a Meth lab, evidencing Meth's \nquick spread across the state.\n  In fact, Wisconsin has become a source of one of the most toxic of \nMeth recipes--known to its Western producers as the ``Nazi variety''--\nwhich causes the most aggressive behavior. This is largely due to the \navailability of Anhydrous Ammonia, which accelerates users to a fast \nand violent high. At the same time, the environmental dangers \nassociated with this chemical pose a serious threat to our law \nenforcement officers and our communities.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill includes several provisions \nfrom the Rural Methamphetamine Use Response Act of 1999, introduced by \nSenator Grassley and me earlier this year. In particular, the \nunderlying bill authorizes $6.5 million for additional Drug Enforcement \nAdministration (DEA) agents in rural areas and $5.5 million for DEA \ntraining designed to combat ``meth'' production. In addition, it \ncriminalizes the transport and sale of Anhydrous Ammonia. These \nprovisions will be of great assistance to rural states like Wisconsin, \nadding to the ongoing efforts of state and local law enforcement and \nbuilding on the $1 million in funding I helped secure through the \nAppropriations process for a Meth ``Task Force'' in Western Wisconsin.\n  As Meth continues its devastation throughout the Midwest, it is time \nto confront this raging menace at multiple levels and with cooperative \nstrength. This bipartisan legislation is an important step in that \ndirection.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Senate for \npassing, S. 486, the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999. \nI'm proud to say this comprehensive anti-methamphetamine bill was built \nupon the DEFEAT Meth legislation that I\n\n[[Page S14939]]\n\nintroduced earlier this year. This reflects a tremendous amount of bi-\npartisan work by the members of the judiciary committee.\n  And the reason for the level of bipartisan effort in crafting this \nbill was the recognition by all involved that it is needed desperately \nto combat one of the fastest growing threats to American society: the \nexplosive problem of methamphetamine.\n  With its roots on the West coast, this epidemic has now exploded in \nmiddle America. Meth in the 1990s is what cocaine was in the 1980s and \nheroin was in the 1970s. It is currently the largest drug threat we \nface in my home state of Missouri. Unfortunately, it may be coming soon \nto a city or town near you.\n  If you wanted to design a drug to have the worst possible effect on \nyour community, you'd make methamphetamine. It is highly addictive, \nhighly destructive, cheap, and easy to manufacture.\n  To give you an idea of the scope of the problem, in 1992, law \nenforcement seized 2 clandestine Meth labs in my state of Missouri. By \n1994, there were 14 seizures. In 1998, they seized 679 labs. Based on \nthe figures collected so far this year, that number will jump again \nthis year to over 800 labs.\n  And with this growth have come all of the problems. As meth abuse has \nincreased, domestic abuse, child abuse, burglaries and meth related \nmurders have also increased proportionately. From 1992 to 1998 meth-\nrelated emergency room incidents increased 63 percent.\n  What is more unacceptable is that meth is ensnaring our children. In \n1998, the percentage of 12th graders who used meth was double the 1992 \nlevel. In recent conversations I have had with local law enforcement \nofficers in Missouri, they estimated that as many as 10% of high school \nstudents know the receipe for meth. In fact, one need only log on to \nthe Internet to find scores of web sites giving detailed instructions \nto set up you own meth lab. This is unacceptable.\n  Despite the appropriation of over $35 million dollars in the past two \nappropriation cycles for the Drug Enforcement Administration to train \nlocal law enforcement in the interdiction and clean-up of \nmethamphetamine labs, the meth problem continues to grow.\n  And that is why I am so pleased S. 486, the Methamphetamine Anti-\nProliferation Act of 1999 passed the Senate. This bill provides the \nnecessary weapons to fight the growing meth problem in this country, \nincluding the authorization of $9.5 million for DEA programs to train \nState and local law enforcement in techniques used in meth \ninvestigations, $5.5 million for the hiring of new agents to assist \nState and local law enforcement in small and mid-sized communities, $15 \nmillion for school and community-based meth abuse and addiction \nprevention programs, $10 million for treatment of meth addicts, and $15 \nmillion to the Office of National Drug Control Policy to combat \ntrafficking of meth in designated HIDTA's (High Intensity Drug \nTrafficking Areas) which have had great success in Missouri and the \nMidwest.\n  This bill also amends the Sentencing Guidelines by increasing the \nmandatory minimum sentences for manufacturing meth and significantly \nincreases mandatory minimum sentences if the offense created a risk of \nharm to the life of a minor or incompetent. Furthermore, the bill \nincludes meth paraphernalia in the federal list of illegal \nparaphernalia.\n  But focusing on reducing supply through interdiction and punishment \nis not enough. The bill also authorizes substantial resources for \neducation and prevention targeted specifically at the problem of meth. \nLocal law enforcement in Missouri tells me that 10% of high school \nstudents know the recipe for meth. I want to ensure that 100% of them \nknow that meth is a recipe for disaster.\n  Meth presents us with a formidable challenge. We have faced many \nother challenges in the past and we can face this one as well. In fact, \nthe history of America is one of meeting challenges and surpassing \npeople's highest expectations. Meth is no exception. All its takes is \nthat we marshal our will and channel the great indomitable American \nspirit. Through legislative efforts like this bill we will meet this \nnew meth challenge and defeat it.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, three years ago I joined with my \ndistinguished friend and colleague, Senator Hatch, to introduce the \n``Hatch-Biden Methamphetamine Control Act'' to address the growing \nthreat of methamphetamine use in our country before it was too late.\n  Our failure to foresee and prevent the crack cocaine epidemic is one \nof the most significant public policy mistakes in recent history. We \nwere determined not to repeat that mistake with methamphetamine.\n  That 1996 Act provided crucial tools that we needed to stay ahead of \nthe methamphetamine epidemic--increased penalties for possessing and \ntrafficking in methamphetamine and the precursor chemicals and \nequipment used to manufacture the drug; tighter reporting requirements \nand restrictions on the legitimate sales of products containing \nprecursor chemicals to prevent their diversion; increased reporting \nrequirements for firms that sell those products by mail; and enhanced \nprison sentences for meth manufacturers who endanger the life of any \nindividual or endanger the environment while making this drug. We also \ncreated a national working group of law enforcement and public health \nofficials to monitor any growth in the methamphetamine epidemic.\n  I have no doubt that our 1996 legislation slowed this epidemic \nsignificantly. But we are up against a powerful and highly addictive \ndrug.\n  The Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999--which I have \ncosponsored--builds on the 1996 Act. First and foremost, it closes the \n``amphetamine loophole'' in current law by making the penalties for \nmanufacturing, distribution, importing and exporting amphetamine the \nsame as those for meth. After all, the two drugs differ by only one \nchemical and are sold interchangeably on the street. If users can't \ntell the difference between the two substances, there is no reason why \nthe penalties should be different.\n  The amendment also addresses the growing problem of meth labs by \nestablishing penalties for manufacturing the drug with an enhanced \npenalty for those who would put a child's life at risk in the process. \nWe provide the Drug Enforcement Administration with much needed funding \nto clean up clandestine labs after they are seized as well as to train \nstate local law enforcement officers to handle the hazardous wastes \nproduced in the meth labs and certify them to train their colleagues.\n  Methamphetamine is made from an array of hazardous substances--\nbattery acid, lye, ammonia gas, hydrochloric acid, just to name a few--\nthat produce toxic fumes and often lead to fires or explosions when \nmixed. I am revealing nothing by naming some of these chemical \ningredients. Anyone with access to the Internet can download a detailed \nmeth recipe with a few simple keystrokes. Our legislation would make \nsuch postings illegal.\n  We provide money for the Drug Enforcement Administration to clean up \nthese toxic sites and certify state and local officials to handle the \nhazardous byproducts at the lab sites. We provide funds for additional \nlaw enforcement personnel--including agents, investigators, \nprosecutors, lab technicians, chemists, investigative assistants and \ndrug prevention specialists in High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas \nwhere meth is a problem.\n  We also provide funds for new agents to assist State and local law \nenforcement in small- and mid-sized communities in all phases of drug \ninvestigations and assist state and local law enforcement in rural \nareas.\n  Further, the legislation provides much needed money for prevention, \ntreatment and research, including clinical trials. It asks the \nInstitute of Medicine to issue a report on the status of \npharmacotherapies for treatment of amphetamine and methamphetamine \naddiction.\n  I understand that the scientists at the National Institute on Drug \nAbuse are making headway in isolating amino acids and developing \nmedications to deal with meth overdose and addiction.\n  We also have a provision that would allow certain doctors to dispense \nSchedule III, IV and V drugs from their offices to treat addiction. I \nam glad to see this provision included. Ten years ago, I asked the \nquestion: ``If drug abuse is an epidemic, are we doing\n\n[[Page S14940]]\n\nenough to find a medical `cure'?'' Unfortunately that question is still \nwith us. But today we also have another question: ``Are we doing enough \nto get the `cures' we have to those who need them?'' We have an \nenormous ``treatment gap'' in this country. Less than half of the \nestimated 4.4 to 5.3 million people who need drug treatment are \nreceiving it. Licensing qualified doctors to prescribe certain \npharmacotherapies from their offices is a significant step toward \nbridging the treatment gap.\n  Also to that end, this bill authorizes $10 million for treatment of \nmethamphetamine addiction.\n  The bill also tightens the restrictions on direct and indirect \nadvertising of illegal drug paraphernalia and Schedule I drugs. Under \nthis legislation, it would be illegal for on-line magazines and other \nwebsites to post advertisements for such illegal material or provide \n``links'' to websites that do. We crafted this language carefully so \nthat we restrict the sale of drug paraphernalia without restricting the \nFirst Amendment.\n  All in all, I believe that this is a comprehensive bill that attacks \nthe methamphetamine and amphetamine problem from every angle.\n  Today the Senate also passed the ``Date Rape Drug Control Act of \n1999,'' a very important piece of legislation which will place the most \nstringent controls on GHB, a drug which is being used with increasing \nfrequency to commit rape. I commend Senator Abraham for his efforts to \nget this bill passed and I thank him for acknowledging my efforts as \nwell.\n  For nearly five years now, I have been working to raise awareness \nabout date rape drugs including rohypnol and ketamine.\n  In 1996, I first introduced legislation to schedule these drugs under \nthe Controlled Substances Act. This was not a step I took lightly \nbecause there is a regulatory procedure in place for scheduling \ncontrolled substances. But my view was that the regulatory process \nwould take years to do what needed to be done in months, forfeiting \nvaluable time in the fight to stop these drugs from being used to \ncommit heinous crimes.\n  Federal scheduling is important for three simple reasons. First, \nfederal scheduling triggers increased state drug law penalties. This is \nbecause state law penalties are linked to the level at which a drug \nappears on the federal controlled substance schedule. Since more than \n95 percent of all drug cases are prosecuted at the state level, not by \nthe federal government, federal scheduling is vitally important.\n  Second, federal scheduling triggers tough federal penalties.\n  And third, scheduling has proven to work. In 1984, I worked to \nreschedule Quaaludes from Schedule II to Schedule I, Congress passed \nthe law and the Quaalude epidemic was greatly reduced. Again in 1990, I \nworked to re-classify steroids as a Schedule III substance, Congress \npassed the law and again a drug epidemic that had been on the rise was \nreversed.\n  Progress on scheduling date rape drugs has been slow. This past \nAugust--four years after I first called for stricter regulations--the \nDrug Enforcement Administration finally classified ketamine as a \nSchedule III drug.\n  Rohypnol has yet to be classified as a Schedule I drug, though we \nhave passed legislation that stipulates that it is subject to federal \npenalties. Far from perfect, but it is a small step in the right \ndirection.\n  In 1996, we passed legislation to crack down on those who commit \nviolent crimes--including rape--by giving the victim a controlled \nsubstance without that person's knowledge.\n  As a result of that legislation, this cowardly act is punishable by \nup to 20 years in prison.\n  And today the Senate passed legislation that recognizes that GHB is a \nsignificant public safety hazard and will result in the drug being \ndesignated as a Schedule I substance. At the same time, the legislation \nrecognizes that there is a public health interest here. GHB is \ncurrently being studied as a treatment for narcolepsy and this bill \ngoes to great lengths to ensure that this research can continue without \nundue burdens.\n  Further, the ``Date Rape Drug Control Act'' requires the Attorney \nGeneral to assist in the development of forensic tests to help law \nenforcement detect GHB and related substances and develop training \nmaterials on date rape drugs for police officers. The bill also calls \nfor a national awareness campaign to warn people about the danger of \nthese drugs.\n  Recently, these date rape drugs have been used in my State of \nDelaware. Several women at ``The Big Kahuna,'' the largest nightclub in \nWilmington have had drugs slipped into their drinks.\n  This is a serious problem and we must take bold steps, like passing \nthe measure we passed today, to establish strict penalties for this \ncowardly crime.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has passed both of these important \npieces of legislation today and I hope to see them enacted into law.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate has now approved a long-time \ncrusade of mine--that of speeding the development and delivery of anti-\naddition medications that block the craving for illicit addictive \nsubstances. This is one way in which we can fight and win the war on \ndrugs--by blocking the craving for illegal substances. The proposal, \nwhich has now passed the Senate as embodied in S. 324, the Drug \nAddiction Treatment Act, which I introduced in January of this year \nalong with Senator Hatch, Senator Moynihan and Senator Biden, will \nachieve this goal.\n  Mr. President, the Drug Addiction Treatment Act, reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee as Sec. 18 of the Methamphetamine Anti-\nProliferation Act of 1999, enables qualified physicians to prescribe \nschedule IV and V anti-addiction medications in their offices, under \ncertain strict conditions. There are a number of reasons why this \nlegislation is necessary. The Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of 1974, \nrequires separate DEA registrations for physicians who want to use \napproved narcotics in drug abuse treatment and separate approvals of \nregistrants by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) \nand by state agencies. The result has been a treatment system \nconsisting primarily of large clinics, preventing physicians from \ntreating patients in an office setting or in rural areas or small \ntowns, thereby denying treatment to thousands in need of it. \nAdditionally, experts say that many heroin addicts who want treatment \nare often deterred because of the stigma that is associated with such \nclinics.\n  The medications Buprenorphine and Buprenorphone/naloxone combination \nhave proven to be effective blockers of craving for heroin. Dr. Alan \nLeshner, Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) \nsubstantiates this finding in the ``many NIDA funded studies [that] \nsupport the effectiveness, safety and efficacy of Buprenorphine and \nbuprenorphine combined with naloxone for the treatment of opiate \ndependence.''\n  The intent of the Drug Addiction Treatment Act, S. 324, is to make it \npossible for medications like Buprenorphine, because of the \nunlikelihood of diversion or abuse, to be used effectively to block the \ncraving for heroin. To do this, the medication must be made available \nin physician offices and there must be safeguards that such \navailability is not abused. The protections in the legislation against \nsuch abuse are as follows: Physicians may not treat more than 20 \npatients in an office setting unless the Secretary adjusts this number; \nthe Secretary, as appropriate, may add to these conditions and allow \nthe Attorney General to terminate a physician's DEA registration if \nthese conditions are violated; and the program may be discontinued \nwithin three years after the date of enactment, if the Secretary and \nAttorney General determine that this new type of decentralized \ntreatment has not proven to be an effective form of treatment.\n  States may opt out of the provision. Also, nothing in the waiver \npolicy is intended to change the rules pertaining to methadone clinics \nor other facilities or practitioners that conduct drug treatment \nservices under the dual registration system imposed by current law. In \ncrafting the waiver provisions of this legislation, we consulted with \nthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including the Federal \nDrug Administration, and the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n  The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), in collaboration with a\n\n[[Page S14941]]\n\nprivate pharmaceutical company developed Buprenorphine for the \ntreatment of heroin addiction. Because of the reluctance of the \npharmaceutical industry to become involved in developing anti-addiction \nmedications, NIDA has played an active role in supporting research at \nevery step of the drug development process. NIDA's Medications \nDevelopment Division has been working to accelerate the identification, \nevaluation, development, and approval of new medications to treat drug \naddiction, which I call anti-addiction drugs. Through this process, \nNIDA has been able to bring a number of effective medications into drug \ntreatment. In the case of Buprenorphine products, NIDA has supported \nresearch for many years which indicates that the medication is \neffective in blocking the craving for heroin.\n  Mr. President, the crisis of illegal drug use continues to cost \nsociety both in human toll and in the loss of billions of dollars each \nyear. Consider the startling and compelling findings of the January \n1995 Institute of Medicine Report, which estimates the cost to society \nfor drug abuse and dependence treatment at $66.9 billion in 1990 alone, \nand estimated the cost of drug-related crime at $46 billion that same \nyear. A 1995 report of the Office of National Drug Control Policy tells \nus that users of illegal drugs spent $48.7 billion on the purchase of \nillicit substances to feed their addiction.\n  Recent findings of the Monitoring the Future Program, headed by Dr. \nLloyd Johnson of the University of Michigan, indicates that heroin use \namong American teens doubled between 1991 and 1998, and represents a \nclear and present danger for a significant number of American young \npeople. Dr. Johnson attributes this to a ``sharp increase in use . . . \nresulting from adoption of non-injectable modes of administration--\nsmoking and snorting, in particular.'' Dr. Johnson goes on to say that \n``the very high purity of heroin on the street has made these new \ndevelopments possible and that unfortunately, a number of those users \nwill become dependent on heroin and will switch over to injection, \nwhich is a more efficient way to derive the equivalent high''\n  The President of the Michigan Public Health Association, Dr. \nStephanie Meyers Schim, has spoken out eloquently about the ``great \nproblems'' of substance abuse. In her recent letter in support of S. \n324, she says: Substance abuse affects health care costs, mortality, \nworkers' compensation claims, reduced productivity, crime, suicide, \ndomestic violence, child abuse, and increases costs associated with \nextra law enforcement, motor vehicle crashes, crime, and lost \nproductivity. Dr. Schim goes on to say, ``Buprenorphine will allow drug \naddicted individuals to maximize everyday life activities, and \nparticipate more fully in work day and family activities while seeking \nthe needed treatment and counseling to become drug free''.\n  Dr. James H. Wood, Professor of Pharmacology at the University of \nMichigan Medical School recently wrote: ``One of the most important \naspects of your bill is the use of Buprenorphine by well-trained \nphysicians to treat narcotic addiction from their offices, which has \nthe potential to attract and treat effectively sizable populations of \ncurrently untreated addicts . . . a major byproduct of this increased \ntreatment, of course, will be reduction in the demand for illicit \nnarcotics in the U.S.''\n  Dr. Thomas Kosten, President of the American Academy of Addiction \nPsychiatry echoed these sentiments in recent testimony on The Drug \nAddiction Treatment Act before the House Commerce Committee on Health \nand Environment, and I quote: ``. . . I would like to support the \navailability of Buprenorphine for office based practice. Addiction is a \nbrain disease and office-based practice is primarily needed for \neffective treatment of Buprenorphine.''\n  The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), and the College on \nProblems of Drug Dependence which is the nation's longest standing \norganization of scientists addressing drug dependence and drug abuse, \nhave stated that the availability of Buprenorphine in physicians' \noffices adds a needed expansion of current treatment for heroin \naddiction. ASAM also cautioned that Buprenorphine will have limited \nutility if it is tied to the regulatory structure for current \ntreatments of heroin addiction.\n  There are other compelling reasons why we must expedite the delivery \nof anti-addiction medications. Of the juveniles who land behind bars in \nstate institutions, more than 60 percent of them reported using drugs \nonce a week or more, and over 40 percent reported being under the \ninfluence of drugs while committing crimes, according to a report from \nthe Bureau of Justice Statistics. Drug-related incarcerations are up \nand we are building more jails and prisons to accommodate them--more \nthan 1000 have been built over the past 20 years. According to the July \n14, 1999 Office of National Drug Control Policy Update, and I quote: \n``Drug-related arrests are up from 1.1 million arrests in 1988 to 1.6 \nmillion arrests in 1997--steady increases every year since 1991.''\n  These sentiments were also expressed during a May 9, 1997 Drug Forum \non Anti-addiction Research, which I convened along with Senator \nMoynihan, Senator Bob Kerrey and other members of the Senate. Forum \nparticipants, including distinguished experts such as Dr. Herbert \nKleber and Dr. Donald Landry of Columbia University, Dr. Charles \nSchuster of Wayne State University and Dr. James Woods of the \nUniversity of Michigan, made it crystal clear that time is of the \nessence--we must act expeditiously on new treatment discoveries that \nblock the craving for illicit addictive substances.\n  Mr. President, I received a very supportive letter from HHS Secretary \nDonna Shalala: ``I am especially encouraged by the results of published \nclinical studies of Buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is a partial mu opiate \nreceptor agonist, in Schedule V of the Controlled Substances Act, with \nunique properties which differentiate it from full agonists such as \nmethadone or LAAM. The pharmacology of the combination tablet \nconsisting of Buprenorphine and naloxone results in . . . low value and \nlow desirability for diversion on the street. Published clinical \nstudies suggest that it has very limited euphorigenic affects, and has \nthe ability to percipitate withdrawal in individuals who are highly \ndependent upon other opioids. Thus, Buprenorphine and Buprenorphine/\nnaloxone products are expected to have low diversion potential. \nBuprenorphine and Buprenorphine naloxone products are expected to reach \nnew groups of opiate addicts--for example, those who do not have access \nto methadone programs, those who are reluctant to enter methadone \ntreatment programs, and those who are unsuited to them (this would \ninclude for example, those in their first year of opiates addiction or \nthose addicted to lower doses of opiates). Buprenorphine and \nBuprenorphine/naloxone products should increase the amount of treatment \ncapacity available and expand the range of treatment options that can \nbe used by physicians. Secretary Shalala went on to say, \n``Buprenorphine and Buprenorphine/Naloxone would not replace methadone. \nMethadone and LAAM clinics would remain an important part of the \ntreatment continuum.''\n  Mr. President, a companion bill has been introduced and reported out \nof Committee in the House. It is my hope that full House will act as \nexpeditiously as the Senate on this important legislation.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, 3 years ago I joined with my distinguished \nfriend and colleague, Senator Hatch, to introduce the Hatch-Biden \nMethamphetamine Control Act to address the growing threat of \nmethamphetamine use in our country before it was too late. Our failure \nto foresee and prevent the crack cocaine epidemic is one of the most \nsignificant public policy mistakes in recent history. We were \ndetermined not to repeat that mistake with methamphetamine.\n  That 1996 act provided crucial tools that we needed to stay ahead of \nthe methamphetamine epidemic--increased penalties for possessing and \ntrafficking in methamphetamine and the precursor chemicals and \nequipment used to manufacture the drug; tighter reporting requirements \nand restrictions on the legitimate sales of products containing \nprecursor chemicals to prevent their\n\n[[Page S14942]]\n\ndiversion; increased reporting requirements for firms that sell those \nproducts by mail; and enhanced prison sentences for meth manufacturers \nwho endanger the life of any individual or endanger the environment \nwhile making this drug. We also created a national working group of law \nenforcement and public health officials to monitor any growth in the \nmethamphetamine epidemic.\n  I have no doubt that our 1996 legislation slowed this epidemic \nsignificantly. But we are up against a powerful and highly addictive \ndrug. The Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999--which I have \ncosponsored--builds on the 1996 act. First and foremost, it closes the \n``amphetamine loophole'' in current law by making the penalties for \nmanufacturing, distribution, importing and exporting amphetamine the \nsame as those for meth. After all, the two drugs differ by only one \nchemical and are sold interchangeably on the street. If users can't \ntell the difference between the two substances, there is no reason why \nthe penalties should be different.\n  The bill also addresses the growing problem of meth labs by \nestablishing penalties for manufacturing the drug with an enhanced \npenalty for those who would put a child's life at risk in the process. \nWe provide the Drug Enforcement Administration with much needed funding \nto clean up clandestine labs after they are seized as well as to train \nstate and local law enforcement officers to handle the hazardous wastes \nproduced in the meth labs and certify them to train their colleagues. \nMethamphetamine is made from an array of hazardous substances--battery \nacid, lye, ammonia gas, hydrochloric acid, just to name a few--that \nproduce toxic fumes and often lead to fires or explosions when mixed. I \nam revealing nothing by naming some of these chemical ingredients. \nAnyone with access to the Internet can download a detailed meth recipe \nwith a few simple keystrokes. Our legislation would make such postings \nillegal.\n  We provide money for the Drug Enforcement Administration to clean up \nthese toxic sites and certify state and local officials to handle the \nhazardous byproducts at the lab sites. We provide funds for additional \nlaw enforcement personnel--including agents, investigators, \nprosecutors, lab technicians, chemists, investigative assistants and \ndrug prevention specialists in High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas \nwhere meth is a problem. We also provide funds for new agents to assist \nState and local law enforcement in small- and mid-sized communities in \nall phases of drug investigations and assist state and local law \nenforcement in rural areas. Further, the legislation provides much \nneeded money for prevention, treatment and research, including clinical \ntrials. It asks the Institute of Medicine to issue a report on the \nstatus of pharmacotherapies for treatment of amphetamine and \nmethamphetamine addiction. I understand that the scientists at the \nNational Institute on Drug Abuse are making headway in isolating amino \nacids and developing medications to deal with meth overdose and \naddiction.\n  We also have a provision that would allow certain doctors to dispense \nSchedule III, IV and V drugs from their offices to treat addiction. I \nam glad to see this provision included. Ten years ago, I asked the \nquestion: ``If drug abuse is an epidemic, are we doing enough to find a \nmedical `cure'?'' Unfortunately that question is still with us. But \ntoday we also have another question: ``Are we doing enough to get the \n`cures' we have to those who need them?'' We have an enormous \n``treatment gap'' in this country. Less than half of the estimated 4.4 \nto 5.3 million people who need drug treatment are receiving it. \nLicensing qualified doctors to prescribe certain pharmacotherapies from \ntheir offices is a significant step toward bridging the treatment gap. \nAlso to that end, this bill authorizes $10 million for treatment of \nmethamphetamine addiction.\n  The bill also tightens the restrictions on direct and indirect \nadvertising of illegal drug paraphernalia and Schedule I drugs. Under \nthis legislation, it would be illegal for on-line magazines and other \nwebsites to post advertisements for such illegal material or provide \n``links'' to websites that do. We crafted this language carefully so \nthat we restrict the sale of drug paraphernalia without restricting the \nfirst amendment. All in all, I believe that this is a comprehensive \nbill that attacks the methamphetamine and amphetamine problem from \nevery angle. Today the Senate also passed the ``Date Rape Drug Control \nAct of 1999,'' a very important piece of legislation which will place \nthe most stringent controls on GHB, a drug which is being used with \nincreasing frequency to commit rape. I commend Senator Abraham for his \nefforts to get this bill passed and I thank him for acknowledging my \nefforts as well.\n  For nearly 5 years now, I have been working to raise awareness about \ndate rape drugs including rohypnol and ketamine. In 1996, I first \nintroduced legislation to schedule these drugs under the Controlled \nSubstances Act. This was not a step I took lightly because there is a \nregulatory procedure in place for scheduling controlled substances. But \nmy view was that the regulatory process would take years to do what \nneeded to be done in months, forfeiting valuable time in the fight to \nstop these drugs from being used to commit heinous crimes. Federal \nscheduling is important for three simple reasons. First, Federal \nscheduling triggers increased state drug law penalties. This is because \nstate law penalties are linked to the level at which a drug appears on \nthe Federal controlled substance schedule. Since more than 95 per cent \nof all drug cases are prosecuted at the state level, not by the Federal \ngovernment, federal scheduling is vitally important.\n  Second, Federal scheduling triggers tough federal penalties.\n  And third, scheduling has proven to work. In 1984, I worked to \nreschedule Quaaludes from Schedule II to Schedule I, Congress passed \nthe law and the Quaalude epidemic was greatly reduced. Again in 1990, I \nworked to reclassify steroids as a Schedule III substance, Congress \npassed the law and again a drug epidemic that had been on the rise was \nreversed.\n  Progress on scheduling date rape drugs has been slow. This past \nAugust--4 years after I first called for stricter regulations--the Drug \nEnforcement Administration finally classified ketamine as a Schedule \nIII drug. Rohypnol has yet to be classified as a Schedule I drug, \nthough we have passed legislation that stipulates that it is subject to \nfederal penalties. Far from perfect, but it is a small step in the \nright direction.\n  In 1996, we passed legislation to crack down on those who commit \nviolent crimes--including rape--by giving the victim a controlled \nsubstance without that person's knowledge. As a result of that \nlegislation, this cowardly act is punishable by up to 20 years in \nprison. And today the Senate passed legislation that recognizes that \nGHB is a significant public safety hazard and will result in the drug \nbeing designated as a Schedule I substance. At the same time, the \nlegislation recognizes that there is a public health interest here. GHB \nis currently being studied as a treatment for narcolepsy and this bill \ngoes to great lengths to ensure that this research can continue without \nundue burdens.\n  Further, the Date Rape Drug Control Act requires the Attorney General \nto assist in the development of forensic tests to help law enforcement \ndetect GHB and related substances and develop training materials on \ndate rape drugs for police officers. The bill also calls for a national \nawareness campaign to warn people about the danger of these drugs. \nRecently, these date rape drugs have been used in my State of Delaware. \nSeveral women at ``The Big Kahuna,'' the largest nightclub in \nWilmington have had drugs slipped into their drinks. This is a serious \nproblem and we must take bold steps, like passing the measure we passed \ntoday, to establish strict penalties for this cowardly crime. I am \npleased that the Senate has passed both of these important pieces of \nlegislation today and I hope to see them enacted into law.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to commend the Senate for \nunanimously passing the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 1999 (S. 324), \nas Title II, Subsection B, of the DEFEAT Meth Act of 1999 (S. 486). The \nSenate's action today marks a milestone in the treatment of opiate \ndependence. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act increases access to new \nmedications, such as buprenorphine, to treat opiate addiction. I thank \nmy colleagues Senator\n\n[[Page S14943]]\n\nLevin (whose long-term vision inspired this legislation), Senator \nHatch, and Senator Biden for their leadership and dedication in \ndeveloping this Act, and I look forward to seeing the Drug Addiction \nTreatment Act of 1999 become law.\n  Determining how to deal with the problem of addiction is not a new \ntopic. Just over a decade ago when we passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of \n1988, I was assigned by our then-Leader Robert Byrd, with Sam Nunn, to \nco-chair a working group to develop a proposal for drug control \nlegislation. We worked together with a similar Republican task force. \nWe agreed, at least for a while, to divide funding under our bill \nbetween demand reduction activities (60 percent) and supply reduction \nactivities (40 percent). And we created the Director of National Drug \nControl Policy (section 1002); next, ``There shall be in the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy a Deputy Director for Demand Reduction and \na Deputy Director for Supply Reduction.''\n  We put demand first. To think that you can ever end the problem by \ninterdicting the supply of drugs, well, it's an illusion. There's no \npossibility.\n  I have been intimately involved with trying to eradicate the supply \nof drugs into this country. It fell upon me, as a member of the Nixon \nCabinet, to negotiate shutting down the heroin traffic that went from \ncentral Turkey to Marseilles to New York--``the French Connection''--\nbut we knew the minute that happened, another route would spring up. \nThat was a given. The success was short-lived. What we needed was \ndemand reduction, a focus on the user. And we still do.\n  Demand reduction requires science and it requires doctors. I see the \nscience continues to develop, and The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of \n1999 will allow doctors and patients to make use of it.\n  Congress and the public continue to fixate on supply interdiction and \nharsher sentences (without treatment) as the ``solution'' to our drug \nproblems, and adamantly refuse to acknowledge what various experts now \nknow and are telling us: that addiction is a chronic, relapsing \ndisease; that is, the brain undergoes molecular, cellular, and \nphysiological changes which may not be reversible.\n  What we are talking about is not simply a law enforcement problem, to \ncut the supply; it is a public health problem, and we need to treat it \nas such. We need to stop filling our jails under the misguided notion \nthat such actions will stop the problem of drug addiction.

RES. 237\n\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of Senator Boxer, I send a Senate resolution to \nthe desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  Ms. COLLINS. On behalf of the Republican leader, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  S. Res. 237 will lie over under the rule.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution on the \nConvention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.\n  For those unfamiliar with this issue, the Treaty, known by its \nacronym CEDAW, is the most comprehensive and detailed international \ntreaty to date that addresses the rights of women.\n  The United States was an active participant in drafting this treaty. \nIt was approved by the General Assembly in 1979. President Carter \nsigned the treaty on behalf of the United States.\n  To date, 165 nations have ratified or acceded to the treaty. The \nUnited States joins the likes of Afghanistan, North Korea and Iran as \nthe few nations who have decided not to become state parties to this \ntreaty.\n  The Convention requires that nations take measures to eliminate \ndiscrimination against women. Discrimination is defined as ``any \ndistinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which \nhas the effect of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment, \nor exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status.''\n  The treaty addresses ``human rights and fundamental freedoms in the \npolitical, economic, social, cultural, civil, or any other field.''\n  Let me be clear, this treaty covers the most basic rights for women. \nFor example, Article 5 recognizes the common responsibility of men and \nwomen for raising children. Article 6 requires measures to suppress all \nforms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women.\n  Articles 7 and 8 would ensure that women have the right to vote, run \nfor office, and represent their countries in international activities.\n  Article 10 calls for the elimination of discrimination in the field \nof education.\n  Article 11 gives women the right to work and free choice of \nemployment.\n  Article 12 eliminates discrimination in the delivery of health care \nservices.\n  This treaty covers other areas of discrimination as well, but as you \ncan tell by the few Articles I have described, this treaty is extremely \nimportant to the rights of women throughout the world.\n  And, ratification of this treaty will strengthen our capability to \nurge other nations to promote these rights.\n  In 1994 the Senate Foreign Relations overwhelmingly supported this \ntreaty approving the resolution of ratification by a vote of 13 to 5.\n  Unfortunately, time ran out in the 103rd Congress before the full \nSenate had the opportunity to consider the treaty.\n  Today, I am offering amendment stating that it is the Sense of the \nSenate that the Foreign Relations Committee should once again hold \nhearings on CEDAW.\n  It also states the Senate should take action on the treaty prior to \nMarch 8, 2000--International Women's Day.\n  The United States needs to show that it is the world leader on \npromoting human rights and that includes the rights of women throughout \nthe world.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S14944-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14944-S14945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND ENFORCEMENT ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe pending appropriations bill which includes funding for the three \nDepartments of Health and Human Services, Education, and Labor, the \nsubcommittee which I chair for the Appropriations Committee.\n  The legislative process has proceeded to this point in an \nextraordinary way.\n\n[[Page S14946]]\n\n It had been my hope and plan that the bill for my subcommittee would \nhave been taken up by the Congress, passed, and presented to the \nPresident in advance of the close of the fiscal year, September 30, but \nthat has not occurred.\n  It had been my hope and plan to present it to the President before \nthe end of the fiscal year so he could have signed it or vetoed it and, \nhad he chosen to veto it, there could have been a public debate on the \npriorities in the bill and also the key point of having local control \non the decision of $1.3 billion, which has been allocated for \nadditional teachers for the reduction of classroom size.\n  Unfortunately, it has been the practice in the Congress in recent \nyears to pass the bills after the close of the fiscal year and in a \ncontext where we are going to yield to the President's wishes, subject \nto a veto, because it may result in the closing down of the Government. \nWinston Churchill had it right when he said that democracy is a \nterrible form of government except compared to everything else. I think \nthat would apply to representative democracy as well. Somehow we muddle \nthrough. We are in the final stage of the muddling process now.\n  To describe the process to people who are not familiar with the \ninside of the Senate is very challenging. I was discussing with my son \nlast night the plan to have the Senate convene at 12:01 a.m., November \n20, Saturday morning, to take up a cloture motion on the appropriations \nbill, and then to vote at 1:01 a.m. It was necessary to have the \nconversation because I had to defer lunch with my 4-year-old \ngranddaughter, Perri, and picking up my 6-year-old granddaughter, \nSilvi, from school, all of which is fine, but there has to be some \nreason for that.\n  We have Senators exercising their rights which, to be repetitious, \nthey have a right to do, such as to have bills read for several hours, \nwhich does not change the ultimate outcome, or to have cloture votes \nwith these extraordinary scheduling problems. I learned a long time ago \nthat the Senate is a lot smarter than I am and the rules of the Senate \nare in place for a purpose.\n  As one of our distinguished colleagues said yesterday in a closed \ncaucus, Senators ought not be discouraged from exercising their rights \nbecause when they take to the floor and debate, have a filibuster, and \nhave extended discussions for the purpose of acquainting the country \nwith what is going on, perhaps it may arouse some public reaction to \nperhaps change what the Senate might be doing.\n  So, in essence, I am delighted to see the Senate rules observed and \nrights to Senators activated. For whatever delay there is, so be it. It \nis my hope that next year the appropriations bill for my subcommittee \non the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nwill be completed at an early date. I have talked to our distinguished \nmajority leader, Senator Lott, and I have had some encouragement that \nmy bill may be taken up first next year, so that priorities can be \nestablished in regular course by the subcommittee, the full committee, \nand the Senate--the same on the House side--then conferenced and \npresented to the President for his signature or for his veto. If he \nchooses to veto the bill, so be it.\n  The bill which was voted out of the Senate by a vote of 73-25 had \nbeen very carefully crafted on a bipartisan basis with my distinguished \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Tom Harkin. I learned a long time ago that \nif you want to get anything done in Washington  in the Senate and the \nCongress, it has to be bipartisan. Senator Harkin and I worked through \nour bill. We had a very attractive bill. We had emphasized $300 million \nmore than the President's figure on education, establishing the \npriorities which we thought were in order.\n\n  We had provided very substantial increases to the National Institutes \nof Health because of the great work done there in looking for cures and \nbeing on the verge of cures for very many major maladies. We are within \n5 years striking distance, so the experts say, on Parkinson's and have \nmade great progress on Alzheimer's and heart disease and cancer--\nprostate cancer, breast cancer and cervical cancer.\n  We picked a figure of $93.7 billion because we thought that would \nattract very substantial bipartisan support, that being $300 million \nhigher in education than the President had, that it would qualify for a \nPresident's signature.\n  Regrettably, the House of Representatives did not pass the bill. In \nconference, the bill was substantially altered, being joined with the \nbill for the District of Columbia. It had an across-the-board cut of \nalmost 1 percent. The bill was ultimately vetoed. Then it came back for \nreconsideration.\n  On reconsideration, the White House administration wanted to add some \n$2.3 billion more. I knew that would cause a major strain on the \nRepublican side of the aisle, and there was a great deal of pressure to \nyield to the President because of the bad experience we had in December \n1995 and early 1996 when the Government was closed down and the \nRepublican-controlled Congress took the blame. The result is that the \nCongress is now gun shy to fight with the President, gun shy because, \nwith his threatened veto, the Congress has a strong tendency to back \ndown, perhaps not on every point--the family planning issue and the \nU.N. dues was a notable exception--but backing down on almost every \npoint. The result has been that we are developing an imperial \npresidency because we have a gun-shy or timid Congress. That is very \nunfortunate.\n  The issue came into sharp focus on the matter of classroom size \nreduction and additional teachers, with the President's program to add \n100,000 teachers. I think it is a very good program. I support it. But \nI do not support it if the local school district says that there are \nother needs at the local level which are more important to the school \ndistrict than additional teachers and classroom size.\n  When we crafted our bill, we said we would acknowledge the \nPresident's ideas as the first priority, but if the local school \ndistrict made a decision after a fact finding study that they wanted to \nuse the money for something else, then let them use the money for \nsomething else. We held tough to that position. Without going into all \nthe details, finally we were undercut. The rug was pulled out, and \nthere was a concession to the President on that point,  with a bone \nbeing thrown to the Congress so that 25 percent could be used for \nteacher training. But that is not the kind of flexibility that is best \npublic policy. The best public policy is, OK, class size reduction and \nadditional teachers are important and they are the first priority, but \nif a local school district says our local needs are different, then \nlet's not put them in a Washington, DC, bureaucratic straitjacket. That \nis the result of what has happened.\n\n  It is my hope that next year we can take this bill up early. This \nissue will still be with us next year and President Clinton will still \nbe with us next year. When Senator Harkin and I and other Republicans \nand Democrats, on a bipartisan basis, establish our priorities, let's \nlegislate. As the Constitution says, the power of the purse is with the \nCongress--the appropriation power--so let us present the bill to the \nPresident. If he vetoes it, let's take the case to the public. I think \nwe can certainly win on the issue of local control versus the \nWashington bureaucratic straitjacket. To do that, the bill has to be \npresented to the President before the end of the fiscal year. It has to \nbe presented to the President in September--hopefully early September. \nThat is the plan for next year.\n  I would like to see the process modified where we do not have the \nWhite House officials in the legislative process as part of the \nnegotiations. The Constitution says that Congress submits a bill to the \nPresident and he signs it or vetoes it. But that system has been \naborted, observed in the breach more often than in the rule by having \nOMB officials, the Director of OMB, sitting down with the appropriators \nto decide what the President will accept before the Congress makes a \ndecision and submits a bill to the President. That is not the \nconstitutional way and we ought to change it.\n  So against that backdrop with substantial concerns about what has \nbeen done, I do intend to vote for this appropriations package. I do so \nbecause the good points outweigh the bad points, perhaps close, but the \nbenefits do outweigh the negatives. We come through in this bill with \nan increase in the National Institutes of Health funding by\n\n[[Page S14947]]\n\n$2.3 billion, for a total of $17.9 billion. Senator Harkin and I have \ntaken the lead with an increase, 2 years ago, of almost $1 billion, \nlast year $2 billion, and this year $2.3 billion. Some objections have \nbeen lodged, but nobody with sufficient bravado to try to take it out \nof the bill.\n  Enormous advances have been made on dreaded diseases. They are within \n5 years of curing Parkinson's, so say the experts, with major research \nadvances in Alzheimer's, cancer, heart ailments, and a whole range of \nvarious other ailments. With the Federal budget of $1.8 trillion, $17.9 \nbillion is not chopped liver, but it is not too much.\n  This bill also has an increase in special education by $913 million, \nbringing the total to more than $6 billion on what is essentially a \nFederal obligation, and it frees State and local funds for other \npurposes. The Head Start increase is $608 million, to more than $5.2 \nbillion. Afterschool learning centers more than doubled for a total of \n$453 million. The substance abuse and mental health program increases \nby $163 million over fiscal year 1999, for more than $2.6 billion. AIDS \nfunding increased by $185 million over last year to almost $1.6 \nbillion. There is first-time funding of $75 million for the Ricky Ray \nHemophilia Act, which are appropriations that are long past due.\n  We worked out an accommodation on the issue of organ allocation and, \nregrettably, at the last minute on a backdoor arrangement, a different \nprovision has been added to another bill that will be voted upon by the \nCongress. Organ allocation has been very contentious. Last year we \nagreed, under considerable reluctance, to a 1-year deferral. The \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, promulgated \nregulations on October 1, and then came the cry for an additional \ndelay. Some wanted it at 90 days.\n  Finally, in a rather unusual way in my capacity as chairman of the \nconference, I invited Secretary Shalala to come to the conference on \nWednesday, November 10. She was on her way home. We reached her in her \ncar and she turned around from Georgetown and headed back to Capitol \nHill. For more than an hour and a half we had a meeting with the House \nchairman, Bill Young, who very much wanted a 90-day delay and the \nranking Democrat on Appropriations, Congressman Obey from Wisconsin, \nwho also argued strongly for a delay. I urged that we not have the \ndelay, as did Congressman John Porter, chairman of the House \nsubcommittee. Finally, we hammered out an agreement for 42 days--21 \ndays for additional comments and 21 more days for a response to those \ncomments.\n  I had thought that closed the matter out and reported back to the \nleadership. The general rule is to leave these issues with the \nsubcommittee chairmen, and we have hammered it out. I found out late \nyesterday that there is another bill with a 90-day extension. It is not \npossible to put a hold on the other measure, which is a conference \nreport. There could be some delay, such as a reading of the bill, a \nvote for cloture, but the result would be the same.\n  Let me say this to those who have increased the delay: It increases \nour tenacity to get these regulations into effect. There is some \nthinking that there will be an authorization bill that is going to \nvalidate the regulations. I am not one for predictions, but I am \nprepared to make one here. There won't be 60 votes for cloture. If that \nshould be wrong, there certainly won't be 67 votes to override a \nPresidential veto. George Shultz, when he was Secretary of State, once \nmade a prophetic comment that ``nothing is ever settled in \nWashington.'' That very thing is true in Washington; he hit that right \non the head. Nothing is ever settled in Washington. I thought the delay \non the organ transplant issue had been resolved, but it wasn't settled. \nGeorge Shultz may be wrong; we may settle it with finality when this \n90-day period expires.\n  In summary, the Congress will finally get the job done on this \nappropriations bill and finally move ahead on the bill from my \nsubcommittee on funding the Departments of Health and Human Services \nand Labor and Education. I have given a brief thumbnail description as \nto what the pluses and minuses are. I will vote for it because the \nadvantages outweigh the disadvantages. But it is my hope that we will \nlearn from the experiences this year and do a much better job next \nyear.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader I submit \na report of the committee of conference on the bill (H.R. 1555) to \nauthorize appropriations for fiscal year 2000 for intelligence and \nintelligence-related activities of the United States Government, the \nCommunity Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency \nRetirement and Disability System, and for other purposes, and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The Conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of November 5, 1999).\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 60 \nminutes for debate with the time divided as follows: Forty minutes \nequally divided between the chairman and vice chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee; 20 minutes under the control of Senator Levin.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the use or yielding \nback of time, which we anticipate, the conference report be agreed to, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any additional \nstatements relating to the conference report be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to ask that my colleagues \nsupport the conference report on the Intelligence Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2000.\n  I want to thank my colleagues in the House for their work on this \nlegislation and especially Chairman Goss and Ranking Member Dixon for \ntheir leadership in the conference.\n  I believe that the conference committee put together a solid package \nfor consideration by the full Senate that fairly represents the \nintelligence priorities set forth in both the Senate and House versions \nof the Intelligence Authorization Act.\n  I am pleased to report that the conference committee accomplished its \ntask in a bipartisan manner, and I want to thank my colleague from \nNebraska, Senator Kerrey, for working so closely with me to produce \nthis legislation.\n  I believe that the conference report embraces many of the key \nrecommendations that the Senate adopted in its version of the bill.\n  We recommended significant increases in funding for high-priority \nprojects aimed at better positioning the Intelligence Community for the \nthreats of the 21st century, while at the same time reducing funds for \nprograms and activities that were not adequately justified or \nredundant.\n  In so doing, we authorized a moderate increase in overall funding for \nintelligence programs above the President's request. This is a positive \nstep and I hope that next year the administration will follow our lead \nand begin to reinvest in our intelligence gathering capabilities.\n  The conference report includes key initiatives that I believe are \nvital for the future of our Intelligence Community.\n  These initiatives include:\n  1. bolstering advanced research and development across the Community, \nto facilitate, among other things, the modernization of NSA and CIA;\n\n[[Page S14948]]\n\n  2. strengthening efforts in counter-proliferation, counter-terrorism, \ncounter-narcotics, counter-intelligence, and effective covert action;\n  3. expanding the collection and exploitation of measurements and \nsignatures intelligence, especially ballistic missile intelligence;\n  4. boosting education, recruiting, and technical training for \nIntelligence Community personnel;\n  5. enhancing analytical capabilities;\n  6. streamlining dissemination of intelligence products;\n  7. developing our ability to process, exploit and disseminate \ncommercial imagery; and\n  8. providing new tools for information operations.\n  I believe that the conferees have provided the funds and guidance \nnecessary to ensure that military commanders and national policymakers \ncontinue to receive timely, accurate information on threats to our \nsecurity.\n  At the same time, we have found some critical areas within the \nCommunity that are in need of major improvements.\n  In the Senate, we had a distinguished panel of Americans with a broad \nrange of expertise--our Technical Advisory Group--that took a look at \nsome key areas within the Intelligence Community and brought forward \nsome very important recommendations.\n  We thank all the members of the Technical Advisory Group for their \ntime and efforts.\n  I will briefly summarize some of their findings, to the extent that I \ncan in open session, along with some of the other findings of our \nconference.\n  First, our ability to collect and analyze information on the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction requires renewed emphasis \nand innovative thinking.\n  As our potential enemies seek out the ability to produce chemical, \nbiological, and nuclear weapons, we must develop the ability to detect \nthese efforts.\n  This bill places a great deal of emphasis on our ability to collect \nsuch information known as Measurements and Signatures Intelligence or \nMASINT.\n  Second, both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees agree that \nour Intelligence Community and our Defense Department must move quickly \nto address what our Technical Advisory Group identifies as a critical \nshortfall in our ability to properly task, process, exploit, and \ndisseminate intelligence information collection by our airborne and \noverhead imagery assets.\n  As we modernize our Imagery Intelligence or IMINT architecture, the \nIntelligence and Armed Services Committees agree that we should not be \nspending the taxpayers money on collection architectures that we may \nnot be able to utilize fully.\n  Third, we have once again placed strong emphasis on recapitalizing \nthe National Security Agency's information technology infrastructure.\n  As we demand more from our Intelligence Community in a number of \nareas, we also demand fiscal responsibility. The conference report \nincludes a number of reductions to programs that were not adequately \njustified or were redundant with other elements within the Intelligence \nCommunity.\n  The legislation contains some important new authorities for the \nIntelligence Community. I'll mention some of the highlights:\n  First, there are new protections for the identities of former covert \nagents and for the operational files of the National Imagery and \nMapping Agency or ``NIMA.''\n  Second, there are new counterintelligence authorities--these include \nprovisions allowing access to government computers used in classified \nwork by executive branch employees. Also, there are new requirements \nfor the FBI to begin its consultation with agencies that they are \ninvestigating at a far earlier stage than before.\n  Third, we have established a commission to study the role and \nmissions of the National Reconnaissance Office or ``NRO.'' This \ncommission will look at the NRO from top to bottom--its findings and \nrecommendations to us and the Senate Armed Services Committee will \nserve to guide our committees on the future funding and operations of \nthe NRO.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee to ensure that the best candidates are \nselected for membership on this very important commission.\n  If any Member of the Senate wishes to review the classified portions \nof the bill, they are available off the Senate floor.\n  Finally, Mr. President, there is a significant piece of legislation \nin this bill that is intended to go after foreign international drug \ntraffickers and those that support their illicit activities.\n  Title eight of this bill, the so-called ``Foreign Narcotics Kingpin \nDesignation Act,'' is modeled after the Executive Order that targets \nthe assets of named Colombian traffickers and those that assist them in \ntheir trafficking activities.\n  Mr. President, I support strongly efforts to target and destroy \nsignificant foreign drug trafficking organizations. I have placed \nsignificant emphasis on counter-narcotics in this and every \nIntelligence Authorization bill since I became Chairman of this \nCommittee. The record is clear.\n  The existing Colombian program has been highly successful. I would be \nthe first to support the President if he chose to expand the program in \na thoughtful and measured way. In fact, the Chief Executive already has \nthe constitutional and statutory authority to do so. The President does \nnot need this legislation to expand the scope of this program.\n  Accordingly, Mr. President, I, along with other Members of Congress, \nhave expressed concern with this legislation because it may have some \nvery serious unintended consequences for innocent American citizens.\n  Although the express language of the ``Kingpin'' legislation deals \nexclusively with foreign persons and entities, it will affect American \ncitizens. Lurking within the seemingly innocuous language is the real \npossibility of unwitting and innocent American citizens being caught up \nin its global net. For example, an American business owner may be a \njoint venture partner with a foreign company that has been designated \nas ``supporting'' the activities of a foreign narcotics trafficker. \nAlthough the American person may be completely unaware of the illicit \nactivities of their foreign partner, their own assets will also be \nblocked if they are jointly held.\n  The ``Kingpin'' legislation does not provide an opportunity for an \nAmerican person to seek judicial review of the blocking of their \njointly held assets. The result is that Americans may be deprived of \ntheir property without due process of law. Let me repeat that, Mr. \nPresident, Americans may be deprived of their property without due \nprocess of law.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the expansion of this successful \nprogram. I do not, however, support depriving innocent Americans of \ntheir fundamental right to due process.\n  Many attempts were made to amend the ``Kingpin'' legislation in \nconference to make it clear that American citizens have an immediate \navenue into Federal District Court should they be snared unjustifiably \nin this trap. Unfortunately, the sponsors and proponents of this bill \nin the House and Senate opposed any effort to clarify this fundamental \nAmerican right. In fact, I have been told that if we were to expressly \nstate that a United States citizen has the right to immediate judicial \nreview, this would, quote, gut the bill, unquote. I disagree.\n  Thomas Jefferson said that our ``Bill of Rights is what the people \nare entitled to against any government on earth . . . and what no just \ngovernment should refuse, or rest on inference.'' Mr. President, I also \nbelieve that our right to due process should not ``rest on inference,'' \nbut rather we should state it clearly and without equivocation. We do \nnot do that in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I fear that in our earnest to pass a ``tough drug \nbill'' we may have sacrificed part of our freedom. I applaud the \nsponsors and proponents of this bill for their dedication to protecting \nour shores from the scourge of illegal drugs. I caution them, however, \nthat their enthusiasm may be dampened as the true implications of this \nlegislation become known.\n  Notwithstanding my concerns, I am encouraged that the conferees did \nagree to include a provision in the so-called ``Kingpin'' legislation \nthat creates a panel to study whether these\n\n[[Page S14949]]\n\nkinds of sanction regimes affect U.S. persons doing legitimate business \nwith foreign partners, and whether there are adequate and fair remedies \nfor honest U.S. persons.\n  I commend my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, for suggesting \nthis study and also for other areas of leadership on which I have \nworked with the Senator during my tenure on the Intelligence Committee. \nHe will be leaving the Intelligence Committee at the end of this year \nwhenever his term is up, and we will miss him because he has certainly \nbeen a friend, but he has also been a leader to put America's national \nsecurity first and foremost everywhere it comes up.\n  In my opinion, we have put the cart squarely before the horse dealing \nwith due process. I am confident that such a panel as I alluded to \nearlier will confirm my concerns and the concerns of others and make \nsubstantive recommendations that my well-meaning colleagues will \nultimately acknowledge and I hope will be able to accept.\n  The conference committee worked closely together in a bipartisan \nfashion to produce the comprehensive intelligence authorization act. I \nurge my colleagues to support its adoption.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would like to recognize \nand thank Senator Shelby and Senator Kerrey for their leadership and \nsupport with regard to the POW/MIA sections of the Intelligence \nAuthorization Act that originally passed the full Senate earlier this \nyear. I am pleased that one of these sections has remained largely \nintact in the conference report we are now adopting. That provision \n(Section 308), will require a declassification review of two \nassessments of Vietnam's cooperation on the POW/MIA issue which were \nconducted in 1998. One of these assessments was prepared by my office \nand the other by the National Intelligence Council. Much of the \ninformation in both of these documents does not require continued \nclassification, and I believe the interests of the POW/MIA families and \nour nation's veterans is best served by having as much information as \npossible in the public domain concerning Vietnam's performance on the \nPOW/MIA question. As the Chairman will recall, there is a provision in \nSection 308 that allows the Director of Central Intelligence to \nwithhold from declassification the names of living foreign individuals \nwho have cooperated with U.S. efforts to account for missing personnel \nfrom the Vietnam War. I wish to make clear that the Congressional \nintent with respect to this provision was related to individuals \nidentified in the National Intelligence Estimate as ``cooperative'' \nwith U.S. officials in Hanoi. Indeed, this specific area of concern was \ncited by the Director of Central Intelligence in a letter to the Senate \non August 3, 1998. However, this is not meant to include information \npertaining to the two former Vietnamese officials who are alleged to \nhave prepared the so-called ``1205'' and ``735'' documents which we \nreceived through the Russian government which were reviewed in both of \nthe above-referenced assessments. Is that the Chairman's understanding \nas well?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes it is.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Chairman for that \nclarification.\n  Mr. President, I also want to take this opportunity to express by \nprofound disappointment that the other section concerning release of \nPOW/MIA information to the Congress was not adopted by the Conference \nbecause of Member opposition from the House Permanent Select Committee \non Intelligence. This provision, previously adopted by the full Senate \nthis summer with the support of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence, required our intelligence \nagencies to provide to Congress, within 120 days, a list of POW-MIA \nrelated documents that are still classified. This list would help the \nCongress exercise oversight on the POW/MIA issue on behalf of the \nfamilies of missing personnel and our nation's veterans. I fail to see \nwhy such a reasonable provision could not have been adopted with the \nfull support of the Conference. I plan to revisit this matter in the \ncoming months, and would appreciate having the Chairman's views as to \nhow we might proceed with respect to this important matter.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I share the disappointment expressed by my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from New Hampshire. As he knows, I have worked steadily \nwith him over the past several years to address his well-founded \nconcerns with respect to the way the POW/MIA issue has been addressed \nby our Intelligence Community. I agree that the provision to which he \nrefers would help us with our oversight responsibilities. That is why I \nsupported his amendment, as did my Vice-Chairman, when our intelligence \nbill passed the full Senate earlier this year. I want the Senator to \nknow that I will work closely with him over the next few months to find \na way to get the listing of POW/MIA reports he seeks provided to the \nSenate. He has a right to review these reports, as does every Member of \nthe Senate. I would urge the Director of Central Intelligence and heads \nof each of our intelligence agencies to work cooperatively with the \nSelect Committee on Intelligence on this matter. I also want the \nSenator to know that I will include his provision in next year's \nauthorization measure if the information he seeks is not provided to \nthe Senate in the next few months. I thank him for his leadership on \nthis important matter.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank my distinguished colleague for \nthat clarification and for his continued support on the POW/MIA issue.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, following my \nremarks, an editorial which appeared recently in the New York Times \ndealing with drug kingpin legislation, and specifically the due process \nproblem I raised, be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                         Carried Away by Drugs\n\n       The target of a new anti-drug initiative now speeding \n     toward final congressional approval is a worthy one--big \n     international drug traffickers. But as too often happens when \n     Congress collaborates with the Clinton administration to \n     toughen law enforcement policies, civil liberties stand to \n     suffer.\n       The measure, called the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin \n     Designation Act, over-whelmingly passed the House two weeks \n     ago. A House-Senate conference committee incorporated the \n     measure in the annual intelligence authorization bill that \n     needs only a final floor vote in the Senate before going to \n     the president's desk for his signature. All of this occurred \n     without any public hearings or extended debate to explore the \n     legislation's implications for due process and other \n     constitutional values.\n       Under the measure, the government will be required to \n     compile an annual list of those it determines to be \n     ``significant foreign narcotics traffickers'' under standards \n     that the bill does not articulate. The government would then \n     have authority to freeze their assets in the United State \n     without any chance for judicial review of the basis of the \n     designation.\n       Americans who engage in financial dealings with a person or \n     company on the list could have their assets blocked, again \n     without the benefit of full judicial review. The measure \n     makes no exception for those investors or partners who \n     thought they were dealing with legitimate businesses.\n       ``Is this the America we want?'' asked Representative \n     Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, as he waged a lonely \n     and futile fight against the bill in the House. ``What is the \n     remedy if the bureaucracy gets the wrong person?'' Those \n     pertinent questions were sadly lost in the rush to crack down \n     on foreign drug lords before Congress adjourns.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to join Chairman Shelby in urging \nmy colleagues to vote in favor of the intelligence authorization \nconference report. This report is a culmination of the lengthy effort \nto fund intelligence activities for fiscal year 2000. It has not been \neasy to arrive at this point because the committee had to address many \nsignificant nonintelligence issues ranging from the reorganization of \nthe Department of Energy to the establishment of procedures for \nblocking the assets of drug kingpins. We have arrived at this point \nbecause we have reached several important compromises with our House \ncolleagues, and the report deserves the Senate's full support.\n  This conference report supports many new initiatives. In my view, one \nof the most important new initiatives is to make the year 2000 a \nwatershed year for intelligence. The watershed represents a turnaround \nin spending on intelligence activities. I believe it is time to \nincrease spending because we now have a much better understanding\n\n[[Page S14950]]\n\nof the threats facing the United States of America and the important \nrole intelligence plays in meeting those threats.\n  One of the most difficult parts of my job as the Intelligence \nCommittee vice chairman has been to talk to people about the importance \nof intelligence. This job is difficult because most of the information \nis classified. Therefore, public debate on the condition of the \nintelligence community is extremely rare and discussing funding levels \nis almost impossible.\n  My colleagues are well aware that classified conference reports and \nthe classified schedules of authorizations are available for their \nreview in S. 407 but you have to go there to get the details. We cannot \ntalk about them now.\n  Let me say, however, intelligence is stretched very thin. Our global \nreach is supported by intelligence as global coverage. Without adequate \ncoverage, we make policy mistakes. The Intelligence Community is \nstretched thin in trying to meet all of its commitments to policy \nmakers. But I can't tell you on the floor of the Senate how thin it is \nstretched, and I can't tell you how much it's going to cost to fix. I \ncan only tell you I'm glad fiscal year 2000 is a watershed year for \nintelligence.\n\n  A second initiative this bill supports is striking the balance \nbetween intelligence collection and the subsequent exploitation and \ndissemination of the information collected. My colleagues should know \nthat one of the problems of insufficient funding is that the \nIntelligence Community is unable properly to exploit and disseminate \nall of the information it gathers. If you think about it, this may seem \nodd. That is, the Community is collecting more information than it is \nable to analyze and deliver to its customers. But it is not odd. Among \nother things, it reflects constrained Intelligence budgets. As the \nCommunity has moved into advanced technologies, it has invested in the \nfuture by developing new intelligence collection systems. The idea was \nthat by the time these new systems were ready to be used, we would have \nbeen able to find the funding to exploit and disseminate the \ninformation being collected. Well the future is now, and we haven't \nbeen able to find the funding to balance collection, exploitation, and \ndissemination. In this bill we have confronted the issue and proposed \nimportant solutions. Again, I urge my colleagues to read the classified \nreport in S-407 in order to get the details.\n  Another important provision in this bill is the creation of a \nNational Commission for the review of the National Reconnaissance \nOffice. Mr. President, the NRO is a national treasure. They acquire and \noperate the nation's space reconnaissance satellites--the so-called spy \nsatellites. They have a long and proud history of being on the leading \nedge of technology so that our nation's leaders could be better \ninformed about our adversaries. We all got a glimpse at their \nextraordinary abilities when the Corona spy satellite imagery was \nreleased to the public. It is literally an eye-opening experience to be \nable to see now what our President was able to see years ago about the \nSoviet Union during the height of the Cold War. This is the type of \neffort we have come to expect from NRO.\n  But the NRO has come under public attack in the recent past. \nUnfavorable news accounts have caused some to be unsure about the NRO \nand the path it is following. Others have questioned whether the NRO \nshould remain an agency resting somewhere between the authorities of \nthe Director of Central Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense. \nMoreover, the end of the Cold War has altered forever the nature of the \nthreats we face. New threats mean a changed emphasis for intelligence. \nFurthermore, the explosion of information technology has created new \nopportunities for the collection and the delivery of intelligence. \nThus, the Conferees decided there is a need to evaluate the NRO's roles \nand missions, organizational structure, technical skills, contractor \nrelationships, uses of commercial satellite imagery, acquisition \nauthorities, and its relationships to other agencies and departments of \nthe Federal Government in order to assure continuing success in \nsatellite reconnaissance. I look forward to the Commission's work.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to comment briefly on the \n``Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act'' contained in the \nconference report. This is a significant piece of legislation intended \nto attack drug traffickers at the heart by blocking all of their assets \neither within the United States or that are under U.S. control. It \nestablishes a procedure for the President of the United States to \npublicly identify drug kingpins and to block the kingpin's assets. As \nmy colleagues may recall, a similar provision sponsored by Senators \nCoverdell and Feinstein was accepted as an amendment to the \nIntelligence Authorization Bill during floor action.\n  As I mentioned at the beginning of my statement, this provision has \nmade the Intelligence Conference extremely interesting. Several of us \njoined the Chairman in being concerned about the right of judicial \nreview for U.S. persons whose assets could be seized as a result of \nbeing involved in a joint venture with someone later identified as a \ndrug kingpin. This was a matter of debate during discussions leading to \nthe conference meeting and was addressed during the conference. The \nHouse Conferees argued strenuously for their vision of the legislation \nwhich passed the House by a vote of 385 to 26. Further, the \nAdministration supported the House version. Nonetheless, Chairman \nShelby and several of us remained concerned about due process being \nafforded to those who might unwittingly get caught up in the kingpin \ndesignation and subsequent blocking of assets.\n  The Conference agreed the concerns were of sufficient merit to \nwarrant the appointment of a special judicial review panel to evaluate \nthese concerns and report its findings. The commission is charged with \nthe responsibility of reviewing judicial, regulatory, and \nadministrative authorities relating to the blocking of assets. It also \nis to report on its evaluation of the remedies available to U.S. \npersons affected by the Government's blocking of assets of foreign \npersons. I believe their detailed and extended evaluation will provide \nthe Congress insights into both the complexities of the Drug Kingpin \nlegislation contained in the Intelligence Conference Report and the \nconsequences to American persons when the assets of foreign persons are \nblocked under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to note this is my last \nConference Report as the committee's Vice Chairman. My term on the \nCommittee expires toward the end of January 2000. I have had the \nprivilege of serving under highly distinguished Chairmen and Vice \nChairmen: David Boren, Frank Murkowski, Dennis DeConcini, John Warner, \nArlen Specter, and Richard Shelby. In every instance, I have \nexperienced a commitment to a bipartisan approach to intelligence.\n  Throughout my time on the Committee, the members always have treated \nintelligence activities and intelligence policy as serious issues \ndeserving their close attention. Because the issues have always been \ntreated very seriously, committee members have had disagreements. But, \nMr. President, in the end we always found a bipartisan answer to our \ndifferences. Bipartisanship has been a hallmark of the committee \nbecause intelligence is not a partisan issue. If it ever should become \na partisan issue, I believe we can look forward to a consequent \npoliticization of intelligence.\n  This can be very bad for Congress and even worse for the country.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Shelby for his leadership in delivering the \nconference report to the floor and for his commitment to finding \nbipartisan answers to some very complex questions. I look forward to \nthe opportunity in the future to speak more fully on the floor \nconcerning intelligence and its values.\n  Lastly, I call to my colleagues' attention and to the attention of \nthe American people that the intelligence community is full of highly \ndedicated men and women who are working under some of the most \ndifficult of circumstances. Their professionalism, their patriotism \nknows no bounds, and I salute them for their excellent work. Being the \ncommittee vice chairman has, indeed, been a great privilege.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S14951]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S14947-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14947-S14951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2000--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader I submit \na report of the committee of conference on the bill (H.R. 1555) to \nauthorize appropriations for fiscal year 2000 for intelligence and \nintelligence-related activities of the United States Government, the \nCommunity Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency \nRetirement and Disability System, and for other purposes, and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill, H.R. \n     1555, have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The Conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of November 5, 1999).\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 60 \nminutes for debate with the time divided as follows: Forty minutes \nequally divided between the chairman and vice chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee; 20 minutes under the control of Senator Levin.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the use or yielding \nback of time, which we anticipate, the conference report be agreed to, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any additional \nstatements relating to the conference report be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to ask that my colleagues \nsupport the conference report on the Intelligence Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2000.\n  I want to thank my colleagues in the House for their work on this \nlegislation and especially Chairman Goss and Ranking Member Dixon for \ntheir leadership in the conference.\n  I believe that the conference committee put together a solid package \nfor consideration by the full Senate that fairly represents the \nintelligence priorities set forth in both the Senate and House versions \nof the Intelligence Authorization Act.\n  I am pleased to report that the conference committee accomplished its \ntask in a bipartisan manner, and I want to thank my colleague from \nNebraska, Senator Kerrey, for working so closely with me to produce \nthis legislation.\n  I believe that the conference report embraces many of the key \nrecommendations that the Senate adopted in its version of the bill.\n  We recommended significant increases in funding for high-priority \nprojects aimed at better positioning the Intelligence Community for the \nthreats of the 21st century, while at the same time reducing funds for \nprograms and activities that were not adequately justified or \nredundant.\n  In so doing, we authorized a moderate increase in overall funding for \nintelligence programs above the President's request. This is a positive \nstep and I hope that next year the administration will follow our lead \nand begin to reinvest in our intelligence gathering capabilities.\n  The conference report includes key initiatives that I believe are \nvital for the future of our Intelligence Community.\n  These initiatives include:\n  1. bolstering advanced research and development across the Community, \nto facilitate, among other things, the modernization of NSA and CIA;\n\n[[Page S14948]]\n\n  2. strengthening efforts in counter-proliferation, counter-terrorism, \ncounter-narcotics, counter-intelligence, and effective covert action;\n  3. expanding the collection and exploitation of measurements and \nsignatures intelligence, especially ballistic missile intelligence;\n  4. boosting education, recruiting, and technical training for \nIntelligence Community personnel;\n  5. enhancing analytical capabilities;\n  6. streamlining dissemination of intelligence products;\n  7. developing our ability to process, exploit and disseminate \ncommercial imagery; and\n  8. providing new tools for information operations.\n  I believe that the conferees have provided the funds and guidance \nnecessary to ensure that military commanders and national policymakers \ncontinue to receive timely, accurate information on threats to our \nsecurity.\n  At the same time, we have found some critical areas within the \nCommunity that are in need of major improvements.\n  In the Senate, we had a distinguished panel of Americans with a broad \nrange of expertise--our Technical Advisory Group--that took a look at \nsome key areas within the Intelligence Community and brought forward \nsome very important recommendations.\n  We thank all the members of the Technical Advisory Group for their \ntime and efforts.\n  I will briefly summarize some of their findings, to the extent that I \ncan in open session, along with some of the other findings of our \nconference.\n  First, our ability to collect and analyze information on the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction requires renewed emphasis \nand innovative thinking.\n  As our potential enemies seek out the ability to produce chemical, \nbiological, and nuclear weapons, we must develop the ability to detect \nthese efforts.\n  This bill places a great deal of emphasis on our ability to collect \nsuch information known as Measurements and Signatures Intelligence or \nMASINT.\n  Second, both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees agree that \nour Intelligence Community and our Defense Department must move quickly \nto address what our Technical Advisory Group identifies as a critical \nshortfall in our ability to properly task, process, exploit, and \ndisseminate intelligence information collection by our airborne and \noverhead imagery assets.\n  As we modernize our Imagery Intelligence or IMINT architecture, the \nIntelligence and Armed Services Committees agree that we should not be \nspending the taxpayers money on collection architectures that we may \nnot be able to utilize fully.\n  Third, we have once again placed strong emphasis on recapitalizing \nthe National Security Agency's information technology infrastructure.\n  As we demand more from our Intelligence Community in a number of \nareas, we also demand fiscal responsibility. The conference report \nincludes a number of reductions to programs that were not adequately \njustified or were redundant with other elements within the Intelligence \nCommunity.\n  The legislation contains some important new authorities for the \nIntelligence Community. I'll mention some of the highlights:\n  First, there are new protections for the identities of former covert \nagents and for the operational files of the National Imagery and \nMapping Agency or ``NIMA.''\n  Second, there are new counterintelligence authorities--these include \nprovisions allowing access to government computers used in classified \nwork by executive branch employees. Also, there are new requirements \nfor the FBI to begin its consultation with agencies that they are \ninvestigating at a far earlier stage than before.\n  Third, we have established a commission to study the role and \nmissions of the National Reconnaissance Office or ``NRO.'' This \ncommission will look at the NRO from top to bottom--its findings and \nrecommendations to us and the Senate Armed Services Committee will \nserve to guide our committees on the future funding and operations of \nthe NRO.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee to ensure that the best candidates are \nselected for membership on this very important commission.\n  If any Member of the Senate wishes to review the classified portions \nof the bill, they are available off the Senate floor.\n  Finally, Mr. President, there is a significant piece of legislation \nin this bill that is intended to go after foreign international drug \ntraffickers and those that support their illicit activities.\n  Title eight of this bill, the so-called ``Foreign Narcotics Kingpin \nDesignation Act,'' is modeled after the Executive Order that targets \nthe assets of named Colombian traffickers and those that assist them in \ntheir trafficking activities.\n  Mr. President, I support strongly efforts to target and destroy \nsignificant foreign drug trafficking organizations. I have placed \nsignificant emphasis on counter-narcotics in this and every \nIntelligence Authorization bill since I became Chairman of this \nCommittee. The record is clear.\n  The existing Colombian program has been highly successful. I would be \nthe first to support the President if he chose to expand the program in \na thoughtful and measured way. In fact, the Chief Executive already has \nthe constitutional and statutory authority to do so. The President does \nnot need this legislation to expand the scope of this program.\n  Accordingly, Mr. President, I, along with other Members of Congress, \nhave expressed concern with this legislation because it may have some \nvery serious unintended consequences for innocent American citizens.\n  Although the express language of the ``Kingpin'' legislation deals \nexclusively with foreign persons and entities, it will affect American \ncitizens. Lurking within the seemingly innocuous language is the real \npossibility of unwitting and innocent American citizens being caught up \nin its global net. For example, an American business owner may be a \njoint venture partner with a foreign company that has been designated \nas ``supporting'' the activities of a foreign narcotics trafficker. \nAlthough the American person may be completely unaware of the illicit \nactivities of their foreign partner, their own assets will also be \nblocked if they are jointly held.\n  The ``Kingpin'' legislation does not provide an opportunity for an \nAmerican person to seek judicial review of the blocking of their \njointly held assets. The result is that Americans may be deprived of \ntheir property without due process of law. Let me repeat that, Mr. \nPresident, Americans may be deprived of their property without due \nprocess of law.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the expansion of this successful \nprogram. I do not, however, support depriving innocent Americans of \ntheir fundamental right to due process.\n  Many attempts were made to amend the ``Kingpin'' legislation in \nconference to make it clear that American citizens have an immediate \navenue into Federal District Court should they be snared unjustifiably \nin this trap. Unfortunately, the sponsors and proponents of this bill \nin the House and Senate opposed any effort to clarify this fundamental \nAmerican right. In fact, I have been told that if we were to expressly \nstate that a United States citizen has the right to immediate judicial \nreview, this would, quote, gut the bill, unquote. I disagree.\n  Thomas Jefferson said that our ``Bill of Rights is what the people \nare entitled to against any government on earth . . . and what no just \ngovernment should refuse, or rest on inference.'' Mr. President, I also \nbelieve that our right to due process should not ``rest on inference,'' \nbut rather we should state it clearly and without equivocation. We do \nnot do that in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I fear that in our earnest to pass a ``tough drug \nbill'' we may have sacrificed part of our freedom. I applaud the \nsponsors and proponents of this bill for their dedication to protecting \nour shores from the scourge of illegal drugs. I caution them, however, \nthat their enthusiasm may be dampened as the true implications of this \nlegislation become known.\n  Notwithstanding my concerns, I am encouraged that the conferees did \nagree to include a provision in the so-called ``Kingpin'' legislation \nthat creates a panel to study whether these\n\n[[Page S14949]]\n\nkinds of sanction regimes affect U.S. persons doing legitimate business \nwith foreign partners, and whether there are adequate and fair remedies \nfor honest U.S. persons.\n  I commend my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, for suggesting \nthis study and also for other areas of leadership on which I have \nworked with the Senator during my tenure on the Intelligence Committee. \nHe will be leaving the Intelligence Committee at the end of this year \nwhenever his term is up, and we will miss him because he has certainly \nbeen a friend, but he has also been a leader to put America's national \nsecurity first and foremost everywhere it comes up.\n  In my opinion, we have put the cart squarely before the horse dealing \nwith due process. I am confident that such a panel as I alluded to \nearlier will confirm my concerns and the concerns of others and make \nsubstantive recommendations that my well-meaning colleagues will \nultimately acknowledge and I hope will be able to accept.\n  The conference committee worked closely together in a bipartisan \nfashion to produce the comprehensive intelligence authorization act. I \nurge my colleagues to support its adoption.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would like to recognize \nand thank Senator Shelby and Senator Kerrey for their leadership and \nsupport with regard to the POW/MIA sections of the Intelligence \nAuthorization Act that originally passed the full Senate earlier this \nyear. I am pleased that one of these sections has remained largely \nintact in the conference report we are now adopting. That provision \n(Section 308), will require a declassification review of two \nassessments of Vietnam's cooperation on the POW/MIA issue which were \nconducted in 1998. One of these assessments was prepared by my office \nand the other by the National Intelligence Council. Much of the \ninformation in both of these documents does not require continued \nclassification, and I believe the interests of the POW/MIA families and \nour nation's veterans is best served by having as much information as \npossible in the public domain concerning Vietnam's performance on the \nPOW/MIA question. As the Chairman will recall, there is a provision in \nSection 308 that allows the Director of Central Intelligence to \nwithhold from declassification the names of living foreign individuals \nwho have cooperated with U.S. efforts to account for missing personnel \nfrom the Vietnam War. I wish to make clear that the Congressional \nintent with respect to this provision was related to individuals \nidentified in the National Intelligence Estimate as ``cooperative'' \nwith U.S. officials in Hanoi. Indeed, this specific area of concern was \ncited by the Director of Central Intelligence in a letter to the Senate \non August 3, 1998. However, this is not meant to include information \npertaining to the two former Vietnamese officials who are alleged to \nhave prepared the so-called ``1205'' and ``735'' documents which we \nreceived through the Russian government which were reviewed in both of \nthe above-referenced assessments. Is that the Chairman's understanding \nas well?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes it is.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Chairman for that \nclarification.\n  Mr. President, I also want to take this opportunity to express by \nprofound disappointment that the other section concerning release of \nPOW/MIA information to the Congress was not adopted by the Conference \nbecause of Member opposition from the House Permanent Select Committee \non Intelligence. This provision, previously adopted by the full Senate \nthis summer with the support of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence, required our intelligence \nagencies to provide to Congress, within 120 days, a list of POW-MIA \nrelated documents that are still classified. This list would help the \nCongress exercise oversight on the POW/MIA issue on behalf of the \nfamilies of missing personnel and our nation's veterans. I fail to see \nwhy such a reasonable provision could not have been adopted with the \nfull support of the Conference. I plan to revisit this matter in the \ncoming months, and would appreciate having the Chairman's views as to \nhow we might proceed with respect to this important matter.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I share the disappointment expressed by my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from New Hampshire. As he knows, I have worked steadily \nwith him over the past several years to address his well-founded \nconcerns with respect to the way the POW/MIA issue has been addressed \nby our Intelligence Community. I agree that the provision to which he \nrefers would help us with our oversight responsibilities. That is why I \nsupported his amendment, as did my Vice-Chairman, when our intelligence \nbill passed the full Senate earlier this year. I want the Senator to \nknow that I will work closely with him over the next few months to find \na way to get the listing of POW/MIA reports he seeks provided to the \nSenate. He has a right to review these reports, as does every Member of \nthe Senate. I would urge the Director of Central Intelligence and heads \nof each of our intelligence agencies to work cooperatively with the \nSelect Committee on Intelligence on this matter. I also want the \nSenator to know that I will include his provision in next year's \nauthorization measure if the information he seeks is not provided to \nthe Senate in the next few months. I thank him for his leadership on \nthis important matter.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank my distinguished colleague for \nthat clarification and for his continued support on the POW/MIA issue.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, following my \nremarks, an editorial which appeared recently in the New York Times \ndealing with drug kingpin legislation, and specifically the due process \nproblem I raised, be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                         Carried Away by Drugs\n\n       The target of a new anti-drug initiative now speeding \n     toward final congressional approval is a worthy one--big \n     international drug traffickers. But as too often happens when \n     Congress collaborates with the Clinton administration to \n     toughen law enforcement policies, civil liberties stand to \n     suffer.\n       The measure, called the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin \n     Designation Act, over-whelmingly passed the House two weeks \n     ago. A House-Senate conference committee incorporated the \n     measure in the annual intelligence authorization bill that \n     needs only a final floor vote in the Senate before going to \n     the president's desk for his signature. All of this occurred \n     without any public hearings or extended debate to explore the \n     legislation's implications for due process and other \n     constitutional values.\n       Under the measure, the government will be required to \n     compile an annual list of those it determines to be \n     ``significant foreign narcotics traffickers'' under standards \n     that the bill does not articulate. The government would then \n     have authority to freeze their assets in the United State \n     without any chance for judicial review of the basis of the \n     designation.\n       Americans who engage in financial dealings with a person or \n     company on the list could have their assets blocked, again \n     without the benefit of full judicial review. The measure \n     makes no exception for those investors or partners who \n     thought they were dealing with legitimate businesses.\n       ``Is this the America we want?'' asked Representative \n     Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, as he waged a lonely \n     and futile fight against the bill in the House. ``What is the \n     remedy if the bureaucracy gets the wrong person?'' Those \n     pertinent questions were sadly lost in the rush to crack down \n     on foreign drug lords before Congress adjourns.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to join Chairman Shelby in urging \nmy colleagues to vote in favor of the intelligence authorization \nconference report. This report is a culmination of the lengthy effort \nto fund intelligence activities for fiscal year 2000. It has not been \neasy to arrive at this point because the committee had to address many \nsignificant nonintelligence issues ranging from the reorganization of \nthe Department of Energy to the establishment of procedures for \nblocking the assets of drug kingpins. We have arrived at this point \nbecause we have reached several important compromises with our House \ncolleagues, and the report deserves the Senate's full support.\n  This conference report supports many new initiatives. In my view, one \nof the most important new initiatives is to make the year 2000 a \nwatershed year for intelligence. The watershed represents a turnaround \nin spending on intelligence activities. I believe it is time to \nincrease spending because we now have a much better understanding\n\n[[Page S14950]]\n\nof the threats facing the United States of America and the important \nrole intelligence plays in meeting those threats.\n  One of the most difficult parts of my job as the Intelligence \nCommittee vice chairman has been to talk to people about the importance \nof intelligence. This job is difficult because most of the information \nis classified. Therefore, public debate on the condition of the \nintelligence community is extremely rare and discussing funding levels \nis almost impossible.\n  My colleagues are well aware that classified conference reports and \nthe classified schedules of authorizations are available for their \nreview in S. 407 but you have to go there to get the details. We cannot \ntalk about them now.\n  Let me say, however, intelligence is stretched very thin. Our global \nreach is supported by intelligence as global coverage. Without adequate \ncoverage, we make policy mistakes. The Intelligence Community is \nstretched thin in trying to meet all of its commitments to policy \nmakers. But I can't tell you on the floor of the Senate how thin it is \nstretched, and I can't tell you how much it's going to cost to fix. I \ncan only tell you I'm glad fiscal year 2000 is a watershed year for \nintelligence.\n\n  A second initiative this bill supports is striking the balance \nbetween intelligence collection and the subsequent exploitation and \ndissemination of the information collected. My colleagues should know \nthat one of the problems of insufficient funding is that the \nIntelligence Community is unable properly to exploit and disseminate \nall of the information it gathers. If you think about it, this may seem \nodd. That is, the Community is collecting more information than it is \nable to analyze and deliver to its customers. But it is not odd. Among \nother things, it reflects constrained Intelligence budgets. As the \nCommunity has moved into advanced technologies, it has invested in the \nfuture by developing new intelligence collection systems. The idea was \nthat by the time these new systems were ready to be used, we would have \nbeen able to find the funding to exploit and disseminate the \ninformation being collected. Well the future is now, and we haven't \nbeen able to find the funding to balance collection, exploitation, and \ndissemination. In this bill we have confronted the issue and proposed \nimportant solutions. Again, I urge my colleagues to read the classified \nreport in S-407 in order to get the details.\n  Another important provision in this bill is the creation of a \nNational Commission for the review of the National Reconnaissance \nOffice. Mr. President, the NRO is a national treasure. They acquire and \noperate the nation's space reconnaissance satellites--the so-called spy \nsatellites. They have a long and proud history of being on the leading \nedge of technology so that our nation's leaders could be better \ninformed about our adversaries. We all got a glimpse at their \nextraordinary abilities when the Corona spy satellite imagery was \nreleased to the public. It is literally an eye-opening experience to be \nable to see now what our President was able to see years ago about the \nSoviet Union during the height of the Cold War. This is the type of \neffort we have come to expect from NRO.\n  But the NRO has come under public attack in the recent past. \nUnfavorable news accounts have caused some to be unsure about the NRO \nand the path it is following. Others have questioned whether the NRO \nshould remain an agency resting somewhere between the authorities of \nthe Director of Central Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense. \nMoreover, the end of the Cold War has altered forever the nature of the \nthreats we face. New threats mean a changed emphasis for intelligence. \nFurthermore, the explosion of information technology has created new \nopportunities for the collection and the delivery of intelligence. \nThus, the Conferees decided there is a need to evaluate the NRO's roles \nand missions, organizational structure, technical skills, contractor \nrelationships, uses of commercial satellite imagery, acquisition \nauthorities, and its relationships to other agencies and departments of \nthe Federal Government in order to assure continuing success in \nsatellite reconnaissance. I look forward to the Commission's work.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to comment briefly on the \n``Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act'' contained in the \nconference report. This is a significant piece of legislation intended \nto attack drug traffickers at the heart by blocking all of their assets \neither within the United States or that are under U.S. control. It \nestablishes a procedure for the President of the United States to \npublicly identify drug kingpins and to block the kingpin's assets. As \nmy colleagues may recall, a similar provision sponsored by Senators \nCoverdell and Feinstein was accepted as an amendment to the \nIntelligence Authorization Bill during floor action.\n  As I mentioned at the beginning of my statement, this provision has \nmade the Intelligence Conference extremely interesting. Several of us \njoined the Chairman in being concerned about the right of judicial \nreview for U.S. persons whose assets could be seized as a result of \nbeing involved in a joint venture with someone later identified as a \ndrug kingpin. This was a matter of debate during discussions leading to \nthe conference meeting and was addressed during the conference. The \nHouse Conferees argued strenuously for their vision of the legislation \nwhich passed the House by a vote of 385 to 26. Further, the \nAdministration supported the House version. Nonetheless, Chairman \nShelby and several of us remained concerned about due process being \nafforded to those who might unwittingly get caught up in the kingpin \ndesignation and subsequent blocking of assets.\n  The Conference agreed the concerns were of sufficient merit to \nwarrant the appointment of a special judicial review panel to evaluate \nthese concerns and report its findings. The commission is charged with \nthe responsibility of reviewing judicial, regulatory, and \nadministrative authorities relating to the blocking of assets. It also \nis to report on its evaluation of the remedies available to U.S. \npersons affected by the Government's blocking of assets of foreign \npersons. I believe their detailed and extended evaluation will provide \nthe Congress insights into both the complexities of the Drug Kingpin \nlegislation contained in the Intelligence Conference Report and the \nconsequences to American persons when the assets of foreign persons are \nblocked under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to note this is my last \nConference Report as the committee's Vice Chairman. My term on the \nCommittee expires toward the end of January 2000. I have had the \nprivilege of serving under highly distinguished Chairmen and Vice \nChairmen: David Boren, Frank Murkowski, Dennis DeConcini, John Warner, \nArlen Specter, and Richard Shelby. In every instance, I have \nexperienced a commitment to a bipartisan approach to intelligence.\n  Throughout my time on the Committee, the members always have treated \nintelligence activities and intelligence policy as serious issues \ndeserving their close attention. Because the issues have always been \ntreated very seriously, committee members have had disagreements. But, \nMr. President, in the end we always found a bipartisan answer to our \ndifferences. Bipartisanship has been a hallmark of the committee \nbecause intelligence is not a partisan issue. If it ever should become \na partisan issue, I believe we can look forward to a consequent \npoliticization of intelligence.\n  This can be very bad for Congress and even worse for the country.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Shelby for his leadership in delivering the \nconference report to the floor and for his commitment to finding \nbipartisan answers to some very complex questions. I look forward to \nthe opportunity in the future to speak more fully on the floor \nconcerning intelligence and its values.\n  Lastly, I call to my colleagues' attention and to the attention of \nthe American people that the intelligence community is full of highly \ndedicated men and women who are working under some of the most \ndifficult of circumstances. Their professionalism, their patriotism \nknows no bounds, and I salute them for their excellent work. Being the \ncommittee vice chairman has, indeed, been a great privilege.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S14951]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S14951-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 1180\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

In light of this agreement, there will be three back-to-\nback votes that will occur a few minutes before 5 o'clock this \nafternoon, the first being the cloture vote relative to the \nappropriations conference report, the second being passage of the \nappropriations conference report, and the third being passage of the \nWork Incentives conference report.\n  There are two very important colloquies we must have this afternoon \nbefore the votes, one with regard to understandings with regard to the \nWork Incentives bill and another colloquy we will have with the \nleadership on the Democratic side, and I will participate in, along \nwith Senator Lugar and others, to discuss the overall dairy situation. \nWe will fulfill that commitment.\n  I thank Senator Daschle, Senator Kohl, Senator Feingold, and \neverybody who has been involved.

I might also say, I heard the distinguished Chair talk \nabout the service provided to this committee and to the Senate by the \ndistinguished ranking member, the Senator from Nebraska. I will make a \nfull statement at a later time, but let me say for the record now, no \none has served this committee, this caucus, and this Senate more \neffectively, taking his intelligence responsibility more seriously, \nthan the distinguished Senator from Nebraska. He has been an \nextraordinary leader, an extraordinary Member, and one who has taken \nhis responsibilities on this committee as seriously as anybody has to \ndate.\n  He departs with the actions taken today. He will leave the committee \nas a result of the statute requiring a certain limit of time for each \nSenator. I know I speak for all Senators in expressing our gratitude to \nhim and our admiration for a job very well done, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I may take a moment of my leader time to \njoin Senator Daschle in those remarks.\n  This is a very important committee. It is a committee that operates \nin the best tradition of total bipartisanship, nonpartisanship. \nChairman Shelby has been doing an outstanding job. It really makes the \nleaders feel good when we see two Senators of two parties work together \nfor our national interests and our intelligence community. Senator \nKerrey certainly has been just outstanding, the way he has handled that \njob. He has been cooperative, nonpartisan.\n  These two Senators, Senator Shelby and Senator Kerrey, have worked \ntogether the way it is supposed to be done. I hope your successors will \nonly do as well. I thank you for your service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank both leaders for their kind remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I start by thanking the Senator from \nNebraska for the extraordinary service he has rendered to the \nIntelligence Committee. I have served with him on that committee for a \nvery short period of time, but I have seen the way he, working with \nSenator Shelby, has been able to bring bipartisan leadership to this \ncommittee that is so essential for the working of this committee.\n  I say to our colleagues--I know Senator Shelby has and as I know \nevery member of the committee feels--Senator Kerrey has made a unique \nand extraordinary contribution to the committee. He has attempted to \nstrengthen the intelligence community every step of the way. He has \ndone so in a bipartisan way. I commend him on his service. I know he is \nbeing rotated out of the committee, but that is what our rules provide. \nHe will be missed.\n  The conference report to H.R. 1555, the Fiscal Year 2000 Intelligence \nAuthorization Act, includes legislation under title 8 entitled \n``Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act.''\n  Title 8 is intended to strengthen the Government's efforts to \nidentify the assets, financial networks, and business associates of \nmajor foreign narcotics trafficking groups in an effort to disrupt \nthese criminal organizations and bankrupt their leadership. I think all \nSenators agree with that laudable goal of combating the insidious \neffects of drug trafficking. In fact, an earlier version of this \nlegislation was seen as being so without controversy that it was added \nby the Senate to the intelligence authorization bill in July of this \nyear with little debate and on a voice vote.\n  Senators should be aware, however, that title 8, as it is now \nwritten, does have a significant national security, law enforcement, \njudicial, and drug trafficking implication that belie the legislation's \nsimple design and are somewhat different from the original amendment \nthat was offered, I believe, by Senator Coverdell and by Senator \nFeinstein.\n  I am not aware, however, despite the implications of this new \nlanguage added in conference, of any committee of jurisdiction in \neither the Senate or the House having held a single hearing on the \nprovision contained in title 8. The Senate Intelligence Committee has \nnot had a hearing on title 8. The Senate Judiciary Committee has not \nhad a hearing. Not a single legal or national security expert inside or \noutside of Government has testified before a congressional hearing as \nto whether title 8 should or should not become law, and if it does, how \nthe legal rights of Americans might be changed as a result.\n  Except for the recent and very perfunctory House of Representatives \ndebate and vote on this provision, the only public debate on the \ncomplexities of title 8 has occurred in the press. The way the issue \nhas been characterized in press reports erroneously suggest that if you \nare ready to sign up to title 8 as now set forth after this conference \ncommittee in H.R. 1555, then you are being tough on foreign drug \ntraffickers. If, however, you are troubled by the effect that the title \n8 language would have on currently existing due process protections \nafforded innocent Americans, you are described by some in the press as \ndoing the bidding of narcolobbyists.\n  This simplistic characterization is not only false, it is an insult \nto Members of this body, and it obscures a vitally important civil \nliberties issue which is at the core of title 8, which is the rights of \ninnocent American citizens to challenge in our courts the taking of \ntheir property.\n\n  As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I was a conferee. I did \nnot sign the conference report accompanying the bill because of the \ncontradiction existing between the stated legislative intent of title 8 \nand the actual language contained in the bill, a contradiction which I \nattempted but failed in conference to correct by amendment.\n\n[[Page S14952]]\n\n  Specifically, my objection is that title 8, as presently written, \nwould undermine the due process protections now afforded a U.S. citizen \nor business that has interests or assets blocked under title 8 to \nchallenge the legality of the blocking under the Administrative \nProcedures Act.\n  This is what the conference report before us says about title 8:\n\n       There is no intention that this legislation affect \n     Americans who are not knowingly and willfully engaged in \n     international narcotics trafficking, nor is it intended in \n     any way to derogate from existing constitutional and \n     statutory due process protections for those whose assets are \n     blocked or seized pursuant to law.\n\n  That is the stated intent. That is well and good, and I commend the \nauthors on that intent. The problem is that the words of the bill \nbefore us do not, I am afraid, comport with that stated intention.\n  According to the Department of Treasury, which is tasked in title 8 \nwith developing the list of significant foreign narcotics traffickers, \ndue process protections exist in law today for those U.S. citizens to \nchallenge the legality of the blocking of assets in court.\n  On November 8, I wrote a letter to the Secretary of Treasury Lawrence \nSummers requesting an opinion on two legal questions concerning title \n8. The first question was the following:\n\n       What existing constitutional and statutory due process \n     protections would allow an American citizen who has an \n     interest blocked by executive branch action to challenge the \n     blocking?\n\n  Question 2 was:\n\n       If H.R. 1555 is enacted into law, how would these existing \n     constitutional and statutory due process protections be \n     changed?\n\n  In his November 10 reply to me, Richard Newcomb, who is Director of \nthe Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, stated the \nfollowing with regard to currently existing judicial review of the \nblocking of American assets:\n\n       The Administrative Procedures Act, or the APA, provides for \n     judicial review of final agency action.\n\n  Mr. President, 5 U.S. Code 702 is the citation.\n\n       In existing sanctions programs administered by the Office \n     of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the final agency action \n     related to blocking are subject to challenge by affected \n     parties through judicial review afforded by the \n     Administrative Procedures Act.\n\n  Then they go on to say:\n\n       Because of normal rules of standing and other \n     jurisdictional principles, a U.S. citizen may, in many cases, \n     not be able directly to challenge the blocking of a foreign \n     person's assets pursuant to APA. However----\n\n  However, and this is the key line----\n\n     as discussed below, agency review by OFAC, followed by \n     judicial review under APA of any resulting final agency \n     action as to that citizen may still be available. In addition \n     to any statutory review available under the APA, a U.S. \n     citizen may also seek judicial review of constitutional \n     claims or challenges related to blockings under existing OFAC \n     sanctions programs.\n\n  Under the process that is currently in place, OFAC determines who is \na foreign drug kingpin after an internal Department of Treasury review \nof the evidence and evidentiary review that is coordinated with the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Under Executive Order 12978 issued in 1995, the State Department and \nJustice Department are required to be consulted by Treasury prior to \nthat designation and prior to the blocking of assets. After designation \nis made and assets are blocked, OFAC regulations allow for a named \nparty to petition OFAC--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Under the \nprevious order, we will proceed to H.R. 1180.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Parliamentary inquiry. I did not realize I was acting \nunder a time constraint.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. KERREY. The majority leader did not complete his unanimous \nconsent request as a consequence of some observations.\n  Mr. SHELBY. He was going to complete it after this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The agreement provided we go to this bill at 3 \no'clock, and it is now 3 o'clock.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent to be yielded 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Michigan is granted 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KERREY. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator be given an \nadditional minute and the Senator from Georgia be given 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the time \nhad been set at 5 o'clock for the beginning of the votes. There are a \nnumber of us who have commitments to depart, and have had for some \ntime. Ordinarily it would not be a matter of concern to this Senator, \nbut if we are to complete the arrangements which have been made with a \ngreat many Senators, I understand from the Parliamentarian that under \nthe prevailing order, debate will resume on this matter but at the \nconclusion of the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERREY. An additional 5 minutes for the Senator from Georgia \nright now would not affect the 5 o'clock vote.\n  Mr. ROTH. Reserving the right to object, we do have a number of \npeople who want to speak. We only have an hour.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could just have----\n  Mr. KERREY. I have a unanimous consent request for time for the \nSenator from Michigan and the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am not going to complete my speech now. I simply want to \napologize to my colleagues. I did not realize there was a unanimous \nconsent agreement that would trigger a 3 o'clock debate on a different \nbill. That is all I had to say.\n  I am perfectly happy to pick up my speech after whatever is scheduled \nis completed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I will try to do this in 2 minutes.\n  First, I compliment the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and \nthe ranking member, the cochairs, for their diligent work on the \noverall bill and for their efforts that dealt with the Narcotic Kingpin \nDesignation Act. There have been some legitimate and reasonable \ndifferences of opinion. I am obviously, as a sponsor of the Narcotic \nKingpin Designation Act, pleased that it is proceeding to passage.\n  To make my point, in deference to the difficulties with time here, I \nsimply ask unanimous consent that the letter to Senator Levin of \nNovember 17 from the Department of the Treasury, by Richard Newcomb, \nDirector, Office of Foreign Assets Control, which says, ``. . .we \nbelieve that the proposed law would not deny a U.S. citizen any rights \nhe previously would have had to raise constitutional claims,'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I received your November 12 letter to \n     Secretary Summers requesting our position on the following \n     question: Do you support maintaining the present right \n     afforded a United States citizen who has an interest in \n     assets blocked by Executive Branch action to challenge the \n     blocking under the Administrative Procedure Act?\n       In my October 13 letter to Senator Coverdell, the \n     Department has indicated that it would not oppose judicial \n     review of Treasury decisions. However, we also can work with \n     the text of Title VIII of H.R. 1555 as finalized by the \n     conference committee. The proposed statute does not eliminate \n     all avenues for seeking relief. I want to emphasize that as \n     the program under the proposed legislation is implemented, \n     the Office of Foreign Assets Control's (OFAC) traditional \n     administrative mechanisms will be employed. Thus, a U.S. \n     citizen whose interests have been blocked will be able, if he \n     chooses, to avail himself of OFAC's licensing authority. In \n     current OFAC-administered programs, this mechanism has served \n     to minimize the adverse impact on innocent U.S. citizens \n     while vigorously implementing sanctions against targeted \n     foreign persons. Additionally, a U.S. citizen will be able to \n     petition OFAC for the unblocking of his interest in blocked \n     property. Similarly, we believe that the proposed law would \n     not deny a U.S. citizen any rights he previously would have \n     had to raise constitutional claims.\n\n[[Page S14953]]\n\n       We hope that this information is of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               R. Richard Newcomb,\n                       Director, Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter \nfrom the Department of the Treasury dated November 10 to Senator Levin \nof Michigan by Richard Newcomb, Director, Office of Foreign Assets \nControl, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 10, 1999.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: This letter responds to your letter to \n     Secretary Summers of November 8, 1999, concerning Title VIII \n     of H.R. 1555, the Fiscal Year 2000 Intelligence Authorization \n     Act, entitled the ``Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation \n     Act'' (the ``Act''). You requested an opinion concerning two \n     questions arising under sections 804 and 805 of the proposed \n     legislation: What existing constitutional and statutory due \n     process protections would allow An American citizen who has \n     an interest in assets blocked by Executive Branch action to \n     challenge the blocking? If H.R. 155 is enacted into law, how \n     would these existing constitutional and statutory due process \n     protections be changed?\n       As noted in my October 13, 1999 letter to Senator \n     Coverdell, the Administrative Procedure Act (the ``APA'') \n     provides for judicial review of final agency action. 5 U.S.C. \n     702. In existing sanctions programs administrated by the \n     Office of Foreign Assets Control (``OFAC''), final agency \n     actions related to blocking are subject to challenge by \n     affected parties through judicial review afforded by the APA. \n     Because of normal rules of standing and other jurisdictional \n     principles, a U.S. citizen may in many cases not be able \n     directly to challenge the blocking of a foreign person's \n     assets pursuant to the APA. However, as discussed below, \n     agency review by OFAC, followed by judicial review under the \n     APA of any resulting final agency action as to that citizen, \n     may still be available. In addition to any statutory review \n     available under the APA, a U.S. citizen also may seek \n     judicial review of constitutional claims or challenges \n     related to blockings under existing OFAC sanctions programs.\n       If H.R. is enacted, section 805(f) presumably would \n     foreclose U.S. citizens from bringing a claim under the APA \n     to challenge a blocking. Such statutory preclusion of \n     judicial review under the APA is expressly provided for in \n     the APA itself. 5 U.S.C. 701(a)(1). Despite the limitation on \n     judicial review in section 805(f), however, a U.S. citizen \n     would not be foreclosed from other meaningful avenues of \n     review.\n       First, even when assets are properly blocked under the law, \n     a U.S. citizen can petition OFAC for a license unblocking the \n     U.S. citizen's interest in blocked assets. OFAC has a long-\n     established practice of utilizing its licensing authority in \n     sanctions programs to minimize the adverse impact on innocent \n     U.S. persons while vigorously implementing the sanctions \n     against targeted foreign persons. OFAC regulations in every \n     major sanctions program contain licensing authority. The Act \n     would provide the Treasury Department with similar authority. \n     The ability of OFAC (or even a reviewing court, if judicial \n     review were available) to grant relief would, of course, \n     depend on the nature of the U.S. citizen's interest in \n     blocked assets.\n       Second, a U.S. citizen would have recourse to agency \n     reviewing of the blocking. If the U.S. citizen believed that \n     its interest in the foreign person's assets is mistakenly or \n     wrongfully blocked, that U.S. citizen could petition OFAC to \n     have the interest unblocked. OFAC has the authority pursuant \n     to section 805(b) of the proposed legislation to unblock \n     assets.\n       Also, as section 805(f) must be read to avoid any \n     Constitutional problems, a U.S. citizens would not be \n     precluded by that section from pursuing any Constitutional \n     claims.\n       Finally, one point in your November 8 letter requires \n     clarification. Paragraph three refers to my October 13 letter \n     to Senator Coverdell. That letter was written in response to \n     the Senate draft of H.R. 1555 received in this office on \n     October 13. My reference to judicial review, quoted only in \n     part in your letter, addressed not the current provisions of \n     the Act, but provisions (section 704(f), and in particular, \n     704(f)(2) of the October 13 draft) that were subsequently \n     deleted. We believe it is important to understand the context \n     of my letter, as well as to examine my statement in its \n     entirety: ``The Administrative Procedure Act already provide \n     for judicial review of final agency actions; and, therefore, \n     additional judicial review provisions are unnecessary'' \n     (emphasis supplied). That statement reflected the \n     Department's position that judicial review did not need to be \n     addressed separately in the proposed legislation.\n       We hope this information is of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               R. Richard Newcomb,\n                       Director, Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent the New York \nTimes op-ed written by A.M. Rosenthal, of August 27, 1999, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, August 27, 1999]\n\n                            (A.M. Rosenthal)\n\n                       On My Mind--Vote on Drugs\n\n       Notice to the public: Vote now on drugs, one of the only \n     two ways.\n       1. If you support the war against drugs, vote now for \n     pending Congressional legislation designed to wound major \n     drug lords around the world. It cuts them off from all \n     commerce with the U.S., now a laundry for bleaching the blood \n     from drug-trade billions and turning them into investments in \n     legitimate businesses.\n       Vote by telling your members of Congress that when the \n     House-Senate bill authorizing intelligence funds comes up for \n     final decision, probably next month, you want them to vote \n     for the section called ``blocking assets of major narcotics \n     traffickers.''\n       Insist they start now to tell the Administration not to try \n     to water it down to satisfy any country for diplomatic or \n     economic reasons--including Mexico, the biggest drug entry \n     point for America, already complaining about ``negative \n     consequences'' of the proposal.\n       Turn yourself and your civil, labor or commercial \n     organization, or religious congregation, into lobbies for the \n     bill--counterweight to the lobbies of drug-transfer nations \n     and American companies beholden to them.\n       2. If you are against the war on drugs or just don't care \n     about what drugs are doing to our country, then don't do a \n     thing. that is a vote, too.\n       That's the way it is in Washington. Members of Congress \n     introduce legislation, committees discuss it for months, \n     votes are taken and then when the time comes to work out \n     House-Senate differences, administrations on the fence and \n     under professional lobbyists' pressure use their power to try \n     to mold the legislation to their liking.\n       That is exactly the time for ordinary Americans around the \n     country to do their own lobbying.\n       The bill targeting drug lords extends throughout their \n     vicious world the economic sanctions already directed at \n     Colombian drug lords, by President Clinton's executive order. \n     It will prohibit any U.S. commerce by specifically named drug \n     operators, seize all their assets in the U.S., and ban \n     trading with them by American companies.\n       The bill specifies that every year the U.S. Government list \n     the major drug lords of the world, by name and nation. The \n     lists are certain to include top drug traders from countries \n     such as Afghanistan, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, \n     Thailand and Mexico.\n       In the Senate it was introduced by Paul Coverdell, a \n     Georgia Republican, and Dianne Feinstein, Democrat from \n     California, and passed with bipartisan support. In the House \n     it also has support in both parties, including Porter Goss of \n     Florida, a Republican and chairman of the House Intelligence \n     Committee, and Charles Rangel, the New York Democrat. It \n     waits the final September House-Senate Joint Intelligence \n     Committee vote.\n       For awhile I heard from within the Administration the kind \n     of mutters that preceded the Clinton certification last year \n     that Mexico was carrying out anti-drug commitments \n     satisfactorily, which was certainly a surprise to Mexican \n     drug lords.\n       Then, yesterday, the White House told me that it favored \n     some target sanctions.\n       Its objection to the bill was that the Administration would \n     have to list all major drug lords for the President to choose \n     targets, and that could endanger investigations. The White \n     House said it would be better for the President to select \n     targets without having to choose from a list.\n       Bit of a puzzle. The bill already gives him the right of \n     decide which of the drug lords to target from the \n     Administration's unpublished list. But some members of \n     Congress think the motive is to avoid a list that might \n     include just a little too many from a ``sensitive country.''\n       No one bill will end the drug war. Only the determination \n     of Americans to use every sort of resource will do that--\n     parental teaching, law enforcement with some compassion \n     toward first offenders and none for career drug criminals, \n     enough money for therapy in and out of jails, targeting drug \n     lords--and passionate leadership.\n       That would preclude Presidential candidates who mince \n     around about whether they used drugs when they were younger--\n     unless they grow up publicly and quickly.\n       Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, head of the Phoenix House \n     therapeutic communities, says that the bill ``reflects the \n     kind of values that we don't hear enough these days.'' So \n     vote--one way or the other.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield back my time in accordance to \nthe pressure of the moment here.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the conference report to H.R. 1555, the \nFiscal Year 2000 Intelligence Authorization Act, include legislation \nunder Title VIII of the bill entitled the ``Foreign Narcotics Kingpin \nDesignation Act.'' Title VIII is intended to strengthen U.S. Government \nefforts to identify the assets, financial networks and business \nassociates of major foreign narcotics trafficking groups in an effort \nto disrupt these criminal organizations and\n\n[[Page S14954]]\n\nbankrupt their leadership. No doubt all Senators would agree with this \nlaudable goal of combating the insidious effects of drug trafficking. \nIn fact, an earlier version of this legislation was seen as being so \nwithout controversy that it was added by the Senate to the Intelligence \nAuthorization bill in July of this year with little debate and on a \nvoice vote.\n  Senators should be aware, however, that Title VIII as it is now \nwritten has significant national security, law enforcement, judicial, \nand drug trafficking implications that belie the legislation's simple \ndesign. Yet, I am not aware of any committee of jurisdiction in either \nthe Senate or the House having held a single hearing on the provisions \ncontained in Title VIII. The Senate Intelligence Committee has not held \na hearing. The Senate Judiciary Committee has not held a hearing. Not a \nsingle legal or national security expert, inside or outside government, \nhas testified before a congressional hearing as to whether Title VIII \nshould or should not become law, and, if it does, how would the legal \nrights of Americans be changed as a result.\n  Except for recent and perfunctory House of Representatives debate on \nthe provision, the only public debate on the complexities of Title VIII \nhas occurred in the press. The way that the issue has been \ncharacterized in press reports erroneously suggests that if you are \nready to sign up to Title VIII as set forth in H.R. 1555, you are tough \non foreign drug traffickers. If, however, you are troubled by the \neffect that the Title VIII language would have on currently existing \ndue process protections afforded innocent Americans, you are described \nas doing the bidding of ``narco-lobbyists.''\n  This simplistic characterization is not only false and an insult to \nthe Members of this body, it obscures a vitally important civil \nliberties issue at the core of Title VIII: the rights of innocent \nAmerican citizens to challenge in our Courts the taking of their \nproperty.\n  As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I was a conferee to \nH.R. 1555. However, I did not sign the conference report accompanying \nthe bill because of the contradiction existing  between the stated \nlegislative intent of Title VIII and the actual language contained in \nthe bill, a contradiction I attempted but failed in conference to \ncorrect by amendment.\n\n  Specifically, my objection is that Title VIII, as presently written, \nwould undermine the due process protections now afforded to a U.S. \ncitizen or business who has interest in assets blocked under Title VIII \nto challenge the legality of the blocking under the Administrative \nProcedure Act.\n  This is what the conference report accompanying H.R. 1555 says about \nTitle VIII:\n  ``There is no intention that this legislation affect Americans who \nare not knowingly and willfully engaged in international narcotics \ntrafficking. Nor is it intended in any way to derogate from existing \nconstitutional and statutory due process protections for those whose \nassets are blocked or seized pursuant to law.'' That's the stated \nintent. But what do the words of this CR do?\n  According to the Department of Treasury, which is tasked in Title \nVIII with developing the list of significant foreign narcotics \ntraffickers, due process protections exist today for those U.S. \ncitizens to challenge the legality of the blocking of assets in court.\n  On November 8th, I wrote a letter to Secretary of the Treasury \nLawrence Summers requesting an opinion on two legal questions \nconcerning Title VIII.\n  The first question was: ``What existing constitutional and statutory \ndue process protections would allow an American citizen who has an \ninterest blocked by Executive Branch action to challenge the \nblocking?''\n  The second question was: ``If H.R. 1555 is enacted into law, how \nwould these existing constitutional and statutory due process \nprotections be changed?''\n  In his November 10, 1999 reply to me, Mr. Richard Newcomb, Director \nof the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (or ``OFAC''), \nstated the following with regard to currently existing judicial review \nof the blocking of American assets:\n  ``. . . the Administrative Procedure Act (the ``APA'') provides for \njudicial review of final agency action. 5 U.S.C. 702. In existing \nsanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control \n(``OFAC''), the final agency actions related to blocking are subject to \nchallenge by affected parties through judicial review afforded by the \nAPA. Because of normal rules of standing and other jurisdictional \nprinciples, a U.S. citizen may in many cases not be able directly to \nchallenge the blocking of a foreign person's assets pursuant to APA. \nHowever, as discussed below, agency review by OFAC, followed by \njudicial review under APA of any resulting final agency action as to \nthat citizen, may still be available. In addition to any statutory \nreview available under the APA, a U.S. also may seek judicial review of \nconstitutional claims or challenges related to blockings under existing \nOFAC sanctions programs.''\n  Under the process currently in place, OFAC determines who is a \nforeign drug kingpin after an internal Department of Treasury review of \nthe evidence, an evidentiary review that is coordinated with the \nDepartment of Justice. Executive Order 12978, issued in 1995, requires \nthat the State and Justice Departments be consulted by Treasury prior \nto this designation and blocking of assets. After designation is made \nand assets are blocked, OFAC regulations allow for a named party to \npetition OFAC to have its designation removed through an administrative \nappeal. Most petitioners initiate this administrative review process \nsimply by writing OFAC. Exchanges of correspondence, additional fact-\nfinding, and, often, meetings occur before OFAC decides whether there \nis a basis for removing the designation and unblocking assets. Once the \nnamed party has exhausted this administrative remedies process, OFAC's \nfinal decision can be challenged in federal court under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act.\n\n  To repeat, the Administrative Procedure Act, or APA, provides some \ndue process protection under current law for an American to challenge \nthe blocking of his or her assets pursuant to a Department of Treasury \nOFAC agency decision.\n  However, a straightforward reading of section 805 of Title VIII makes \nclear that these existing statutory due process protections, referenced \nin the conference report as being unaffected by the bill, could well \nbe, in fact, foreclosed if H.R. 1555 becomes law in its present form.\n  More specifically, section 805(a) of the bill states, in part: ``A \nsignificant foreign narcotics trafficker publicly identified . . . \nshall be subject to any and all sanctions as authorized.''\n  Section 805(b) of the bill provides that ``all property and interests \nin property within the United States, or within the possession or \ncontrol of any United States person'' are blocked effective as of the \ndate of a report designating the significant foreign narcotics \ntraffickers.\n  And then the critically important language of section 805(f): ``The \ndeterminations, identifications, finding, and designations made \npursuant to section 804 and subsection (b) of this section shall not be \nsubject to judicial review.''\n  In sum, under Title VII, designation in the drug kingpin report \nautomatically results in the blocking of assets, including any assets \nheld by innocent U.S. citizens and businesses unaware of the \nassociation the foreign business entity allegedly has with narcotics \ntrafficking. The blocking of assets, in turn, is not subject to \njudicial review, according to section 805(f) of the bill. Thus, Title \nVII would limit the statutory opportunity that exists today under the \nAPA for innocent Americans to petition the courts to challenge the \nblocking of assets.\n  Could American citizens and businesses with no knowledge of, or \nparticipation in, foreign narcotics trafficking find their assets \nblocked under Title VIII of this bill? Certainly. For example, an \nAmerican business involved in a joint venture agreement with a foreign \nshipping firm could find its assets blocked under the provisions of \nTitle VIII. Or, American citizens owning stock in a company found to be \nowned or operated by drug traffickers and money launderers could have \ntheir assets blocked and suffer devastating economic loss as a result, \ndespite being innocent of any wrongdoing themselves.\n\n[[Page S14955]]\n\n  Under current law, the scenarios I have described resulting in the \nblocking of assets under the control of U.S. citizens, if not remedied \nin the administrative appeals process, could be challenged in federal \ncourt. Title VIII will have the effect of taking away this judicial \nappeal opportunity, thereby enhancing the authority federal bureaucrats \nhave to not only hear but decide all challenges to Department of \nTreasury designation and asset blocking decisions.\n  The Department of Treasury confirms this change in statutory due \nprocess protections in its November 10th letter to me:\n  ``If H.R. 1555 is enacted, section 805(f) presumably would foreclose \nU.S. citizens from bringing a claim under the APA to challenge the \nblocking.''\n  That is what the Department of Treasury, the agency empowered under \ncurrent law as expanded by Title VIII to block assets, says about how \nthis bill will foreclose currently existing statutory due process \nprotections.\n  Mr. President, at this point I ask that both my November 8, 1999 \nletter to Secretary Summers and the November 10, 1999 reply from OFAC \nbe printed in the Record in their entirety.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  A different section of Title VIII provides perhaps the most \nconclusive evidence that this legislation is being brought to a vote in \nhaste and without the careful consideration it needs. Section 810 of \nthe bill, creates a Judicial Review Commission on Foreign Asset \nControl.\n  The conference report includes six judicial review and due process \nquestions the prospective Commission is being asked to examine and \nreport on to Congress in the next year. I am going to read each of the \nsix questions and, as I do so, I ask that my colleagues consider \nwhether we should have the answers to these important legal questions \nbefore approving Title VIII of H.R. 1555:\n  ``(1) Whether reasonable protections of innocent U.S. businesses are \navailable under the regime currently in place that is utilized to carry \nout the provisions of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act \n(``IEEPA'').''\n  Should not the Senate know the answer to this question before we act \non Title VIII?\n  ``(2) Whether advance notice prior to blocking of one's assets is \nrequired as a matter of constitutional due process''\n  Should not the Senate know the answer to this question before we act \non Title VIII?\n\n  ``(3) whether there are reasonable opportunities under the current \nIEEPA regulatory regime and the Administrative Procedure Act for an \nerroneous blocking of assets of mistaken listing under IEEPA to be \nremedied''\n  We know the most important part of the answer already. The Department \nof Treasury confirms that Americans would no longer be able to use the \nAdministrative Procedure Act and a court appeal from an agency \ndetermination under that act to remedy an erroneous blocking of assets \nor mistaken listing. Should not the Senate have the answer to this \nquestion before we act on Title VIII?\n  ``(4) whether the level of proof that is required under the current \njudicial, regulatory, or administrative scheme is adequate to protect \nlegitimate business interests from irreparable financial harm''\n  Should not the Senate know the answer to this question before we act \non Title VIII?\n  ``(5) whether there is constitutionally adequate accessibility to the \ncourts to challenge agency actions under IEEPA, or the designation of \npersons or entities under IEEPA''\n  We know that section 805(f) of Title VIII will foreclose the \nstatutory access to the courts to challenge agency actions, but should \nnot the Senate know the complete answer to this question before we act \non Title VIII?\n  ``(6) whether there are remedial measures and legislative amendments \nthat should be enacted to improve the current asset blocking scheme \nunder IEEPA or this title [Title VIII]''\n  Should not the Senate know the answer to this question before we act \non Title VIII?\n  These are crucially important questions and strike to the very \nessence of due process protections afforded to U.S. citizens. So \nimportant are these questions that I believe the Senate as a body \nshould know the answers to them before approving a law with potentially \nfar-reaching legal consequences. These questions deserve careful \nconsideration through a hearing process in the Judiciary Committee, the \nIntelligence Committee and other committees of jurisdiction. We should \nknow the answers before we vote on the bill before us.\n  As it stands today, the Senate is being asked to approve a new law \nwhich will foreclose a currently existing statutory right of judicial \nappeal without the benefit of this hearing record and without a \ncomplete understanding of how this change in due process protections \ncould harm innocent Americans.\n  Senators should be aware that the original drug kingpin amendment to \nthe Intelligence Authorization Act--the Coverdell-Feinstein amendment--\napproved by the Senate on July 21st on a voice vote, did not eliminate \nor alter the existing judicial review avenue afforded innocent \nAmericans under the Administrative Procedure Act to challenge the \nlegality of the blocking of assets. The Coverdell-Feinstein amendment \nwas silent on the issue. Only at the insistence of the House conferees \nduring conference on the bill was the language contained in section \n805(f) foreclosing statutory review of final agency actions included in \nthe final conference agreement. So Senators should be clear that this \nsignificant difference exists between the original Coverdell-Feinstein \namendment approved by the Senate in July and what we are being asked to \nadopt today.\n  Because the House approved the conference report to H.R. 1555 last \nweek, the rules of the Senate preclude a motion to recommit the bill \nback to conference with instructions to remove the provision of Title \nVIII eliminating current review of final agency actions under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act.\n  Realistically, the conference report to H.R. 1555, even with this \noffending provision, will pass overwhelmingly given the signatures on \nthe conference report. The only way to minimize the damage it could do \nto innocent U.S. citizens is to attempt to amend Title VIII after it \nbecomes law. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to speak \nin morning business for the purpose of introducing a bill to do just \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk on behalf of myself, Senator \nShelby, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, and Senator Roberts.\n  This bill would restore the right that U.S. citizens are about to \nlose under section 805(f) of H.R. 1555 to challenge in court under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act an illegal blocking of their assets by \nExecutive Branch decision.\n  Based on my reading of the conference report language accompanying \nH.R. 1555, the conferees may not have intended or fully understood that \nTitle VIII would foreclose a currently existing avenue of judicial \nreview under the Administrative Procedure Act. It wasn't until after \nthe conference on H.R. 1555 was concluded did any one in either \nCongress or the Executive Branch state in writing that this would be \nthe bill's effect. I argued this position at the conference called \nimmediately before the conferees voted. Therefore, I am hopeful that \nthis significant flaw in H.R. 1555 can be corrected soon and that the \nAmerican people will be assured that the United States Congress is not \ntaking away rights of Americans to challenge the wrongful taking of \ntheir property by bureaucratic action. Because of this flaw, if there \nhad been a recorded vote on the conference report before us, I would \nhave voted ``no''.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 1999.\n     Hon. Lawrence H. Summers,\n     Secretary of the Treasury,\n     Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: On Friday, Senate and House of \n     Representatives conferees completed work on H.R. 1555, the \n     Fiscal Year 2000 Intelligence Authorization Act. The \n     conference agreement which has yet to be passed by either \n     body, contains Title VIII, the ``Foreign Narcotics Kingpin \n     Designation Act.''\n       I have a concern that Title VIII, as presently written, \n     would undermine the due\n\n[[Page S14956]]\n\n     process protections now afforded to an innocent U.S. citizen \n     or business who has interest in assets blocked under this Act \n     to challenge the blockage under the Administrative Procedure \n     Act of any other avenue of judicial review.\n       According to the October 13, 1999 letter from Mr. R. \n     Richard Newcomb, Director of the Department of Treasury's \n     Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to Senator Paul \n     Coverdell, the Administrative Procedure Act ``already \n     provides for judicial review of final agency actions'' \n     concerning the blocking of assets. The report accompanying \n     H.R. 1555 adds that Title VIII is not ``intended in any way \n     to derogate from existing constitutional and statutory due \n     process protections for those whose assets are blocked or \n     seized pursuant to law.''\n       However, a straightforward reading of section 805 of H.R. \n     1555 raises significant concerns that these ``existing \n     constitutional and statutory due process protections'' may be \n     eroded if the Act becomes law.\n       More specifically, section 805(a) of the bill states, in \n     part: ``A significant foreign narcotics trafficker publicly \n     identified . . . shall be subject to any and all sanctions as \n     authorized.'' Section 805(b) goes on to state that ``all \n     property and interests in property within the United States, \n     or within the possession or control of any United \n     States person'' are blocked effective as of the date of \n     Treasury's report. Finally, section 805(f) states: ``The \n     determinations, identifications, findings, and \n     designations made pursuant to section 804 and subsection \n     (b) of this section shall not be subject to judicial \n     review.''\n       In sum, designation in the Treasury report automatically \n     results in the blocking of assets. The blocking of assets, in \n     turn, is not subject to judicial review, according to section \n     805(f) of the Act. Thus, H.R. 1555 would seem to limit the \n     opportunity that exists today for innocent American citizens \n     and businesses to petition the courts to challenge the \n     blocking of assets.\n       Because H.R. 1555 may come before the Senate for \n     consideration in short order, I asked that the Department of \n     Treasury, in consultation with the Department of Justice, \n     provide a written legal opinion to me answering two important \n     questions:\n       (1) What existing constitutional and statutory due process \n     protections would allow an American citizen who has interest \n     in assets blocked by Executive Branch action to challenge the \n     blocking?\n       (2) If H.R. 1555 is enacted into law, how would these \n     existing constitutional and statutory due process protections \n     be changed?\n       Your immediate response to my request is appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Minority Member.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 10, 1999.\n     Hon.Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: This letter responds to your letter to \n     Secretary Summers of November 8, 1999, concerning Title VIII \n     of H.R. 1555, the Fiscal Year 2000 Intelligence Authorization \n     Act, entitled the ``Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation \n     Act'' (the ``Act''). You requested an opinion concerning two \n     questions arising under sections 804 and 805 of the proposed \n     legislation:\n       What existing constitutional and statutory due process \n     protections would allow an American citizen who has an \n     interest in assets blocked by Executive Branch action to \n     challenge the blocking?\n       If H.R. 1555 is enacted into law, how would these existing \n     constitutional and statutory due process protections be \n     changed?\n       As noted in my October 13, 1999 letter to Senator \n     Coverdell, the Administrative Procedure Act (the ``APA'') \n     provides for judicial review of final agency action. 5 U.S.C. \n     702. In existing sanctions programs administered by the \n     Office of Foreign Assets Control (``OFAC''), final agency \n     actions related to blocking are subject to challenge by \n     affected parties through judicial review afforded by the APA. \n     Because of normal rules of standing and other jurisdictional \n     principles, a U.S. citizen may in many cases not be able \n     directly to challenge the blocking of a foreign person's \n     assets pursuant to the APA. However, as discussed below, \n     agency review by OFAC, followed by judicial review under the \n     APA of any resulting final agency action as to that citizen, \n     may still be available. In addition to any statutory review \n     available under the APA, a U.S. citizen also may seek \n     judicial review of constitutional claims or challenges \n     related to blockings under existing OFAC sanctions programs.\n       If H.R. 1555 is enacted, section 805(f) presumably would \n     foreclose U.S. citizens from bringing a claim under the APA \n     to challenge a blocking. Such statutory preclusion of \n     judicial review under the APA is expressly provided for in \n     the APA itself. 5 U.S.C. 701(a)(1). Despite the limitation on \n     judicial review in section 805(f), however, a U.S. citizen \n     would not be foreclosed from other meaningful avenues of \n     review.\n       First, even when assets are properly blocked under the law, \n     a U.S. citizen can petition OFAC for a license unblocking the \n     U.S. citizen's interest in blocked assets. OFAC has a long-\n     established practice of utilizing its licensing authority in \n     sanctions programs to minimize the adverse impact on innocent \n     U.S. persons while vigorously implementing the sanctions \n     against targeted foreign persons. OFAC regulations in every \n     major sanctions program contain licensing authority. The Act \n     would provide the Treasury Department with similar authority. \n     The ability of OFAC (or even a reviewing court, if judicial \n     review were available) to grant relief would, of course, \n     depend on the nature of the U.S. citizen's interest in \n     blocked assets.\n       Second a U.S. citizen would have recourse to agency review \n     of the blocking. If the U.S. citizen believed that its \n     interest in the foreign person's assets is mistakenly or \n     wrongfully blocked, that U.S. citizen could petition OFAC to \n     have the interest unblocked. OFAC has the authority pursuant \n     to section 805(b) of the proposed legislation to unblock \n     assets.\n       Also, as section 805(f) must be read to avoid any \n     Constitutional problems, a U.S. citizen would not be \n     precluded by that section from pursuing any Constitutional \n     claims.\n       Finally, one point in your November 8 letter requires \n     clarification. Paragraph three refers to my October 13 letter \n     to Senator Coverdell. That letter was written in response to \n     the Senate draft of H.R. 1555 received in this Office on \n     October 13. My reference to judicial review, quoted only in \n     part in your letter, addressed not the current provisions of \n     the Act, but provisions (section 704(f), and in particular, \n     704(f)(2) of the October 13 draft) that were subsequently \n     deleted. We believe it is important to understand the context \n     of my letter, as well as to examine my statement in its \n     entirety. ``The Administrative Procedure Act already provides \n     for judicial review of final agency actions; and, therefore \n     additional judicial review provisions are unnecessary'' \n     (emphasis supplied). That statement reflected the \n     Department's position that judicial review did not need to be \n     addressed separately in the proposed legislation.\n       We hope this information is of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               R. Richard Newcomb,\n     Director, Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 12, 1999.\n     Hon. Lawrence H. Summers,\n     Secretary of the Treasury,\n     Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: Thank you for your November 10, 1999 \n     reply to my letter requesting a legal opinion of Title VIII \n     of H.R. 1555, the Fiscal Year 2000 Intelligence Authorization \n     Act, entitled the ``Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation \n     Act.'' Your reply was not only prompt but responsive to the \n     questions I posed.\n       Paragraph three of your letter contains the following \n     conclusion about how H.R. 1555, if enacted into law, would \n     change existing statutory due process protections:\n       ``If H.R. 1555 is enacted, section 805(f) presumably would \n     foreclose U.S. citizens from bringing a claim under the APA \n     [Administrative Procedure Act] to challenge a blocking.''\n       I do not believe this current existing avenue for judicial \n     review of final agency action should be foreclosed. \n     Therefore, I am requesting that you forward to me a written \n     answer to the following question before the Senate considers \n     the conference report to H.R. 1555 next Tuesday:\n       Do you support maintaining the present right afforded a \n     United States citizen who has an interest in assets blocked \n     by Executive Branch action of challenge the blocking under \n     the Administrative Procedure Act?\n       Your immediate response to my request is appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Minority Member.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 17 1999.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Levin: I received your November 12 letter to \n     Secretary Summers requesting our position on the following \n     question:\n       Do you support maintaining the present right afforded a \n     United States citizen who has an interest in assets blocked \n     by Executive Branch action to challenge the blocking under \n     the Administrative Procedure Act?\n       In my October 13 letter to Senator Coverdell, the \n     Department has indicated that it would not oppose judicial \n     review of Treasury decision. However, we also can work with \n     the text of Title VIII of H.R. 1555 as finalized by the \n     conference committee. The proposed statute does not eliminate \n     all avenues for seeking relief. I want to emphasize that as \n     the program under the proposed legislation is implemented, \n     the Office of Foreign Assets Control's (OFAC) traditional \n     administrative mechanisms will be employed. Thus, a U.S. \n     citizen whose interests have been blocked will be able, if he \n     chooses, to avail himself of OFAC's licensing authority. In \n     current OFAC-administered programs, this mechanism has served \n     to minimize the adverse impact on innocent U.S. citizens \n     while vigorously implementing sanctions against targeted \n     foreign persons. Additionally, a U.S. citizen will be able to \n     petition OFAC for the unblocking of his interest in blocked \n     property. Similarly, we believe that the proposed law would \n     not deny a U.S. citizen any rights he previously would have \n     had to raise constitutional claims.\n\n[[Page S14957]]\n\n       We hope that this information is of assistance.\n           Sincerely\n                                               R. Richard Newcomb,\n                       Director, Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today will \npass S. 1515, an important bill to make some much needed changes to the \nRadiation Exposure Compensation Act. I am pleased to join my \ncolleagues, including the Chairmen of the Senate Judiciary and Indian \nAffairs Committees, in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, my home state of New Mexico is the birthplace of the \natomic bomb. One of the unfortunate consequences of our country's rapid \ndevelopment of its nuclear arsenal was that many of those who worked in \nthe earliest uranium mines became afflicted with terrible illnesses.\n  I noticed this problem more than twenty years ago, when I learned \nthat miners had contracted an alarmingly high rate of lung cancer and \nother diseases commonly related to radiation exposure.\n  Many of the miners were Native Americans, mostly members of the \nNavajo Nation, with whom the United States government has had a \nlongstanding trust relationship based on the treaties and agreements \nbetween our country and the tribes. Some 1,500 Navajos worked in the \nuranium mines from 1947 to 1971. Many of them have since died of \nhorrible radiation-related illnesses.\n  All of the uranium miners, including the Navajos, performed a great \nservice out of patriotic duty to this country. Their work helped us to \nwin the Cold War. Unfortunately, our Nation failed to fulfill its duty \nto protect the miners' health. After hearing of the problem, I began \nthe effort the miners' health. After hearing of the problem, I began \nthe effort to see that the miners and their families received just \ncompensation for their illnesses.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize a person who has \nbeen a champion in the hearts of uranium miners and their families \nthroughout the Colorado Plateau. This person, a former uranium miner \nhimself, has worked tirelessly in advocating many of the reforms we \nhave established within this bill.\n  Mr. President, Paul Hicks of Grants, New Mexico deserves a large \namount of credit for bringing attention to this legislation in the \nUnited States Senate. Paul is President of the New Mexico Uranium \nWorkers Council and he has spearhearted the grassroots effort that is \nresponsible for several of these much needed reforms.\n  Paul was a uranium miner for over twelve years in New Mexico. He \nlater worked as a lead miner, a shift boss, and ended his mining career \nas a mine foreman. But as Paul will tell you, ``it takes about ten \nyears to make a good miner, but only ten minutes to make a good \nforeman.'' Mr. President, Paul Hicks is and will always be a miner at \nheart.\n  Paul has fought this effort for the miners of the Navajo nation, \nAcoma Pueblo, Grants, New Mexico, and Dove Creek and Grand Junction, \nColorado. Paul Hicks is truly a hero in the heart's of the many people \nalong the Colorado Plateau that have been adversely affected by \nexposure to uranium.\n  Unfortunately Mr. President, Paul is now facing another battle. That \nis fight against cancer. Paul was diagnosed last week with bone cancer \nand now, he must endure massive radiation treatments for the next six \nweeks. It will be a tough fight, but one I know he'll win. Simply, \nbecause I know Paul Hicks.\n  Way back in 1979, I held the first field hearing on this issue in Mr. \nHicks' hometown of Grants, New Mexico to learn about the concerns and \nthe health problems faced on uranium miners. In later years, I traveled \nto Shiprock, New Mexico and the Navajo Nation Indian Reservation to \ngather more information about the uranium miners and their families.\n  Twelve years after I introduced that first bill, President Bush \nsigned RECA into law. At the time, RECA was intended to provide fair \nand swift compensation for those miners and downwinders who had \ncontracted certain radiation-related illnesses.\n  Since the RECA trust fund began making awards in 1992, the Department \nof Justice has approved a total 3,135 claims valued at nearly $232 \nmillion. In my home state of New Mexico, there have been 371 claims \napproved with a value of nearly $37 million. For that work, the \nDepartment of Justice is to be commended.\n  The original RECA was a compassionate law which unfortunately has \ncome to be administered in a bureaucratic, dispassionate and often \nunfair manner. Many claims have languished at the Department of Justice \nfor far too long.\n  Miners and their families, particularly Navajos, often have waited \nmany years for their claims to be processed. Many claims were denied \nbecause the miners were smokers and could not prove that their diseases \nwere related solely to uranium mining. In other cases, miners faced \nproblems establishing the requisite amount of working level months \nneeded to make a successful claim. Native American claims by spousal \nsurvivors often were denied because of difficulties associated with \ndocumenting Native American marriages.\n  This bill makes some important, common-sense changes to the radiation \ncompensation program to address the problems I have outlined. First, it \nexpands the list of compensable diseases to include new cancers, \nincluding leukemia, thyroid and brain cancer. It also includes certain \nnon-cancer diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis. Medical science has \nbeen able to link these diseases to uranium mining in the 10 years \nsince the enactment of the original RECA. We now know that prolonged \nradiation exposure can cause many additional diseases. This bill uses \nthe best available science to make sure that those who were injured by \nradiation exposure are compensated.\n  The bill also extends eligibility to above-ground and open-pit \nminers, millers and transport workers. The latest science tells us that \nthe risks of disease associated with radiation exposure were not \nnecessarily limited to those who worked in unventilated mines.\n  Most importantly, the bill requires the Department of Justice to take \nNative American law and customs into account when deciding claims. I \nhave heard countless stories about the inequities faced by the spouses \nof Navajo miners who have been unable to successfully document their \ntraditional tribal marriages to the satisfaction of the Justice \nDepartment under current law and regulations. This bill will change \nthat, and make it easier of spousal survivors to make successful \nclaims.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to support this important legislation. \nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will cost close \nto $1 billion over the next 21 years. That is far less than some of the \nother proposals floated in the House and Senate during the past few \nyears. This is a common-sense approach, which addresses many of the \nproblems with the existing program, without unnecessarily expanding the \nscope of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. The Chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee has done a fine Job crafting this bill and I \nhave been pleased to work with him in that regard. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today marks a major breakthrough in our \nWar on Drugs. H.R. 1555, the Intelligence Reauthorization bill, \ncontains a provision authored by myself and Senator Diane Feinstein, \nwhich is designed to put drug kingpins out of business. Enactment of \nour Drug Kingpin legislation represents the most dramatic change in our \nNation's drug laws since the drug certification process was established \nin 1986.\n  The Drug Kingpin legislation, which Senator Feinstein and I \nintroduced earlier this year as a free-standing bill, targets major \ndrug kingpins by blocking their assets in the U.S. and by preventing \ntheir access to U.S. markets. Our objective is to use U.S. economic \npower to undercut the financial base of the cartels and their kingpins, \nthereby providing a tool that directly targets a major security threat \nto this country. Simply stated, we are hitting drug traffickers where \nit hurts them most--in their wallets.\n  This legislation codifies and expands an existing Presidential \nExecutive Order which has had remarkable success in financially \nisolating and weakening Colombian drug cartels. In 1995, President \nClinton signed Executive Order 12978, exercising the International \nEmergency Economic Powers\n\n[[Page S14958]]\n\nAct (IEEPA) against four major drug kingpins affiliated with Colombia's \nCali cartel. The Executive Order blocks any financial, commercial and \nbusiness dealings with any entity associated with the four named drug \ntraffickers, recognizing that drug traffickers who pump cocaine and \nheroin into our communities pose a threat to our national security.\n  The Coverdell-Feinstein initiative expands the President's Executive \nOrder to include all foreign narcotics traffickers deemed as threats to \nour national security and enhances congressional oversight of this \nimportant and effective program. Here's how it works: As under the \nPresident's Executive Order, the Treasury Department's Office of \nForeign Assets Control (OFAC) would develop a list of Specially \nDesignated Foreign Narcotics Traffickers in consultation with the \nDepartment of Justice, the Department of State, and other executive \nbranch agencies. Any foreign entity which appears on the list would be \nprohibited from conducting any economic activity with the United \nStates. American firms or individuals who violate this prohibition \nwould be subject to significant financial penalties and, potentially, \nprison terms.\n  Mr. President, this program's track record in Colombia is impressive. \nThe United States targeted over 150 companies and nearly 300 \nindividuals involved in the ownership and management of the Colombian \ndrug cartels' non-narcotics business empire, which included a variety \nof companies ranging from drugstores to poultry farms. Once labeled as \ndrug-linked businesses, these companies found themselves financially \nisolated. Banks and legitimate companies chose not to do business with \nthe blacklisted firms, choking off key revenue streams to the cartels. \nOver 40 drug-funded companies, with estimated combined sales of over \n$200 million, were liquidated or in the process of liquidation by \nFebruary 1998. I am submitting for the Record a recent Treasury \nDepartment Impact Summary on the Colombia program.\n\n  The best part of this approach to fighting foreign drug kingpins is \nthat it supports the efforts of foreign governments who need our help \nto take down the cartels. To that end, it is essential that \nimplementation of this program occurs with the cooperation and \nparticipation of the host country. Indeed, in the case of Colombia, the \nparticipation and high level of cooperation by the Colombian government \nand the Colombian Banking Association were crucial to the success of \nthe program. It is our hope and intention that as this program is \nexpanded in legislation, a similar framework of cooperation and \nparticipation is developed with other countries.\n  One of our principle intentions with this legislation is to avoid the \ncountry-to-country confrontation that often occurs and to focus instead \non the bad actors who are producing and trafficking the illegal drugs \nand who are causing so much damage to our nation. At the same time, it \nis designed to be a supplement, not a replacement for the current drug \ncertification process.\n  The Coverdell-Feinstein provision is not country specific. It is a \nglobal initiative which targets foreign drug kingpins and their \nassociates regardless of nationality and location--from Burma to \nNigeria to Colombia.\n  Despite the proven track-record of this program, some raised concerns \nthat this legislation would not adequately protect U.S. business \ninterests. I disagree. So do the vast majority in both Houses of \nCongress, the Department of Treasury that implemented the successful \nColombia program and the National Security Council. This legislation \nhas been thoroughly vetted and painstakingly examined by the experts in \nCongress and in the Executive Branch. Since its unanimous passage in \nJuly 1999 as an amendment to the Intelligence Reauthorization bill, \nimportant changes were made which perfected and refined this provision \nthat will be soon signed into law.\n  It is important to remember that this bill targets foreign drug \ntraffickers and their front companies, not U.S. entities. This program \nis implemented so as to minimize the possibility of unfairly tarnishing \nthe reputation of an individual or company. If a U.S. company is \nknowingly or unknowingly conducting business with drug traffickers or \ntheir associates, they are warned by the Treasury Department before any \nfurther steps are taken. According to Treasury Department practice, \nalert letters are sent by Treasury to U.S. entities who are potentially \nconducting business with a designated foreign narcotics trafficker or \ntheir associates. Often, a Treasury Department representative will \npersonally warn the U.S. entity. Actions would only be taken if the \nU.S. entity continues the business relationship with the narcotics \ntrafficker.\n  The purpose is not to harm unwitting U.S. businesses. Instead, it is \nto inform U.S. persons of the identities of the prohibited foreign \nparties. In the case of the Colombia program, U.S. businessmen have \ntermed this program as ``a good preventative measure'' that helps them \nsteer clear of the cartels' front and agents. If a U.S. entity does \nhappen to be adversely affected, it has recourse to administrative \nremedies through the Treasury Department, and of course has access to \nU.S. courts--as would any U.S. citizen under the Constitution. I am \nsubmitting for the Record a copy of several Treasury Department letters \non this issue which should put this matter to rest once and for all. In \naddition, at the suggestion of Senator Richard Shelby and Senator Bob \nKerrey, the legislation provides for a commission to examine a range of \nlegal issues that could arise through implementation of the program.\n\n  As for the foreign drug kingpins, this legislation treats them for \nwhat they really are: a national security threat. Many of these \ncriminals, who peddle their wares on our streets and in our school \nyards, are already under indictment in the U.S. These are the thugs \nresponsible for thousands of deaths each year. In several cases tried \nbefore U.S. district courts since 1995, U.S. federal judges have found \nthe designation process to be appropriate and applicable to the named \nforeign entities.\n  The provision unanimously passed the Senate as an amendment to the \nIntelligence Authorization Bill in July. It then passed the House on \nNovember 2 as a free-standing bill by a vote of 385-26. The provision \nwas accepted in the Intelligence Conference on November 5. And then, \nlast week, the House unanimously passed the Intelligence Conference \nReport, which included this provision. And, today, this provision \nreceived final approval in the Senate and will soon be sent to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  This provision is time-tested, has had extraordinary success in \nColombia, and will continue to be an effective tool when applied on a \nglobal basis. This is a tough but fair measure. It punishes some of the \nworst criminals alive today, and at the same time protects the rights \nof innocent U.S. citizens.\n  Take legitimate U.S. dollars out of drug dealers' pockets is a vital \nstep in destroying their ability to traffic narcotics across our \nborders. This is a bold but necessary tool to fight the war on drugs.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to thank the distinguished \nSenator from California Senator Diane Feinstein, for her leadership and \ndedication to this issue. I would also like to recognize Representative \nPorter Goss and Representative Bill McCollum for their work on behalf \nof this bill and their tireless efforts in fighting the war on drugs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nCoverdell-Feinstein Drug Kingpin bill, which is contained in modified \nform within this Intelligence Authorization Conference Report.\n  That bill, also co-sponsored by Senators Lott, Torricelli, DeWine, \nHelms, Craig, Graham and Reid, is designed to strengthen the \nPresident's hand in combating foreign narcotics traffickers around the \nworld. Senator Coverdell and I have worked for months to answer \nquestions about the bill, iron out remaining problems, and satisfy the \nconcerns of the Clinton Administration over how the bill will work.\n  We and our staffs met with representatives from the White House, the \nJustice Department, the Treasury Department, the Department of State, \nthe National Security Council, other Senate offices and many others \nduring that time. I am gratified to report that we now have the support \nof this Administration, as well as both Houses of Congress.\n  Let me speak a bit about this provision and why it is so important. \nThis\n\n[[Page S14959]]\n\nprovision is patterned after an Executive Order issued by President \nClinton in 1995, which targeted the assets of the powerful Colombian \ndrug kingpins.\n  That Order expanded the International Emergency Economics Powers Act \nto include ``Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers.'' As issued, \nthe President's Executive Order applies to four drug traffickers \naffiliated with the Colombian Cali cartel. The goal is to completely \nisolate the targeted drug traffickers.\n  The Executive Order blocks any financial, commercial and/or business \ndealings with any entity associated with the four named drug \ntraffickers--to include criminal associates, associated family members, \nrelated businesses and financial accounts.\n  Under the Coverdell-Feinstein provision now contained in this \nConference report--as under the President's Executive Order--the \nTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) would \ndevelop a list of Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers in \nconsultation with the Department of Justice, the CIA and the Department \nof State. Now, this list can contain traffickers throughout the world, \nand not just in Colombia.\n  By focusing on the financial relationships between drug cartels and \ntheir associated business relationships, the Executive Order--and now \nthis new provision--is directed toward the entities that are creating \nthe drug problem in our country--the drug cartels.\n  Now, this provision will codify and expand that Presidential \ndirective to include other foreign narcotics traffickers considered a \nthreat to our national security--Colombia was a good start, and we \nbelieve it is time to set our sights elsewhere around the world.\n  The goal is to isolate targeted drug traffickers and their affiliated \nbusinesses by freezing their assets under U.S. jurisdiction and cutting \noff their ability to do business in the United States.\n  Under the Executive Order, more than 400 companies and individuals \naffiliated with drug trafficking have been targeted by the Treasury \nDepartment.\n  These entities are denied access to banking services in the U.S. and \nColombia, and existing bank accounts have been shut down.\n  As a result, more than 400 Colombian accounts have been closed, \naffecting over 200 companies and individuals engaged in drug \ntrafficking.\n  By February 1998, over 40 of these companies, with an estimated \ncombined annual sales of over $200 million, had been forced out of \nbusiness.\n  Drug cartels today are more powerful, more violent and have a far \ngreater reach than traditional organized crime organizations ever had \nbeen in the past. And, I believe they pose a major threat to our \nnational security.\n  Indeed, measured in dollar value, at least four-fifths of all illicit \ndrugs consumed in the U.S. are of foreign origin, including virtually \nall the cocaine and heroin.\n  With the authority to reach countries beyond Colombia, the President \ncan work to isolate major criminal drug syndicates around the world, \nand impose upon them and their associates a similar fate as that of the \nCali cartel.\n  It is my hope that with new emphasis on this expanded authority, and \nwith a concerted intelligence effort to develop sufficient data about \nthe cartels and their associates, in this country and abroad, the \nUnited States will be able to work with our allies to expose, isolate, \nand cut off the major drug trafficking syndicates that pose a \ntremendous threat to our societies.\n  This crucial mission can only be accomplished together, and we must \nwork together to see that our governments are properly equipped to \ncarry it out successfully.\n  To that end, this amendment establishes clear procedures through \nwhich the various parts of our own government will be able to share \ninformation with their counterparts, and make recommendations to the \nPresident as to those cartels that represent the greatest risk to our \nnation.\n  Coordinated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the Department \nof Treasury, the expanded program will target new international drug \ncartels with the same successful financial choke holds that worked so \nwell in Colombia.\n  And let me also be clear about one thing. Nothing in this provision \nshould in any way be read to say that the United States Government \nshould stop cooperating with other governments in the fight against \ndrugs.\n  To the utmost extent possible, the United States under this provision \nshould continue and even expand upon its current agreements with other \nnations in the fight against drugs. While valid concerns over the \ncompromise of national security, sources and methods, or ongoing \ninvestigations must be taken into account, we must also make sure that \nwe continue to work cooperatively with those governments also intent on \nsolving this drug crisis.\n  This will not be an easy process, and the results will not be \nimmediate. But over time, we hope that the flow of drugs across our \nborders will be diminished.\n  Before I yield the floor, I want to address one concern that has been \nraised about due process for American citizens under this bill. Some \nhave expressed a concern that this bill would leave U.S. citizens \nwithout redress for blocked assets, in possible violation of their due \nprocess rights. Such an outcome is certainly not what we are trying to \naccomplish with this bill, and I have been assured by the Treasury \nDepartment that avenues of redress will remain open to United States \nCitizens.\n  According to Richard Newcomb, the Director of Foreign Assets Control \n(OFAC), the entity responsible for carrying out the provisions of this \nbill:\n\n       Even when assets are properly blocked under U.S. law, a \n     U.S. citizen can petition OFAC for a license unblocking the \n     U.S. Citizens interest in blocked assets. OFAC has a long-\n     established policy of utilizing its licensing authority in \n     sanctions programs to minimize adverse impact on U.S. persons \n     while vigorously implementing the sanctions against targeted \n     foreign persons.\n\n  Second, according to Newcomb, OFAC will have the ability under \nsection 805(b) of this Act to completely unblock assets:\n\n       If the U.S. citizen believed that its interest in the \n     foreign person's assets is mistakenly or wrongfully blocked, \n     that U.S. citizen could petition OFAC to have the interest \n     unblocked.\n\n  Finally, ``Also, as section 805(f) must be read to avoid any \nConstitutional problems, a U.S. citizen would not be precluded from \nthat section from pursuing any Constitutional claims.''\n  In other words, Mr. President, U.S. citizens are now, and will \ncontinue to be, offered significant protections against wrongful \nblocking or seizure of their assets. The Treasury Department has \nassured us that nothing in this bill will eliminate a U.S. citizen's \nabsolute, Constitutional right to due process, and nothing in this bill \nattempts to do so. The clear purpose of the bill is to seek out foreign \ndrug kingpins and cut off their access to the American economy.\n  I'd like to thank Senator Coverdell for working so tirelessly with me \non this bill, and I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for \nsupporting our efforts. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for the record, I want to ensure that \ncongressional intent on the Secretary of Health and Human Services' \norgan transplantation rule is clear. The provision in the tax extender \nbill, which provides for a 90 day delay with a required 60 day comment \nperiod, does not reflect the views of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee. Rather, congressional intent is expressed by the \nprovision in the Consolidated Appropriations bill, which simply delays \nthe effective date of the regulation by 42 days. This compromise \nassures that the transplant community and affected patients will have \none final chance to discuss this issue, and that the Secretary shall \nthen proceed with the regulation. Therefore, the provision in the \nConsolidated Appropriations bill should have legal effect, \nnotwithstanding the provision in the tax extender bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent a statement of Administration Policy be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 1180--Ticket to Work and \n                    Work Incentives Improvement Act\n\n       Today, the Senate is expected to vote on the conference \n     report to accompany H.R. 1180, the Ticket to Work and Work \n     Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. The President has a deep \n     and long-standing commitment to empowering and promoting the \n     independence of people with disabilities.\n\n[[Page S14960]]\n\n       H.R. 1180 would give people with disabilities a new chance \n     to work without fear of losing their Medicare and Medicaid \n     coverage. This bill also would create a demonstration program \n     that provides people who are not yet too disabled to work the \n     opportunity to ``buy into'' Medicaid to help them keep \n     working. In addition, it would enhance opportunities for \n     Social Security disability beneficiaries to obtain vocational \n     rehabilitation and employment services from their choice of \n     participating providers. The Administration strongly supports \n     these provisions that will enable more people with \n     disabilities to work.\n       The Administration is deeply troubled that H.R. 1180 \n     includes a provision concerning the organ transplantation \n     rule of the Department of Health and Human Services that \n     would provide for a 90-day delay in the rule, including a \n     required 60-day comment period. This provision is in conflict \n     with the provision in the Consolidated Appropriations bill \n     that would provide for a 42-day delay. The Statement of the \n     Managers for the Consolidated bill makes clear their intent \n     that there be no further delay following the 42-day period. \n     The provision in the Consolidated bill represents the true \n     compromise that resulted from negotiations involving all \n     parties. The Administration agreed to and supports the \n     compromise provision in the Consolidated bill and believes \n     that the rule should be issued without further delay after \n     the 42-day period expires.\n       H.R. 1180 contains several time-sensitive provisions that \n     extend expiring tax laws. The Administration supports many of \n     these provisions, including the extension of alternative \n     minimum tax provisions, the research and experimentation tax \n     credit, the qualified zone academy bond authorization, the \n     brownfields provisions, and the District of Columbia \n     homebuyers credit. Although the extension of certain expiring \n     tax laws is essential, the failure to fully offset the \n     revenue losses resulting from these provisions is \n     unfortunate. The Administration also is disappointed that \n     H.R. 1180 includes the special allowance adjustment for \n     student loans because it exposes the Federal Government, \n     rather than lenders, to substantial financial risk due to the \n     difference between Treasury and commercial paper borrowing \n     rates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S14960-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTICKET TO WORK AND WORK INCENTIVES IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We do need to have a colloquy now, before we begin the \nfinal debate on this very important work incentives legislation on the \nmatter of dairy and the dairy language in the appropriations bill. \nThere is no use at this point of me going back and recounting all that \nhas gone on in us reaching the point where we are in the language in \nthis bill.\n  There are a lot of Senators on both sides of the aisle who believe \nthat the Northeast Dairy Compact should have been included. There are \nSenators who think that portions of the bill H.R. 1402, known as the 1-\nA, should have been included. There are other Senators who believe \nequally as strongly that neither of those should have been included in \nthis bill. I must say, I am in that group.\n  I do not think what we have come up with on dairy is where we should \nleave it. It was something that was laboriously worked out. I tried my \nvery best to find some way that we could come up with something that \nwas in the best interests of dairy, the consumers, something that was \nacceptable to Senator Grams, Senator Jeffords, Senator Kohl, Senator \nWellstone, and Senator Feingold, but there was no way to find a \nsolution with which all sides could be content. Regardless of how this \nagreement was reached, we are here, and it will be in law. But I do not \nthink we should leave it on this line.\n\n  I do not think compacts are the answer, personally. I believe it very \nstrongly. I do not think that trying to expand it--more compacts--and \nhave the kinds of controls you have now by the Government, or will have \nin this by the Government, is the answer.\n  So I find myself philosophically very sympathetic to Senator Grams \nand Senator Kohl and Senator Domenici and Senator Fitzgerald, but I \nalso know of the position of the Senate on this issue, and Senator \nJeffords and Senator Leahy were able to produce a majority of the \nSenate, although neither side could produce a 60-vote margin to break a \nfilibuster.\n  So all I want to say today is that while this legislation, I believe, \nis going to pass, we should not stop at this point. We should look for \na better way to do this. We should look for a way to get away from \ncompacts and a way to get away from the type of Government controls we \nnow have.\n  Do I have a magic solution? Can I guarantee by the first week in \nFebruary this will be resolved? No. I have been wrangling around with \nthis for 20 years, as the Senator in the Chair, who was chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee, tried mightily and could not find the solution.\n  But I am committed here today to work with those who believe we \nshould not be doing this to find a way to do it better. I know the \nSenators on the other side will fight tenaciously against that, but I \nwant the Record to reflect my true feelings on this and reflect my \ncommitment that we are not going to leave it on this line.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks made \nby the distinguished majority leader. He noted that this is a matter of \ngreat import to many Senators, including those from the Northeast. They \nhave made their position known, and I respect that position.\n  I have also indicated to them personally, and I have said publicly, \nthat I do not support compacts. I do not support the Northeast Dairy \nCompact. I do not believe it is good economic policy. I think the \nprocess that allowed the Northeast Dairy Compact in H.R. 1402 to be \ninserted in the budget process was flawed and wrong and unfair. This \nisn't the way we ought to deal with complex and extraordinarily \nimportant economic policy affecting not hundreds or thousands but \nmillions of rural Americans.\n  I oppose compacts in any form, but I especially oppose them when they \nare\n\n[[Page S14961]]\n\nloaded into a bill without the opportunity of a good debate, without \nthe opportunity of votes, without the opportunity of amendment.\n  We will come back to this issue. We must revisit this question. We \nmust find a way by which to assure that all views are taken into \naccount, and all sections of the country are treated fairly.\n  In this case, the two Senators from Wisconsin in particular, and the \nSenators from Minnesota, Wellstone and Grams, were not treated fairly. \nI do not fault anybody. These things happen. Senator Lott and I have to \ndeal with a lot of different challenges and issues. He and I have \nadmitted that we wished this could have been done differently. Those \nfour Senators were not treated fairly. I applaud them for coming to the \nfloor to express themselves, and to say in as emphatic a way as they \ncan, as eloquently as they have, how important this matter is to them \nand how determined they are to see it resolved.\n  My hat is off to them. I thank them. I also thank them for their \ncooperation in working with us to come up with a way to resolve this. \nIt is one thing to throw things and to stomp up and down and to cause \nall kinds of havoc. Anyone can do that. But it takes courage, it takes \ncharacter, it takes class to say, look, in spite of the fact that we \nwere not treated fairly, we are going to work with you to assure that \npeople in other circumstances will be treated more fairly. I thank them \nfor that.\n  Again, I appreciate the majority leader's comments in acknowledging \nthe unfairness of this and ensuring that we will deal with it \nappropriately at a later date.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I enter this colloquy because I want to \ngive a little bit of historical perspective, as chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield briefly.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that this colloquy extend for not \nto exceed 10 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it may take a little longer. We are in \nan accommodating mode, thanks to our colleagues.\n  Mr. REID. If I could say to the majority leader, we have a number of \npeople, Senator Lugar, Senator Gramm, Senator Byrd, who----\n  Mr. LOTT. I think it would help if I withdraw that and urge my \ncolleagues, be profound but succinct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Indiana has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The history of this situation goes back to the farm bill \nof 1996. At that time, the dairy provisions were the final issue to be \ncompromised. At that time, the House and the Senate agreed upon a New \nEngland dairy compact for 2 years. The 2 years were to end September \n30, 1998. During that time, the USDA was charged with the need to \nreform the entire dairy system and reduce the number of the \narrangements for pricing from roughly 38 to 13.\n\n  USDA acted this year. The Secretary promulgated some reforms that \nmoved toward more of a market system. Likewise, the Secretary did not \nmake further comment about the compacts because, under the law, they \nwere supposed to be gone at this point. Obviously, they have not \ndisappeared. A similar legislative predicament last year gave a wedge \nfor the compacts to continue for another year in New England. \nObviously, as the leaders have described it, that situation has \noccurred once again.\n  Let me say, as chairman of the Agriculture Committee, we would like \nto reclaim the issue. It is in our jurisdiction. It is not in the \njurisdiction of the people who worked this out. They had no right to do \nthis. They have been widely condemned for doing it. There has been no \ndebate on the compacts in our committee or on the floor, except for the \nag bill. And they should have been gone by September 30, 1998, under \nthose provisions. Likewise, although the House did decide to disagree \nwith the Secretary of Agriculture, the Senate did not. The Senate did \nnot have debate on this and, the fact is, the leadership of the \ncommittee wrote to commend our Secretary of Agriculture in a bipartisan \nway.\n  Let me reassure the distinguished Senators from Wisconsin and \nMinnesota that the Agriculture Committee of the Senate will be eager to \ntake up legislation that deals definitively with this situation. It \nwill require a majority of the committee and a majority of this body \nand, likewise, some cooperation from the House. But that is the proper \nway to proceed. A suggestion has been made that we ought to be heard as \na Senate. I suggest that that is the way we will follow.\n  We will entertain legislation with regard to these issues at the \nearliest possible time and ask for the support of Senators who are here \non the floor involved in this colloquy to help us in that quest.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, let me say a few words. I would like to say \nmore about this man from Wisconsin but time constraints will not allow \nme to do that.\n  He is the Stonewall Jackson of Wisconsin. He stands like a stone \nwall. If I had the voice of Jove, I would shout from the ends of the \nearth. Yet I would not be able to move this man, Herb Kohl, when he \ntakes a determined stand. He has been talking with me time and time \nagain about this issue that is so important to him and the people of \nWisconsin. He has been absolutely indefatigable; he has been \nunshakable, and I salute him. He has stood up for the people of \nWisconsin. That is what I like about him. He stands for principle. He \nstands for his people.\n  I have been criticized many times for standing for my people in West \nVirginia. Who sends me here? They do. The distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin feels the same way. He is courteous; he doesn't talk very \nmuch or very loud; but he always listens. Always, when I have had a \nproblem affecting my State in particular, he has listened. I sat down \nin his office with him and talked with him. So I listen to him. I \nsalute him. The people of Wisconsin have a real treasure in Herb Kohl, \nand I have a real treasure in Herb Kohl as a friend. I want him to know \nthat at any future time when this issue comes up, he knows the number \nof my office, the number on my telephone. I will be glad to see him, \ntalk with him, and help him in his fight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today stunned by the \naddition of harmful dairy provisions in the final appropriations bill. \nThis omnibus bill contains another extension of the Northeast Dairy \nCompact for 24 months--which I consider the most brazen attempt in my \nmemory as a member of Congress to steal and move an industry from one \nregion of the country to another. This economic power grab is \nalternatively characterized as a matter of states' rights, a way to \nguarantee a fresh supply of milk to local consumers, a means to ensure \nlower-priced milk to consumers, and a means to help the small family \nfarmer survive. All of these arguments are false--a thinly veiled \ndisguise to cover the truth, which is that this is an unvarnished \neconomic power grab of major proportions.\n  But first, I would like to explain what dairy compacts are, and \nexplain why they are so destructive to the heart of dairy production in \nAmerica and the Upper Midwest. The Northeast Dairy Compact raises the \nprice of Class I fluid milk above the prevailing federal milk marketing \norder price within the participating states, and, I might add, above \nwhat the market would pay. Milk processors have to pay the higher price \nfor the raw milk they process, and this higher price is passed along to \nthe consumer at the grocery store. With higher prices, consumption goes \ndown, and children are the biggest losers. I don't argue against a fair \nprice or honest price--for any dairy farmer in Minnesota or Vermont or \nany other state. But I cannot support price- fixing schemes that \nlegislatively transfer market share.\n\n[[Page S14962]]\n\n  The Northeast Compact was authorized in 1996 during consideration of \nthe larger Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act. This \ncontroversial issue was inserted in the conference committee, avoiding \na separate vote, after the measure had been overwhelmingly defeated on \nthe floor. While most of the FAIR Act was designed to help farmers \ncompete in world markets and reduce government involvement in \nagriculture, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact established a \nregional price-fixing cartel within our very own country. The Northeast \nDairy Compact has harmed dairy farmers in Minnesota, and this kind of \nunfair subsidy should be terminated. We should not be passing laws that \nwill have such a harmful impact on any American. This compact does.\n  When this issue came to the fore, compacts were roundly condemned in \nthe major newspapers of the compact region. The New York Times, Boston \nHerald, the Connecticut Post, and the Hartford Courant all weighed in \nagainst the cartel, in addition to publications such as USA Today and \nthe Washington Post.\n  Again, compacts were hardly consensus legislation to begin with. The \nHouse refused to put the provision in its broader farm bill. And I must \nreiterate, the Senate voted on the floor to strip the Compact language \nfrom its bill. Despite these defeats, the compact provision was slipped \ninto the bill in conference and signed by the President. The Compact \nlegislation could not withstand the scrutiny of a fair debate on the \nfloor, and had to be muscled in at the last minute in conference, just \nas we've seen with this attempted extension today. Knowing that this \nscheme was a bad idea from the start, Congress limited the life of the \ncompact, and that is why compact proponents asked for an extension and \ncould only achieve an extension sneaked into an omnibus bill as we are \nabout to head out of town for the session.\n  Retail prices of milk jumped immediately after the higher Compact \nprice was implemented. As predicted, the milk produced in New England \nincreased by four times the national rate of increase in a six-month \nperiod following Compact implementation. The surplus milk was converted \ninto milk powder, leading to a 60% increase in milk powder production. \nThat surplus directly harms dairy farmers in Minnesota and Wisconsin, \ndriving down prices and demand in the Midwest.\n  Soon after implementation, the Northeast Compact had to begin \nreimbursing school food service programs for the increases in cost \ncaused by the milk price hikes; an admission that prices have gone up \nand consumers are being affected. However, low-income families that \nneed milk in their diet are not being reimbursed by the Compact for \ntheir increased costs. Milk is a food staple, and one of the healthiest \nfoods we have. Are we going to permit the extension of this milk tax \nthat hits low- income citizens hardest? Are we going to continue a food \ntax on the group of citizens who spend the highest percentage of their \nincome on food? What's next, a special tax on bread, eggs, ground beef, \nor potatoes? But that won't happen--Why? Because it would be unfair, \njust as this compact cartel is unfair. Consider the low-income families \nwith small children and the elderly on fixed incomes in your state and \nask if this is the population you want bearing the brunt of this \nregressive milk tax.\n\n  Despite all of the discrediting information about dairy compacts, \nmembers continue to contemplate extending for the second time this bad \npolicy that was initially only to be ``temporary'' assistance to \nNortheast producers. Everyone who truly understands this issue admits \nthat compacts are harmful for consumers and for American agriculture, \nbut somehow we can't muster the political will to say no to the \nentrenched interests that support the compact. Thus, we keep hitting \nthe snooze button--preferring to ``temporarily'' extend bad policy \nrather than addressing it on a policy basis. What is even more \negregious is other regions of the country are promoting compacts for \nthemselves to tap into these goodies at the expense of other regions of \nthe country such as the Upper Midwest. And again would force consumers \nto pay unfair high prices for milk.\n  This is really Economics 101. If you artificially raise the price \nreceived for a commodity, you can count on more being produced. Where \ndoes the excess go? It goes into areas where there isn't a floor price, \nand that excess production depresses the price that producers in my \nstate receive. It's really not that hard to understand, despite the \nsentimental arguments that compact supporters use to cloud the real \nissues at play in this debate. Again, we are trying to knock down or \nreduce trade barriers around the world to open markets and give our \nfarmers a level playing field to compete, but would erect these same \nbarriers to trade inside our own borders that will not allow dairy \nfarmers in the Midwest to fairly compete.\n  As I said earlier, I must address some of these urban myths about the \nbenefits of compacts, myths that are so often repeated around here by \ncolleagues that they have become difficult to distinguish from the \ntruth. One of these claims is that compacts are somehow a matter of \n``states' rights,'' and that compacts make an important contribution \ntoward devolving power back to the states.\n  The fact is that regulation of interstate commerce is a power \nspecifically delegated to Congress in Article I, Section 8 of the \nConstitution, which states that Congress shall have power ``to regulate \ncommerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with \nthe Indian tribes.''\n  Regulation of interstate commerce was one of the chief reasons our \ncountry's founders abandoned the Articles of Confederation and moved to \nadopt the Constitution. I consider it one of the great ironies of this \ndebate when I hear colleagues claim that the dairy compact issue boils \ndown to ``states' rights.''\n  Professor Burt Neuborne, a constitutional law professor at the New \nYork University School of Law, in testimony before a subcommittee of \nthe House Judiciary Committee, noted that the chief motive for the \nFounding Fathers' decision to abandon the Articles of Confederation in \nfavor of the Constitution was to foster a free market of trade within \nthe United States. Under the weaker Articles of Confederation that \nentrusted commerce powers in the states, states enacted price controls \nto protect high-cost producers from competition from other regions of \nthe country. The Constitution corrected this problem by empowering \nCongress to regulate interstate commerce. According to Professor \nNeuborne,\n\n       At the close of the Revolution, the thirteen original \n     states experimented with a loose confederation that delegated \n     power over foreign affairs to a national government, but \n     retained power over virtually everything else at the state \n     and local level. The lack of a national power to regulate \n     interstate Commerce led to the eruption of a series of trade \n     wars, pitting states and regions against one another in a \n     mutually destructive spiral . . .\n\n  United States Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson, reviewing \nthe history of the Commerce Clause in a 1949 opinion, stated that:\n\n       The sole purpose for which Virginia initiated the movement \n     which ultimately produced the Constitution was 'to take into \n     consideration the trade of the United States; to examine the \n     relative situations of trade of said States; to consider how \n     far a uniform system in their commercial regulations may be \n     necessary to their common interest and their permanent \n     harmony' and for that purpose the General Assembly of \n     Virginia in January of 1786 named commissioners and proposed \n     their meeting with those from other states. The desire of the \n     Forefathers to federalize regulation of foreign and \n     interstate commerce stands in sharp contrast to their jealous \n     preservation of the state's power over its internal affairs. \n     No other federal power was so universally assumed to be \n     necessary, no other state power was so readily relinquished. \n     [As Madison] indicated, ``want of a general power over \n     Commerce led to an exercise of this power separately, by the \n     states, (which) not only proved abortive, but engendered \n     rival, conflicting, and angry regulations.''\n\n  Continuing to quote again from Professor Neuborne,\n\n       James Madison noted that the single most important \n     achievement of the Constitutional Convention was to rescue \n     the nation from a continuation of the parochial trade wars \n     that had marred the first ten years of its existence and \n     threatened its future permanent harmony. . .. Congress should \n     reflect on the fact that Madison's understanding of the \n     relationship between economic protectionism and the erosion \n     of political unity was brilliantly prescient. One of the \n     Founders' enduring insights was that regional economic \n     protectionism is ultimately corrosive of national political \n     unity. To prevent economic\n\n[[Page S14963]]\n\n     regionalism, the Founders imposed a constitutional \n     prohibition on state and regional efforts to discriminate \n     against goods and services produced elsewhere in the nation. \n     To tamper with that constitutional prohibition is to tamper \n     with the mainspring of the nation's political and economic \n     fabric.\n\n  Professor Neuborne's research on the topic of interstate compacts, \nwhich originate under Congress' grant of power in Article I, Section \n10, revealed that prior to the Northeast Regional Dairy Compact, \nCongress had never granted the compact power to enable states to engage \nin economic protectionism. Two hundred ninety-nine times before, the \ncompact power had been used for a constitutionally legitimate purpose. \nOnly now, with the advent of the dairy compact, has Congress ever \ncontorted the meaning of Article I, Section 10 as an opportunity to set \nup a protectionist, multi-state cartel, in direct conflict with the \nCommerce Clause of the Constitution.\n  The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that by granting to Congress \nthe power to regulate interstate commerce via Article I, Section 8, the \nConstitution carries with it a negative implication precluding the \nstates from engaging in protectionist schemes that favor local economic \ninterests at the expense of national competitors.\n  Mr. President, are we not in fact returning to the very types of \nbehavior that the Constitution was in large part designed to remedy? \nAre we really willing to pit region against region, and create \nprotectionist regimes, under the guise of dairy compacts, even within \nour own country?\n  The next pro-compact argument I would like to address is the claim \nthat the compact is necessary to guarantee an ``adequate supply of \nfresh, locally produced milk'' to consumers. As I have said before, I \nbelieve the constant refrain that compact supporters are merely trying \nto guarantee an ``adequate supply of fresh, locally produced milk'' is \na calculated deception designed to mislead consumers into believing \nthat without this legislation, there may not be a consistent supply of \nmilk in the grocer's dairy case. This is simply false our nation \nproduces three times more milk than it consumes as a beverage. And I \nshould note that Minnesota farmers have not come to the federal \ngovernment asking for pricing advantages so they can grow oranges or \nlemons and guarantee Minnesota consumers a quote ``adequate supply of \nfresh, locally produced citrus.'' Minnesota farmers want to produce \nwhat they produce best, which are dairy products, and they can deliver \nthem to the consumer much cheaper, too.\n\n  In fact, some compact supporters have the audacity to claim that \nwithout a compact, the region would pay more for milk as high shipping \ncosts for imported milk was factored into the price. This is also \nfalse. If local producers can sell a product for less than their \ncompetitors, then they would have no need of a compact. They could keep \ntheir markets by beating the price of the competition. But the truth \nis, high quality milk can be trucked into New England at the peak of \nfreshness and at less cost than it can be produced in most New England \nstates.\n  Compact supporters also claim that the compacts are necessary to save \nthe small, family dairy farm. Interestingly enough, according to USDA \nfigures, the average dairy herd size is 85 head in Vermont, while in \nMinnesota it's 57 head. This means that herd sizes in Vermont are \nalmost 50% larger than those in Minnesota. So much for the idea that \nthe compact is protecting dairy producers from competing against large, \nMidwestern dairy farmers. This is just one of the distortions that I \nhave had to deal with in this dairy debate, and I'm tired of the hard-\nworking dairy farmers in Minnesota being labeled as, quote, ``corporate \ndairy farmers.'' The average Minnesota dairy farmer grazes a 57-head \nherd on 160 acres. I know Minnesota dairy farmers don't want to \nconsolidate into larger and larger operations; they just want a level \nplaying field where they can earn enough to support their families and \ncontinue to do something they love to do. I would ask my opponents to \nplease not cloak the dairy cartels with the mantle of supposedly \nhelping the little guy against encroaching agribusiness conglomerates. \nThe hard evidence shows that on average, the wealthy, large producers \nare not, I repeat, not, in the Midwest, and the rich will only get \nricher if a compact extension gets rammed through the Senate.\n  Mr. President, not only are certain members of this Congress trying \nto impose expensive dairy compacts on the American consumer, but they \nare also trying to strong-arm through milk marketing order changes that \nadversely impact both Upper Midwest producers in the dairy heartland of \nAmerica and low-income consumers. I also want to review how we have \narrived at this point today where Congress is trying not only through \ncompacts but through the milk marketing order system, to blatantly \nseize market share from dairy producers in one area of the country and \ngive it to producers in another. This bill not only hits Midwest \nproducers once, but twice.\n  The current milk marketing system requires processors to pay higher \nminimum prices for fluid milk the further the region is located from \nEau Claire, Wisconsin. To reform this antiquated, Depression-era method \nfor supplying milk to consumers, which basically picks winners and \nlosers in the dairy industry, Congress, through the 1996 FAIR Act, \nrequired USDA to significantly reduce the number of milk marketing \norders, and transition to a more market-oriented system of milk \ndistribution. After many months of study and having received comments \nfrom hundreds of market participants, USDA proposed Options 1-A and 1-\nB. The Option 1-A proposal made minimal changes to the old marketing \norder pricing system, while Option 1-B contained some basic free market \nreforms and modernizations of the system. The Upper Midwest did not \nlike what it saw in 1-B, actually, and liked the compromise even less, \nbut it was a small step in the right direction, and we supported it as \na compromise.\n  The compromise came after the USDA received testimony concerning the \ntwo alternatives, and, as I said previously, the final rule takes steps \ntoward simplifying and modernizing the milk marketing order system. As \nan Option 1-B supporter, I hoped for a proposal closer to 1-B, but \naccepted the need for compromise and, again, supported it. \nImplementation of the new compromise orders has unfortunately been \npostponed by a lawsuit in federal court.\n  Option 1-A is basically no reform, and would ignore the direction of \nCongress in the FAIR Act. It would increase prices for consumers, \naffecting most the low-income consumers that spend a high percentage of \ntheir wages on food. Option 1-A also keeps in place a regionally \ndiscriminatory milk pricing system that benefits producers in some \nparts of the country at the expense of dairy farmers in other regions, \nmuch like compacts. Again, it's a government program that picks winners \nand losers, not allowing the market to set the prices. It is opposed by \nfree market taxpayer advocacy groups, consumer groups, regional \nproducer groups, and processor groups, and it does nothing to protect \nthe nation's supply of fresh fluid milk. Our nation produces an \nabundance of milk that is sufficient to supply consumers' needs.\n\n  Secretary Glickman, writing about the final rule, said that:\n\n       USDA's own analysis shows that nationally, dairy farmers \n     will realize virtually the same cash receipts under the new, \n     fairer plan as they do now, and when aggregated, the all-milk \n     price will remain essentially unchanged from that under the \n     existing program, which virtually all sides agree sorely \n     needs changing[.]\n\nMoreover, Agriculture Committee Chairman Lugar said that the final \ncompromise rule ``is a good first step toward a policy that places the \nnation's dairy industry in a position to better meet the challenges of \nthe global markets of the new century[.]''\n  What we also need to ask ourselves is why are we considering these \ncontroversial issues without going through the committee process, with \nfull hearings and testimony? The Agriculture Committee has jurisdiction \nover milk marketing orders; nonetheless, we are here today trying to \ncircumvent that jurisdiction.\n  Again, the final rule is a compromise, not the best for either 1A or \n1B advocates but a middle ground. We should not rush to reverse a \nprocess that took months to complete in order to replace it with 1A. \nAdoption of 1A would in effect maintain the status quo that, again, \nheavily favors some dairy farms at the expense of others. And please\n\n[[Page S14964]]\n\ndon't look at this debate as a mere balance sheet of who wins and who \nloses, or count votes that way. Remember that the Upper Midwest has \nbeen at a price disadvantage for more than sixty years, and this reform \nwas only a modest, and, in fact, inadequate, attempt to correct the \nunfairness. Compacts are bad enough, but retaining these failed dairy \npolicies of the past on top of that is incomprehensible.\n  Currently 85% of the milk produced in the Midwest goes into \nmanufacturing. When other regions of the country receive higher Class I \ndifferentials, the excess production spills into Midwestern markets and \nlowers the prices that our producers receive. Artificially inflated \nprices will always, always, always increase production. You can count \non it like the sun rising in the morning. And by artificially inflating \nmilk prices in areas of the country that are not particularly suitable \nto dairy production, Congress is literally trying to micro-manage where \nAmerica's milk will be produced, and to take away dairy markets from \nthe Upper Midwest.\n  No other product receives the same kind of discriminatory pricing \ntreatment that milk does in our country. The Upper Midwest can produce \nmilk for a third less than some regions of the country. Why should the \nfamily farmers in the Upper Midwest not be allowed to benefit from the \ncomparative advantage they have in milk production?\n  Some will claim that the compromise reform will cost the dairy \nfarmers across the country $200 million. This is not true. Actually, \naccording to a USDA study, net farm income will be higher under the \ncompromise rule in comparison to the status quo. And the Food and \nAgricultural Policy Research Institute at Iowa State, an agricultural \npolicy research group, concluded that 60% of the nation's dairy farmers \nwould receive more income under the USDA plan.\n  Some supporters of H.R. 1402 (the legislation upon which these \nprovisions now before us are based) also make the same argument as \ndairy compact proponents that if we do not implement H.R. 1402 then \nmilk will be produced by agribusiness, or that further farm \nconsolidations will occur. Going back to the USDA figures, North \nCarolina, whose congressional delegation has argued strenuously for the \nreversion to Option 1A, has an almost 20% larger per head average dairy \nfarm size than my home state of Minnesota. Of course, Minnesota is part \nof one of the regions of the country that the opposition tries to \ndemonize as the center of corporate dairy farming. Proof that this is \nnot a battle between, quote, ``small family dairy farms'' and large \nMidwestern dairy farms only gets more striking. New York, a state that \nhas also seen significant political support for H.R. 1402, has an \naverage herd size per dairy farm that is 37% larger than Minnesota's. \nGeorgia's average herd size is 72% larger than Minnesota's, and \nFlorida's average herd size is four times larger than my home state's. \nLike the dairy compact argument, so much for the idea that we are \nsaving the family farmer through passage of H.R. 1402.\n\n  As an aside, because of the blatant unfairness of the system, and \nbecause the efforts of Upper Midwesterners to compromise in good faith \nhave been ignored, forcing us to fight these last minute riders and \nstrong-arm tactics, I have recently introduced legislation to totally \nderegulate the milk marketing order system, effective upon the date of \nenactment. This milk marketing order system is a relic from the past. \nIt's a byzantine arrangement of complicated pricing formulas that looks \nlike something conceived in 1980s Eastern Europe. It's time to tear \nthis entire decaying, outdated infrastructure down, and start anew with \nan even playing field on which all producers can compete. That's what \nmy legislation does, and I ask my colleagues who believe in fair trade \nand a fair shake for hard working farmers to sign on as cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, the dairy compact and the other dairy provisions \nattached to this legislation are anti-competitive, anti-consumer, \nunprincipled, and an affront to the family dairy farmers in my state. \nTo be candid, I'm thoroughly disgusted by this entire turn of events. \nWe have sacrificed any basic sense of fairness during this process. \nThese provisions have been added at the last minute, behind closed \ndoors because they won't survive the scrutiny of public debate. Because \nof the blatant injustice that is being done to Minnesota farmers, I am \ncommitted to joining my Upper Midwest colleagues in doing all I can do \nto ensure that this legislation does not reach the President's desk.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to read several newspaper editorials \nthat have been written across the country in opposition to dairy \ncompacts and H.R. 1402.\n  To begin, from the March 15, 1997 edition of The New York Times:\n\n       Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman blundered last year when \n     he approved a dairy cartel in the Northeast that would jack \n     up consumer prices by perhaps 25 percent. . . . The Dairy \n     cartel, also called a compact, would control the production \n     and distribution of milk in New England, raising its price by \n     between 13 and 35 cents a gallon. That would pump money into \n     the bank accounts of the region's 3,600 dairy farmers by \n     pushing prices back up to last year's sky-high levels. But it \n     would hit 13 million consumers in Maine, Vermont, New \n     Hampshire, Connecticut and Rhode Island with an added cost of \n     up to $100 million. Poor parents, who spend about twice as \n     much of their income on food as do non-poor families, would \n     suffer the most. Food stamps would buy less milk and other \n     dairy products. High milk prices would also raise the cost of \n     national, state and local nutrition programs. With Washington \n     cutting money for welfare, food stamps and other poverty \n     programs, this is no time to impose needless costs on the \n     poor. It will be hard for Mr. Glickman to admit he erred when \n     he approved the cartel. But it would be even harder on \n     parents to pay more for their children's milk.\n\n  From the March 2, 1998 USA Today:\n\n       Imagine being a widget maker in Georgia or New Hampshire \n     with a federal guarantee that assures you a higher price for \n     your product than widget makers in Wisconsin or Iowa. Sounds \n     incredible, huh?\n       Imagine being a cattle raiser in Florida or Oregon with a \n     guaranteed price for your beef that's better than what \n     ranchers in Texas or Nebraska can get. Impossible? Yes--but \n     only because you're producing widgets or hamburger. If you're \n     in the milk industry, it's business as usual.\n       Pressured by the dairy industry, the government maintains a \n     Depression-era formula that makes some cows (and their \n     owners) more equal than others, depending on where they live. \n     Millions of consumers and taxpayers pay the price; higher \n     milk costs for themselves, higher taxes for government-bought \n     milk for schools and other programs. . . .\n       Apologists for government control claim the program is \n     necessary to keep farmers in business and assure a supply of \n     milk. The number of dairy cows plunged from 23.6 million in \n     1940 to 9.4 million in 1996; farms with dairy cows dropped \n     from 4.7 million in 1940 to 155,300 in 1992. But the milk \n     produced per cow has nearly quadrupled. U.S. milk \n     production is up from 109 billion pounds in 1940 to a \n     projected 162 billion pounds in 2000, despite a 60% \n     reduction in the number of cows. And while sales of \n     cheese, cream and speciality products like eggnog and \n     yogurt are up, U.S. demand for liquid milk has been \n     essentially flat for more than 20 years.\n       Yet dairy farmers continue to get special privileges, \n     eluding even the 1996 ``Freedom to Farm'' law that committed \n     the government to phasing out price supports and market \n     manipulation for corn, soybeans, wheat and other commodities. \n     . . . Aggressive dairy lobbies in state capitals from \n     Louisiana to New York are pressing to form or enlarge new \n     regional compacts that permit even more manipulation of milk \n     prices at the consumer's expense--adding up to 15 or 20 cents \n     a gallon. That's on top of the indefensible marketing orders, \n     which inflate retail milk prices by at least $1.5 billion a \n     year for a program that isn't needed. Congress abolished \n     ``welfare as we know it'' for mothers and children. Welfare \n     for cows and dairy farmers should end as well.\n\n  The next editorial shows that though the compacts are ostensibly put \nin place to help small dairy farms, they have failed to do so, and \nexist as subsidies to large New England operations. Following are \nexcerpts from a July 19, 1999 Boston Globe editorial:\n\n       Dairy farming in New England, especially in Massachusetts \n     has been a chancy proposition for small, family-run \n     operation. . . . Congress, which must soon decide whether to \n     extend the system's enabling legislation, should modify it to \n     focus more closely on smaller farms rather than lavishing \n     money on larger operations that are fully capable of \n     competing in a tough economic environment. Congress should \n     also resist the temptation to expand the system to other \n     parts of the country. . . .\n       The rescue effort now in place is a federally sanctioned \n     system of mandated price supports, which amount to about 14 \n     cents a gallon. In Massachusetts this generates $40 million \n     annually, but only $2 million goes to Massachusetts farmers, \n     with most of the balance going to Vermont farms, many of \n     which are larger and have lower costs. Massachusetts's \n     agriculture commissioner, Jay Healy, has proposed limiting \n     the subsidy to a fixed level of production, about 1.5 million \n     gallons of milk annually, which is typical for smaller farms.\n\n\n[[Page S14965]]\n\n\n  Concluding with an excerpt from the editorial, it says:\n\n       Even the New England system provides more subsidies than \n     are needed to achieve its objective. The funds that now go to \n     larger farms would be more effective if they were used to \n     increase small-farmer subsidies, typically $3,000 to $4,000 \n     per farm.\n\n  Now, I must disagree with the editorialist's assessment that the \nsubsidies should be continued, but I find it very significant that even \nin New England they recognize that since the subsidy does not \nspecifically target the smaller farms, it disproportionately helps the \nlarger operations because the subsidy is based upon the volume \nproduced. It should not be surprising that efforts to cap the subsidy \nto a fixed level of production have been successfully resisted by the \nlarge dairy farms in New England.\n  The next editorial I will read is from the April 27, 1999 edition of \nthe Houston Chronicle:\n\n       The Texas House of Representatives recently approved a bill \n     that seeks to raise milk prices and deprive Texans of the \n     benefits of competition. The Senate need not reflect long \n     before rejecting it. House Bill 2000 would require Texas to \n     join the Southern Dairy Compact, which sets the minimum price \n     for milk paid to producers in its member states. The minimum \n     price inevitably would be higher than the price Texans pay in \n     a competitive market.\n\n  I should note at this point that Congress has not in fact authorized \nthe Southern Dairy Compact, and if common sense, prevails, it won't. \nCongress has arbitrarily chosen New England consumers to pay the milk \ntax, and New England producers to receive it.\n  Again continuing with the Houston Chronicle article:\n\n       Texas dairy farmers are producing all the milk that Texas \n     families and dairy product manufacturers need and more. There \n     is no reason why state government should make families pay \n     more for the milk, ice cream and other dairy products they \n     buy. The state purpose of House Bill 2000 is to preserve \n     family dairy farms and ensure a supply of fresh milk. But \n     history shows that milk price controls heighten the financial \n     advantage enjoyed by the largest producers without sustaining \n     uneconomical small farms.\n       Furthermore, anyone who thinks Texas needs added government \n     regulation to provide a reliable milk supply has not seen the \n     dairy cases at the supermarket that are filled to overflowing \n     with milk and dairy products of every description. Why change \n     a system that provides ample supply and variety at the lowest \n     possible price? Adding Texas to the Southern Dairy Compact \n     would do little to help Texas milk producers, but it would \n     deprive Texas dairy product manufacturers of an advantage \n     they enjoy over competitors in state where the price of milk \n     is controlled.\n       This bill is bad for consumers, bad for manufacturers and \n     bad for the taxpayers who pay for or subsidize milk consumed \n     by schoolchildren, prisoners, patients in public hospitals \n     and food stamp recipients. Few bills could provide more \n     reason to reject them than the authors of House Bill 2000 \n     have provided.\n\n  The next editorial is from the June 15, 1999 edition of the \nPhiladelphia Inquirer:\n\n       In 1996, Congress revamped federal farm laws, intending to \n     ratchet down government's intrusion in agriculture. But a \n     bill now pending would use that law to create regional \n     cartels that would set artificially high prices for milk. \n     Pennsylvania consumers should be lobbying lawmakers against \n     this move. Despite the fact that the state's outdated milk-\n     board system already sets minimum milk prices--but no \n     maximum--the legislature last week allowed Pennsylvania to \n     join the cartel known as the Northeast Interstate Dairy \n     Compact.\n       Consumers here who consistently pay more for milk than in \n     neighboring states should wince at the prospect of a regional \n     price-fixing body imposing still higher prices. Here's how it \n     works: Congress established the Northeast compact under the \n     1996 act, an agreement among six New England states to prop \n     up milk prices in an effort to save small dairy farms. When \n     milk prices on the open market fall below a ceratin target \n     price, the compact states tack a surcharge onto milk. The \n     extra revenue is passed back to farmers; the higher milk \n     price gets passed along to consumers.\n       The compact is set to expire October 1, but a bill \n     introduced in April would make it permanent and expand it to \n     include six more states, including Pennsylvania. What's \n     worse, the bill also would establish a Southern Dairy \n     Compact, which could include up to 15 more states. Already \n     the Northeast compact has raised milk prices by almost 20 \n     cents a gallon since its inception. By federal and state law, \n     the compact could raise milk prices in Pennsylvania by about \n     70 cents a gallon, consumer groups warn. The logic behind the \n     original legislation, to save small dairy farms, had some \n     appeal. Dairy farms nationwide have been going out of \n     business, usually because they are acquired by larger \n     producers, at an average rate of 5.1% a year in the 1990s, \n     experts say.\n       But that doesn't prove the compact would protect small \n     farmers; it may hurt them. Larger dairy farms which produce \n     the most milk reap the most benefit in subsidies from the \n     compact. Alarmed by the potential harm both to middle-class \n     consumers and low-income families, various groups are \n     protesting the new bill. Nutrition and consumer groups, \n     government-spending watchdogs and milk processors and \n     retailers all have lined up against the concept. Congress \n     should reject this attempt to extend the counterproductive \n     intrusion on the workings of the free market. Let the milk \n     cartel die.\n\n  The following editorial is from the January 5, 1999 issue of Newsday:\n\n       Despite a few new consumer protections that made the deal \n     acceptable to the Democratic Assembly, the state should not \n     have allowed New York's dairy farmers to join a regional milk \n     cartel. This sour stuff will keep the wholesale price of milk \n     artificially high, forcing processors and retailers to pass \n     the cost on to consumers. The hit will fall hardest on the \n     poorest parents who buy milk for their children. And it's not \n     clear now much it will help the small farm owners most in \n     need.\n       Besides, there are other ways to help dairy farmers that \n     wouldn't necessarily push up milk prices in markets. The \n     state, for instance, could cut or subsidize a variety of \n     taxes about which farmers have complained. Meanwhile, \n     wholesale milk prices are at a record high, easing some \n     pressure on farmers. Entrance into the Northeast Interstate \n     Dairy Compact would tie New York's farmers into a New England \n     cartel designed to keep prices higher when they otherwise \n     would collapse. Rather than benefit from lower prices, \n     consumers would pay the higher ones when wholesale prices \n     soar. And the law's cap on retail prices is so high that, \n     barring severe inflation, it won't ever be reached. Schools \n     are protected but not other nonprofits. Now, there's only \n     one way to stop this deal. Congress has to approve it. It \n     shouldn't.''\n\n  This next editorial is from the April 4, 1999 edition of The Atlanta \nJournal-Constitution:\n\n       Since the federal Freedom to Farm Act was passed in 1996, \n     the U.S. government has been trying to wean the nation's \n     farmers, including the dairy industry, from government price \n     supports and other subsidies that interfere with the workings \n     of the free market. Unfortunately, the dairy industry is \n     trying to undo that progress by pressuring Congress and \n     states such as Georgia to approve interstate dairy compacts. \n     If the industry succeeds in that lobbying campaign, consumers \n     will have to pay higher prices for a basic food commodity \n     essential for good health.\n       The compacts, if approved would essentially establish legal \n     cartels for dairy farmers and allow the cartels to set milk \n     prices higher than the market would otherwise allow. In \n     Georgia, dairy farmers have rammed through the recent session \n     of the General Assembly a bill allowing them to join the \n     Southern Dairy Compact. The same bill was passed a year ago \n     by the General Assembly but was vetoed by Gov. Zell Miller, \n     who noted that it might be unconstitutional and would \n     certainly raise costs for consumers. The decision whether to \n     sign the latest bill rests with Miller's successor, Roy \n     Barnes.\n       Barnes was elected last year in part by portraying himself \n     as a consumers' advocate. If he honors the philosophy, he too \n     should recognize the dairy compact as nothing more than a \n     back-door tax increase and veto it accordingly. Government \n     should not use its power to guarantee any business or \n     industry a profit.\n       A dairy compact already exists in New England. After it was \n     enacted in 1997, the price of milk rose from $2.54 and \n     fluctuated to a high of $3.21 a gallon. Milk prices there \n     initially jumped about 20 cents a gallon, enough to generate \n     an additional $46.7 million for dairy farmers in less than \n     two years. Not surprisingly, New England dairy farmers see \n     the compact as a safety net designed to prevent their profits \n     from dropping too dramatically.\n       Those who actually pay higher prices, however, see it as \n     little more than a special-interest tax increase that will \n     only hurt consumers, particularly the poor, the elderly and \n     those on fixed incomes. Milk prices go up and down monthly \n     all over the country, but when prices drop significantly in \n     the spring and fall, they only drop slightly in dairy compact \n     states. The savings to the consumer is lost so the dairy \n     farmer can keep a high return on the product.\n       ``It socialism. It's a controlled economy,'' said John \n     Schnittker, an economist with Public Voice for Food and \n     Health Policy. ``Compacts are a really bad deal for \n     consumers. They add about 22 cents a gallon to today's milk \n     price. And they keep paying high prices when prices all over \n     drop.' Nine southern states besides Georgia have already \n     approved creation of a Southern Dairy Compact to mimic the \n     protectionism found in New England. However, that and other \n     proposed compacts must still be approved by Congress, which \n     also has to decide whether to renew the New England Dairy \n     Compact.''\n       Congress should reject both these proposals as unnecessary, \n     counterproductive intrusions on the workings of the free \n     market. However, if Barnes signs the Georgia law and Congress \n     approves the Southern compact, Georgia consumers are stuck. \n     The state can\n\n[[Page S14966]]\n\n     withdraw from the compact only through passage of another law \n     by Congress and then only after a one-year waiting period. \n     Approval of dairy compacts in the South would not suspend the \n     law of supply and demand. It would only distort it. Some \n     economists predict that as a result of higher prices, dairy \n     compacts would reduce milk consumption by 8 percent \n     nationwide. Those most vulnerable would be families with \n     young children, who in many cases are already struggling to \n     make ends meet.\n       Georgia's dairy industry is going through a painful \n     consolidation. The state lost 117 dairy farms over the past \n     four years, and farmers warn that without government \n     protection, more and more milk will have to be imported from \n     other states. However, dairy farms in neighboring states have \n     also been disappearing; the trend toward consolidation is \n     nationwide. Furthermore, milk from Alabama or Tennessee \n     tastes the same as Georgia milk, and today's technology \n     allows quick transport to prevent milk products from \n     spoiling.\n       Free enterprise, competition and the open market have been \n     the economic pillars of the United States' economy for more \n     than 200 years. Every experiment at subsidizing an industry \n     has proven to be a failure, particularly in agriculture. Gov. \n     Roy Barnes should protect Georgia consumers and families by \n     vetoing that state's entry into the Southern Dairy \n     Compact. And Congress should dismiss the entire concept as \n     an unnecessary infringement on free enterprise.\n\n  I also want to share with my colleagues some editorials concerning \nthe milk marketing order system.\n  This editorial is from The Dallas Morning News, dated September 14, \n1999. It says:\n\n       Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura wants Beaumont, Texas to be \n     the center of the dairy universe instead of Eau Claire, \n     Wisconsin. Mr. Ventura knows that there are no dairy cows in \n     Beaumont. Nevertheless, his logic is faultless. That's \n     because federal farm policy dictates that the farther a dairy \n     farmer lives from Eau Claire, the more milk processors must \n     pay him for his milk. Minnesota profits little from the \n     arrangement because it borders Wisconsin. But it is 1,200 \n     miles from Beaumont. So making Beaumont the new Eau Claire \n     makes sense for Minnesota's hard-pressed dairy farmers.\n       In truth, Mr. Ventura favors a free market in agriculture. \n     His facetious advocacy for Beaumont is designed to focus \n     public attention on absurd federal dairy policies, which \n     punish efficient producers and gouge consumers. The United \n     States needs to abandon the Depression-era thinking that led \n     it to calculate milk prices based largely on dairy farms' \n     proximity to Eau Claire. Times have changed; U.S. \n     agricultural policy remains mired in the 1930s.\n       Unfortunately, Congress seems poised to revoke the few \n     tentative reforms that it passed in 1996 and to expand and \n     give extended life to a program that would create consumer-\n     antagonistic milk cartels in sections of the country. A \n     simplified milk-pricing system is supposed to go into effect \n     on October 1. And federal price supports are supposed to end \n     on Dec. 31. But a key congressional committee has approved a \n     bill that would stifle both of these reforms. Another \n     congressional committee is expected to vote soon on a bill \n     that would expand a milk cartel of six northeastern states to \n     as many as 27 states; if Congress does nothing, the cartel \n     would disappear on October 1.\n       Congress should leave the reforms in place and let the milk \n     cartel ride into the sunset. Monkeying with the free marked \n     has raised prices for consumers and hasn't kept marginal \n     dairy farms from going bankrupt.\n\n  This next editorial is from the July 29, 1999 Chicago Tribune:\n\n       The U.S. justifiably accuses Europe of protectionism when \n     it comes to beef and bananas. But when lamb and milk are on \n     the menu, the accuser stands accused. The Clinton \n     administration just slapped tariffs on lamb imports from \n     Australia and New Zealand to protect U.S. sheep producers. \n     That's outrageous and makes a mockery of the case the U.S. is \n     trying to build that phasing out agricultural subsidies must \n     be a priority when the next round of World Trade Organization \n     negotiations is launched in Seattle this November.\n       But as outrageous as the lamb tariffs are, they pale in \n     comparison to the mischief currently afoot in Congress to \n     extend and expand what can only be called domestic \n     protectionism in milk pricing. Who needs the rest of the \n     world for a trade war? If some in Congress have their way, \n     we'll soon have our very own All-American trade war, pitting \n     the Midwest against the Northeast and the South while \n     needlessly raising milk prices for consumers.\n       The facts are these: As part of the 1996 Federal \n     Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act, the decades-\n     old milk price support program was to be phased out over \n     three years and the Department of Agriculture was ordered by \n     Congress to reform its unfathomable pricing system. The farm \n     bill also created a ``temporary'' milk cartel among six New \n     England states--which account for all of 3 percent of U.S. \n     milk production--to keep less expensive milk out of that \n     region. The rationale was that small family-owned dairy farms \n     in those states needed an adjustment period to prepare them \n     for free-market competition come October 1999 when the cartel \n     would expire.\n       Now there is an effort in Congress to roll back the USDA \n     pricing reforms, to extend the life of the New England cartel \n     beyond October and expand it to include six other states, \n     including New York and Pennsylvania. And 15 southern states \n     say that, in order to compete with their brethren to the \n     north, well, they're going to need a cartel of their own. \n     Follow the map west to see where this is headed. There are \n     about 9,000 dairy farmers in America--40,000 of them are in \n     the upper Midwest and, at some point, why shouldn't they have \n     a cartel too? And, of course, the West will need one to \n     compete with all the others. Don't do it, Congress. The FAIR \n     Act properly and at long last got Washington out of the \n     milk business. Let the market work.''\n\n  This editorial is from the April 3, 1999 edition of the Boston \nHerald:\n\n       The federal government is reorganizing its milk cartels, \n     and that made news this week. Every bit of attention that can \n     be focused on this absurd system of price controls ought to \n     be considered help, no matter how small, toward eventual \n     abolition. The Agriculture Department has a new set of price-\n     setting formulas, which it estimates will reduce the national \n     average price by 2 cent a gallon, and is consolidating \n     regional cartels to make 11 cover the country instead of the \n     previous 31.\n       Nothing fundamental will change. The ``marketing order'' \n     regions are protected markets for farmers--all dairies in one \n     must pay the same government-dictated price to farmers. It is \n     illegal to ship milk from one region to another. Nothing else \n     in the economy is sold like this--not even essentials like \n     gasoline or shoes. The effect is to keep prices higher than \n     they would be otherwise and transfer wealth from families \n     with children to dairy farmers. The farmers, the productivity \n     of whose cows just keeps increasing, argue in essence they \n     ought not to be driven out of business by economic forces.\n       If we accepted that as a principle, we'd be subsidizing \n     manufacturers of gas lamps and buggy whips.\n\n  This editorial is from the July 17, 1999 edition of The Kansas City \nStar:\n\n       In 1996, Congress ordered the administration to simplify \n     the pricing of milk. That's easy enough: Stop regulating it. \n     But this is the farm sector, and a free market in milk is \n     somehow inconceivable. Instead, milk prices are calculated \n     from rules and equations filling several volumes of the Code \n     of Federal Regulations.\n       The administration's proposed reform would reduce the \n     number of regions for which the price of wholesale milk is \n     regulated from 33 to 11. Fine, but it would also perpetuate \n     the loopy, Depression-era notion that the price of milk \n     should be based in part on its distance from Eau Claire, \n     Wisconsin. Under current policy, producers farther away from \n     this supposed heart of the dairy region generally receives \n     higher premiums, or ``differentials.''\n       The administration called for slightly lower differentials \n     for beverage milk in many regions, but in Congress even this \n     minuscule step toward rationality is being swept aside. The \n     House Agriculture committee has substituted a measure that \n     essentially maintains the status quo. Similar moves are afoot \n     in the Senate.\n       Worse, some dairy supporters are working to reauthorize and \n     expand the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, a regional \n     milk cartel, and allow a similar grouping for Southern \n     states. Missouri's legislature, by the way, has already voted \n     to join a Southern compact, even though it would result in \n     higher prices for consumers. The Consumer Federation of \n     American reports that the Northeast Compact raised retail \n     milk prices an average of 15 cents a gallon over two years.\n       Kansas lawmakers gave tentative approval to participation \n     in a compact but would have to act again to make the decision \n     final. Dairy producers concerned about the long view should \n     be worried. Critics point out that the higher milk \n     differentials endorsed by the House Agriculture Committee may \n     well lead to lower revenue for many producers. This is \n     because the higher prices will encourage more production, \n     driving down the ``base'' milk prices and negating the higher \n     differential.\n       The worse idea in this developing stew is the prospect of \n     dairy-compact proliferation. A compact works like an internal \n     tariff. Because the cartel prohibits sales above an agreed-\n     upon floor price, producers within the region are protect \n     from would-be-outside competitors. Opponents point out that \n     more regional compacts--and the higher prices they support--\n     will breed excessive production, creating surplus dairy \n     products that will be dumped in the markets of other regions. \n     This will prompt other states to demand similar protection, \n     promoting the spread of dairy compacts.\n       Ultimately, as in the 1980s, political pressure will build \n     to liquidate the dairy surplus in a huge, multibillion-dollar \n     buyout of cheese, milk powder and even entire herds . . . \n     Congress should permit the Northeast Compact to ``sunset,'' \n     or expire, which will occur if the lawmakers simply do \n     nothing. In fact, doing nothing to the administration's \n     proposal seems the best choice in this case, or more \n     properly, the least bad. Perhaps some day Washington will \n     debate real price simplification, as in ditching dairy \n     socialism and letting prices fluctuate according to supply \n     and demand.\n\n\n[[Page S14967]]\n\n\n  This editorial is from the September 14, 1999 edition of the San \nAntonio Express-News:\n\n       During the Depression, when it was impractical to truck \n     milk long distances from dairy farms to processing plants, \n     Congress devised a system of price supports that flattened \n     the price farmers--and consumers--paid for milk. That system, \n     still in place, pays dairy farmers more for milk the farther \n     they are from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, the ``center,'' said \n     Congress in the 1930s, of the dairy industry.\n       While refrigerated trucks and modern dairy farms make the \n     system arcane, Congress preserved it until 1996, when it \n     ordered the Agriculture Department to phase it out. Price \n     supports are scheduled to end December 31. However, Congress \n     is toying with keeping them and adding to the mess by \n     creating a new dairy compact.\n       There already is a Northeast compact, designed to help \n     family farms. However, it helps large dairy farms more than \n     small ones and adds from 50 cents to $1 to the price of a \n     gallon of milk. This not only negatively impacts families, \n     but also child nutrition programs. The Northeast dairy \n     compact also was supposed to die December 31, but some \n     members of Congress now want to create a Southern compact . . \n     . Let the dairy price supports expire and don't create a new \n     Southern dairy compact.\n\n  This editorial is from the September 20th edition of the Florida \nTime-Union:\n\n       There is a good lesson to learn as reformers in Congress \n     continue efforts to end milk subsidies. The lesson is that a \n     government handout, once in place, is as close to having \n     eternal life as anything on earth. Millions of consumers \n     would benefit from the end of dairy price supports and milk \n     marketing orders, but hundreds of wellheeled milk magnates \n     would have a little taken off the bottom line, perhaps.\n       Every product that contains any milk costs more because of \n     them. Like most subsidies, it involves a double cost: higher \n     taxes and higher prices. Even those who are lactose \n     intolerant are injured by the subsidies. For example, \n     taxpayers get hit hard when they buy milk for the Women, \n     Infants and Children program and school lunches.\n       People with food stamps get hurt because they pay more for \n     milk and therefore have less for other staples. The \n     industry's lobbyists stalk the halls of Congress carrying \n     tales of woe about the diminishing number of dairy cows. Yet, \n     they rarely talk about the nearly four-fold increase in milk \n     from each cow that occurred between 1940 and 1996.\n       The federal government got into the dairy business in 1933. \n     Citizens Against Government Waste notes that the excuse was \n     to relieve the existing national economic emergency by \n     increasing agricultural purchasing power.\n       Call Washington: The Great Depression has ended.\n       Price supports and marketing orders are part of a . . . \n     system rivaling anything devised in the old Kremlin's central \n     planning office. They cut off the dairy farmer from the \n     realities of the market, causing overproduction and waste, \n     with the government trying to clean up its mess by buying \n     huge stockpiles of cheese or even entire dairy herds. Price \n     supports are winding down because of the 1996 Farm Bill, but \n     marketing orders remain.\n       Clinging to the days when long-distance refrigeration was a \n     potential problem, the order include differential pricing \n     based on how far manufacturing plants are from Eau Claire, \n     Wisconsin, which makes that hamlet the center of the dairy \n     universe for no logical reason. That translates into 35 cents \n     more per gallon of milk for Florida residents, Citizens \n     Against Government Waste says. Parents can do the math.\n       Lobbyists succeeded in muddying the 1996 bill. Congress \n     should now revisit the law and improve on the improvements. \n     There simply is no rational reason for the federal government \n     to set the price of milk. End the milk tax.\n\n  This one is from the September 24, 1999 of the Christian Science \nMonitor:\n\n       No one can dispute the difficulties many family farms face \n     today, problems farmers have struggled with this entire \n     century. For many, farming is more than just earning a \n     living, it's a way of life and a connection with the land. \n     The nation, too, has a stake in preserving farms. But at what \n     price? It's mistake to argue that agriculture can be \n     insulated from shifting market forces forever. Government can \n     help  farmers adjust but not always survive.\n       This week saw Congress swing backward in its own mandate to \n     update a federal system of setting milk prices that currently \n     props up many dairy farms. It's not a minor issue: Dairy \n     sales make up roughly 10 percent of American farm income. The \n     House voted Wednesday to block the Agriculture Department \n     (USDA) from modernizing the 1937 pricing system in which \n     dairy farmers get higher prices for raw milk the farther they \n     live from Eau Claire, Wisconsin. (Then considered the \n     ``center'' of dairy farming). The idea back then was to \n     ensure fresh milk supplies nationwide. But with modern \n     refrigeration and transportation, it's obsolete.\n       A 1996 law handed USDA the job of devising and implementing \n     a new system since Congress, representing competing \n     interests, couldn't get it done. The 1937 system expires \n     October 1. While the USDA plan is more market-friendly, it's \n     only a first step. It simplifies pricing and narrows \n     disparities between efficient Midwestern farmers and less-\n     efficient ones elsewhere that can get up to $3 more per 100 \n     pounds of milk. But in doing so, it would remove a $200 \n     million, consumer-paid subsidy, potentially driving many \n     Northeastern and Southern dairy farmers out of business.\n       The House scrapped the Eau Claire system, but left in place \n     pricing that hurts consumers, who pay artificially high \n     prices for milk. The Senate shouldn't follow suit; if it \n     does, the President should veto the bill. Meanwhile, \n     Vermont's senators are spearheading an effort to renew the \n     federally authorized Northeast Dairy Compact, which is \n     expiring. Separate from the USDA pricing system, the compact \n     allows regional officials to set higher prices for milk. Some \n     Southern senators want a similar cartel.\n       Yet all this price-fixing has failed to halt the decline of \n     inefficient dairy farms. Between 1992 and 1998, the number of \n     dairy farms fell about 5 percent a year to 91,508. Price-\n     fixing only drags out the difficult process at consumer \n     expense.\n\n  This editorial is from the April 29, 1999 of the Cincinnati Enquirer:\n\n       Three years ago, Congress busted its bib-overall buttons \n     with pride after it planted a few seeds of agricultural \n     reform in the Freedom to Farm Act. Problem is, nobody's \n     remembered to water them since. That neglect is placing a \n     huge economic burden on farmers, says Representative John \n     Boehner.\n       The bill, co-written by Mr. Boehner, began to phase out \n     some farm subsidies over seven years to create a free-market \n     structure for agriculture that reflected America's economic \n     reality. So far, so good. But the other part of the deal, Mr. \n     Boehner points out, was the federal government was supposed \n     to help farmers through the transition by opening new markets \n     for their goods, cutting estate taxes and easing the \n     regulatory burden on farmers.\n       What's happened? Nothing, of course. President Clinton has \n     made some occasional noises about the need to ``tear down \n     barriers, open markets and expand trade,'' but administration \n     officials conveniently forgot that part--and Congress hasn't \n     been exactly diligent in reminding them. In fact, the White \n     House only made matters worse--notably with a new set of \n     costly federal environmental mandates on farmers announced \n     last month. . . .\n       On Tuesday, Mr. Boehner sounded the alarm on legislative \n     efforts to renew one interstate price-fixing dairy compact \n     and to create a new one. Such deals ``are bad for consumers, \n     bad for farmers and bad for the future of American \n     agriculture,'' he said. It would be another step backward \n     from free-market reform--a troubling turn of events. And so \n     the Freedom to Farm Act itself has been left to take the rap \n     for farmers' woes--low prices resulting from a record \n     harvest, coupled with overseas financial crises. The news is \n     terrible: Kansas farm income plunged 72 percent last year, \n     the Kansas Farm Management Association announced Tuesday.\n       ``Farmers today are having a tough time, and Washington's \n     inaction on this forgotten side of Freedom to Farm is making \n     it even tougher,'' says Mr. Boehner, who's virtually alone in \n     criticizing this federal foul-up. ``It is fundamentally wrong \n     for the Clinton administration to make Freedom to Farm the \n     scapegoat for its own failure to deliver on its promises to \n     farmers.''\n       He says Mr. Clinton ought to help Congress with trade, \n     estate-tax and regulatory relief legislation instead of \n     throwing up roadblocks and imposing new sets of rules on \n     farmers. Mr. Boehner is right, and his colleagues should join \n     him in putting the pressure on the White House. As reforms \n     go, Freedom to Farm was pretty tame, a watered-down \n     compromise that left a lot of pet projects intact.\n       But it did manage to break federal precedent, by starting \n     to reverse 60 years of Depression-era subsidies and controls \n     that made little sense once America recovered from economic \n     devastation. Now, those modest gains are in danger from a \n     rule-happy, control-freak administration, enabled by a \n     complacent Congress. . . .\n\n  Finally, the last editorial I'm going to read is from Wednesday's \nedition of the Washington Post. It says:\n\n       This is a Congress that began with lofty discussions of \n     saving Social Security, modernizing Medicare, etc. But all \n     legislatures come back to the fundamentals in the end. Among \n     the few issues that remained as the two chambers were \n     completing their work--right up there with U.N. dues and \n     Third World debt relief--was milk price supports.\n       Somewhere in the final mega-bills will be provisions \n     allowing New England to maintain a dairy compact that keeps \n     milk prices artificially high, and abandoning a modest reform \n     that Congress itself virtuously ordered a few years ago \n     reducing such supports elsewhere in the country. \n     These provisions are brought to you by people who in other \n     contexts present themselves as foes of government \n     regulation. But they like it well enough when it produces \n     what they want--extorting higher prices for milk, for \n     example.\n       In the Freedom to Farm Act of 1996, while reducing supports \n     for other crops, Congress called for a study of the milk \n     marketing order system, which props up prices at the checkout \n     counter. The study produced a recommendation that the system \n     be preserved\n\n[[Page S14968]]\n\n     but eased. Even that seems too much for the milk folks in \n     Congress. Though the issue was still in play, it appeared \n     last night they would succeed in keeping the old system \n     intact. It's just like the emergency aid they've doled out to \n     producers of other crops in the past two years, repealing by \n     another name the reduced supports in Freedom to Farm. \n     Meanwhile, the New England compact, which was due to expire, \n     will be allowed to remain in effect for two more years.\n       The result will be to transfer hundreds of millions of \n     dollars from consumers to inefficient producers who couldn't \n     otherwise compete. By definition, most of the benefit will go \n     to larger producers. The impact will be disproportionately \n     felt by lower-income consumers. It will be evident inside \n     government feeding programs as well, including that for low-\n     income women, infants and children; the available dollars \n     will buy less. It's a fitting testament to the instincts of a \n     Congress that, from the standpoint of the public interest, \n     can't go home soon enough.\n\n  Mr. President, the editorial boards have got it right this time, and \nnow is the time to end these distortions and fundamental unfairness in \ndairy markets before it gets worse.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment to thank the majority leader \nand the Democratic leader for taking the time to work with us. I \nappreciated all their help and support in working with my colleagues, \nSenators Kohl, Wellstone, and Feingold. We don't see eye to eye on \nevery issue, but on something as important to our States as this, I \nappreciated the opportunity to work with them.\n  I want to say that any Senator who has one ounce of support for the \ncapital market, the free market system, they could not support this \npart of the dairy provisions. The Northeast Dairy Compact and the bill, \nH.R. 1402, is unacceptable. I am not happy with this bill, but I am \nglad the majority leader has recognized the problem and has offered to \nwork with us in the months ahead. I appreciate that. When we look at \nFreedom to Farm--the bill that passed--it says we should compete in the \nopen marketplace, go head to head. The best person and the best farmer \nwho can be competitive is going to win.\n  Now, we should not be pitting our dairy farmers one against the other \nthrough an unfair, archaic Government program. Let our dairy farmers \ncompete head to head in the marketplace, but let's not have Government \npick winners and losers. I have worked closely with Senator Jeffords \nfrom Vermont. I told him, after we had a vote on the floor dealing with \nthe Northeast Dairy Compact, I wasn't satisfied with that, as well, and \nwe needed to get together and work out something where our dairy \nfarmers are not put at a disadvantage, one against the other.\n  Again, I appreciate all the efforts that have been put into this. I \nlook forward to working with all our colleagues next year to try to \nbring some kind of fairness to this dairy program, as we have done with \nother farmers. We should not leave dairy unanswered. I thank everybody \nfor their help, and I look forward to working with colleagues to make \nsure we can work out a fair bill that will satisfy everybody when it \ncomes to dairy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, what we have before us is not the answer to \nour prayers, but it is what we call in politics ``consensus.''\n  Margaret Thatcher said of consensus:\n\n       To me, consensus seems to be the process of abandoning all \n     beliefs, principles, values, and policies in search of \n     something in which no one believes.\n\n  Well, I would like to say to our dear colleagues, Senator Kohl and \nSenator Grams, that I do not support dairy compacts. There are two \nsides to every issue, and I know we have people on both sides. In this \ncase, however, at least in my mind, there is a right side and a wrong \nside. Dairy compacts would make a Soviet commissar blush. The idea of \nallowing a regional group of producers to conspire, with Government \nsupport, and set prices is an absolute outrage. We ought to be ashamed \nof it, especially having passed Freedom to Farm.\n  I share the outrage of my two colleagues. I just want to say to Rod \nGrams and Herb Kohl, on this issue, not only did they fight for their \nStates but for every consumer across this country. Senator Byrd, if the \ngreat general had been from Wisconsin it would have been a much shorter \nwar, from a historians point of view, and that would have meant a much \nbetter outcome from a humanitarian's point of view. In any case, we \nhave had people here who stood up and fought for what they believed in, \nwhat was right for their States. In this body we still honor those \npeople. I commend both Senator Kohl and Senator Grams.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have had the good fortune, in the past \nseveral days, to work to resolve many issues. We have made some \nprogress. I want to say that what we have seen in the last few days \ncould not be a better illustration of what politics and Government is \nall about. I say that in a positive fashion. We have had people from \nthe State of Wisconsin and the State of Minnesota fighting for what \nthey believe is right. The Constitution was developed to protect the \nminority, not the majority. The majority can always protect themselves.\n  The Constitution is set up, especially through the Senate, to always \nprotect the minority. That is what they were doing, protecting \nthemselves. They, in effect, didn't get a fair deal in this omnibus \nbill.\n  About the Senator from Wisconsin, there have been a number of things \nsaid, especially by the Senator from West Virginia. I underscore and \napplaud that. We have to make sure the other Senator from Wisconsin is \nalso recognized. They have both been stalwarts in this battle.\n  I direct everybody's attention to yesterday's Congressional Record. \nOn page S14794, there was a statement made by Senator Kohl. If anyone \nis ever concerned about what the free enterprise system is all about, \nread what Senator Kohl said yesterday on the Senate floor. That is what \nthis debate has been all about--about the free enterprise system in \nthis great country of ours.\n  In effect, what the Senators from Wisconsin have been fighting about \nis whether or not the free enterprise system is going to be \ncircumvented by a cartel, a deal that has been, in effect, condoned, \nunderlined, and set forth by the Federal Government. It should not be. \nSo I direct everyone's attention to this. I appreciate very much the \ncooperation of the Senators from Wisconsin and especially the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone. He has fought long and hard, and he has \nbeen on this floor for the last several days. To my friends from \nMinnesota and Wisconsin, I appreciate their recognizing that they have \nrights. They have done everything they could to protect their rights \nunder the Constitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am going to defer to Senator Kohl, \nand I will follow him and Senator Feingold. I have literally 30 \nseconds.\n  I yield to Senator Kohl.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I sincerely thank all of my colleagues who \nhave spoken up this afternoon. It has been remarkable to hear Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle express themselves in such a heartwarming \nway, and I think in such a fair and clear way with respect to this \ncountry of ours and how our economy works and how it is intended to \nwork.\n  It is remarkable to me that all these leaders have made clear that \nwhile we are passing dairy legislation this afternoon, it is of \nnecessity, and not because they and we believe in the specifics of that \nlegislation. It is heartwarming for me to know that when we come back \nnext year, we apparently have common agreement on both sides of the \naisle that we are going to work together to come up with dairy \nlegislation that more clearly and fairly represents the interests not \nonly of the different parts of our country in terms of our States and \nregions but more clearly represents the real intentions of our \nConstitution with respect to how this economy is supposed to work and \nhow the free enterprise system is supposed to work.\n  It has been a long, hard fight for myself, Senator Feingold, Senator \nWellstone, Senator Grams, and others. Certainly, what happened here \nthis afternoon, in my opinion, justifies that fight and leaves me \nfeeling very good about my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and \nfeeling very optimistic about the things we can look forward to next \nyear.\n\n[[Page S14969]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank all the people that have \nparticipated in the colloquy for their kind words about our effort and \nfor coming to the floor to say it. My primary purpose in rising at this \npoint is to praise my senior colleague, Senator Kohl.\n  The words that have been said about many in this effort are true. But \nI want everyone to know that this was not an effort that he initiated a \nweek ago, or 2 weeks ago, or 2 years ago. Every single day since I have \nbeen in the Senate I have found working with Senator Kohl on this \ncritical issue to be one of the best opportunities to work with another \nSenator together for our State. This has been certainly the most \ndramatic example. But it is an example also of the tenaciousness that \nSenator Kohl has on behalf of our dairy farmers.\n  Both he and I spent our entire youth in Wisconsin. He and I both know \nthat in 1950 there were 150,000 dairy farms in this Wisconsin. Now \nthere are less than 23,000. Over that time you begin to realize that \nsome of the old dairy policies maybe once worked but now, frankly, are \nabsurd. The notion of having this difference between the class I milk \nacross the country based on issues that refrigeration and \ntransportation that stopped existing decades ago makes no sense. The \nidea of a dairy cartel in one part of the country and a system that is \nsupposed to be based on national economy and free enterprise is also \nridiculous.\n  We know this Congress asked that the Department of Agriculture take a \nlook at these issues, and said: What do you think we ought to do? They \ncame back with a conclusion to narrow those differentials and get rid \nof the compact. Over 90 percent of the producers in the country said \nthat is the right idea. That is why Senator Kohl and I fought so hard, \nbecause it wasn't just our idea. It wasn't just Wisconsin. It was a \nnational consensus.\n  Unfortunately, I think this Congress has very inappropriately \noverturned that. And Senator Kohl and I will not give up until we have \nhad the opportunity to reverse this unfortunate decision.\n  But I want to join with my senior colleague in thanking everyone for \ntheir courtesies on this. We obviously could have taken this to an even \ngreater extent, and we realize the issues that are involved in that. \nThis is a very important issue to not only Wisconsin, but to Minnesota, \nand to other States. We certainly will be back early next year to \ncontinue the battle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I also would like to \nthank all of my colleagues. I appreciate their comments.\n  I think the only thing I say that might be a little different is I \nremain pretty skeptical, to be honest. I am glad to hear what my \ncolleagues have said. I think that is real progress. We are talking \nabout working together. I think we are very committed--I say this to \nSenator Kohl, to Senator Feingold, and to Senator Grams--to making sure \nthat working together leads to a product. We have to change what we \nhave right now because the compact blocking the milk marketing order \nreform has a disastrous impact on our dairy farms.\n  I come from a State where we lose about three dairy farms a day. I \nappreciate the comments that have been made. I know the Senators who \nhave made them have made them in good faith. That gives me confidence. \nOn the other hand, given what has happened, permit me to be skeptical \nuntil we see the product. The proof is in the pudding.\n  Finally, since my colleague from Texas mentioned the Freedom to Farm \nbill--what some of us call the ``freedom to fail'' bill --I think dairy \nis part, just part of it. We have to write a new farm bill. We have a \nfailed farm policy. We have to change this. We are going to press hard \nto do so.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I must set the record straight with \nregard to the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. Rarely in all my \nyears in Congress have I witnessed such ill-considered comment and \nmedia hysteria as has occurred over the Dairy Compact in these last few \ndays.\n  I recognize that my Senate colleagues from the Midwest are, very \nunderstandably, raising the dairy issue to a new level of concern and I \nwelcome the opportunity to respond to their call for productive changes \nin our dairy policy. As for my media friends, I appreciate the \nheightened scrutiny of our dairy policy, because we in the northeast \nshare a common concern with our Midwestern Senate colleagues over the \ncurrent state of our nation's dairy policy.\n  To my Senate colleagues from the Midwest: I have worked on the dairy \nissue for all of my twenty-four years in the Congress. More than most, \nI appreciate the complexity and difficulty of this issue. There is \nnothing I would like more than to join with you in common cause to \nimprove our nation's dairy policy.\n  But let us be frank with each other. The key issue that has divided \nus in all my time here, and which continues to divide us, is your \ninsistence that the Midwest should somehow be seen as the source of our \nnation's supply of fluid, or beverage, milk.\n  This insistence has been and still remains simply contrary to the \noverwhelming will of this Congress. And this is not just an issue that \ndivides the northeast and the Midwest; this is an issue that divides \nthe Midwest from the rest of the country.\n  The universal constituencies of every member of Congress, from every \nregion including your own, demand a local supply of fluid milk. This is \nnot a free market issue, not merely an issue of the best interests of \ndairy farmers.\n  The real issue is the very nature of our basic food supply and so \nextends way beyond the mere interest of a single constituent group. \nRegionally and on behalf of the nation as a whole, the Congress simply \nwill not yield to the destruction of our local supplies of fresh, \nwholesome drinking milk, and the inevitable result of the consumption \nof reconstituted milk.\n  For now and for the foreseeable future, our nation's dairy policy \nwill be based on the maintenance of local, regional supplies of fluid \nmilk. You must recognize that we cannot compromise on this issue.\n  This fact must and will define our national policy. The Midwest will \nnever be called upon to provide the supply of fluid milk for the rest \nof the country.\n  And so I call upon my Senate colleagues from the Midwest to look \nelsewhere than to reformation of the fluid marketplace for a solution \nto the problems your dairy industry faces. I make this call in the \nspirit of cooperation and with a positive spirit.\n  To my media friends: I welcome this opportunity to respond to the \nspecifics of the various misstatements and misinformation contained in \nthe most recent descriptions of the Dairy Compact. Before doing so, I \nwould like first to highlight for you a simple and incontrovertible \nfact about the Dairy Compact:\n  Twenty-five of our fifty states have now passed dairy compact \nlegislation patterned after the original compact language first adopted \nby the Vermont legislature in 1987. This means that twenty-five \nlegislatures and twenty-five governors (more, if you count the number \nof governors who have supported the bill over the years) have committed \ntheir active support to this unique legislation.\n  With this important fact in the background, I would like to respond \nto the charges and assertions that have recently been raised against \nthe Dairy Compact.\n  For purposes of this discussion, I will address directly the \nsubstance of the editorial that appeared yesterday in the Wall Street \nJournal. To summarize the editorial, the Dairy Compact is a ``price \nfixing cartel'' which benefits ``inefficient'' Vermont dairy farmers \nunfairly at the expense of their more efficient Upper Midwest \ncounterparts.\n  To compound this misery, the Compact unduly burdens milk consumers in \nthe northeast, particularly the most vulnerable ``poor children'', ``to \nthe tune of 20 cents a gallon.''\n  Now I would like first generally to ask this body: Who in their right \nmind would support such a clearly wrongheaded policy as so \ncharacterized by the Wall Street Journal? Who could support any measure \nwhich pits a relatively small number of farmers\n\n[[Page S14970]]\n\nagainst a vastly greater constituency of consumers, and which \ndisadvantages our most vulnerable citizens?\n  Certainly not the twenty-five state legislatures and governors which \nhave adopted Compact legislation. And certainly not the 40 Senators and \nover 160 House Members who co-sponsored legislation to approve Compact \nlegislation here in the Congress.\n  Certainly not the Compact's bi-partisan supporters in the Congress \nand around the country, who represent the country's most rural and most \nurban constituencies. And such an initiative could never have been \nembraced simultaneously by our nation's most divergent regions--the \nnortheast and the deep south.\n  Just look at the list of co-sponsors here in the Senate. Senator \nJesse Helms joins Senator Ted Kennedy. Senator Schumer from New York is \na co-sponsor along with Senator Thurmond from South Carolina. Need I \nsay more about the diversity of support for the Compact?\n  And so I call upon the media to look at the Compact with a fresh \ngaze. If you will do so, I think you will find that the reason for this \nunusual if not truly unique support for the Compact is really quite \nsimple: The Compact manages to respond simultaneously to all of the \ndivergent interests at play in today's dairy marketplace.\n  The Compact does not just respond to the needs of dairy farmers. \nConsumers, processors, retailers, as well as farmers, all find their \nplace in the regulatory process created by the Compact.\n  Because the consumer ultimately pays, the consumer controls the \ndecision as to whether the price should be raised. Perhaps most \nimportantly, because the Compact is made up of individual sovereign \nstates, the sovereign right of each state to control its own regulatory \nfate is ultimately protected by the Compact.\n  In short, the Compact truly promotes the public interest. Let me see \nif I can further advance the discussion by clearing up at least some of \nthe cloud of confusion which the Journal and others have cast around \nthe Compact.\n  Let's begin with the claim that the Compact is a ``price-fixing \ncartel''. Along with the Journal, the Washington Post also yesterday \nreferred to the Compact as a ``cartel'' in an editorial. And our \nsupposed ``newspaper of record'', The New York Times, has repeatedly \ndescribed the Compact as a cartel in its coverage of the Compact.\n  For the benefit of all these erudite commentators whose stock in \ntrade is the precise use of the English language, let's consider the \ndictionary definition of a cartel. Webster's dictionary defines \n``cartel'' as follows\n\n       (1) a written agreement between belligerent nations; (2) a \n     combination of independent commercial enterprises designed to \n     limit competition; (3) a combination of political groups for \n     common action.\n\n  The definition contained in the Random House dictionary similarly \ndescribes a ``cartel'' as:\n\n       (1) an international syndicate, combine, or trust generally \n     formed to regulate prices and output in some field of \n     business; (2) a written agreement between belligerents, esp. \n     for the exchange of prisoners; (3) (in French or Belgian \n     politics) a group acting as a unit toward a common goal; (4) \n     a written challenge to a duel.\n\n  Notwithstanding use of this term by our most respected media \ncommentators, it becomes quickly obvious that the Compact in no way \nshape or form resembles such a ``cartel.''\n  Indeed, were I to challenge these commentators to a duel in writing, \nthat absurd challenge would actually be a more accurate use of the term \ncartel than is their use of the term to describe the Compact.\n  I guess our political commentators have now tilted so far away in \ntheir zeal to embrace the so-called free market that they recognize no \nrole for the government in regulating the marketplace. Or, I guess, \nthey simply no longer trust the government.\n  Even so, is their distrust of government so great that they cannot \ngive even simple recognition to the simple distinction between \nbusinesses price-fixing for private gain and states regulating in the \npublic interest?\n  Such regulation in the public interest, which provides the basis for \nthe Compact, is central to our system of government. Even the most \nardent free-marketeers recognize the need for the government to play at \nleast some role in the policing of the marketplace in the public \ninterest.\n  The basic function of the Compact is this: To determine whether the \nprice received by dairy farmers must be adjusted in the public \ninterest. Not solely in the interest of farmers, but in the public \ninterest of all those who participate in the fluid milk marketplace--\nprocessors, wholesalers, retailers and consumers, including low-income \nconsumers.\n  Adjustment may mean an increase in price, or simply stability in \nprice. Presently, the Compact provides for both some increase in price \nas well as price stability.\n  I will address the various concerns raised by the increase in price \nin a minute, but first I would like to address the issue of price \nstability, because it brings home the fact that the Compact serves the \nlarger public interest, of which farmers comprise only one part.\n  Various stories have alluded to the problem of erratic wholesale \nprices and their adverse impact on consumers.\n  Indeed, nobody really benefits, other than retailers, from an \nincreasingly market-driven farm price for milk. This is an issue \naddressed by the Compact. The Compact, in the public interest, provides \nfor price stability, to the benefit of all market participants. (Even \nretailers.)\n  Now about the increase in price resulting from operation of the \nCompact in New England. Here are some simple numbers. Over the last two \nyears, the Compact has raised the price of farm milk by no more than \nten cents per gallon. No more than ten cents. Not twenty cents, as we \nhave heard over and over and over and over. As they say, you could look \nit up, so let me repeat: Ten cents. Period.\n  And that is just the impact on the farm price. What of the impact on \nconsumer prices. You can look this up, as well. If you do so, you will \nfind that prices in New England are actually lower than in the \ncorresponding New York City market, where the Compact is not in place.\n  And what of the impact on ``poor children''? Under current operation \nof the Compact, the WIC program and the School Lunch Program are both \nexempt. There is no impact on participants in these programs. Let me \nrepeat: No impact on participants in the WIC and School Lunch programs. \nPeriod.\n  In conclusion, let me again speak directly to my troubled colleagues \nfrom the Upper Midwest.\n  As we look to the new millennium and our future, I wish my Midwestern \ncolleagues again to understand that I will strive to work with them in \ncommon purpose. Our farmers from the northeast and Midwest are so \nsimilar. They are among the yeoman farmers who built this country so \nproud. We must be responsive to their common plight. Surely we should \nbe able to reason together based on those issues we share in common \nrather than continue to dispute over issues which divide us.\n  In all the recent discussion about the Dairy Compact, one key fact \nseems to have gotten overlooked. Twenty-five of our fifty states have \nnow passed dairy compact legislation. One-half of the states have \nembraced the Compact idea.\n  This means that twenty-five state legislatures and twenty-five \ngovernors (more, if you count the number of governors who have \nsupported the bill over the years) have adopted the Compact approach as \nthe best way to solve the dairy issue we all find so vexing.\n  I call upon my colleagues, especially those Members on my side of the \naisle, to give due deference to the rights of the states to assist the \nCongress in defining policy. The states have spoken and are telling us \nthat the free marketplace does not work with dairy pricing. We should \nlisten to their wise counsel.\n  These Interstate Compacts are not all about dairy policy, but about \nthe rights of states to work together under the compact clause of the \nconstitution. It's a states right issue that deserves to be heard and \nunderstood. I hope my colleagues will take the time to understand the \nlaw and the purpose of this important state initiative.\n  I fully believe that those Members who have today spoken against them \nmay see Dairy Compacts in a new light if they will view them from the \nperspective of the states which have adopted them. Instead of seeing \ncartels, they will see a regulatory framework that operates in the \npublic interest. Instead of seeing a system of price\n\n[[Page S14971]]\n\nsupports that works only for dairy farmers, they will see a regulatory \nmechanism that benefits all the citizens of the states--consumers, \nprocessors and farmers, alike.\n  This is the way our federalist system is supposed to work--the states \ntalk and we listen. As an issue of states rights, I urge the Judiciary \nCommittee to take this issue up when next we consider it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S14971-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14971-S14975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTICKET TO WORK AND WORK INCENTIVES IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999--CONFERENCE \n                           REPORT--Continued\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am pleased with the progress we have made \nin two very important areas on issues that will affect the lives of \nAmericans everywhere. This legislation--the Ticket to Work and Work \nIncentives Improvement Act of 1999--will go a long way toward improving \nthe quality of life for millions of Americans with disabilities. At the \nsame time, important provisions within this legislation--provisions \nthat extend important tax and trade relief provisions--will bring \nmeaningful relief and increased opportunities to individuals and \nfamilies. The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act will \nhelp Americans with disabilities live richer, more productive lives. \nIts core purpose is to assist disabled individuals in returning to \nwork. It removes the real risk many people with disabilities face of \nlosing their health insurance, and it provides new ways of helping them \nfind and keep meaningful employment.\n  Is there any question how important this is?\n  Millions of Americans with disabilities are waiting for the vote. \nThey are waiting to be freed from a disability system that stifles \ninitiative and thwarts productivity rather than rewarding them--a \nsystem that tells individuals with disabilities that if they leave \ntheir homes and try to find productive employment they will lose their \naccess to health insurance. The current system isn't right, Mr. \nPresident. It isn't productive. And it certainly is not ennobling.\n  Under current law, if a person with a disability wants to return to \nwork--even taking a job with modest earnings--he or she will jeopardize \naccess to insurance coverage through the Medicaid and Medicare \nprograms. And as many individuals with disabilities have difficulties \nsecuring private sector insurance coverage, losing access to Medicaid \nor Medicare is not an option. In fact, it's a tragic consequence for \nmany people with medical conditions that demand ongoing treatment. As a \nresult, the only recourse these individuals have is to forego the \nopportunity to work--to build and grow professionally and personally--\nand to stay at home.\n  No one, Mr. President, should be forced to choose between health care \nand employment. Robbing an individual of the opportunity to work \nbecomes a double tragedy in the life of someone who is living with a \ndisability. It's been said that work is the process by which dreams \nbecome realities. It is the process by which idle visions become \ndynamic achievements. Work spells the difference in the life of a man \nor woman. It stretches minds, utilizes skills and lifts us from \nmediocrity.\n  No one should have to choose between health care and work, and \npassage of the Work Incentives Improvement Act will make that choice \nunnecessary. By acting on this legislation today, the Senate will offer \nnew promise to millions of Americans with disabilities. This \nlegislation will help promote their independence and personal growth. \nIt will help restore confidence and meaning in their lives--and greater \nsecurity in the lives of their families.\n  But this legislation is not about big government. We do not tell the \nstates what they must do. There are no mandates. And we do not tell \nindividuals with disabilities what they must do. We create options. We \ncreate choices. And choice is the essence of independence, isn't it?\n  The unemployment rate among working-age adults with severe \ndisabilities is nearly 75 percent. What a tragic consequence of errant \npublic policy that discourages those who can and want to work from \nattaining their desires. It's my firm belief that this number will come \ndown--it will come down dramatically as we pass this law allowing them \nto return to the workplace. My belief is based in part on the fact that \nover 300 groups of disability advocates, health care providers, and \ninsurers endorse this change and are anxiously waiting for us to act.\n\n  These groups and individuals are not the only Americans watching what \nwe do here today. Along with them, are countless other who are looking \nto this legislation to extend important tax and trade relief provisions \nthat are included in the work incentives bill.\n  These provisions are ``must do'' business. Like appropriations, \nextenders are provisions that we have an obligation to address before \nwe conclude this session. They are necessary fixes to our Tax Code, and \nwill go a long way toward helping families and creating greater \neconomic opportunity in our communities.\n  Among the important provisions contained in these extenders is one \nthat excludes nonrefundable tax credits from the alternative minimum \ntax (``AMT''). This change alone will insure that middle-income \nfamilies receive the benefits of the $500 per child tax credit, the \nHOPE Scholarship credit, the Lifetime Learning credit, the adoption \ncredit, and the dependent care tax credit. In this legislation, such \nrelief is extended through December 31, 2002.\n  Another important provision in this legislation extends and expands \nthe tax credit for production of energy from wind and closed loop \nbiomass. This important alternative energy provision expired on June \n30, 1999. In this legislation, the tax credit is expanded to cover \npoultry litter-based biomass, and it is extended through December 31, \n2001. For my home State of Delaware and many other poultry producing \nregions, this provision provides an important option for the \ndisposition of poultry litter in a way that will be beneficial and \nproductive.\n  Other important expiring tax provisions included in this legislation \nare a 5-year extension and enhancement of the research and development \ntax credit and the tax-free treatment of employer-provided educational \nassistance. I can't overstate how important the R credit is to the \nhigh-tech community and many other important leading American economic \nsectors. The extension offered in this legislation will give businesses \nthe certainty they need and will result in more and higher paid jobs \nfor American workers. And as far as employer-provided educational \nassistance, I've made it clear that my goal is to make this provision \npermanent and expand it to graduate education. I know this is an \nimportant goal for Senator Moynihan as well. Over one million workers \nwill benefit from this extension, and under this legislation, the \nprovision is extended through the end of 2001 for undergraduate \neducation.\n  But, Mr. President, important extenders do not stop here. This \nlegislation will also extend incentives designed to help Americans move \nfrom welfare to work through the end of 2001. These incentives include \nthe work opportunity tax credit and the welfare to work tax credit.\n  Other extenders include the active finance exception to Subpart F--a \nprovision that puts our banks, insurance, and securities firms on equal \nfooting with their foreign competitors in overseas markets--and five \nother important tax provisions that are scheduled to expire. These \nprovisions, which are extended through the end of 2001, include the \n``brownfields'' expansing treatment of environmental cleanup costs. In \naddition, the school repair and renovation costs of some school \ndistricts are met by an extension of the qualified zone academy bond \nprogram.\n  But the provisions included in this legislation are not limited to \ntax relief. We also include some important trade issues. For example, \nwe extend the Generalized System of Preferences, as well as Trade \nAdjustment Assistance programs. Both of these trade provisions are \nextended through the end of 2001. Beyond these, there are several \nrevenue raising provisions that we've included. Most of these, I am \npleased to report, close loopholes in the Tax Code raising some $3 \nbillion in return.\n  When all is said and done with this legislation, Mr. President, I am \npleased that the tax relief in this bill amounts to a net tax of $15.8 \nbillion over 5 years and $18.4 billion over 10.\n\n[[Page S14972]]\n\n  There's no question that what have before us is a dynamic piece of \nlegislation. From providing hope and opportunity to Americans with \ndisabilities to extending and expanding important tax provisions for \nindividuals and families, this is a comprehensive package. It has been \ncarefully constructed, debated, and addressed in conference. It include \nthat efforts of many of our colleagues and countless hours of staff \nwork.\n  I want to thank several Senators who have worked closely with me over \nthe past year to bring the work incentives bill to the floor--Senators \nMoynihan, Jeffords, Kennedy, and Bunning. Passage of the Work \nIncentives Improvement Act has been one of my top health care \npriorities during this Congress. It would have been impossible without \nclose, productive, bipartisan cooperation. Likewise, the effort we've \nmade to address the important tax and trade extenders. Without the work \nand cooperation of my distinguished friend and the Finance Committee's \nRanking Democratic Member, Senator Moynihan, we wouldn't be here today \nwith a conference agreement.\n  In closing, let me also mention that there are two provisions in this \nbill outside the Finance Committee's jurisdiction, one dealing with the \norgan donor and the other dealing with a NOAA procurement matter. I ask \nmy colleagues to join us in seeing that all of these important \nprovisions are passed into law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I do wish there were more Members \npresent that we might rise in a general applause to the Senator from \nDelaware, chairman of the Finance Committee. I refer to him as our \nrevered colleague. This legislation could not be here, most of it would \nnot have been conceived, without him. It is a triumph against what has \nbecome our procedures that it is here today and will shortly be \napproved.\n  Millions of Americans who will not know that he has done this will \nbenefit from what he has done, and that, for him, will be sufficient \nknowledge and reward. I want to say that.\n  I don't want to speak at length because other Senators wish to join \nin this matter. I simply make two points. One is how very much I \nappreciate the chairman's mention of the importance of providing \nemployer education assistance for graduate students. Go to any major \nmetropolis in this country, any area where there is a college, and find \nnight schools where young America and not so young come to acquire \nfurther skills and greater economic capacity.\n  Nothing could be more clearly in our national interests. It will go \non whether we have a tax credit or not, but on the margins, it is \nimportant, first, recognizing the need for new skills, recognizing the \nneed for developing new areas. Send our own employees to graduate \nschool. Let them get this further degree while they are on the job, \ncome back, be promoted, earn more, and be more valuable.\n  I spoke with our friend, the House majority leader, Mr. Armey. Of \ncourse he is a distinguished economist. He noted the last 5 years he \nwas teaching, he was teaching at night school and teaching people who \nwanted to be there. They didn't have to be there to play soccer--put it \nthat way.\n  I would secondly like to note, and I know the chairman would agree, \nabsent from our measure today are two matters reported from the \nCommittee on Finance: The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act of 1999 and \nthe Caribbean Basin Initiative. They came out of the Finance Committee \nas near matter unanimous as can be--under our chairman, things come out \nof our committee unanimous. We did not suceed given the complexities of \nthese negotiations this time. We will be back. I hope these matters \nwill be addressed. I know on our side of the aisle, if you will, in the \nHouse, Representative Rangel, the ranking member in Ways and Means, my \ncounterpart, very much hopes this will happen, and so do I.\n  Mr. President, I would briefly note, for the Record, some important \nprovision in this legislation.\n  With regard to tax extenders, this bill extends the research and \nexperimentation credit for five years and it extends all other \nprovisions through December 31, 2001. Extending these provisions as \nlong as possible was simply the right thing to do--providing certainty \nto employers and workers.\n  Might I add that some of these provisions are vitally important to \nworking families. If we do not, for instance, pass the alternative \nminimum tax provision, approximately 1.1 million Americans will lose \npart or all of the $500 child credit, the HOPE scholarship credit, or \nother non-refundable credits. We also, rightfully so, extend the \nWelfare-to-work and the Work opportunity credits.\n  I would also like to clarify two matters with respect to a provision \nbased on S. 213, which I introduced on January 19, 1999--and which is \nknown as the rum cover-over provision. I am very pleased that we were \nable to increase from $10.50 to $13.25 the amount of excise taxes on \nrum that is transferred to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. \nUnfortunately, procedural obstacles required a delay in most of the \ntransfer from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2001. Instead, up to $20 \nmillion will be transferred 15 days after enactment. The remainder of \nthe amount will not, however, be transferred until after September 30, \n2000. However, our distinguished Finance Committee Chairman, Senator \nRoth, and Chairman Archer from the House Ways and Means Committee have \nmade a commitment that, to the extend possible, the delayed payments \nwill be accelerated, or interest on the delayed amounts will be \nprovided for in the Africa and CBI legislation next year.\n  With respect to the second matter, the rum cover-over provision, as \npassed by this body on October 29, 1999, included an additional \ntransfer of 50 cents from the government of Puerto Rico to the National \nHistoric Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico--the purpose of which is the \nprotection and enhancement of the natural resources of Puerto Rico. \nUnfortunately, the 50 cent transfer is not included in the legislation \nbefore us today. However, it is my understanding that the Governor of \nPuerto Rico, the Honorable Pedro Rossello, has made the commitment to \ntransfer one-sixth (45 cents), of the increase provided by this \nlegislation, to the Trust. I applaud the Governor for his commitment.\n  I am also very pleased that this legislation would remedy some of the \nbarriers and disincentives that individuals enrolled in Federal \ndisability programs face in returning to work. Many disabled Americans \ndo not return to work because they must lose their health care coverage \nand because they have inadequate access to employment and \nrehabilitation services.\n  In 1986, we took our first step to remove obstacles facing disabled \nAmericans who want to work. Our former Finance Committee Chairman and \nMajority Leader--Senator Dole--introduced the Employment Opportunities \nfor Disabled Americans Act to make permanent a demonstration project \nthat enabled Supplemental Security Income--or ``SSI'' recipients to \nmaintain Medicaid benefits during a transition to work. I was an \noriginal co-sponsor of the bill which was enacted on November 11, 1986. \nBuilding on that first step and other subsequent initiatives, Senators \nJeffords, Kennedy, Roth and I introduced this work incentives bill in \nthe Senate on January 28th of this year. The legislation has enjoyed \noverwhelming bipartisan support, passing the Senate 99-0 on June 16th \nand the House 412-9 on October 19.\n  The bill addresses an issue of paramount concern: how to encourage \ndisabled individuals to return to work. Currently, less than one-half \nof one percent of individuals receiving disability benefits now leave \nthe rolls and return to work. A survey by the National Organization on \nDisability found that only 29 percent of all disabled adults are \nemployed full-time or part-time, compared to 79 percent of the non-\ndisabled adult population. The disabled find it difficult to work \nbecause if they earn income above a certain level, they lose their \ndisability benefits and their health care coverage. In fact, witnesses \ntestifying before the Finance Committee cited the potential loss of \nhealth care coverage as the primary obstacle between the disabled and \ntheir ability to work.\n  This legislation tries to remove this barrier by guaranteeing that \nworking individuals with disabilities can maintain their Medicare and \nMedicaid coverage for a longer period of time. Under\n\n[[Page S14973]]\n\ncurrent law, Social Security disability beneficiaries, who go back to \nwork and earn a modest income, may only continue their Medicare \ncoverage for four years. This legislation would permit disabled workers \nto retain their Medicare coverage for an additional four and a half \nyears.\n  Two important Medicaid provisions are included in this bill. The \nfirst would permit more lower-income disabled workers to pay premiums \nand buy into the Medicaid program. The second establishes a \ndemonstration project that would provide Medicaid coverage to persons \nlikely to become disabled without medical treatment. This is good \ncommon-sense policy: providing preventive health coverage to working \nindividuals with serious medical conditions before such conditions \nworsen to a disabling level.\n  This legislation does more than just extend greater health care \ncoverage to the disabled. Through a program called ``Ticket to Work,'' \nit would make it easier for disabled workers to access coordinated \nvocational rehabilitation and employment assistance services. It \nprovides grants to States to develop the program infrastructure and to \nperform the outreach necessary to help disabled individuals to work. \nThe legislation would also ensure that a mere return to work does not \nautomatically trigger eligibility reviews that could result in being \nremoved form the disability rolls. In addition, it would streamline the \nprocess for individuals to be reinstated for disability benefits, if \nthey are unable to continue working.\n  Lastly, the bill funds Social Security demonstration projects on how \nbest to encourage disabled individuals to return to work. For example, \none innovative project will determine whether a sliding-scale reduction \nof disability benefits by $1 for every $2 earned would make it easier \nto go back to work. Such a result seems far more reasonable than the \ncurrent situation where workers who earn income above a statutory limit \nlose their disability benefits entirely.\n  The overwhelming support for his legislation is not surprising given \nits simple and universal goal: providing disabled Americans the \nopportunity they deserve to work and contribute to the fullest of their \nability. For Americans with disabilities, enacting this legislation \nwould take a great step forward in removing the many barriers they face \nin returning to work.\n  Before I conclude, Mr. President, I did want to mention that \nregrettably, this bill includes an extraneous provision delaying \nimplementation of a new regulation to improve the Nation's system of \nallocating human organs for transplant.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chairman for his commitment to this tax \nextenders and work incentive legislation. I would also like to thank \nthe staffs of the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Senate Finance \nCommittee and the House Way and Means and Commerce Committees. Now, \nlet's go home.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nVermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May the Chair ascertain how many minutes?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first I ask unanimous consent Lu Zeph \nand Tom Valuck, fellows on my staff, be granted the privilege of the \nfloor during consideration of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Iowa, with whom I \nhave worked all these years, was here just a moment ago. I would like \nto wish him a happy 60th birthday. I am sure all of us would like to \njoin in that, and I will move on now and get to the purpose of being \nhere today.\n  Mr. President, I am thrilled that the Senate will soon send to the \nPresident the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. This landmark \nlegislation will open doors to jobs across the country for disabled \nAmericans.\n  As we all know, the Federal Government often sets policies with the \nbest of intentions, and the least of common sense. There are lots of \nexamples, but today's policy for disability benefits takes the prize.\n  If you are disabled and don't work, you have access to federally \nfunded health care. If you are disabled and you do work, you lose \naccess to federally funded health care. Does it make any sense to you? \nNo, it does not to me, either.\n  Access to health care is important to everyone, of course, but to \nseverely disabled people it is absolutely vital for the everyday needs \nof life. And the price tag for this care can be astronomical.\n  Three years ago, this paradox was brought to my attention, and I \nbegan the process of trying to figure out how we could solve it.\n  I realized that, unless and until we gave individuals with \ndisabilities access to health care, they would not, could not work to \ntheir full potential. That is why I am so proud that we are on the \nverge of changing the law that will, at last, change the lives of 9.5 \nmillion individuals with disabilities who have been waiting, pleading \nthat we take this step.\n  These millions of Americans want and will use the job training and \njob placement assistance that this legislation authorizes. They will \nbenefit from the advice and guidance that will be available on the \ncomplicated work incentives options in Federal law. They will go to \nwork, work longer hours, work more hours, and seek advancement knowing \nthat their health care will be there when they need it.\n  For those who look beyond what this legislation means in human terms, \nto its monetary applications, I say, you will see results. The taxpayer \nrolls will expand. Use of Federal and State public assistance programs \nwill decrease. Data on the health care needs and costs of working \nindividuals with severe disabilities will be collected. Private \nemployers and their insurers will have data from which they may \ncalculate risks and craft health care insurance options for employees \nwith disabilities.\n  This conference report represents sound federal policy. Last night \nour colleagues in the House, on a vote of 418 to 2, endorsed this \npolicy. We must do the same. Let us celebrate and confirm the consensus \nwe have achieved. Individuals with disabilities are waiting to show us \nhow they are ready, willing, and able to join the workforce, support \ntheir families, and contribute to their communities and our national \neconomy.\n  The action we are taking is the next logical step in our efforts to \nensure that disabled Americans can fully participate in our society. In \n1975 we guaranteed each child with a disability a free appropriate \neducation through the precursor to the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act. In 1978, we prohibited discrimination based on \ndisability in all services, programs, and employment offered by or \nthrough the federal government. In 1988, for the first time, we \nrecognized and addressed the need to provide assistive technology to \nindividuals with disabilities.\n  And in 1990, we enacted the most comprehensive civil rights law for \nindividuals with disabilities, the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  Each of these actions was a building block toward true independence \nfor individuals with disabilities.\n  But the promise of employment rights under the ADA was an empty one \nfor millions of Americans who couldn't afford to take advantage of \ntheir rights. Today, we are making good on that promise.\n  I want to again commend the principal cosponsors of this legislation, \nSenators Kennedy, Roth, and Moynihan for their incredible \ncontributions. Five months ago, the four of us joined President Clinton \nin a room just off the Senate floor to call for enactment of this \nlegislation.\n  I was confident then that the day would soon come, and I am elated \nthat it finally has. It is the end of the session, we are all tired, \nand some tempers are frayed. But Mr. President, as we conclude our work \nfor the year and return to our states, this is one accomplishment of \nwhich we can all be proud.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The distinguished Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have the pleasure to yield up to 15 \nminutes to my good and old friend, the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, who has been so instrumental in this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n\n[[Page S14974]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join with Senator Moynihan and Senator \nRoth in commending our colleagues on the Finance Committee for their \nstrong work in helping bring us to where we are today. I thank them for \ntheir leadership.\n  I would especially like to acknowledge Senator Jeffords, who has been \ninstrumental in the development of the legislation. And I, all of us on \nthis side and throughout the Senate and across the country always \nrecognize the real leader on all of the disability issues, our friend \nfrom Iowa, Senator Harkin, who has had a lifetime of commitment on the \nissues of promoting the interests of disabled Americans. The Senate \nwill welcome his comments this afternoon.\n  Today, Congress will complete action on the Ticket to Work and the \nWork Incentives Improvement Act, and this important legislation will go \nat long last to the White House. When President Clinton signs this bill \ninto law, he will truly be signing a modern Declaration of Independence \nfor millions of men and women with disabilities in communities across \nthe country who will have a priceless new opportunity to fulfill their \nhopes and dreams of living independent and productive lives.\n  We know how far we have come in the ongoing battle over many decades \nto ensure that people with disabilities have the independence they need \nto be participating members of their communities.\n  Mr. President, 67 years ago this month we elected a disabled American \nto the highest office in the land. He became one of the greatest \nPresidents, but Franklin Roosevelt was compelled by the prevailing \nattitudes of his time to conceal his disability as much as possible. \nThe World War II Generation began to change all that. The 1950s showed \nthe Nation a new class of people--people with disabilities--as veterans \nreturned from the war to an inaccessible society. Each decade since \nthen has brought significant progress.\n  In the 1960s, Congress responded with new architectural standards so \nwe could build a society of which everyone could be a part.\n  The 1970s convinced us that full participation in society was needed, \nnot only for disabled veterans but for disabled children and family \nmembers and for those injured in everyday accidents. Congress responded \nwith a range of federally funded programs which improved the lives of \npeople with mental retardation, supported the rights of children with \ndisabilities to go to school, ensured the right of people with \ndisabilities to vote, and gave people with disabilities greater access \nto health care.\n  The 1980s brought a new realization that when we are talking about \nassisting people with disabilities, we must not look only to Federal \nprograms, but to the private sector as well. Congress again responded \nby guaranteeing fair housing opportunities for people with \ndisabilities, by ensuring access to air travel, and making \ntelecommunication advances available for people who are hard of hearing \nor deaf.\n  The 1990s brought us the Americans with Disabilities Act, which \npromised every disabled citizen a new and better life, in which \ndisability would no longer put an end to the American dream.\n  But too often, for too many Americans, the promise of the ADA has \nbeen unfulfilled. Now, with this legislation, we will finally link \ncivil rights clearly with health care. It isn't civil and it isn't \nright to send a person to work without the health care they need and \ndeserve.\n  As Bob Dole stated in his eloquent testimony to the Finance Committee \nearlier this year, this issue is about people going to work--``it is \nabout dignity and opportunity and all the things we talk about, when we \ntalk about being an American.''\n  Millions of disabled men and women in this country want to work and \nare able to work. But they have been denied the opportunity to work \nbecause they lack access to needed health care. As result, the Nation \nhas been denied their talents and their contributions to our \ncommunities.\n  Current laws are an anachronism. Modern medicine and modern \ntechnology make it easier than ever before for disabled persons to have \nproductive lives and careers. Current laws are often a greater obstacle \nto that goal than their disability itself. It's ridiculous that we \npunish disabled persons who dare to take a job by penalizing them \nfinancially, by taking away their health insurance lifeline, and by \nplacing other unfair obstacles in their path.\n  Currently, there are approximately 9 million working-age adults who \nreceive disability benefits, many of whom could take jobs if they could \nkeep their governmentally financed health benefits. A national survey \nearlier this year showed that, while 76 percent of people with \ndisabilities wanted to work, nearly 75 percent are unemployed. Of those \nreceiving benefits, only \\1/2\\ of 1% leave the disability roles to \nreturn to work.\n  Disability groups have estimated that about 2 million of the 8 \nmillion would consider forgoing disability payments and take jobs as a \nresult of this legislation.\n  The estimated cost of this new program would be recouped if only \n70,000 people leave the disability benefit roles. If 210,000 of them \ntake jobs, the government would actually save $1 billion annually in \ndisability payments.\n  That 210,000 constitutes only 10% of the number of people who the \ndisability community believe will avail themselves of this program. If \ntheir estimates are even close to accurate, the savings to the Federal \nGovernment could eventually approach $10 billion per year. Far more \nimportant that the savings is the impact on people's lives. It is about \ndignity. It is about opportunity that is by far the most important \ncharge.\n  Today is a new beginning for persons with disabilities in their \npursuit of the American dream. This bill corrects the injustice they \nhave unfairly suffered.\n  The Work Incentives Improvement Act removes these unfair barriers to \nwork that face so many Americans with disabilities:\n  In makes health insurance available and affordable when a disabled \nperson goes to work, or develops a significant disability while \nworking.\n  It gives people with disabilities greater access to the services they \nneed to become successfully employed.\n  It phases out the loss of cash benefits as income rises, instead of \nthe unfair sudden cut-off that workers with disabilities face today.\n  It places work incentive planners in communities, rather than in \nbureaucracies, to help workers with disabilities learn how to obtain \nthe employment services and support they need.\n  Many leaders in communities throughout the country have worked long \nand hard and well to help us reach this milestone. They are consumers, \nfamily members, citizens, and advocates. They showed us how current job \nprograms for people with disabilities are failing them and forcing them \ninto poverty.\n  In all the time I have been in the Senate, I doubt if there has \nreally been a single piece of legislation that has so coherently \nreflected the common concerns of a constituency and all of that \nconstituency worked so effectively on recommendations to the Congress \nof the United States.\n  We have worked together for many months to develop effective ways to \nright these wrongs. And to all of them I say, thank you for helping us \nto achieve this needed legislation. It truly represents legislation of \nthe people, by the people and for the people. It is all of you who have \nbeen the fearless, tireless warriors for justice.\n  When we think of citizens with disabilities, we tend to think of men \nand women and children who are disabled from birth. But fewer than 15% \nof all people with disabilities are born with their disabilities. A \nbicycle accident or a serious fall or a serious illness can suddenly \ndisable the healthiest and most physically able person.\n  In the long run, this legislation may be more important than any \nother action we have taken in this Congress.\n  I say that very sincerely. In the long run, this legislation may be \nthe most important piece of legislation we have passed in this \nCongress. Its offers a new and better life to large numbers of our \nfellow citizens. Disability need no longer end the American dream. That \nwas the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act a decade ago, \nand this legislation dramatically strengthens our fulfillment of that \npromise.\n  This bill has a human face. It is for Alice in Oklahoma, who was \ndisabled because of multiple sclerosis and receives SSDI benefits. She \nwill now be able to get personal assistance to work\n\n[[Page S14975]]\n\nand live in here community. No longer will she have to use all of her \nsavings and half of her wages to pay for personal assistance and \nprescription drugs. No longer will she be left in poverty.\n  This bill is for Tammy in Indiana, who has cerebral palsy and uses a \nwheelchair and works part-time at Wal-Mart. No longer will she be \nforced to restrict her hours of work. Her goals of becoming a \nproductive citizen will no longer be denied--because now she will have \naccess to the health care she needs.\n  This bill is for Abby in Massachusetts, who is six years old and has \nmental retardation. Her parents are very concerned about her future. \nAlready, she has been denied coverage by two health insurance firms \nbecause of the diagnosis is of mental retardation. Without Medicaid, \nher parents would be bankrupted by her current medical bills. Now when \nAbby enters the work force, she will not have to live in poverty or \nlose her Medicaid coverage. All that will change, and she will have a \nfair opportunity to work and prosper.\n\n  This bill is for many other citizens whose stories are told in this \ndiary, called ``A Day in the Life of a Person with a Disability.''\n  Disabled people are not unable. Our goal in this legislation is to \nbanish the stereotypes, to reform and improve existing disability \nprograms, so that they genuinely encourage and support every disabled \nperson's dream to work and live independently, and be a productive and \ncontributing member of their community. That goal should be the \nbirthright of all Americans--and with this legislation, we are taking a \ngiant step toward that goal.\n  A story from the debate on the Americans with Disabilities Act \nillustrates the point. A postmaster in a town was told that he must \nmake his post office accessible. The building had 20 steep steps \nleading up to a revolving door at the only entrance. The postmaster \nquestioned the need to make such costly repairs. He said, ``I've been \nhere for thirty-five years, and in all that time, I've yet to see a \nsingle customer come in here in a wheelchair.'' As the Americans with \nDisabilities Act has proved so well, if you build the ramp, they will \ncome, and they will find their field of dreams. This bill builds new \nramps, and vast numbers of the disabled will now come--to work.\n  The road to economic prosperity and the right to a decent wage must \nbe more accessible to all Americans--no matter how many steps stand in \nthe way. That is our goal in this legislation. It is the right thing to \ndo, and it is the cost effective thing to do. And now we are finally \ndoing it.\n  Eliminating these barriers to work will help disabled Americans to \nachieve self-sufficiency. We are a better and stronger and fairer \ncountry when we open the door of opportunity to all Americans, and \nenable them to be equal partners in the American dream. For millions of \nAmericans with disabilities, this bill is a declaration of independence \nthat can make the American dream come true. Now, when we say ``equal \nopportunity for all,'' it will be clear that we mean all.\n  No one in America should lose their medial coverage--which can mean \nthe difference between life and death--if they go to work. No one in \nthis country should have to choose between buying a decent meal and \nbuying the medication they need.\n  Nearly a year ago, President Clinton signed an executive order to \nincrease employment and health care coverage for people with \ndisabilities. Today, with strong bipartisan support, Congress is \ndemonstrating its commitment to our fellow disabled citizens. But our \nwork is far from done.\n  This bill is only the first step in the major reform of the Social \nSecurity disability programs that will enable individuals with \ndisabilities to have the rights and privileges that all other Americans \nenjoy; 54 million Americans with disabilities are waiting for our \naction. We will not stop today, we will not stop tomorrow, we will not \never stop until America works for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, in these final moments, I especially commend President \nClinton, Vice President Gore, and Secretary Shalala. President Clinton \nmade this one of his top priorities over this year and during these \nfinal negotiations. He understands the importance of this legislation, \nand this was a matter of central importance to him and his Presidency.\n  I also thank John Podesta and Chris Jennings who saw this through to \nthe very end.\n  I commend the many Senate staff members whose skilled assistance \ncontributed so much to the achievement: Jennifer Baxendale, Alec \nVachon, and Frank Polk of Senator Roth's staff; Kristin Testa, John \nResnick, Edwin Park, and David Podoff of Senator Moynihan's staff; Pat \nMorrissey, Lu Zeph, Chris Crowley, Jim Downing, and Mark Powden of \nSenator Jeffords' staff; Connie Garner--a special thanks to Connie \nGarner--Jim Manley, Jonathan Press, Jeffrey Teitz, and Michael Myers of \nmy own staff; and the many other staff members of the Health Committee \nand the Finance Committee.\n  No longer will disabled Americans be left out and left behind. The \nTicket to Work and the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 is an \nact of courage, an act of community, and, above all, an act of hope for \nthe future. I urge its passage, and I reserve the remainder of the time \nof the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much, I say to Senator Roth.\n  I might say, on the bill that we are speaking to, the Ticket to Work \nand Work Incentives Improvement Act, I do not know how many Senators \nhave ever had a disabled person who is holding a job and getting a \npaycheck. Come and see them. A disabled person who is holding a job and \njust got a paycheck--and you get to visit with them--they are glowing. \nThey are filled with pride that they are able to work. Actually, it is \nthe best therapy in the world for a disabled person to have a job.\n  I happen to know that from personal experience in my own family. But \nI have seen it in scores of faces of people who come and tell me as \ndisabled people that they are working and they are getting a paycheck.\n  The U.S. Government, probably because it did not understand what it \nwas doing, decided that we would help disabled people who were not \nworking with health insurance, either under Medicare or Medicaid. Then \nwhat a cruel hoax, as soon as they started working and making \nsufficient money, as low as $700 a month, they started losing their \nhealth care coverage, and they began to wonder and their parents began \nto wonder, why did they ever take a job?\n  For some, they did not even make any net profit out of getting a job. \nBecause if they are cut off from health care, some of them have to pay \ntheir entire paycheck to take care of their illness. That is just not \nright. Frankly, it was a hard issue in terms of drafting something that \ncould work, and I compliment everybody that worked on this bill. I \nthink it is a very important day today.\n  In fact, I am sorry it is getting passed along with a great deal of \nother legislation because the importance of it might very well get \nlost. Sometimes a long debate on a bill is meritorious, for the country \nfinds out what we are doing. They are not necessarily going to find out \nabout this bill because we did not use a lot of time today. But I asked \nthe distinguished chairman if I could use a few moments and he gave it \nto me. Now, if the Senate would bear with me, I just want to take the \nremaining time I have, and how much is that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes remaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S14975-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14975-S14977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to take a few moments to thank a few people \nand summarize the budget bill that we are going to pass this evening, \nhopefully.\n  I want to thank the White House for their cooperation in coming to an \nagreement with reference to the appropriations bill and all of those \nthings that are in the so-called omnibus package.\n  In particular, I want to thank the director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, Mr. Lew. The last evening\n\n[[Page S14976]]\n\nwhen we were about to depart and part company and say we will go our \nown ways, they asked me if I would meet with Mr. Lew, and if we could \nsee if we could work something out. We are here today with a bipartisan \nbill because we did work something out.\n  I thought it was the very best thing we could do. Frankly, I am proud \nof it. I wish it could have been done sooner. I am hoping that next \nyear we will get the appropriations bills done perhaps 6 to 7 or 8 \nweeks sooner than we did this year. But I want to start by quoting from \nthe New York Times, not necessarily a newspaper that thinks what \nRepublicans do is necessarily good, as I do, but they said in their \neditorial, on their editorial page, the following thing about this \nbudget bill that we are going to have before us:\n  There are modest spending increases in some of the President's \npriority areas like education but over all the Republican approach  of \nspending restraint has shaped this budget.''\n\n  I am very proud of that. I think that is true because what we have \ndone is we have kept the faith with those who want a balanced budget. \nThis budget proposal ensures a balanced budget without using Social \nSecurity trust fund money.\n  I ask parenthetically for those who still doubt that because they do \nnot have a Congressional Budget Office letter that says it, if the \nPresident of the United States would be asking Democrats to vote for \nthis measure if he and his OMB Director thought it was using Social \nSecurity trust fund money? I think the answer is no. They know it does \nnot. I know it does not. And I can promise the Senate, come February or \nMarch, when you reestimate everything, it will not be using the Social \nSecurity trust fund money.\n  I think that is the new discipline that has been imposed on our \neconomy and our fiscal policy. It is a brand new event to say we are \nnot going to spend Social Security money, and it is the best thing we \ncan do for the American economy because, Senator Moynihan, to the \nextent we do not spend it, we reduce the public debt. So for those who \nare wondering about the public debt, the public debt is reduced dollar \nfor dollar when you leave Social Security surpluses alone year by year \nas they accumulate and do not spend them.\n  Now, let me tell you a dramatic statement about our current fiscal \npolicy. Who would think a budget chairman could stand on the floor and \nsay to the Senators who are listening, we will pay down the publicly-\nheld debt by $130 billion? Think of that--$130 billion. If that does \nnot mean that as soon as we saw surplus we did not run out and spend \nit, then I do not know what it means.\n  Frankly, I think my good friend, Senator Gramm from Texas, is \ncorrect; in about 30 or 40 years, when they look back on this period in \ntime, they are going to say: Incredible. With the kind of surpluses \nthat existed, not a single new entitlement program of major proportion \nwas started, and not a single new American spending program was started \nbecause the accumulations went into the Social Security trust fund \ninstead of being used to pay for more Government.\n  I am proud of that. I think it is the best medicine for growth and \nprosperity in the future.\n  It holds Government spending, as we calculate it overall, to about \n3.3 percent this year over last year--that includes entitlements and \nappropriations--a very interesting number.\n  In the 1970's, it was 11 percent growth.\n  In the 1980's, it was 8 percent growth.\n  For those who in editorial comments across this land call this a \nbloated budget, let me suggest, the fiscal policy of the United States \nwhich has the Government growing less than the economy is growing is \nnot bad fiscal policy. That is about where we are now under the \nculmination of this budget process for this year.\n  In the meantime, when we passed the budget resolution in April of \nthis past year, we said we wanted to do some very important things.\n  First, we wanted to increase the flexibility in education programs. \nIt does not matter how much the President or others claim that the \nPresident won the education battle. The truth of the matter is, \nRepublicans put more money in education than the President asked for.\n  For the first time we have flexibility. Twenty percent of the money \nthat was going to go to teachers directly, and targeted and for nothing \nelse, can be flexibly used by school districts. And the philosophical \nbattle of the future will be flexibility of education funds with \naccountability versus the targeting and direct aid in very numerous and \nnumbers of targeted mandates that Government says one size fits all. \nYou all use it this way, or you cannot use it at all.\n  We suggested in our budget resolution that we should put more money \ninto research on the dread diseases that affect our people and mankind. \nWe increased NIH $2.3 billion, which is $2 billion more than the \nPresident asked for, for dreaded diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, and \nthe whole list.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Food allergies.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Allergies--all kinds of things.\n  We believe the breakthroughs will come in the next the millennium \nfrom this kind of investment. We are proud of it. We increased national \ndefense--if you take out emergencies--by $13.5 billion, and increased \nthe pay for the military at a very significant rate, which was long \noverdue and much needed.\n  In addition, also in this bill, we have taken care of the \nshortcomings in Medicare that came from the Balanced Budget Act. And \n$16 billion goes into that in the next 5 years, including $2.1 billion \nto replenish skilled nursing home payments. Also, the therapy caps have \nchanged. There are slower reductions in payments for teaching \nhospitals, and a long list of changes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROVISIONS SUMMARY\n         [Nov. 18, 1999, CBO estimates, in billions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                             2000   2000-2004  2000-2009\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIncrease Skilled Nursing Facilities            0.3       2.1        2.1\n Payments.................................\n2 Year Moratorium on Therapy Caps.........     0.2       0.6        0.6\nSlow Reductions for Teaching Hospitals....     0.2       0.6        0.6\nHospital Outpatient Department Payments...     0.3       5.3       11.1\nRural Hospital Provisions.................     0.0       0.8        1.7\nDelay 15% Home Health Reduction...........     0.0       1.3        1.3\nMedicare+Choice Payments..................     0.0       1.9        2.5\nMiscellaneous Medicaid and S-CHIP.........     0.1       0.9        1.6\nOther.....................................     0.1       2.5        5.5\n                                           -----------------------------\n    Total.................................     1.2      16.0       27.0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     1.

And Senator Robert Byrd, ranking member, what a \ndifficult job he had.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kyle \nKinner, a presidential management intern with the Finance Committee \nminority staff, be granted the privilege of the floor during the \nconsideration of this conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I have the great pleasure to yield 5 minutes to my \nfriend from Illinois, Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I salute Senator Roth, Senator Moynihan, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Harkin, and others who worked so hard on this \nWork Incentives Improvement Act.\n  A close friend of my family had a son who was mentally ill. This \nyoung man wanted more than anything to go to work. He knew if he did \nso, he would lose the protection of health insurance. So he was held \nback from that opportunity. I don't believe he was better for that. I \ndon't believe America was better for that.\n  This bill addresses that challenge and says that as the disabled go \nto work, they will still be able to use Medicaid and Medicare to \nprotect themselves with health insurance even as they earn some income. \nThat is only just. It opens up an opportunity that currently is not \nthere. I am happy to be a supporter of this legislation. I look forward \nto voting for it when it comes to the floor.\n  There is some reservation in my mind about the bill that is before \nus, not because of the provision I just mentioned, nor because of the \nextension of certain tax credits and benefits, but, rather, because of \nthe language in this bill relating to organ donation.\n  This is the challenge we face in America. If you are an American \ngrievously ill, in need of an organ transplant, your chances of \nsurvival depend more than anything on your address and how much money \nyou have. You could be the most seriously ill person in some State in \nthis Union and be overlooked and bypassed in favor of another patient \nin another State who is not as seriously ill and might be able to wait. \nThat needs to change. That is certainly not a fair or American way.\n  The rules we are trying to promulgate to make that change have been \nthe source of great controversy on Capitol Hill. It is sad when it \ncomes to a point where Members of the House and Senate are deeply \ninvolved in a debate over the availability of organs for donation to \nthose who need a transplant to live.\n  In my State of Illinois, over the last 3 years, 97 people have died \nwaiting for organ transplants at the University of Chicago. I see my \ncolleague from the State of Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, where 187 \npeople died waiting at the University of Pittsburgh. My colleagues, \nSenator Moynihan and Senator Schumer, know that 99 people died waiting \nat Mount Sinai in New York. In the last week alone, two people have \ndied at one of the Chicago transplant centers because an organ did not \nbecome available.\n  If you are an American who needs a liver transplant to survive and \nyou live in the following States, you have much less chance of \nreceiving the transplant: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, \nIllinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New York, or Pennsylvania.\n  This is not a fair system. It is a system which cries out for justice \nand one that cries out for the politicians to step aside. Let the \nmedical community find the best and most efficient way organs can move \nto the people who need them to live, instead of getting caught up in \nsome special interest tangle here or political dogfight. It is sad that \nwe are now in a situation on this bill where we have not resolved this \ncontentious issue. I sincerely hope all parties will come together, and \nsoon, to make certain that changes are made to make the system fairer. \nWe know, by the people we represent, that this is literally a life-or-\ndeath argument.\n  Kathryn Krivy lives in Chicago. She runs the wellness clinic at the \nNorthwestern Memorial Hospital. She is desperately in need of a new \nliver. She has developed primary biliary cirrhosis, a very rare \nautoimmune disease that is incurable. She has been on the transplant \nlist in Chicago for over 2 years, but currently, because of the delay, \nshe has decided to sign up at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota because it \nis much more likely she can receive a transplant in a shorter period of \ntime. She has the knowledge and the resources to make that decision, \nbut many of the poorer people in America waiting for an organ \ntransplant do not have that luxury.\n  We should not reach the point in America where something as basic as \nthe gift of life, an organ donation, depends on your home address. That \nis exactly what has occurred. An estimated 66,000 potential organ \nrecipients are waiting their turn. Only 20,000 will see an organ \ntransplant this year. Nearly, 5,000 Americans will die each year, at \nleast 13 every day, while awaiting organ transplants. Of those, it is \nestimated that 300 to 1,000 Americans, maybe up to 3 a day, might be \nspared if this system were fairer and were revised. Unfortunately, that \nis not the case.\n  Though this is an excellent bill which I support, I believe it is a \nsad commentary that we have reached this state of affairs. I hope in \nthe next session of Congress we can bring justice to organ donation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today the United States Senate completes \nits business for calendar year 1999 by passing two important bills: \nH.R. 3194--the final spending bill, and H.R. 1180--the Work Incentives \nAct, which provides new opportunities for disabled individuals to enter \nthe work force and includes $18 billion dollars in tax cuts. I am \npleased to announce my support for both these bills.\n  The Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee has eloquently explained \nhow this budget agreement keeps faith with the Republican pledge that \nno Social Security trust fund monies be used to pay for other \ngovernment programs.\n  Last year, for the first since 1960--during the Eisenhower \nAdministration--we balanced the budget without counting the Social \nSecurity surplus. Mr. President, for the first time in 39 years the \ngovernment did not divert money from the Social Security Trust Fund to \npay for other programs.\n  As a result of the spending plan pursued by this Republican Congress, \nwhich called for protection of Social Security, increased spending on \neducation and defense, and reduction of the national debt, we have \nbegun to put our fiscal House in order.\n  When I was elected to this body in 1994, the incoming 104th Congress \ninherited a projected four-year budget deficit of $906 billion. Now, \nthrough the hard work and discipline of this Congress, the tables have \nturned. That actual four-year period produced a net budget surplus of \n$63 billion--a turnaround of $969 billion, just a shade under a \ntrillion dollars. With the passage of the final FY 2000 appropriations \nbill, we will continue on that path, reducing our national debt by $140 \nbillion dollars in the current fiscal year.\n  Unlike last year's omnibus appropriations package that increased \nspending by almost $14 billion, this Congress successfully obtained \noffsets for all of the President's new spending, including an across-\nthe-board cut that will help eliminate government waste and excess. In \naddition, despite President Clinton's best efforts, the offsets do not \ninclude a tax increase.\n  At the beginning of this year, I said that the Congress' primary \nresponsibility was to protect the Social Security surplus. With the \npassage of this budget, we have accomplished that goal. In addition, \nnot only have we avoided a tax hike, but we have also given the \nAmerican people an $18 billion tax cut through the provisions contained \nin H.R. 1180--the Work Incentives Act.\n  I am pleased that the final bill includes over $2 billion in \nadditional education spending over last year and gives local school \ndistricts more flexibility in how they spend that federal\n\n[[Page S14978]]\n\nassistance. The appropriations bill also contains an increase of $1.7 \nbillion for veterans spending above President Clinton's request, as \nwell as an increase in funding for national defense that includes a \nboost in pay and benefits for our soldiers, sailors, and airmen.\n\n  But this bill does not just fund these important priorities, it also \nprovides real cuts in government waste and abuse. The legislation \nincludes a 0.38% across the board reduction that is essential to \nmaintaining our fiscal discipline and protecting Social Security.\n  Included in this package are provisions to address some unintended \nconsequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to protect Medicare \nrecipients and providers. This bill includes $16 billion over 5 years \nto ensure that senior citizens can continue to receive quality health \ncare.\n  These Medicare changes will help Medicare patients in hospitals--\nparticularly rural, teaching, and cancer hospitals--skilled nursing \nfacility residents, home health care recipients, and seniors who wish \nto receive their health care through the innovative Medicare+Choice \nprogram rather than through the conventional fee-for-service mechanism. \nI have traveled around Missouri and heard from countless doctors, \npatients, nurses, and other health care providers about the necessity \nof these changes. These provisions are good for the seniors in Missouri \nand across the Nation.\n  The package also provides for State Department Reauthorization, \nincluding language I authored that requires the State Department to \npublish a report documenting American victims of terrorist attacks in \nIsrael, Gaza, and the West Bank.\n  In addition, the almost 400,000 Missouri households that are \nsatellite television viewers will be pleased that this bill includes \nlanguage that will allow them to continue receiving local programming. \nThe Satellite Home Viewer Act will give real price competition and \nchoice in video programming to all Missourians.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am pleased that unlike last year, when we \nlumped all the bills together, allowing $14 billion in extra spending \ninto one package, this year we finished our work on each of the bills, \nand negotiated each bill on its individual merits. While this bill is \nan omnibus package for procedural reasons, it was not negotiated as an \nomnibus package. Every provision was negotiated according to regular \norder, and as a result, we were able to succeed in our goal of \nprotecting Social Security.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to support this conference \nreport and I say, Mr. President, that I am very happy to have been an \noriginal cosponsor of the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999.\n  People all across Minnesota who have contacted my office know the \nimportance of the Work Incentives Improvement Act and how it will \nfurther expand the possibilities opened up by the Americans with \nDisabilities Act which was enacted in 1990. Thanks to the ADA, many \npeople with disabilities in Minnesota and around the country are \nworking, but others still cannot accept jobs because they would lose \ntheir health care coverage. This Act will allow them to fulfill their \ndreams for employment and to be productive citizens.\n  This legislation has enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support--with 79 \nSenate cosponsors. It would make it easier for those receiving \ndisability benefits through Social Security programs to go to work \nwithout losing their Medicare or Medicaid health benefits. The \nlegislation also encourages the disabled to seek paid employment by \ngradually reducing their cash benefits as income increases, rather than \ncutting them off completely.\n  Let's look at the current situation for disabled individuals who seek \nemployment and require health insurance coverage. For some of these \npeople, employer-based coverage is unavailable because they are self-\nemployed or because their disabilities prevent them from working full-\ntime. For others, coverage is unaffordable because of co-pays and co-\ninsurance for repeated, ongoing treatments. For those offered \naffordable employer insurance, these plans generally cover only primary \nand acute care, not the specialized medications, equipment, supplies \nand other long term care needs that individuals with disabilities \nunfortunately require.\n  Last year, in the Spring of 1998, the Minnesota Consortium for \nCitizens with Disabilities surveyed 1200 Minnesotans who have \ndisabilities and found the vast majority were ready to go to work if \ntheir current health care benefits remained intact.\n  Here are two examples from Minnesota:\n  Let me tell my colleagues about Steve. Steve is a middle-aged adult \nwith advanced Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy. He is married, has two \ngrown children, and owns his own home in rural Minnesota. As the \nmanifestations of his condition progressively worsen, Steve has \nstruggled to remain self-sufficient as long as possible using all of \nhis personal resources. Steve's desire to remain an independent \ncontributing member of society is evident in his efforts to develop the \nskills that enable him to work from home in a computer-based business. \nSteve is on SSDI making him eligible for Medical Assistance that pays \nfor his health care needs. He is growing weaker and cannot afford to \nlose his medical assistance eligibility. Steve has a fledgling \npublishing business; ghost-writing and copy-writing. He crafts sales \nads and creates direct mail advertising packages. Steve uses the \nInternet to market his services. He uses his website as a forum for \nother authors to advertise their books. He sells space as one would a \nclassified ad. Steve is becoming involved with e-bay auctioning \nfocusing onbooks--first editions and autographed copies. Steve says the \nWork Incentives Improvement Act is his only opportunity to become \nfinancially independent. ``If a person in my position is at risk for \nall of the medical expenses that one could incur, that is a big \nincentive not to try to get ahead. I still have my pride, my ego, the \ndesire to rise above.''\n\n  Another Minnesotan whose story I would like to tell is Jean. Jean is \nin her mid-forties and has had Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease since early \nchildhood. Her muscles have wasted away from her elbows to her finger \ntips and from her thighs to her toes. She has trunk weakness and uses a \npower wheelchair for mobility. Jean works in an office as a clerk-\ntypist using a pencil held between her two hands to strike the computer \nkeys and a trackball to navigate her computer. Jean's career is limited \nby not being able to accept raises, declining wage rewards for the \ncontinuing education and skills she has gained, because if she accepted \nthese well deserved raisers, she would exceed Supplemental Security \nIncome's (SSI) earnings threshold of just $500/month and lose her \neligibility for medical assistance. ``It just seems unfair that people \nwith disabilities don't have the same opportunities to advance in their \ncareers. Why can't we earn enough money to live in a house? To purchase \na van with a lift? To travel?''\n  These are but two of the thousands of disabled Americans who, with \nguaranteed continued health care coverage--coverage they already have--\nwould be able to lead more productive lives, productive for themselves, \nfor their families and for their communities. In my state there are not \nenough workers to meet the needs of Minnesota employers. and I know it \nis also the case in many communities around the country. According to \nthe Disability Institute, in 7 years Minnesota will need 1 million new \nworkers. The Work Incentives Improvement Act will help match the needs \nof Minnesota's disabled community with Minnesota employers. That is \nwhat I call a real win-win situation.\n  When President Bush signed the Americans with Disability Act in 1990, \nhe noted that when you add together all the state, federal, local and \nprivate funds, it costs almost $200 billion annually to support people \nwith disabilities--to keep them dependent. The ADA was the first giant \nstep forward to allow Americans with disabilities to be independent. \nThe Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 which we have before us \ntoday is another giant step along the same path, and today I am happy \nto say that we will be taking that step.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, yesterday, the House and Senate Conference \nCommittee reached agreement on the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives \nImprovement Act of 1999, which addresses\n\n[[Page S14979]]\n\na fundamental inequity for individuals with disabilities.\n  As a heart and lung transplant surgeon, I witnessed unfair \ndiscrimination against patients with disabilities. After a successful \ntransplant, several of my patients were faced with a serious dilemma. \nThey had to choose between keeping their health insurance coverage or \nreturning to work. Under current law, if these patients choose to \nreturn to work and earn more than $500 per month, they lose their \ndisability payments and health care coverage provided through Medicare \nand Medicaid as part of their Social Security Disability Insurance \n(SSDI). This is health care coverage that they simply cannot get in the \nprivate sector, as it is extremely difficult for individuals with \nsevere disabilities to obtain coverage due to their medical history.\n  Let me illustrate the profound impact this dilemma has had on our \ndisabled Americans. Today, the unemployment rate among working-age \nadults with disabilities is nearly 75 percent. Only 7% of disabled \nAmericans--318,728 of the 4.2 million non-blind individuals with \ndisabilities--were working in 1997, according the General Accounting \nOffice. Many persons with disabilities who currently receive federal \ndisability benefits, such as SSDI and Supplemental Security Income \n(SSI), want to work; however, less than one-half of one percent of \nthese beneficiaries successfully forego disability benefits and become \nself-sufficient. If disabled individuals try to work and increase their \nincome, they lose their disability cash benefits and their health care \ncoverage. The loss of these benefits is simply too powerful of a \ndisincentive to return to work.\n  In addition, more than 7.5 million disabled Americans receive cash \nbenefits from SSI and SSDI. Disability benefit spending for SSI and \nSSDI totals $73 billion a year, making these disability programs the \nfourth largest entitlement expenditure in the federal government. If \nonly one percent--or 75,000--of the 7.5 million disabled adults were to \nbecome employed, federal savings in disability benefits would total \n$3.5 billion over the lifetime of the beneficiaries. Removing barriers \nto work is not only a major benefit to disabled Americans in their \npursuit of self-sufficiency, but it also contributes to preserving the \nSocial Security Trust Fund.\n  This legislation is critical to the health and well-being of our \ndisabled Americans. It will create new opportunities for individuals \nwith disabilities to return to work while allowing them to maintain \ntheir health insurance coverage and disability benefits. In particular, \nthis bill expands new options to states under the Medicaid program for \nworkers with disabilities; continues Medicare coverage for working \nindividuals with disabilities; and establishes a ticket to work and \nself-sufficiency program.\n  I would like to thank Senator Jeffords for his leadership on this \ncritical issue. I would also like to thank Senators Lott, Roth, \nMoyinhan and Kennedy and their House colleagues for their dedication \ntoward reaching consensus on this important legislation.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Work \nIncentives Conference Report. As my colleagues know, this conference \nreport contains a number of items that have been joined together in \norder to accommodate the end of session schedule, and I would like to \noffer brief comments on several of those items.\n  With regard to the tax portion of the conference report, I am in \nsupport of the compromise that was reached to extend the expired tax \ncredits. Earlier this year, I supported an ambitious tax relief package \nwhich extended the credits and contained my child care tax credit and \nfarmer income averaging relief provisions, as well as targeted tax \nmeasures to help Americans pay for education and health care and to \nexpand the low-income housing tax credit. Hardworking American \ntaxpayers created the budget surplus, and a significant portion of that \nsurplus should be returned to them, allowing them to keep more of their \nown paychecks and helping them plan for their future. It is my hope \nthat when we return in the spring, we will rise above partisan concerns \nand achieve bipartisan progress towards comprehensive tax relief, as \nwell as the challenge of reforming both Medicare and Social Security \nAnd we must do so while continuing our vigilance in protecting the \nbalanced budget gains of recent years.\n  But for today we will content ourselves with the limited extenders \npackage before us. The research and development tax credit promotes \ninnovation and enhances the competitiveness of American business. The \nwork opportunity and welfare-to-work tax credits continue the \npartnership between the public and private sector to move those in need \nof a helping hand off of public assistance and into the workforce. I am \nalso pleased that this tax package preserves eligibility to important \ntax benefits, such as the child tax credit, by protecting against the \nencroachment of the alternative minimum tax. While I am concerned that \nthe conferees did not offset fully the costs of these provisions and \nwould have preferred a final version along the lines of the bipartisan, \nand fully offset, Senate bill, this package is modest and urgently \nneeded. It deserves our endorsement.\n  I am extremely pleased that we are finally taking the final step to \nenact the Work Incentives Improvement Act into law. I cosponsored this \nlegislation because I believe strongly that it will have a tremendous \nimpact on the lives of people with disabilities.\n  Currently, over 9 million people receive disability benefits through \nthe SSDI and SSI programs. Only \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of SSDI \nbeneficiaries, and only 1 percent of SSI beneficiaries ever return to \nwork. Yet we know that many--in fact, the vast majority--of people with \ndisabilities want to work. In study after study, people with \ndisabilities report that the single biggest obstacle to returning to \nwork is the loss of health care benefits that often comes along with \ntheir decision to work. Many do not have access to employer-based \nhealth insurance and find policies in the individual insurance market \nprohibitively expensive. Therefore, disabled beneficiaries who want to \nwork are faced with the choice of returning to work while risking their \nhealth benefits or forgoing work to maintain health coverage.\n  This is simply unacceptable. People with disabilities deserve every \nopportunity to live healthy, productive lives, and we should encourage \nand support their efforts to work by ensuring that they continue to \nhave access to the health care services they need. I am pleased that \nthe Work Incentives Improvement Act accomplishes that goal. This bill \nwill ensure that millions of people with disabilities have the \nopportunity to work if they are able--without the fear of losing the \nhealth insurance coverage they need in order to live healthier lives \nand to succeed in their work. I want to commend the bipartisan efforts \nof Chairman Roth, Senator Moynihan, Chairman Jeffords, and Senator \nKennedy, in making this bill a reality.\n  Again, I regret that end-of-year pressure has forced us to combine so \nmany unrelated provisions into a single bill. However, I support the \nconference report for the reasons I have just stated, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for its adoption.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, it is with great reluctance that I vote \nfor the Work Incentives Act Conference Report.\n  A particular provision, Section 408, has been added to this important \npiece of legislation at a date too late to make further changes. \nSection 408 was introduced in the House, included in the Conference \nReport, but never debated in the Senate. I am a cosponsor of the Senate \nversion of this bill.\n  In an effort to finish the first session of the 106th Congress we \nhave had no time to sound our concerns and make due changes. Section \n408 extends the authority of state medicaid fraud units. Not only would \nthis provision mandate more federal control over what has been \nhistorically governed by the states, it also calls for investigation \nand prosecution of resident abuse in non-Medicaid board and care \nfacilities. This provision allows the federal government unprecedented \ncontrol over the quality of care in private institutions. This is yet \nanother example of government authority exceeding its' boundaries. I \nhave always been a supporter of state's rights and less government \ncontrol and I feel these regulations are best promulgated by the \nstates. Certainly they should not be promulgated in the final days of \nthe session.\n\n[[Page S14980]]\n\n  It is my opinion that we must reduce the amount of federal government \nregulation and not further impede the rights of care providers and \nstate officials to monitor private industry. I make an effort to \nexamine all pieces of legislation to ensure that the end results is \nobjective and does not further burden individuals with undue \nregulation.\n  Again it is with great reluctance that I vote for this act. The \nchanges made in the Conference Report at this late date are onerous and \nthreaten the sanctity of private health care providers.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \ntax extenders package included in the Work Incentives Act conference \nreport. In the context of our current budget situation of a small \nprojected on-budget surplus for FY 2000, I believe this tax package \nstrikes an important balance between fiscal responsibility and tax \nrelief.\n  Although I would have preferred a fully offset tax package, I am \npleased that the bill is fully offset for FY2000 and partially offset \nfor FY2001, the two years for which most of the tax provisions are \nextended by law. If two years from now when we reconsider most of these \nprovisions a on-budget surplus does not exist, I will push for an \nextenders package that is fully offset to ensure that we do not go into \ndeficit as a result of tax relief measures.\n  The package includes several important provisions that I strongly \nsupport. The Research and Experimentation Tax Credit is important for \nour future international competitiveness. This tax credit provides an \nimportant incentive for our companies to research and innovate. I hope \nthat in the near future we will update this credit to reflect current \nbusiness conditions and to make it a permanent part of the tax code.\n  The AMT modification, the Worker Opportunity Tax Credit, and the \nWelfare-to-Work Tax Credit are all important provisions to help low to \nmoderate income earners create more opportunities and to improve their \nliving standards. I am pleased that the Finance Committee decided to \ninclude renewal of the Generalized System of Preferences in this tax \npackage. This is a critical program for promoting growth in developing \neconomies and for increasing international trade integration.\n  I strongly support the provision to extend and modify the tax credit \nfor electricity produced by wind and biomass materials. In order to \nensure energy security and address national environmental priorities \nsuch as clean air and mitigation of global climate change, it is \nessential that renewable energy options become more competitive. These \ntax provisions will ensure that renewable energy technologies will be \nable to compete more equitably with fossil sources such as coal and \noil. However, while this package includes modest extensions and \nmodifications, I am disappointed that the bill does not go further by \nextending the credit to include landfill methane and other cellulosic \nfeedstocks.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan for their \nhard work in getting this package together. It is a fiscally \nresponsible and an appropriate package under our current fiscal \nsituation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President I am delighted to stand before you today, \nto speak about an extremely important piece of legislation. The bill we \nare sending to the President today, a bill I know he is eager to sign \ninto law, will have a tremendous impact on people with disabilities. In \nfact, this legislation is the most important piece of legislation for \nthe disability community since the Americans with disabilities Act.\n  My reason for sponsoring this particular piece of legislation is \nquite simple. The Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 addresses a \nfundamental flaw in current law. Today, individuals with disabilities \nare forced to make a choice . . . an absurd choice. They must choose \nbetween working and receiving health care. Under current federal law, \nif people with disabilities work and earn over $700 per month, they \nwill lose cash payments and health care coverage under Medicaid or \nMedicare. This is health care coverage that they need. This is health \ncare coverage that they cannot get in the private sector. This is not \nright.\n  Once enacted, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 will allow \nindividuals with disabilities, in states that elect to participate, \ncontinuing access to health care when they return to work or remain \nworking. In addition, those individuals who seek it, will have access \nto job training and job placement assistance from a wider range of \nproviders than is available at this time. Currently, there are 9.5 \nmillion individuals with disabilities across the country who receive \ncash payments and health care coverage from the federal government. \nApproximately 24,000 of these individuals live in my home state, \nVermont. Once enacted, the Work Incentives Improvement Act will \nactually save the federal government money. For example, let's assume \nthat 200 Social Security disability beneficiaries in each state return \nto work and forgo cash payments. That would be 10,000 individuals out \nof the 9.5 million individuals with disabilities across the country. \nThe annual savings to the Federal Treasury in cash payments for just \nthese 10,000 people would be $133,550,000! Imagine the savings to the \nFederal Treasury if this number were higher. Clearly, the Work \nIncentives Improvement Act of 1999 is fiscally responsible legislation.\n  I began work on this bill 1996. Though it was a long and sometimes \ndifficult task, many hands made light work. Senator Kennedy, Ranking \nmember on the HELP Committee, joined me in March 1997. Senators Roth \nand Moynihan, Chairman and Ranking Member on the Finance Committee \nsigned on as committed partners in December of 1998. Last January, 35 \nof our colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, joined us in \nintroducing S. 331, the Senate version of this legislation. One week \nlater, in a Finance Committee hearing, we heard compelling \ntestimony from our friend, former Senator Dole, a strong supporter of \nthis legislation. A month later, we marked this legislation out of the \nFinance Committee with an overwhelming majority in favor of the bill. \nFinally, on June 15th, with a total of 80 cosponsors, we passed this \nlegislation on the floor of the United States Senate, with a unanimous \nvote of 99-0.\n\n  Four months later, over 35 of our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives, took to the floor of their chamber, and spoke \neloquently for their version of this legislation. Later that day, the \nbill passed the floor of the House with a vote of 412-9. Since then, \nthe Senate and House Conferees have been working diligently in effort \nto reach common ground. I am very pleased today, that the differences \nin policy in the two different bills have been resolved and consensus \nhas been reached on a conference agreement. This agreement does not \ncompromise the original intent of the legislation, retaining key \nprovisions from S. 331.\n  From my perspective, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 \nrepresents a natural and important progression in federal policy for \nindividuals with disabilities. That is, federal policy increasingly \nreflects the premise that individuals with disabilities are cherished \nby their families, valued and respected in their communities, and are \nan asset and resource to our national economy. Today, most federal \npolicy promotes opportunities for these individuals, regardless of the \nseverity of their disabilities, to contribute to their maximum \npotential--at home, in school, at work, and in the community.\n  I have been committed to improving the lives of individuals with \ndisabilities throughout my Congressional career. Providing a solid \nelementary and secondary education for children with disabilities, so \nthat they will be equipped, along with their peers, to benefit from \npost-secondary and employment opportunities is crucial. When I came to \nCongress in 1975, Public Law 94-142, the Education for all Handicapped \nChildren Act, now the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n(IDEA), was enacted into law. IDEA assures each child with a \ndisability, a free and appropriate public education. I am proud to be \none of the original drafters of this legislation which has reshaped \nwhat we offer to and expect of children with disabilities in our \nnation's schools.\n  In addition, I have been committed to providing job training \nopportunities for individuals with disabilities. In\n\n[[Page S14981]]\n\n1978, I played a central role in ensuring access to programs and \nservices offered by the federal government for individuals with \ndisabilities through an amendment to the Rehabilitation Act. I believe \nthat this amendment alone laid the foundation for significant \nlegislation that followed, including the Technology-Related Assistance \nfor Individuals with Disabilities Act of 1988, now the Assistive \nTechnology Act of 1998, both of which I drafted. Most importantly, this \nlegislation opened the doors for the most comprehensive piece of \nlegislation of all, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. This \nlegislation prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in \nemployment, public services, public accommodations, transportation, and \ntelephone service.\n  These laws have forever changed the social landscape of America. They \nserve as models for other countries who recognize that their citizens \nwith disabilities are an untapped resource. In our country, individuals \nwith disabilities are seen everywhere, doing everything. Just this past \nweekend, thousands of physically disabled individuals participated in \nthe New York City Marathon, as they have been doing for years. The \nexpectations that these people set for themselves and the standards we \napply to them have increasingly been raised, and now in many \ncircumstances equal those set and applied to other individuals.\n\n  Unfortunately, one major inequity remains. That is, the loss of \nhealth care coverage if an individual on the Social Security disability \nrolls chooses to work. Individuals with disabilities want to work. They \nhave told me this. In fact, a Harris survey found that 72 percent of \nAmericans with disabilities want to work, but only one-third of them do \nwork. With today's enactment of the Work Incentives Improvement Act of \n1999, individuals with disabilities will no longer need to worry about \nlosing their health care if they choose to work a forty-hour week, to \nput in overtime, or to pursue career advancement. Individuals with \ndisabilities are sitting at home right now, waiting for this \nlegislation to become law. Having a job will provide them with a sense \nof self-worth. Having a job will allow them to contribute to our \neconomy. Having a job will provide them with a living wage, which is \nnot what one has through Social Security.\n  In addition to continuing health care coverage and providing job \ntraining opportunities for individuals with disabilities, this \nlegislation offers many other substantial long-term benefits. The Work \nIncentives Improvement Act of 1999 will give us access to data \nregarding the numbers, the health care needs, and the characteristics \nof individuals with disabilities who work. Furthermore, this \nlegislation will provide the federal government as well as private \nemployers and insurers, the facts upon which to craft appropriate \nfuture health care options for working individuals with disabilities. \nIt will allow employers and insurers to factor in the effects of \nchanging health care needs over time for this population. Hopefully, it \nwill even improve the way in which employers operate return-to-work \nprograms. Through increased tracking of data, we will learn the \nbenefits of intervening with appropriate health care, when an \nindividual initially acquires a disability. We will also learn the \nvalue of continuing health care to a working individual with a \ndisability. If an individual, even with a severe disability, knows that \nhe or she has access to uninterrupted, appropriate health care, the \nindividual will be a healthier, happier and thus more productive \nworker.\n   I would like to take the time now to briefly outline the major \nprovisions which have remained as part of this legislation. The \nconference agreement retains the two state options of establishing \nMedicaid buy-ins for individuals on Social Security disability rolls, \nwho choose to work and exceed income limits in current law, as well as \nfor those who show medical improvement, but still have an underlying \ndisability. For working individuals with disabilities, the conference \nagreement extends access, beyond what is allowed in current law, to \nMedicare. In addition, the legislation before us today retains several \nkey provisions from S. 331, including, the authority to fund Medicaid \ndemonstration projects to provide access to health care to working \nindividuals with a potentially severe disability; the State \nInfrastructure Grant Program, to assist states in reaching and helping \nindividuals with disabilities who work; work incentive planners \nand protection and advocacy provisions; and finally, most of the \nprovisions in the Ticket to Work Program.\n\n  In order to control the cost of this legislation, compromises were \nmade. Although the purpose of the State Infrastructure Grant Program \nand the Medicaid Demonstration Grant Program remain the same, the terms \nand conditions of these grants were altered in conference. As a result, \nstates are not required to offer a Medicaid buy-in option to \nindividuals with disabilities on Social Security, who work and exceed \nincome limits in current law, prior to receiving an Infrastructure or a \nMedicaid Demonstration Grant.\n  Also in Conference, the extended period of eligibility for Medicare \nfor working individuals with disabilities has been changed from 24 to \n78 months. During this extended period, the federal government is to \ncover the cost of the Part A premium of Medicare for a working \nindividual with a disability, who is eligible for Medicare. S. 331 \nwould have extended such coverage for an individual's working life, if \nhe or she became eligible during a 6-year time period.\n  I would like to note two changes to the Ticket to Work program made \nduring Conference. The new legislation shifts the appointment authority \nfor the members of the Work Incentives Advisory Panel from the \nCommissioner of Social Security to the President and Congress. In \naddition, language regarding the reimbursements between employment \nnetworks and state vocational rehabilitation agencies was deleted in \nConference. The new legislation gives the Commissioner of Social \nSecurity the authority to address these matters through regulation.\n  Although several changes have been made from the original Work \nIncentives bill, I am still very pleased with what we are adopting \ntoday. This is legislation that makes sense, and it will contribute to \nthe well-being of millions of Americans, including those with \ndisabilities and their friends, their families, and their co-workers. \nToday's vote provides us the opportunity to bring responsible change to \nfederal policy and to eliminate a misguided result of the current \nsystem--if you don't work, you get health care; if you do work, you \ndon't get health care. The Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 \nmakes living the American dream a reality for millions of individuals \nwith disabilities, who will no longer be forced to choose between the \nhealth care coverage they so strongly need and the economic \nindependence they so dearly desire.\n  In closing, I would like to thank the many people who contributed to \nreaching this day. I especially thank the conferees, Majority Leader \nLott, Senators Roth and Moynihan, and in the House, Majority Leader \nArmey, and Congressmen Archer, Bliley, Rangel, and Dingell. I also \nthank their staff who worked so closely in effort to reach this day. \nFrom my staff, I thank Pat Morrissey, Lu Zeph, Leah Menzies, Chris \nCrowley, and Kim Monk. I want to recognize and extend my appreciation \nto the staff members of my three fellow sponsors of this bill; Connie \nGarner in Senator Kennedy's office, Jennifer Baxendell and Alexander \nVachon with Senator Roth, and Kristen Testa, John Resnick, and Edwin \nPark from Senator Moynihan's staff. Finally, I wish to thank Ruth Ernst \nwith the Senate Legislative Counsel for her drafting skill and \nsubstantive expertise, her willingness to meet time tables, and most of \nall, her patience. In addition to staff, we received countless hours of \nassistance and advice from the Work Incentives Task Force of the \nConsortium for Citizens with Disabilities. These individuals worked \ntirelessly to educate Members of Congress about the need for and the \neffects of this legislation.\n  Finally, I would like to urge my colleagues in both chambers to set \naside any concerns about peripheral matters and to focus on the central \nprovisions of this legislation. Let's focus on what today's vote will \nmean to the 9.5 million individuals with disabilities across the \nnation. At last, these individuals will be able to work, to preserve \ntheir health, to support their families, to become independent, and \nmost importantly, to contribute to their communities, the economy, and \nthe nation.\n\n[[Page S14982]]\n\nWe are making a statement, a noble statement and we must do the right \nthing. Let's send this bill to the President.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Ticket \nto Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act.\n  I want to pay tribute to my colleagues, Senators Kennedy and \nJeffords, who began working on this legislation in the last Congress--\neffectively building support for this bill from a handful of senators \nto 79 cosponsors.\n  I also want to commend Senators Moynihan and Roth, who have dedicated \ntheir time and effort to this important cause. They have kept the \ndebate on this bill focused on the substance, and have prevented it \nfrom degenerating into grandstanding or partisan bickering.\n  But the lion's share of credit should go to the members of the \ndisability community, who have been tireless advocates for work \nincentives legislation. Without their hard work, we would not be here \ntoday. This bill is the product of their grassroots activism--making a \ncommon sense idea into a national policy.\n  As my colleagues know, the major provisions of the Ticket to Work and \nWork Incentives Improvement Act are infinitely sensible. They would \nremove the most significant barrier that individuals with disabilities \nface when they try to return to work--continued access to adequate \nhealth care.\n  Currently, individuals with disabilities face the dilemma of choosing \nbetween the Medicare and Medicaid health benefits they need and the job \nthey desire. Mr. President, this is not a choice at all, and it is \nregrettable.\n  According to surveys, about three quarters of individuals with \ndisabilities who are receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and \nSocial Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits want to work. \nSadly, less than one percent are actually able to make a successful \ntransition into the workforce. A major barrier seems to be the lack of \nsufficient health care coverage.\n  By passing this legislation, we will extend eligibility for Medicare \nand Medicaid and provide a helping hand to individuals with \ndisabilities who aspire to work.\n  Mr. President, this legislation also takes a step to help workers who \nare stricken with progressive, degenerative diseases, such as Multiple \nSclerosis, HIV/AIDS, and Parkinson's Disease, which can be slowed with \nproper treatment. With the health coverage buy-in offered under this \nbill, these workers can continue to hold a job instead of leaving the \nworkforce in hopes of meeting the need requirements for Medicaid \ncoverage.\n  These citizens can continue to make substantial contributions to the \nworkplace and to society while benefitting intellectually and \nemotionally.\n  With the Americans with Disabilities Act, Congress adopted \nlegislation to combat discrimination and remove physical barriers from \nthe workplace. Now, we have the chance to lift yet another barrier to \nwork, the loss of health care coverage.\n  In my home state of Rhode Island, more than 40,000 individuals with \ndisabilities could benefit from the work incentives bill. Across the \ncountry, more than 9.5 million people could be positively affected by \nthis legislation.\n  Our booming economy has created millions of new jobs, and has brought \nthousands of Americans into the workforce for the first time. By \npassing this legislation, we can take another step to help a \nsignificant group of Americans participate in our national economic \nprosperity.\n  Mr. President, before I yield, I would like to briefly mention my \nconcern about some offsets attached to this measure. As colleagues who \nhave followed this bill know, it seemed as if there was a revolving \ndoor when it came to the consideration of offsets during the \nConference. Provisions came and went and returned again.\n  I was pleased that a controversial offset regarding the refund of FHA \nupfront mortgage insurance premiums was withdrawn. This offset was \nessentially a $1,200 tax on approximately 900,000 low- and middle-\nincome families and first-time home-buyers, and the conferees were \nright to omit it from this bill.\n  Regrettably, the bill retains two other controversial offsets, which \nI oppose. The first is an assessment on attorneys representing clients \nwith Social Security disability benefits claims. Although the \nAdministration supports this offset, I believe that it will discourage \nqualified attorneys from taking on these complicated, labor-intensive \nclaims cases--which already offer little remuneration to attorneys. \nUltimately, this assessment will hurt those individuals trying to \nsecure their rightful benefits, not the attorneys. I commend the \nconferees for taking steps to blunt the impact of this provision by \ncapping the fee at 6.3% and requiring GAO to study the cost and \nefficiency of this and alternative assessment structures. Nonetheless, \nI still believe that this is an inappropriate offset.\n  The other offset changes the index for student loan interest rates \nfrom the 91-day Treasury bill to the three-month rate for commercial \npaper. This provision saves a modest amount of money in the short-term. \nUnfortunately, those savings will not be transferred to students, and \nthe offset will actually put taxpayers on the hook if the markets turn \nsour. Let me add that this provision flies in the face of an agreement \nreached in last year's Higher Education Act Amendments. Under that \nlegislation, we were to study the impact of this type of conversion. We \nare still awaiting the findings of that study, and in the absence of an \nauthoritative conclusion, I believe it is premature to entertain this \nchange in policy. Mr. President, setting these important concerns \naside, I believe that the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives \nImprovement Act is a major victory for all Americans, and we should all \nsupport it. I want to again commend the leading Senate sponsors, \nSenators Kennedy, Jeffords, Moynihan, and Roth for their tremendous \nwork in bringing this legislation to this point, and I urge all of my \ncolleagues to vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 8 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to pick up where the Senator from \nIllinois left off. I think he hit the nail on the head with respect to \nour concern with a provision in this bill which will create an \nadditional moratorium for the organ allocation regulations to go into \neffect.\n  There will be a 90-day moratorium. Senator Durbin, Senator Schumer, \nSenator Moynihan, Senator Specter, and I, and many others have some \ngrave concerns about its impact on thousands of people who are on \ntransplant lists across this country and their ability to get organs in \nwhat may be the last few days of their lives. That is, unfortunately, \nwhat is going to occur. We are going to delay a system being put into \nplace which would put a priority on the health status of the person on \nthe transplant list as opposed to the residency status of where that \nperson happens to be in the hospital.\n  It is a battle. It is an economic battle in many respects. And \ncertainly, from some perspectives, I have transplant centers in my \nState that support these regulations; I have transplant centers in my \nState that oppose them. I look at it from the unbiased position of, \nwhat is in the best interest of the patient? For me, as Senator Durbin \njust said, when 3 of the 11 people who will die today because organs \nare not available, when 3 of them needlessly die because we are \ntransplanting organs that would otherwise go to them into people who \nare healthier and would not die but for the transplant, then we have \nsomething seriously wrong in this country. We have something seriously \nwrong when geography trumps patient need. That is what the current \norgan allocation system has.\n  Why has that occurred? This was a system that was put in place well \nover 10 years ago, when there were fewer transplant centers and when \norgans could not survive as long after being harvested. So geography \ndid play an important role because the organ that was harvested had to \nbe quickly transported to a hospital and implanted into the donee. That \nhas changed. Now organs survive for around 4 hours, according to our \ntransplant surgeon, Dr. Frist, who lectured us on this a little\n\n[[Page S14983]]\n\nwhile ago. Now we have the ability to more broadly spread these organs \nout so we can reach sicker people. Yet the organ allocation system \ndeveloped well over 10 years ago still focuses on geography. It may \nhave been applicable at one time. It doesn't work anymore. People are \ndying as a result of it.\n  We have 4,000 people on transplant lists; 1,000 will die. And it is \nincredible to me that those will die unnecessarily--4,000 will die and \n1,000 will die unnecessarily--because of our regulations.\n\n  We have gone through a moratorium on these regs. I know this is a \nvery controversial issue. It is a controversial issue because of \neconomics. There is no controversy anymore as to what is in the best \ninterest of patients. Last year, when Bob Livingston was able to get a \nyear delay as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, we said, well, \nthe medical evidence will sustain their position that geography is the \nbest way to do this. So we asked for a study--the study of the \nInstitute of Medicine--to determine the findings of a nonpartisan, \nnonbiased organization. Let me tell you what they came back with:\n\n       On the basis of the analysis of this report, it seems \n     apparent that patients on liver transplant----\n\n  That is what they specifically looked at----\n\n     waiting lists will be better served by an allocation system \n     that facilitates broader sharing within broader populations.\n\n  The Institute of Medicine says ``broader sharing,'' with geography \nbeing a lower priority factor in the decision.\n  This question was also put forward: Will more people die if we \ncontinue this system?\n  Again, the Institute of Medicine was very clear:\n\n       Increased sharing of organs would result in increasing \n     transplantation rates for status 1 patients, the sickest \n     patients, decreasing pre-transplantation mortality for sicker \n     patients, which is status 2(b), and decreasing \n     transplantation rates for status 3 patients, without \n     increasing mortality.\n\n  That is the key. Yes, status 3, the healthier patients, will get \nfewer organs, but they won't die as a result of that. Yes, status 1 and \n2(b) patients will get more transplantations and will live as a result \nof that, where they otherwise would die.\n  So it is clear, again, from the medical evidence the Institute of \nMedicine has put forward that a broader geographic sharing is the way \nto go. That is what these regulations dictate--that the sicker patients \nshould get these before they die, not healthy patients who would \notherwise live or would live for a long period of time without \ntransplants.\n  The other issue you will hear brought up is that we need geography to \nbe a big factor because it increases the availability of organs, that \npeople want to donate organs in their community. The Institute of \nMedicine looked at this and found no convincing evidence to support the \nclaim that broader sharing would adversely affect donation rates, or \npotential donors would decline to donate because an organ might be used \noutside the immediate geographic area.\n  I have an organ donor card. I am someone who, upon my demise, wants \nto be able to give organs to someone else so they might live. I don't \ncare whether it goes to somebody in Pittsburgh, or in Chicago, or in \nAlabama, as long as it goes to the person who needs it the most.\n  That brings me to my final point, on which I think we can all agree. \nThis debate is contentious, and the reason for that is, we don't have \nenough organs. So I just say that we can all agree that we need to do \nmore to encourage organ donation. People are needlessly dying because \npeople and families have trouble at that moment of death--I know how \ndifficult that can be--making the decision to donate the organs of \nsomebody who is brain dead to someone else who can live as a result of \nthat donation. Hopefully, through this discussion, we can also work on \nhow we can broaden the availability of organs so this contentious issue \nof regional transplant centers will be minimized in the future.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have the great honor and pleasure to \nyield 5 minutes to the Senator from Iowa, who is so active in the \nTicket to Work legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member on the \ncommittee. I rise in strong support of the Work Incentives Improvement \nAct. I really want to commend my two colleagues, Senator Jeffords of \nVermont and Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts, for their excellent \nwork in getting this very important piece of legislation through. I \nwant to also thank the members of the Finance Committee--in particular, \nSenator Roth and Senator Moynihan--for their hard work on this \nlegislation.\n  For people with disabilities all over this country, this is truly an \nincredible day. Congress is continuing to fulfill the promise we made \nto people with disabilities 9 years ago when we passed the Americans \nWith Disabilities Act in 1990. When we passed the ADA, they told \nAmericans with disabilities that the door to equal opportunity was \nfinally open. And the ADA has opened doors of opportunity--plenty of \nthem. Americans with disabilities now expect to be treated as full \ncitizens, with all the rights and responsibilities that entails.\n  But our work is not finished. Far too many people with disabilities \nwho want to work are unemployed. One of the main reasons they are \nunemployed is, under the current system, people have to choose between \na job and health care. I could not put it any better than a constituent \nof mine, a young woman by the name of Phoebe Ball. Phoebe just \ngraduated from the University of Iowa. She was shocked when they found \nthat if she took an entry-level job paying $18,000 a year, she would \nsuffer a huge loss--her health insurance.\n  So Phoebe wrote an article for the newspaper. I will read part of it:\n\n       I want off SSI desperately . . . I want to work. I want to \n     know that I have earned the money I have . . .\n       My parents and my society made a promise to me. They \n     promised me that I can live with this disability, and I can . \n     . . What is limiting me right now is not this wheelchair, and \n     it's not this limb that's missing. It's a system that says if \n     I can work at all, then I'm undeserving of any assistance, \n     I'm undeserving of the basic medical care that I need to stay \n     alive.\n       . . . What is needed is a government that understands its \n     responsibility to its citizens . . . then we'll see what we \n     are capable of, then we'll be working and proving the worth \n     of the Americans With Disabilities Act.\n\n  I could not say it any better than Phoebe just did. The Work \nIncentives Improvement Act is a comprehensive bill that will be the \nanswer to Phoebe Ball's dilemma. If only 1 percent--or 75,000--of the \n7.5 million people with disabilities, such as Phoebe, who are now on \nbenefits were to become employed, Federal savings would total $3.5 \nbillion over the work life of these beneficiaries. That not only makes \neconomic sense, it contributes to preserving the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  The disability community across this country and Members from both \nsides of the aisle have wholeheartedly endorsed this bill. Rarely do we \nsee such broad bipartisan support. But that is because on this \nparticular issue it is easy to agree--people with disabilities should \ncontinue to move toward greater and greater independence.\n\n  In that spirit, Senator Specter and I introduced the Medicaid \nCommunity Attendant Services and Supports Act earlier this week. Its \nshorthand name is MCASSA. This bill will build on what we are doing \ntoday with the Work Incentives Improvement Act. Ten years after the \npassage of the Americans With Disabilities Act, next year, we are still \nfacing the situation where our current long-term care program favors \nputting people into institutions.\n  A person has a right to the most expensive form of care--a nursing \nhome bed--because nursing home care is an entitlement. But if that same \nperson with a disability wants to live in the community, he or she is \ngoing to have to face a lack of available services because community \nservices are optional under Medicaid. Nursing home is a mandatory \nentitlement, but if you want to live in the community, that is \noptional. Well, the purpose of our bill is to level the playing field \nand give people with disabilities a real choice.\n  Our bill would allow any person entitled to medical assistance who \nwould\n\n[[Page S14984]]\n\ngo to a nursing facility to use the money for community attendant \nservices and support. In shorthand, what our bill says is: Let the \nFederal money follow the person and not the program. If that person \nwants to use that money for community-based services and attendant \nservices, that person with a disability ought to be able to use the \nmoney that way. If they want to use the money for a nursing home, leave \nit up to the individual; we should not be dictating where they ought to \nlive and how they ought to live. As is the work incentives bill, MCASSA \nis rooted in the promise of ADA--equality of opportunity, full \nparticipation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for \nall.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware, and I \nthank him particularly for his interest on this issue and so many other \nissues that have been before this Senate, including all of the major \ntax cuts in our country in the last number of years. He has been a key \nplayer in that.\n  The issue before us today involves many different aspects. I believe \nvery strongly that the organ transplant issue is critical for our \nNation. We have made such magnificent progress in enhancing the \navailability of organs, helping people who receive those organs, and \nincreasing the success rate of organ transplants. It has been a \ncontinual series of advancements--whether it is medication to avoid \nrejection, or the skill of a surgeon, and so forth. The key to that has \nbeen the magnificent services rendered by organ transplant centers all \nover the country.\n  The plan that has been directed and proposed by Secretary Shalala of \nHHS, which gives her, in fact, the total ability to void and dictate \nthe regulations, that plan has been opposed and is not supported by the \noverwhelming number of organ transplant centers in this country. They \ndo not believe it will save lives. They do not believe it will help the \nsystem to have Washington decide who gets organ transplants.\n  We have a system that is working and getting better on a daily basis, \nwhich is something of which we can be extraordinarily proud.\n  In Alabama, the University of Alabama at Birmingham is No. 1 in the \nworld in kidney transplants. They are exceptionally skilled at that \nprocedure, and is one of the great organ transplant centers in the \nworld. Others are similar around the country. They are very uneasy \nabout and object to this consolidation of power in the Secretary's \noffice--a person who is not elected by the people, and yet is about to \nimpose regulations on the dispersement of organs in America.\n\n  This is a matter that ought to be and by law and right should be done \nin the U.S. Congress. The House passed a bill quite different from the \nSecretary's proposal. The committee met in the appropriations, and \nseveral Senators who had a view on this came up with a bill giving a \n42-day window to change any rule she might pass. We will hardly be in \nsession. We will not be in session in 42 days. Ninety days is the \nminimum time we can have so that this Congress can fulfill its \nresponsibility to the health and safety of this country by having \nhearings and passing legitimate legislation on organ transplantation.\n  I would point out that the chairman of that subcommittee of the \ncommittee of which I am a member, Senator Frist, Dr. Frist, is one of \nthe great organ transplant surgeons in America. He did the first organ-\nlung transplant in the history of the State of Tennessee. He will chair \nthat committee. He is going to be fair on this issue.\n  But there is a congressional responsibility, and the minimum time we \ncan accept is the 90 days that has been proposed.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I hope and I am confident that will be part of this legislation.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 3 minutes to my \ncolleague and friend from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding time.\n  I rise, along with my colleagues from Pennsylvania and Illinois, very \nmuch against my colleague from Alabama on this important issue.\n  When somebody donates a liver or lungs or a kidney or a heart, they \ndo not donate it in a particular area. They don't donate it and say: I \nwant the person who lives in the State of Alabama or the State of New \nJersey to have it. They donate it to do the most good.\n  Finally, we have come up with a solution with provisions that are \nfair--that say it doesn't matter where you live but rather what your \nneed is in terms of getting an organ.\n  All of a sudden, to my disappointment, in the dark of night a ruling \nof that position was put into the legislation.\n  I think this is wrong. When somebody needs a liver in New York, and \nthey need it, and their life depends on the liver, that liver should \nnot go to someone in another State who has at least 3 years to live on \ntheir existing organs.\n  It is so wrong to create geographic divisions. We have learned that. \nThe Secretary of HHS has promulgated regulations which, if I had my \nway, would be promulgated immediately.\n  My friend and colleague, who I know is very sincere in this, the \nSenator from Alabama, and others, put in a provision to delay this for \n90 days.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Lott, and the \nSecretary of HHS for trying to compromise this issue so it can be fair \nto all.\n  We must and we will continue to fight, those of us who believe that \norgan donations should go to those who need it the most, and not those \nwho live in a certain geographical area be given those organs.\n  The system has been supported by the National Academy of Sciences \nInstitute of Medicine. It was developed by medical people and \nscientists. That is the way it ought to be.\n  We ought not hold organs hostage to political, geographic, and other \ndivisive considerations.\n  Again, when somebody donates an organ, a beautiful and selfless act, \nit ought not be marred by politics. It ought to go to the person of \ngreatest need, no matter where that person lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 3 minutes to my \nfriend, Senator Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to actually start out on a \npositive note by raising one question.\n  This Work Incentives Improvement Act is a very important piece of \nlegislation for all the reasons my colleagues have explained. I will go \nthrough that in a moment.\n  I don't understand why there is in this piece of legislation a $1.7 \nbillion subsidy for higher education lenders. I don't understand what \nthat is doing in this piece of legislation. We are talking about \nwhether or not people with disabilities are going to be able to work \nand maintain their health care coverage. That is what is so important \nabout this legislation. It is incredibly important to the disabilities \ncommunity in my State and across the country.\n  I thank Senators Kennedy, Jeffords, Roth, and Moynihan. But I have to \nraise this question just for the Record.\n  What are we doing putting a $1.7 billion subsidy in here for higher \neducation lenders? Students could use this money by way of expanding \nthe Pell grant. Students could use the money by way of low interest \nloans. Students could use the money to make higher education more \naffordable. But why is this provision being linked to another piece of \nlegislation?\n  I must say again that when we get back to how we conduct our \nbusiness, I hope next time we will not put these kinds of provisions \ntogether. This is not the way to legislate.\n  I think it is a great piece of legislation. I am going to support it. \nBut I certainly don't think we should have this $1.7 billion subsidy \nfor the lenders as a part of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S14985]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the voting \nschedule occur no later than 5 p.m. this evening, and that it be \nreversed so that the first vote will now occur on the adoption of the \nWork Incentives conference report, to be followed by the cloture vote, \nand finally adoption of the appropriations conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in the spirit of the hour, the \nDemocratic side yields the remainder of its time to the distinguished \nand ebulliently happy majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. President. It is always a great pleasure to \nwork with the Senator from New York. It is even more fun to hear him \nspeak. I am not sure what he said, but it sounded beautiful. I take it \nas a high compliment as I always do.\n  For the sake of a colloquy to clarify a section in the work \nincentives bill, I yield to Senator Santorum. We will have a colloquy \nwith Senator Santorum, Senator Schumer, and myself.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, there is an issue over the language \ncontained in section 413 of H.R. 1180 and the intent thereof that I ask \nthe majority leader to clarify.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, and \nthe Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, for working with me on this and \nfor their devotion to this important public health issue.\n  It is one which is important to our country and to the people that \nneed the organ transplants. We have to try to find the best and the \nfairest way to deal with this issue. I am happy to clarify this issue \ncontained in the legislative measure.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I wish to clarify the language in section 413 of H.R. \n1180 pertaining to the implementation of the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Service's final rule on organ procurement and the transplantation \nprinted in the Federal Register on October 20, 1999, specifically to \nensure that this language allows, but does not require, the Secretary \nof HHS to revise this rule after the 90-day period beginning on the \ndate of enactment of this act.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the language will delay the rule for 90 \ndays. That is what is required and that was my intent, from the date of \nenactment of H.R. 1180, in order to facilitate additional public \nreview. It is not the intent of the legislation to cause any \nunreasonable delay in the formulation of necessary improvements in \nnational organ transplant policies, but rather to permit constructive \nreview of the information that  will be available and for the Congress \nto review it.\n\n  Furthermore, I make clear section 413 provides that the rule is not \neffective until the expiration of the 90-day rule beginning on the date \nof enactment of this act. During that 90-day period, the Secretary \nshall publish a notice eliciting public comments on the rule and shall \nconduct a full review of the comments. At the end of the period, \nsection 413 allows, but does not require, the Secretary to make any \nrevisions in the rule that she deems appropriate.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the majority leader for the clarification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield \nfor a brief statement?\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe I have the time and I will yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Leader and Senator Santorum, I have spoken with the \nSecretary of HHS and she has assured me this clarification has the \nsupport of the administration and it is something she, and it, intend \nto stand by.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator.\n  Does the Senator from Alabama wish to speak?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, is it your expectation following the 90-\nday period during which the Secretary reviews the public comments that \nas of today we have not had a formal comment period, as I understand \nit; that the Secretary should inform the Congress of her reasons behind \nany final decision she would make?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, absolutely. I expect that and I believe she will do \nthat.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I wish to say that I know a lot of hard work has gone \ninto this very contentious issue. Some said this had happened in the \ndead of night. What happened in the dead of night--I serve on the \nhealth committee that should be dealing with this--this 42-day rule \nwent in. Our committee never voted on that or had hearings on it.\n  This at least gives our committee a narrow window of opportunity to \ntry to deal with it. It won't be a full 90 days because we will be out \nhalf of that. It will be a narrow opportunity with Senator Bill Frist \nchairing it and maybe we can work out some things that make sense. \nRight now I am very troubled. The overwhelming majority of the \ntransplant centers are not happy with these rules as they are being \ndeveloped. I think the Congress must speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I have time remaining, I yield the floor. \nI believe we are prepared to begin our series of votes, unless the \nchairman or ranking member would desire to wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would also like to quickly thank several \nstaff members who have been working long and hard to make this bill \npossible.\n  Let me thank several members of Senator Moynihan's staff--as always, \nthey are skilled professionals who have been our partners working on \nthis bill every step of the way.\n  In particular, let me thank Jon Resnick, Edwin Park, and David \nPodoff. And I would like to thank a former member of the Moynihan \nstaff, Kristen Testa, who was there at the very beginning of this \nbill's legislative life and without whom there would not have been a \nWork Incentives Improvement Act.\n  I would also like to thank Pat Morrissey, Leah Menzies, and Lu Zeph \nof Senator Jeffords' office, and Connie Garner on Senator Kennedy's \nstaff. They have been tireless in their efforts on behalf of this \nlegislation. Jennifer Baxendell and Alec Vachon from my staff worked \ntirelessly on this legislation and deserve special commendation.\n  Since this bill's inception, our staffs have worked together closely \nand well. I would like to thank you all for your dedication and hard \nwork throughout all the many ups and downs this bill has faced.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to thank the dedicated professionals \nwho worked so diligently to complete this year's tax legislation. First \nof all, I would like to thank my Finance team--Frank Polk, Joan \nWoodward, Mark Prater, Brig Pari, Tom Roesser, Bill Sweetnam, Jeff \nKupfer, Ed McClellan, Ginny Flynn, Tara Bradshaw, Connie Foster and \nMyrtle Agent. I would also like to thank John Duncan and Bill Nixon \nfrom my personal staff for their commitment to seeing this process \nthrough to its successful completion.\n   I would also like to thank the members of Senator Moynihan's Finance \nstaff who have helped make this a bipartisan effort--David Podoff, Russ \nSullivan, Stan Fendley, Anita Horn, and Mitchell Kent.\n  It is also important to recognize the professionals of the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation. In particular, I would like to thank Lindy \nPaull, Bernie Schmitt, Rick Grafmeyer, Carolyn Smith, Cecily Rock, Mary \nSchmitt, Greg Bailey, Tom Barthold, Ben Hartley, David Hering, Harold \nHirsch, Laurie Matthews, Sam Olchyk, Oren Penn, Todd Simmens, Paul \nSchmidt, Mel Schwarz, and Barry Wold.\n  I would also like to thank Jim Fransen and Mark Mathiesen of the \nSenate's Legislative Counsel office who have the thankless job of \nturning tax policy into statute.\n  Finally, I would like to thank the Treasury's Office of Tax Policy. \nIn particular, Linda Robertson, Jon Talisman and Joe Mikrut deserve \nspecial recognition for their help in this important legislation.\n  On this occasion I would also like to thank the staff who worked so \nhard on the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP reform provisions included in \nthe Omnibus Appropriations Act. They have worked incredibly long hours, \nwith real dedication, to develop the strong, consensus product before \nthe Senate today. In particular, let me thank Kathy Means, Teresa \nHouser, Mike\n\n[[Page S14986]]\n\nO'Grady, Jennifer Baxendell, and Alec Phillips on the Majority staff.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Moynihan's staff for their \ncooperation and input. Let me thank Chuck Konigsberg, Liz Fowler, Edwin \nPark, Jon Resnick, Faye Drummond, Kyle Kinner, Dustin May, Julianne \nFisher, Jewel Harper, and Doug Steiger.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport.

Mr. President, had I been present for the vote on the \nconference report on H.R. 1180, I would have voted ``no.'' I would have \ndone so in spite of my high approval of most of the tax extenders and \nof many of the work initiative provisions. Nevertheless, the bill \nincluded an unwise and ill-considered new tax credit for the use of \nchicken waste for power production. That provision could never have \nsurvived standing alone. It is another unjustified complication in our \ntax code never considered by either House of Congress. It poisons the \nentire bill.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum).

Mr. President, the NOAA budget includes $51.56 million in \nfunds to procure the first of four state-of-the-art fishery research \nvessels to conduct critical research on our Nation's fishery resources. \nThis is an important step in providing for sustainable fisheries for \nour fishermen, U.S. trade, and U.S. consumers. It is my understanding \nthat these ships will be some of the most technically complex research \nvessels in the world. It Is critical that the procurement of thee ships \nreflect this complexity, and that all U.S. shipbuilders with technical \nexpertise in oceanographic research ships will have the opportunity to \noffer their expertise to the Government. Is it the Senator's \nunderstanding that this solicitation will be open to all U.S. \nshipbuilders, without set-asides that limit competition?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Majority Leader is correct. In providing for the \nfirst of these ships to be built, we understood that the public will \nbenefit from free and unrestricted competition on this vessel. The \ndemands placed on our fishery management system dictate that\n\n[[Page S14987]]\n\nwe procure the most technically sophisticated ship possible from our \nU.S. shipbuilding industry. The only way to guarantee this result is to \nconduct a free and open competition among all U.S. shipbuilders and \nmeet with Dr. Baker, the Director of NOAA, who has agreed to homeport \nthis vessel in Kodiak. By locating it mid way between the Gulf of \nAlaska and the Bering Sea, it will have ready access to the Nation's \ntwo largest fisheries.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my friends from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, \nand Nevada, Senator Reid, have worked hard to protect the mining jobs \nin their States and in mine, and I extend my thanks to them for working \nwith me to keep the Department of Interior from mindlessly destroying \njobs and lives by trying to rewrite the Mining Law. We want to make \nsure the intent of the provision on mill sites included in the \nDepartment of Interior portion of the appropriations bill is clear, and \nwould like to ask your clarification on a few points.\n  Mr. REID. I thank my friend from Idaho for his hard work. I want to \nconfirm my understanding of one absolutely critical thing with respect \nto the language in Section 337 protecting plans of operations submitted \nprior to November 7, 1997. It is my understanding that the language \ncovers revisions, modifications, and amendments to such plans that are \nmade before such plans are fully approved by the BLM or Forest Service. \nIf an as yet unapproved plan of operations was submitted prior to \nNovember 7, 1997 and revised earlier this year, for instance, then the \nproposed operation, as revised, would be protected. It is the \noperation, not a specific property position--whether mining claims or \nmill sites--that is protected. This is very important to my State and I \nask the chairman to specifically confirm my understanding.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I can say unequivocally that your understanding is \ncorrect. We all know that plans and operations are often revised by the \napplicant before being finally approved. Indeed, some revisions are \nrequired by the BLM or Forest Service during the plan review process. \nIt is the clear intent of the language to protect revisions made prior \nto the plan's final approval. It is the operation, not a specific \nproperty position (whether mining claims or mill sites), that is \nprotected. Anything less would be grossly inequitable and directly \ncontrary to the clear intent of the conference.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friends from Alaska and Nevada for that \nclarification. It is also my understanding that the provision is \nintended to protect large investments made in mining operations \napproved by the Department of Interior under its old interpretation of \nthe law. Frankly, it would be shameful for us to endorse the actions of \na Federal agency that approves a project, allows the proponent to spend \nmillions of dollars to develop it, and then changes its mind about what \nthe law says and on that basis shuts the operation down. I understand \nthat the provision would protect these enormous investments and the \njobs they create from such arbitrary action by the Department of \nInterior.\n  Mr. STEVENS. My friend is right. In compromising the House and Senate \nversions, our intention was to avoid the retroactive application of the \nSolicitor's opinion of November 7, 1997 and the resulting destruction \nof existing jobs and investments.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the chairman for that clarification. Finally, \nas my friend knows, mining operations are large, complex undertakings, \nand circumstances change all the time, requiring changes in the plan of \noperations. Miners must ask the BLM and Forest Service to approve \namendments to their plans all the time in order to keep operating. In \nfact, the BLM and Forest Service often require these miners to amend \ntheir plans. I'm concerned that unless these types of amendments to \nexisting plans are protected, the provision we are adopting would be of \nvery little value. The BLM or the Forest Service could simply require \nan operator of a large existing mine to amend its plan of operations, \nand then deny the plan amendment and shut down the operation on the \nbasis of the Solicitor's opinion. I would like clarification that \namendments to existing plans are protected by the provision.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I assure my colleague that it was never our intent to \nshut down existing operations under any circumstances. Applying the \nopinion to these existing operations through the back door of a plan \namendment would undermine the entire provision and make it meaningless. \nAnybody who knows the mining industry knows that plan amendments are \nroutine. We want operators to be able to amend their plans when \nnecessary to make them better. The provision covers such amendments, \nand protects them from the legal interpretation contained in the \nSolicitor's opinion.\n  Mr. REID. I thank my friends from Alaska, the committee chairmen, for \nthese important clarifications.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for many years I have been working with the \nMinority Leader, Senator Daschle, to develop and enact legislation to \nprovide liability relief for recyclers of scrap metal and other \nmaterial, under the Superfund program. I am pleased that we have been \nable to work together to reach a successful resolution on this issue, \nand that the legislation incorporates the agreement of a broad spectrum \nof parties.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have appreciated the hard work of the Majority Leader \non this issue, and I am pleased that this legislation has been included \nas part of the omnibus appropriations bill. I hope that this provision \nwill serve to achieve our goal of encouraging recycling.\n  It is also my understanding that the language of the bill is not \nintended to exempt from liability parties who had reason to believe \nthat the recyclable material originated from the portion of a DOD, DOE, \nNRC or Agreement State-licensed facility where source, byproduct or \nspecial nuclear material, as defined in the Atomic Energy Act, was \nprocessed, utilized or managed. Is it your understanding that the \nagreement does not cover these materials?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this issue is of great significance to \nmany of my colleagues and to members of the public. In particular, it \nis of great interest to the Senator from Arkansas, and I deeply \nappreciate her leadership on this issue.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, for the last six years I have worked in \nCongress to provide relief from liability to legitimate recyclers. \nCongress never intended to create a disincentive to recycle when it \ncreated the Superfund program, and for that reason, I am delighted that \nthis legislation was included in the omnibus appropriations bill.\n  In addition, I agree with Senator Daschle's clarification of the \nintent of this bill. I am very concerned about the possibility that \nthis legislation could be misinterpreted to relieve from Superfund \nliability persons who release radioactive material to recyclers, such \nas those in the steel industry in my home state of Arkansas, who may be \nunaware of the danger of the products they are receiving, and who could \nin turn pass it on to consumers. I believe it is critical that we \nfurther clarify that this was not intended, and I am hopeful that the \nMajority Leader and the Minority Leader will work with me to do so.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I agree completely with the Senator from Arkansas. Since \nan explicit provision to this effect was inadvertently omitted, would \nthe Majority Leader agree to address this issue through a technical \ncorrection to be enacted at the earliest possible opportunity next \nsession?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes. I would be happy to work with the Minority Leader and \nthe Senator from Arkansas early next year to pass a technical \ncorrection to this legislation to achieve this goal.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on November 1 of this year, the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources reported S. 623, the Dakota \nWater Resources Act of 1999, to the Senate. The legislation amends \nexisting law in an effort to address the water needs of North Dakota. \nThe legislation, as is true of most water related legislation in the \narid West, is not without controversy.\n  Proposals to divert water from the Missouri River to meet \nagricultural, municipal and industrial, and other needs in North Dakota \nhave a long history. The Missouri, like the Colorado and the Columbia, \nserves many States and a multitude of interests, including navigation. \nThe Missouri is also important to the management and operation\n\n[[Page S14988]]\n\nof the Mississippi. Although there are sufficient resources in each of \nthose Basins to meet all the water related needs if the resources were \ndeveloped using on-stream and off-stream storage, that development has \nnot occurred and for various reasons, including what I believe are \nshort sighted concerns by national organizations, are not likely to \noccur in the near term. That being the case, it is not surprising that \nwhenever any Basin State manages to corral all the competing interests \nin its State and even obtains support from the Administration that \nother States that could be potentially affected want to examine the \nagreement and reassure themselves that this particular solution does \nnot come at their expense.\n  The best way to accomplish that is to bring all the parties together \nto allow them to review their concerns and work out whatever \narrangement will best address their needs. Our Committee did just that \nseveral years ago as part of the legislation to settle the water claims \nof the Colorado Ute Tribes. Once we had revised the agreement in a \nfashion that was acceptable to the Tribes, the State of Colorado, and \nthe other affected water users, we then had several weeks in intense \ndiscussions with the other Colorado River Basin States. I want to point \nto that process, because it did result in the passage of legislation \nthat was supported by all the parties and provided for the completion \nof the Dolores and Animas projects.\n  I rise today to speak and offer reassurance to the North Dakota \ndelegation and the Missouri delegation that the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee is committed to assisting these two delegations in \nworking out their difficulties regarding S. 623, the Dakota Water \nResources Act of 1999.\n  I appreciate the hard work and good will expressed by both \ndelegations over the past several weeks, but we have just run out of \ntime in this session of Congress to address the concerns of all \naffected states. To continue these discussions, I have proposed to my \ncolleagues that when Congress returns next year, the Energy Committee \nwill hold a workshop or other forum so that the Senate can fully \nidentify, discuss, and attempt to resolve the issues that have \nprevented this legislation from moving this year.\n  With the assistance of my colleagues, I propose that the Energy \nCommittee staff work with their staffs during the recess and that we \nconvene a meeting during the first week in February to bring all the \nparties together. Hopefully, if we use the time well during the recess, \nwe can identify who the technical people are who need to be involved so \nthat the delegations will be able to have a constructive meeting. I \nwant to note that Senator Smith, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nWater and Power, who held the hearings earlier this year on the \nlegislation has indicated that he is also willing to assist in this \nprocess.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Chairman's cooperation and assistance on \nthis bill and his willingness to work with me in the Energy Committee \nto bring this legislation to the floor. His commitment to convene a \nworkshop to resolve outstanding issues provides the basis for moving \nforward with this legislation, which would meet the outstanding Federal \ncommitment to our state.\n  As the Senator from Alaska knows, North Dakota has significant water \nquality and water quantity needs that must be addressed. In many parts \nof my state, well water in rural communities resembles weak coffee or \nstrong tea; it is unfit for drinking and other domestic uses. Several \nparts of my state, including the Red River Valley, do not have access \nto reliable sources of water. This bill is designed to address those \nneeds and help provide clean, reliable water to families and businesses \nacross North Dakota. When the Senate attempted to consider this \nlegislation in recent days, objections were registered by other \nSenators who had concerns about the bill. In response, Senator Conrad \nand I have worked with those Senators to address their concerns.\n  I am certain that with the Chairman's assistance and that of Senator \nSmith we will be able to resolve these concerns expeditiously.\n  Mr. BOND. I too, extend my thanks to the Chairman of the Energy \nCommittee for his willingness to help us on this very complex and \ndifficult issue. Missouri, and other States in the Missouri River Basin \nare dependent on the flow of the Missouri River. Any legislation that \naffects this flow must be thoroughly vetted by the people in our state \nwho have the knowledge and the expertise. Since this legislation came \nup at the end of the session with no time for debate on the Senate \nfloor, we appreciate the opportunity the Chairman is providing us to \nbring together those people from our States who know this issue well. A \nforum with the free exchange of ideas is an excellent way to air very \nserious concerns as well as explore possible solutions that can make \nthis a win-win situation for everyone. Representatives of the Missouri \nBasin States are currently in deep negotiations to discuss water flow. \nThis forum should be held in the context of those negotiations.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I would like to associate myself with the remarks of my \ncolleague from Missouri. We in Missouri are just as protective of our \nwater as any other State in the Missouri River Basin, or for that \nmatter, the rest of the United States. Before either of us can agree to \nany legislation that has the potential to affect our State, we must \nhave the opportunity for our state experts to go over this legislation \nwith a fine-tooth comb. I welcome the chance that the Senator from \nAlaska has offered and I know our state water experts will be happy to \nparticipate. As I have repeatedly stated, I am willing to work with my \ncolleagues to try to resolve any concerns in a manner that will fully \nprotect the interests of Missouri.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I also appreciate the Senator's continued willingness to \nwork with us. We will continue to work in good faith to develop a bill \nthat can be passed by the Congress.\n  I want to be absolutely clear that it is not our intent or that of \nanyone in North Dakota to harm any of our neighbors. This legislation \nsignificantly reduces the amount of irrigated acreage from that \nauthorized by current law and completely eliminates any irrigated \nacreage from this project in the Hudson River drainage. We have \nsignificantly increased the levels of review by both the State \nDepartment to ensure compliance with the Boundary Water Treaty and by \nEPA to ensure compliance with the Clean Water Act on any trans-basin \ndiversion that might occur. There is no guarantee that such a diversion \nwill actually occur. I also want to make it clear that we are willing \nto discuss the timing, amount, and source of any diversions to ensure \nthat the legitimate needs of our neighboring Basin States are met. The \nChairman's offer is helpful and I hope that with a full and frank \ndiscussion we will be able to fully resolve all concerns.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I agree with this proposal. I want to assure my \ncolleagues that I will work with the Chairman to provide a forum to \nallow the North Dakota and Missouri delegations, along with adjacent \nstates, to resolve their concerns.\n\n\n                            c-band industry\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Senator from \nUtah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in a colloquy.\n  As the Senator knows, the C-Band industry is declining and the \nconferees correctly exempted existing C-Band consumers from numerous \nprovisions in this bill at my request. It is my understanding the \nconferees sought to exempt the C-Band industry from the program \nexclusivity rules that we are applying in the satellite bill. Complying \nwith the program exclusivity rules would be technically and \neconomically unreasonable for the C-Band industry and would only \ndeprive C-Band consumers with some of their favorite programming.\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, the Senator from Alaska is correct; that was the \nintent of the conferees. And, I appreciate the Senators concerns and \npledge to work with him to ensure that when the FCC promulgates these \nrules, the C-Band industry is exempt and C-Band consumers are \nprotected.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to ask the distinguished Chairman of the \nCommittee on Finance a question regarding a tax provision which \nCongress adopted this summer as part of the vetoed Taxpayer Refund and \nRelief Act of 1999.\n\n[[Page S14989]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, section 1005 of that Act would have provided that the \nprinciples of section 482 should be used to determine whether \ntransactions between tax-exempt organizations and related non-exempt \nentities give rise to unrelated business income tax. This provision was \nneeded to insure that legitimate arms length transactions between these \nentities are not penalized.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that this session will end without our \nhaving another opportunity to once again enact this vitally needed \nprotection for the tax exempt community. As a result, I would like to \nask the distinguished Chairman whether he would agree that this \nprovision should be included as a high priority in the first tax \nvehicle that we adopt in the second session.\n  Mr. ROTH. I can assure the distinguished Senator that the enactment \nof this provision, which has already been agreed to by both the House \nand Senate, is a high priority for our next tax bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I want to join my distinguished colleague from Iowa in \nhis remarks, and also thank our distinguished Chairman for his \ncommitment to enact this provision next year. Tax exempt organizations \nprovide critical services to our communities, and this provision will \nmake it far easier for them to continue to perform these important \nfunctions.\n  Mr. ROTH. I look forward to working with both the Senators from Iowa \nand Oklahoma next year to provide the relief that this provision would \ngive to the many fine exempt organizations that are awaiting its \nenactment.\n\n\n                           nurse anesthetists\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. In 1994, the Health Care Financing Administration issued \na draft regulation deferring to State law on the issue of physician \nsupervision of certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNA's). This \naction was followed -in 1997 by a proposed HCFA rule deferring to State \nlaw on this issue. HCFA's rule has been subject to great scrutiny and \nnumerous studies. Nevertheless, HCFA has to date failed to issue its \nfinal rule on the matter, and defer this issue to State law. Would the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, \nand Education Appropriations Subcommittee agree with this assessment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree with my distinguished colleague, the ranking \nsubcommittee member. States should have the authority to regulate \nCRNA's in the same manner as States regulate other health care \nproviders. There is a wealth of information already in existence that \nsupports the view that the issue of supervision should be left to the \nStates, just as HCFA has proposed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Therefore, we agree that HCFA's proposed rule has been \nextensively researched and that HCFA should move forward expeditiously.\n  Mr. GORTON. I join with my distinguished colleagues to agree that \nHCFA should move forward expeditiously to resolve this issue.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Absolutely, HCFA should do what it has initially \nproposed several years ago and defer to State law on this issue.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senators. I look forward to working with them \nboth to resolve this matter.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. As you know, I initially objected to the movement of \nthis legislation because of my concerns about the manner in which it \npreempted state law. As introduced, this bill would have nullified any \nability of state legislatures to adopt the Uniform Electronic \nTransactions Act, (UETA), in a manner that varied from the provisions \nof the bill, or in a manner that reserved the right of states to adopt \nUETA in conformance with their consumer protection laws. When the bill \nwas reported by the Commerce Committee, provisions were included to \nprovide states this flexibility. Since the reporting of the bill, the \npreemption language has been amended to provide that to avoid adherence \nto the federal law, a state must adopt UETA ``in the form, or any \nsubstantially similar variation'' as provided to the states by the \nNational Conference on Uniform State Law.\n  Do you agree that notwithstanding this change, the purpose and intent \nof the preemption provisions, either pursuant to the definitions in the \nbill or otherwise, have not changed? And that the legislation, in its \ncurrent form, is intended to permit states the flexibility of adopting \nand enacting UETA in a manner and form that ensures its conformance \nwith state consumer protection laws?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes, Senator Hollings, that is certainly the intent of \nthe legislation in its current form, but I would note that there must \nbe a modicum of common sense involved in this approach. It is expected \nthat states will pass consumer protection provisions in conjunction \nwith the Electronic Transactions Act. It is important, however, that \nstates not use the heading of ``consumer protection'' to enact changes \nwhich are inconsistent with the spirit of UETA and which threaten to \nundermine the uniformity which UETA is intended to convey. I believe \nthe current language realizes these important goals.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would like to address another change to the bill \nsince its reporting by the Committee. As you know, the legislation has \nbeen amended to incorporate language providing that the bill applies to \nthe business of insurance. This language has the effect of permitting \nthe validation of insurance contracts pursuant to electronic commerce. \nAs you know, state insurance commissioners have expressed reservations \nabout this provision. There is concern that the provision could \npotentially adversely affect the ability of states to maintain their \nfull regulatory authority over these transactions. Do you agree that \ninsurance companies that enter into agreements via electronic commerce \nare still required to meet all other state insurance regulatory \nrequirements?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I agree wholeheartedly. The purpose of this section is \nto permit insurance companies to use electronic signatures in the same \nmanner and extent as other market participants. Under no circumstances \nis the legislation intended to allow insurance companies to evade state \ninsurance regulations.\n  Mr. BURNS. As the sponsor of the low power television provisions \ncontained in the Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus \nReform Act of 1999, I would like to take this opportunity to clarify \none of the provisions. Specifically, I want to ensure that a qualified \nlow power television (LPTV) station in New York City serving the \nKorean-American community on Channel 17 (WEBR(LP), formerly W17BM) is \nnot prohibited from obtaining Class A licensing as a result of Sec. \n5008(f)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act.\n  As drafted, Section 5008(7)(C)(ii) requires a qualified LPTV station \nto demonstrate the it will not interfere with land mobile radio \nservices operating on Channel 16 in New York City in order to obtain \nthe Class A license. However, in 1995, the Commission authorized public \nsafety agencies to use Channel 16 in New York City on a conditional \nbasis pursuant to a waiver of the Commission's rules. The Order \ngranting that waiver specifically stated that the low power television \nstation on Channel 17 would not have any responsibility to protect land \nmobile televisions on adjacent Channel 16. Do you agree with my \nunderstanding of Section 5008(f)(C)(ii), namely that this section is \nnot intended to prevent that low power station's qualification for the \nClass A license?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, it is also my understanding that the low power \nstation on Channel 17 in New York City should not be precluded from the \nClass A license due to Section 5008(f)(7)(ii). The interference that is \ncurrently permitted by the Commission is intended to continue. Is this \nalso your understanding Senator Moynihan?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes, it is. Otherwise, the Channel 17 LPTV station in \nNew York City will be permanently deprived of a Class A license, \nnotwithstanding the fact that it exemplifies exactly the type of low \npower station that should have the opportunity to achieve Class A \nstatus. WEBR(LP) has a demonstrated strong commitment to the local \nKorean community in New York, providing locally originated programming \n24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This station's worthwhile service to the \ncommunity has been a benefit to the public good, and this legislation \nshould not thwart such service from continuing.\n\n\n   the scope of compulsory licenses for television broadcast signals\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the measure before us contains some \ntechnical amendments to various provisions of the Copyright Act, \nincluding sections\n\n[[Page S14990]]\n\n111 and 119, which deal with the cable and satellite compulsory \nlicenses, respectively. It is important to emphasize that these \ntechnical amendments make no change whatsoever in the key definitional \nprovisions of these two compulsory licenses. Section 111(f) defines \n``cable systems,'' and section 119(d)(6) defines ``satellite carrier.'' \nNeither of these definitions is changed by the measure before us.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator from Utah yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am glad to yield to my friend from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator with whom I worked on this important \nlegislation. Does he agree that these definitions should be interpreted \nin exactly the same way after enactment of this legislation as they \nwere interpreted before its enactment?\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator is correct. In other words, if a facility \nqualified as a ``cable system'' under section 111(f) prior the \nenactment of this measure, it should also qualify after enactment. \nConversely, if a facility did not meet the definition of ``cable \nsystem'' before this measure was enacted, it still would not meet that \ndefinition after enactment, and therefore the operations of that \nfacility could not rely upon the cable compulsory license established \nby section 111. And an entity which was not entitled to claim the \nsection 119 compulsory license because it did not meet the definition \nof a ``satellite carrier'' prior to enactment of the measure before us \nwould be in exactly the same position after enactment, that is, it \ncould not claim the satellite compulsory license under section 119.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I appreciate that response.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would point out that none of this is affected by the \nfact that in any earlier version of this legislation, there were \ntechnical amendments that would have affected these definitions. Those \nparticular amendments do not appear in this legislation, and neither \ntheir inclusion in the earlier version nor their omission here has any \nlegal significance. Would the Senate from Vermont agree with that \nstatement?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would, and I would hope that both the Copyright Office \nand the courts would take the same approach. In that regard, I would \nask my friend from Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for \nhis understanding of the current state of the law concerning the \navailability of these compulsory licenses to digital online \ncommunications services?\n  Mr. HATCH. In reply to that question, I would say that certainly \nunder current law, Internet and similar digital online communications \nservices are not, and have never been, eligible to claim the cable or \nsatellite compulsory licenses created by sections 111 or 119 of the \nCopyright Act. To my knowledge, no court, administrative agency, or \nauthoritative commentator has ever held or even intimated to the \ncontrary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is the distinguished chairman aware of the views of the \nCopyright Office on this question? After all, since the Copyright \nOffice administers these compulsory licenses, their views are of \nparticular importance.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Copyright Office studied this issue exhaustively in \n1997 and came to the same conclusion which I have just stated. In fact, \nin undertaking the study, the Copyright Office asked the fundamental \nquestion whether a statutory license should be created for the \nInternet. The underlying assumption of the question was that there was \nnot, and never was, a statutory license applicable to the Internet. In \nresponse, there was little or no comment challenging that assumption. \nAnd I would point out that valid exercises of the Office's statutory \nauthority to interpret the provisions of these compulsory licensing \nschemes are binding on the courts.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I recall the Copyright Office's 1997 study, entitled ``A \nReview of the Copyright Licensing Regimes Covering Retransmission of \nBroadcast Signals,'' which concluded that no existing statutory license \nauthorizes retransmission of television broadcast signals via the \nInternet or any online service. We held a hearing on that report. I \nrecently received a letter from the Register of Copyrights reaffirming \nthis interpretation. Indeed, in that letter, dated November 10, 1999, \nthe Register stated that ``the compulsory license for secondary \ntransmissions of television broadcast signals by cable systems does not \napply to digital online communication services,'' and specifically that \n``the section 111 license does not and should not apply to Internet \ntransmissions.''\n  Mr. HATCH. I also received such a letter from the Register. And along \nthe same lines, I have received a letter on this issue from one of \nAmerica's most distinguished copyright scholars, Professor Arthur \nMiller of Harvard Law School. Professor Miller's interpretation of the \nscope of eligibility for these compulsory licenses under current law \nappears to be very similar to the Register's, and his letter also \nunderscores the point I was making earlier, that there is no legal \nsignificance to the fact that this legislation omits certain technical \namendments to the definition of ``cable system'' and ``satellite \ncarrier'' that appeared in earlier versions of this legislation. I ask \nunanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                        The Register of Copyrights\n\n\n                              of the United States of America,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 10, 1999.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am writing to you today concerning \n     pending proposals regarding the Satellite Home Viewer Act, \n     and particularly the compulsory copyright licenses addressed \n     by that Act. As the director of the Copyright Office, the \n     agency responsible for implementing the compulsory licenses, \n     I have followed the actions of the Congress with great \n     interest.\n       Let me begin by thanking you for all your hard work and \n     dedication on these issues, and by congratulating you on your \n     success in achieving a balanced compromise. Taken as a whole, \n     the Conference Report on H.R. 1554, the Intellectual Property \n     and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999, represents a \n     clear step forward for the protection of intellectual \n     property. I particularly appreciate your support for \n     provisions that improve the ability of the Copyright Office \n     to administer its duties and protect copyrights and related \n     rights.\n       I was greatly concerned when I heard the statements of \n     Members on the floor of the House suggesting that in the \n     final few legislative days of this session, subsection \n     1011(c) of the Conference Report should be amended or \n     removed. Section 1011(c) makes unmistakable what is already \n     true, that the compulsory license for secondary transmissions \n     of television broadcast signals by cable systems does not \n     apply to digital on-line communication services.\n       It is my understanding that some services that wish to \n     retransmit television programming over the Internet have \n     asserted that they are entitled to do so pursuant to the \n     compulsory license of section 111 of Title 17. I find this \n     assertion to be without merit. The section 111 license, \n     created 23 years ago in the Copyright Act of 1976, was \n     tailored to a heavily-regulated industry subject to \n     requirements such as must-carry, programming exclusivity and \n     signal quota rules--issues that have also arisen in the \n     context of the satellite compulsory license. Congress has \n     properly concluded that the Internet should be largely free \n     of regulation, but the lack of such regulation makes the \n     Internet a poor candidate for a compulsory license that \n     depends so heavily on such restrictions. I believe that the \n     section 111 license does not and should not apply to Internet \n     transmissions.\n       I also question the desirability of permitting any existing \n     or future compulsory license for Internet retransmission of \n     primary television broadcast signals. In my comprehensive \n     August 1, 1997 report to Congress, A Review of the Copyright \n     Licensing Regimes Covering Retransmission of broadcast \n     Signals, Internet transmissions were addressed in Chapter \n     VIII, entitled ``Should the Cable Compulsory License Be \n     Extended to the Internet?'' the report concluded that it was \n     inappropriate to ``besto[w] the benefits of compulsory \n     licensing on an industry so vastly different from the other \n     retransmission industries now eligible for compulsory \n     licensing under the Copyright Act.''\n       The report observed that ``Copyright owners, broadcasters, \n     and cable interests alike strongly oppose . . . arguments for \n     the Internet retransmitters' eligibility for any compulsory \n     license. These commenters uniformly decry that the \n     instantaneous worldwide dissemination of broadcast signals \n     via Internet poses major issues regarding the United States \n     and international licensing of the signals, and that it would \n     be premature fur Congress to legislate a copyright compulsory \n     license to benefit Internet retransmitters at this time.'' \n     the Copyright Office believes that there would be serious \n     international implications if the United States were to \n     permit statutory licensing of Internet transmissions of \n     television broadcasts.\n       Therefore I urge that no action be taken to remove or alter \n     section 1011(c) of the Conference Report. At this point, to \n     do so could be construed as a statement that digital on-line \n     communication services are eligible for\n\n[[Page S14991]]\n\n     the section 111 license. Such a conclusion would be \n     reinforced in light of section 1011(a)(1), which replaces the \n     term ``cable system'' in section 111 of Title 17 with the \n     term ``terrestrial system.'' In the absence of section \n     1011(c), section 1011(a)(1) might incorrectly be construed as \n     implying a broadening of the section 111 license to include \n     Internet transmissions.\n       The Internet is unlike any other medium of communication \n     the world has ever known. The application of copyright law to \n     that medium is of utmost importance, and I know that you have \n     personally invested a great deal of time and energy in recent \n     years to assure that a balance of interests is reached. \n     Permitting Internet retransmission of television broadcasts \n     pursuant to the section 111 compulsory license would pose a \n     serious threat to that balance.\n       Please feel free to contact me if I can be of any \n     assistance in this matter. Thank you.\n            Sincerely,\n                                                  Marybeth Peters,\n     Register of Copyrights.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Harvard Law School,\n\n                                 Cambridge, MA, November 15, 1999.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Henry J. Hyde,\n     Chairman, Judiciary Committee,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairmen Hatch and Hyde: I am writing to you to \n     express my views on a proposal to amend the cable and \n     satellite compulsory licenses in Sections 111 and 119 of the \n     Copyright Act. I have taught Copyright Law at Harvard Law \n     School, as well as Michigan and Minnesota, for over thirty-\n     five years and have written extensively and lectured \n     throughout the world on this area of the law. In addition, I \n     was very active in the legislative process that led to the \n     Copyright Act of 1976 and was appointed by President Ford and \n     served as a Commissioner on the Commission for New \n     Technological Uses of Copyright Works (CONTU).\n       The Conference Report on H.R. 1554, the Intellectual \n     Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999, \n     included amendments to Sections 111 and 119 to state \n     explicitly that digital online communication services do not \n     fall within the definitions of ``satellite carrier'' and \n     ``terrestrial system'' (currently ``cable system'') and, \n     therefore, are not eligible for either compulsory license. I \n     understand that Congress is currently considering deleting \n     these amendments or enacting legislation that would not \n     include them. I believe that the amendments were wholly \n     unnecessary and that the deletion or exclusion of them will \n     have no effect on the law, which is absolutely clear: digital \n     online communication services are not entitled to the \n     statutory license under either Section 111 or Section 119 of \n     the Copyright Act.\n       A compulsory license is an extraordinary departure from the \n     basic principles underlying copyright law and a substantial \n     and significant encroachment on a copyright owner's rights. \n     Therefore, any ambiguity in the applicability of a compulsory \n     license should be resolved against those seeking to take \n     advantage of what was intended to be a very narrow exception \n     to the copyright proprietor's exclusive rights. As the \n     Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has noted in a case \n     involving another compulsory license: the compulsory \n     license provision is a limited exception to the copyright \n     holder's exclusive right to decide who shall make use of \n     his (work). As such, it must be construed narrowly, lest \n     the exception destroy, rather than prove, the rule.\n       Fame Publishing Co. v. Alabama Custom Tape, Inc., 507 F.2d \n     667, 670 (5th Cir. 1975).\n       In this situation, however, there is absolutely no \n     ambiguity as to the correct construction of the cable and \n     satellite compulsory licenses. Neither the language of the \n     Copyright Act, nor any statement of Congressional intent at \n     the time of their enactment, nor any judicial interpretation \n     of Section 111 or Section 119 in any way suggests that these \n     compulsory licenses could apply to digital online \n     communication services. And, as far as I know, the \n     representatives of these services have not offered any \n     substantive argument to the contrary--with good reason. No \n     reasonable person--or court--could interpret these statutory \n     licenses to embrace these services.\n       And if there was any doubt left in anyone's mind, the \n     federal agency charged with interpreting and implementing \n     these statutory licenses, the United States Copyright Office, \n     has addressed this issue directly: retransmitting broadcast \n     signals by way of the Internet is clearly outside the scope \n     of the current compulsory licenses. In fact, the Copyright \n     Office recommended in 1997 that Congress not even create a \n     new compulsory license, concluding that it would be \n     ``inappropriate for Congress to grant Internet retransmitters \n     the benefits of compulsory licensing.'' See U.S. Copyright \n     Office, A Review of the Copyright Licensing Regimes Covering \n     Retransmission of Broadcast Signals (August 1, 1997), at 99 \n     and Executive Summary at xiii.\n       My work in the field of copyright over the past decades, \n     especially my extensive activities in connection with the \n     development of the legislation that became the Copyright Act \n     of 1976, leads me to agree with the Office's conclusions that \n     it would be far too premature to extend a compulsory license \n     to the Internet. That conclusion seems sound given the \n     enormous differences between the Internet and the industries \n     embraced by the existing licensing provisions and the need to \n     engage in extensive research and analysis regarding the \n     potentially enormous implications of digital communications. \n     We simply do not know enough to legislate effectively at this \n     point. Doing so at this time--especially without hearing from \n     numerous affected interests--would create a risk of upsetting \n     the delicate balance between the rights of copyright \n     proprietors and the interests of others.\n       Thus, in any judicial action that might materialize by or \n     against the providers of digital online communication \n     services, the court would be bound by the Copyright Office's \n     interpretation of the statutory licenses. See Cablevision \n     Systems Development Co. v. Motion Picture Association of \n     America, Inc., 836 F.2d 599, 609-610 (D.C. Cir. 1988) \n     (deferring to the Copyright Office's interpretation of \n     Section 111, noting Congress' grant of statutory authority to \n     the Copyright Office to interpret the Copyrights Act, and the \n     Supreme Court's indication that it also would defer to the \n     Copyright Office's interpretation of the Copyright Act), \n     Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Assoc v. Oman, 17 \n     F.3d 344, 345 (11th Cir. 1994) (holding that valid exercises \n     of the Copyright Office's statutory authority to interpret \n     the provisions of the compulsory licensing scheme are binding \n     on the court).\n       In summary, based on the unmistakable fact that digital \n     online communication services are ineligible for the cable \n     and satellite compulsory licenses and the identical, \n     unequivocal interpretation by the Copyright Office, \n     amendments to the existing statute reiterating this legal \n     truth are unnecessary. Consequently, the status quo with \n     respect to who is eligible for the statutory licenses will \n     remain undisturbed whether Congress deletes these amendments \n     from the pending legislation or excludes them from subsequent \n     legislation.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                 Arthur R. Miller,\n                                   Bruce Bromley Professor of Law.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my colleague from Utah for his responses. I \nbelieve this colloquy should help to clarify that this legislation \nleaves these crucial definitions unchanged, and also to clarify what is \nthe current state of the law, which this legislation does not disturb.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the Senator from Vermont. And I would clarify one \nother point relating to a minor modification we made to the definition \nof ``unserved household'' in the distant signal satellite statutory \nlicense found in section 119 of Title 17 of the United States Code. The \nconferees decided to add the word ``stationary'' to the phrase \n``conventional outdoor rooftop receiving antenna'' in Section \n119(d)(10) of the Copyright Act. As the Chairman of the Conference \nCommittee and of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction \nover copyright matters, I should make clear that this change should not \nrequire any alteration in the methods used by the courts to enforce the \n``unserved household'' limitation of Section 119. The new language \nstates only that the antenna is to be ``stationary''; it does not state \nthat the antenna is to be misoriented (i.e., pointed away from the \nstation in question). Any interpretation that assumed misorientation \nwould be inconsistent with the basic premise of the definition of \n``unserved household,'' which defines that term in relation to an \nindividual TV station rather than to all network affiliates in a \nmarket--and speaks to whether a household ``cannot'' receive a Grade B \nintensity signal from a particular station. If a household can receive \na signal of Grade B intensity with a properly oriented stationary \nconventional antenna, it is not ``unserved'' within the meaning of \nSection 119. In addition, if station towers are located in different \ndirections, conventional over-the-air antennas can be designed so as to \npoint towards the different towers without requiring the antenna to be \nmoved. And reading the definition of ``unserved household'' to assume \nmisoriented antennas would mean that the ``unserved household'' \nlimitation had no fixed meaning, since there are countless different \nways in which an antenna can be misoriented, but only one way to be \ncorrectly oriented, as the Commission's rules make clear.\n  With that clarification, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       patent reform legislation\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I want to thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member \nfor their tireless efforts on patent reform. I strongly support passage \nof S. 1798, which is included in this omnibus measure, because so many \ncompanies in California and across the nation depend on a strong and \nwell-functioning patent system.\n\n[[Page S14992]]\n\n  While S. 1798 will provide important protection for inventors and \ninnovators and help reduce needless patent litigation, I do have some \nconcerns regarding the compromise reached regarding the reexamination \nprocedure set forth in Title VI. As I understand it, this section will \nreduce the burden of patent cases in our federal courts. However, we \nneed to be sure that the procedure fully and fairly protects the rights \nof all parties, and some concerns about this process have been brought \nto my attention over the last few weeks.\n  Out of deference to the Chairman and the Ranking Member of the \nJudiciary Committee, and being sensitive to the compromise that the \nHouse reached, I did not seek amendments to this title of the bill. \nFurthermore, I feel strongly that the bill should move forward without \nfurther delay, so I support its final passage. This does not mean, \nhowever, that I believe we should cease to be concerned about how the \nnew system will function. Accordingly, I would like to receive \nassurances from Chairman Hatch that we will keep a close eye on how \nwell this new reexamination system works. In particular, I would like \nto request that the Committee obtain an interim report from the Patent \nand Trademark Office under the authority specified in section 606 of S. \n1798 not later than 18 months after this bill becomes effective. I \nwould also invite Chairman Hatch to hold a hearing to consider this \ninformation, and to obtain views from people who both supported and \nopposed this compromise system.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator from California for her remarks and \nappreciate her support for this important legislation. I agree that \nCongress must closely monitor the effectiveness and fairness of the new \nreexamination procedure. I also believe it would be very useful to \nobtain the interim report she mentioned in a timely fashion and look \nforward to continuing to work with her on this issue.\n\n\n                       cpb list sharing provision\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. Chairman, I would like to engage with you in a \ncolloquy concerning the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) list-\nsharing prohibition in the Intellectual Property and Communications \nReform Act.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The bill amends Section 396(h) of the Communications \nAct to prevent public broadcasting entities that receive federal funds \nfrom renting or exchanging lists with political candidates, parties or \ncommittees.\n  Mr. Chairman, am I correct in reading this language as providing that \nthe list-sharing restriction only applies to the CPB and not any other \norganizations?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. Chairman, in my view, CPB is a unique entity and \nits unique nature may be used by supporters of this provision to \njustify the restrictions on list sharing. CPB is unique because it is \ncreated, controlled and funded by the government with a legal \nobligation to be balanced and objective.\n  Many non-profit organizations rely upon exchanges of lists with \npolitical organizations as a way to attract new members to their \norganizations to support their charitable works. A number of mainstream \nnon-profit organizations, such as the Disabled Veterans of America, \nhave expressed concern that this CPB provision may set a precedent for \nfuture restrictions on list sharing by other non-profit organizations. \nIt is my understanding, however, that this list sharing restriction is \nnot a precedent for similar restrictions on other non-profits that are \nnot: (1) created by the federal government; (2) controlled by the \nfederal government; (3) funded by the federal government; and (4) \nlegally required to be balanced and objective. Thus, I do not think \nthis provision relating to CPB is a precedent for imposing such \nrestrictions on other non-profits. Does the Chairman agree with my \nassessment?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, the Senator's assessment is correct. The conferees \nincluded the CPB list-sharing language in the bill because of concerns \nrelated to CPB's unique status. This provision should in no way be \ninterpreted as precedent for restrictions on list sharing by other non-\nprofit organizations that may receive federal funds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to ask a question of the \nsenior Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, in his capacity as chair of \nthe full Committee on Appropriations, and the senior senator from \nWashington, Mr. Gorton, who is chair of the Interior Subcommittee, \nregarding clarification of a vital issue facing the State of Alaska.\n  The Year 2000 will be the 20th anniversary of the passage of the \nAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980. ANILCA is the \nmost far-reaching piece of legislation ever passed--in the history of \nthe United States--in terms of creating massive set-asides for \nconservation purposes.\n  Last year, in the appropriations conference report, Congress passed \nspecific language requiring that the federal managers chosen from \naround the United States to oversee the implementation of ANILCA's \nConservation Units receive adequate, in-depth training on its many \ncomponents and ramifications. The language read as follows:\n\n       The Committees agree that the Secretary of the Interior and \n     the Secretary of Agriculture should provide comprehensive \n     training to land managers on the history and provisions of \n     statutes affecting land and natural resource management in \n     Alaska, including but not limited to Revised Statute 2477, \n     the Act of May 17, 1906 (34 Stat. 197), the Alaska Statehood \n     Act, the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, the White Act, the \n     Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, the Alaska \n     Native Claims Settlement Act, and the Magnuson-Stevens \n     Fishery Conservation and Management Act.\n\n  When this language passed it was our hope that this training would \nalso be provided to those employees who manage programs in Alaska and \nto employees whose jobs entail knowledge of one or more of the laws \ndescribed above.\n  I want to further clarify that it is our hope that the Secretary of \nthe Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture would enter into an \nagreement with, and provide funding to, Alaska Pacific University, in \nconjunction with University of Washington School of Law and \nNorthwestern School of Law, Lewis and Clark College, to develop and \nconduct training.\n  I feel training in these laws very specific to Alaska is badly \nneeded, as most federal employees arriving in the state know little \nabout Arctic and sub-Arctic environments. Many people coming to Alaska \nimagine incorrectly that the statute governing Alaska's federal Parks \nand Refuges is identical to those they have worked with in the South \n49. This, of course, is  far from the truth.\n\n  Because of the dimensions of ANILCA's reclassification of Alaska's \nlands, encompassing more than 104 million acres, an area larger that \nthe State of California, the Congress rightfully tailored the law with \na series of Alaska-specific provisions, unfamiliar to other states. The \npurpose of these provisions was clearly intended to ensure that these \nland designations protect the natural glories of Alaska's most \nbeautiful regions but neither destroy the way of life of Alaska's \nNative people nor violate the promises made to all Alaskans in the \nCompact made between our people and the U.S. Government in the Alaska \nStatehood Bill.\n  During the August recess, I held hearings in Alaska to discover how \nthe federal managers of the federal Conservation Units in Alaska are \ndoing in carrying out and living by the provisions required in the law. \nSadly, I must report a long litany of abuses being suffered by Alaskans \nas individuals, as outdoor sports participants, as business owners, and \nas a community due to ignorance by federal managers. Much of this \nignorance is through honest misunderstanding of the Statute. I, \ntherefore, ask my honorable colleagues to respond to my query about the \nstatus of the language passed last year that would fill this void.\n  I also want to call to your attention that Alaska Pacific \nUniversity's Institute of the North has followed up on that language, \nand is inaugurating a semester course this coming semester addressing \nall of these issues on the 20th anniversary of ANILCA. All \nstakeholders--from conservationists to Native peoples to resource \nharvesters--will be part of the discussions and learning process. The \nUniversity is working with Lewis and Clark's Northwestern School of Law \nto develop the needed legal research in this area. And while the \nUniversity was invited to participate at its own expense in the one-day \nANILCA training held here in Washington this spring, I believe the \nInterior Department and the Department of Agriculture have done no more \nthan that to fulfill Congressional intent.\n\n[[Page S14993]]\n\n  I believe a good curriculum can be developed at a cost of some \n$300,000, a small investment for an issue this important. The existing \ncourse can be re-formatted in a thorough but intensive week-long \nseminar and delivered specifically for the federal employees who \nconstantly are rotated into Alaska to serve on the front line of this \npioneering experiment in conservation and sustainable development.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague, the Chairman \nof the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The Senator from \nAlaska and the Senator from Washington will remember that I asked that \nthe language in the conference report be inserted last year. I, too, am \nconcerned that no action has taken place. It is my intent, as chairman \nof this committee, that the training called for in last year's \nconference report take place, and that the program led by Alaska \nPacific University, in conjunction with two of the closest law schools \nin Washington and Oregon, take place. There are sufficient funds in the \ntraining budgets of the several Interior agencies to make this happen, \nand I believe it should happen in conjunction with the outside \nresources who are developing this curriculum. While I participated in \nthe program held in Washington, DC, on this issue, I would hope that a \ngreater effort is put forth in the future.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I concur with the Alaska Senator's intent, \nand I believe the Interior and Agriculture budgets are sufficient to \nallow the Department to contract with these schools to provide the \ntraining we called for. Each of these Alaska laws referred to in the \nreport language last year is important, is unique, and needs \nappropriate training for our managers to ensure that Congressional \nintent is followed.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Thank you, Mr. President, and through the chair, thank \nyou to my colleagues. We have considered making this a legal \nrequirement in an amendment to law, but I believe this year--in the \n20th anniversary of ANILCA--we should see that the training gets \nstarted. We will be following it closely in the year to come, and we \nappreciate the comments provided by the committee chairman and the \nmanager of the bill.\n\n\n            blm closure of twin falls airtanker reload base\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to discuss with the Chairman \nof the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee a problem that has come up \nin Twin Falls in my State of Idaho. In July 1998, the Bureau of Land \nManagement's state office closed the tanker resupply base at the Twin \nFalls airport, after an internal inspection indicated unsafe \nconditions. At the time of that closing, the BLM Shoshone and state BLM \noffices expressed their interest in re-opening the facility as soon as \npossible. Over the following months, discussions between BLM and local \nofficials included mention of re-opening as early as during fiscal year \n2000.\n  Then, approval and timing of the project appeared to enter a twilight \nzone somewhere between south Idaho and Washington, DC. In February of \nthis year, a project data sheet was produced showing a request for FY \n2001. Local officials in Twin Falls were told that this delay was the \nresult of no prioritization decision being made at the national level, \nand that FY 2001 was going to be the earliest year for which the \nrequest could be made. Subsequently, local officials were told both, \nthat no final decisions had been made, and that the project had slipped \nto a lower priority and would be delayed at least until FY 2002.\n  Prompt replacement of this airtanker reload base is important for \nseveral reasons. It is the only such base within 100 miles of most of \nthe Idaho-Nevada border and is therefore situated to provide the \nfastest possible response in the area during the fire season. Because \nof the location of the airport and its clear departure paths, it offers \nfast, safe turnaround times. Many customers in addition to BLM need a \nbase in this area. If the base is not re-opened soon, it will hurt \nairport operations and hurt the local economy.\n  I am not suggesting to the Chairman that anyone is acting \ninappropriately. But I do think it is important for us to look into the \nmatter, find out more about the decisionmaking process and what it is \nproducing, consider what the fairest, most prompt outcome should be, \nand engage with BLM to arrive at that solution.\n  Mr. GORTON. I appreciate the gentleman bringing this to the \nSubcommittee's attention. I certainly can understand the Senator's \nconcern with the closure of this base and his constituents' frustration \nwith seemingly inexplicable delays in making progress toward a re-\nopening. I look forward to working with the Senator and with BLM, to \nlook into this matter and arrive at the best, earliest possible \nresolution.\n\n\n                      desulfurization (bds) grant\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. The FY 2000 Interior Appropriations conference report \nprovides a grant to a refinery in Alaska for a pilot project to \ndemonstrate the effectiveness of diesel biocatalytic desulfurization \ntechnology, or BDS for short. This technology holds great promise for \nhelping our petroleum refining industry reduce the sulfur content of \ndiesel fuel in order to meet new EPA regulations. Would the Chairman of \nthe Subcommittee clarify a couple of points about this grant?\n  Mr. GORTON. Certainly.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my understanding that the Chairman intends for \nthis grant to be made available only to a refinery owned by a small \nbusiness in Alaska. Is that correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct. I understand that the BDS \ntechnology is ideally suited to small refineries. Therefore, I believe \nthat the grant should be made available only to a refinery that meets \nthe Small Business Administration's definition of small; that is, less \nthan 75,000 barrels per day capacity of petroleum-based inputs and less \nthan 1,500 employees.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Why is the BDS technology better suited to small \nrefineries?\n  Mr. GORTON. It has to do with the nature of the technology itself. As \nthe Senator may know, diesel engine manufacturers currently are in the \nprocess of developing new technologies with the potential to radically \nreduce harmful diesel emissions, but which will require fuel with very \nlow sulfur content in order to work effectively. To reduce the \nenvironmental impact of diesel emissions, the EPA is considering new \nregulations which would require significant reductions in the sulfur \ncontent of diesel fuel.\n  Large-scale, fully-integrated refineries are capable of cost-\neffectively producing low-sulfur diesel fuel using the traditional \ntechnology for removing sulfur from gasoline and diesel fuel, called \nhydrodesulfurization, or HDS. However, small refineries do not have \nthat capability. HDS is a highly complex, energy intensive, and \nexpensive process. As a result, it is not well-suited to small \nrefineries, which generally are much more simply configured and produce \na smaller variety and quantity of refined products than large \nrefineries, and therefore cannot justify the expense of building and \noperating HDS units.\n  BDS, on the other hand, is a simple, efficient, and low cost \ntechnology which uses much less energy than the traditional HDS \ntechnology. A BDS unit is likely to cost 50% less to construct and \noperate than a traditional HDS unit. For these reasons, BDS technology \nis particularly well-suited to small refineries and holds great promise \nas a cost-effective alternative for producing low-sulfur diesel fuel. \nBecause small refineries will be the principal users of the BDS \ntechnology if it works like we hope it will, it makes sense to first \ntry it out at a small refinery. Therefore, we believe that the grant \nfor a demonstration project should be directed to a small refinery.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Thank you.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Senator Gorton, I have in my hand a copy of an August 27 \norder from Judge William Dwyer instructing the parties in a lawsuit \nover timber sales in the Pacific Northwest to negotiate a settlement \nregarding a requirement to survey for 77 species of mollusks, lichens, \nbryophytes, salamanders and slugs prior to conducting ground disturbing \nactivities. This lawsuit has held up over one quarter of a billion \nboard feet of federal timber sales.\n  Let me read a single sentence from the Judge's order:\n\n       Negotiations should now be resumed, should include the \n     defendant-interveners, and should explore short-term \n     solutions that would reduce the impact of injunctive relief\n\n[[Page S14994]]\n\n     on logging contractors and their employees while complying \n     with the Northwest Forest Plan.\n\n  I have been advised by media accounts that the settlement announced, \nwith great fanfare, by Under Secretary Jim Lyons yesterday did not \ninvolve the ``defendant-interveners.'' Indeed, in his public comments \nMr. Lyons indicates that, the defendant-interveners were excluded from \ndiscussions. Defendant-interveners have been unsuccessful in even \nsecuring basic information that the government currently has available \nabout affected sales. Furthermore, the settlement did not ``reduce the \nimpact of injunctive relief on logging contractors and their \nemployees'' at all. Instead, it actually expanded the injunction by \nadding four more sales to the dozens that are already either enjoined \nby the Court, or not awarded by a decision of the Administration. Mr. \nLyons gave the environmental plaintiffs more than what Judge Dwyer \nordered in his original decision simply to settle the case and claim \nthat his Northwest Forest Plan was ``back on track.'' This seems more \nlike a capitulation, rather than a settlement.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct. Additionally, I also understand \nthat the day before this ``deal'' was announced, Judge Dwyer held a \nstatus conference with all the parties, including the defendant-\ninterveners. The government attorneys told him that no agreement had \nbeen reached, and that the next mediation session was to occur on \nDecember 2. The Judge then set December 3 for the next status \nconference. Apparently, this Administration has as much trouble \nspeaking with any probity to the Judicial Branch as they have recently \nwith the Congress. It appears that the Judge's admonition to include \nthe ``defendant-interveners'' in the discussions was ignored.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Senator, I also understand that Section 334 of the \nInterior Appropriations Bill was dropped, in part, because of concerns \nby the Administration that the measure would disrupt the negotiations \nthat were underway, and could prevent the release of any of the \nenjoined timber sales. But, the settlement announced yesterday will not \nrelease any of the enjoined sales.\n  To add insult to injury, Mr. Lyons is nevertheless claiming that the \nsettlement he announced yesterday will, indeed, allow the sales to go \nforward. I understand that nothing could be further from the truth. \nThese sales are still on hold while the Forest Service tries to figure \nout how to search for slugs, slime and salamanders. Most importantly, \nthe Administration is not willing to commit to a time-frame to complete \nthese surveys. I believe this is a wrong that must be corrected.\n  Mr. GORTON. I concur with the observations of my colleague from \nIdaho. The sales in question have not been made available to operate. \nThey are still subject to the impossible survey requirements that \ncaused the injunction to begin with. That is why I would urge the \nAdministration in the strongest terms to return to the negotiating \ntable with the defendant-interveners and address their concerns.\n  Specifically, there should be an agreed-upon time-frame and a date \ncertain for the completion of the agreed-upon survey requirements. \nFailure to conduct a good-faith effort to complete the settlement \nprocess in the fashion ordered by the Judge should be grounds for \nwithholding final approval of the agreement.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I agree. It seems to me that, based upon the \nAdministration's performance, Congress should reinstate Section 334 or \nsome similar measure in the FY2000 Supplemental Appropriations bill and \ndirect the Administration to release these sales immediately. The \nAdministration's present course will keep this conflict alive \ninterminably, and expose the taxpayers to the liability of damage \nclaims from contract holders. Moreover, this consistent record of \ndeceit and chicanery from the Administration must stop. We made a good \nfaith effort to respond to the Administration's concerns over Section \n334 based, in part, on its promise to negotiate a fair settlement of \nthis legal dispute. Not only did they not do that, they now have the \naudacity to claim publicly that they did, and spin their announcement \nin the most shameful of ways. If truth is the coin of the realm, Mr. \nLyons and his cohorts are hopelessly bankrupt.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I would like to ask the Chairman of the \nInterior Appropriations subcommittee to clarify some matters concerning \nthe President's American Heritage Rivers initiative that concerns the \nInterior and related agencies portion of the appropriations act. \nSenator Gorton, is it your understanding that there is nothing in this \nbill that authorizes the American Heritage Rivers initiative?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, I would like to clarify that matter. There is no \nlanguage whatsoever in the Interior portion that provides an \nauthorization for the American Heritage Rivers Initiative.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Thank you Mr. Chairman. In addition, is \nit true that there is no separate appropriation for the American \nHeritage Rivers initiative in the Interior portion of the bill?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, it is true that there is no appropriation for the \nAmerican Heritage Rivers initiative in the appropriations act. In fact, \nthe bill includes in Title three a provision that clearly prohibits the \ntransfer of any funds from this act to the Council on Environmental \nQuality (CEQ) for purposes related to the American Heritage Rivers \ninitiative.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Thank you Mr. Chairman. In addition, can \nyou comment on some guidance that you have given the Forest Service in \nyour statement to the managers?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, certainly. The statement of the managers provides a \nlimitation on spending for the Forest Service for purposes related to \ndesignated American Heritage Rivers. This is not an appropriation, but \nit provides a maximum that may be spent from funds appropriated for \nother purposes on any efforts that are consistent with existing \nauthorized programs. I would also like to point out that the Interior \nsubcommittee has questioned this initiative previously. The Committee \nreports accompanying the FY 1999 bill clearly stated that efforts on \nthis initiative by agencies covered by the Interior bill must complete \nwith, or be normal part of, the authorized program of work of the \nagency.\n\n\n                intellectual property and communications\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the revised \n``Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999'' \n(H.R. 1554). As a Member of the Judiciary Committee, I am particularly \npleased that this legislation includes as Title IV, the ``American \nInventors Protection Act of 1999.'' This important patent reform \nmeasure includes a series of initiatives intended to protect rights of \ninventors, enhance patent protections and reduce patent litigation.\n  Perhaps most importantly, subtitle C of title IV contains the so-\ncalled ``First Inventor Defense.'' This defense provides a first \ninventor (or ``prior user'') with a defense in patent infringement \nlawsuits, whenever an inventor of a business method (i.e., a practice \nprocess or system) uses the invention but does not patent it. \nCurrently, patent law does not provide original inventors with any \nprotections when a subsequent user, who patents the method at a later \ndate, files a lawsuit for infringement against the real creator of the \ninvention.\n  The first inventor defense will provide the financial services \nindustry with important, needed protections in the face of the \nuncertainty presented by the Federal Circuit's decision in the State \nStreet case. State Street Bank and Trust Company v. Signature Financial \nGroup, Inc. 149 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1998). In State Street, the Court \ndid away with the so-called ``business methods'' exception to statutory \npatentable subject matter. Consequently, this decision has raised \nquestions about what types of business methods may now be eligible for \npatent protection. In the financial services sector, this has prompted \nserious legal and practical concerns. It has created doubt regarding \nwhether or not particular business methods used by this industry--\nincluding processes, practices, and systems--might now suddenly become \nsubject to new claims under the patent law. In terms of every day \nbusiness practice, these types of activities were considered to be \nprotected as trade secrets and were not viewed as patentable material.\n  Mr. President, the first inventor defense strikes a fair balance \nbetween patent law and trade secret law. Specifically, this provision \ncreates a defense for inventors who (1) acting in\n\n[[Page S14995]]\n\ngood faith have reduced the subject matter to practice in the United \nStates at least one year prior to the patent filing date (``effective \nfiling date'') of another (typically later) inventor; and (2) \ncommercially used the subject matter in the United States before the \nfiling date of the patent. Commercial use does not require that the \nparticular invention be made known to the public or be used in the \npublic marketplace--it includes wholly internal commercial uses as \nwell.\n  As used in this legislation, the term ``method'' is intended to be \nconstrued broadly. The term ``method'' is defined as meaning ``a method \nof doing or conducting business.'' thus, ``method'' includes any \ninternal method of doing business, a method used in the course of doing \nor conducting business, or a method for conducting business in the \npublic marketplace. It includes a practice, process, activity, or \nsystem that is used in the design, formulation, testing, or manufacture \nof any product or service. The defense will be applicable against \nmethod claims, as well as the claims involving machines or articles the \nmanufacturer used to practice such methods (i.e., apparatus claims). \nNew technologies are being developed every day, which include \ntechnology that employs both methods of doing business and physical \napparatus designed to carry out a method of doing business. The first \ninventor defense is intended to protect both method claims and \napparatus claims.\n  When viewed specifically from the standpoint of the financial \nservices industry, the term ``method'' includes financial instruments, \nfinancial products, financial transactions, the ordering of financial \ninformation, and any system or process that transmits or transforms \ninformation with respect to investments or other types of financial \ntransactions. In this context, it is important to point out the \nbeneficial effects that such methods have brought to our society. These \ninclude the encouragement of home ownership, the broadened availability \nof capital for small businesses, and the development of a variety of \npension and investment opportunities for millions of Americans.\n  As the joint explanatory statement of the Conference Committee on \nH.R. 1554 notes, the provision ``focuses on methods for doing and \nconducting business, including methods used in connection with internal \ncommercial operations as well as those used in connection with the sale \nor transfer of useful end results--whether in the form of physical \nproducts, or in the form of services, or in the form of some other \nuseful results; for example, results produced through the manipulation \nof data or other inputs to produce a useful result.'' H. Rept. 106-464 \np. 122.\n  The language of the provision states that the defense is not \navailable if the person has actually abandoned commercial use of the \nsubject matter. As used in the legislation, abandonment refers to the \ncessation of use with no intent to resume. Intervals of non-use between \nsuch periodic or cyclical activities such as seasonable factors or \nreasonable intervals between contracts, however, should not be \nconsidered to be abandonment.\n  As noted earlier, Mr. President, in the wake of State Street, \nthousands of methods and processes that have been and are used \ninternally are now subject to the possibility of being claimed as \npatented inventions. Previously, the businesses that developed and used \nsuch methods and processes thought that secrecy was the only protection \navailable. As the conference report on H.R. 1554 states: ``(U)nder \nestablished law, any of these inventions which have been in commercial \nuse--public or secret--for more than one year cannot now be the subject \nof a valid U.S. patent.'' H. Rept. 106-464, p. 122.\n  Mr. President, patent law should encourage innovation, not create \nbarriers to the development of innovative financial products, credit \nvehicles, and e-commerce generally. The patent law was never intended \nto prevent people from doing what they are already doing. While I am \nvery pleased that the first inventors defense is included in H.R. 1554, \nit should be viewed as just the first step in defining the appropriate \nlimits and boundaries of the State Street decision. This legal defense \nwill provide important protections for companies against unfair and \nunjustified patent infringement actions. But, at the same time, I \nbelieve that it is time for Congress to take a closer look at the \npotentially broad and, perhaps, adverse consequences of the State \nStreet decision. I would hope that beginning early next year that the \nJudiciary Committee will hold hearings on the State Street issue, so \nthat Senators can carefully evaluate its economic and competitive \nconsequences.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. My college is correct. The State Street decision may \nhave unintended consequences for the financial services community. By \nexplicitly holding that business methods are patentable, financial \nservice companies are finding that the techniques and ideas, that were \nin wide use, are being patented by others.\n  The Prior Inventor Defense of H.R. 1554 is an important step toward \nprotecting the financial services industry. By protecting early \ndevelopers and users of a business method, the defense allows U.S. \ncompanies to commit resources to the commercialization of their \ninventions with confidence that a subsequent patent holder will prevail \nin a patent-infringement suit. Without this defense, financial services \ncompanies face unfair patent-infringement suits over the use of \ntechniques and ideas (methods) they developed and have used for years.\n  While I support the Prior Inventor Defense, as a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, I hope that we will revisit this issue next year. \nMore must be done to address the boundaries of the State Street \ndecision with the realities of the constantly changing and developing \nfinancial services industry.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Schumer and my colleagues on \nthe committee on this important issue.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to support an extremely \nimportant provision in the budget agreement. A provision which will \nmean the difference for many dairy farmers around the country on \nwhether they will stay in business or not.\n  The dairy compromise that is included in the budget agreement will \nhelp bring stability to the price dairy farmers around the country \nreceive for their product--as well as protect consumers and processors \nby helping to maintain a fresh local supply of milk.\n  The agreement extends the very successful Northeast Dairy Compact and \noverturns Secretary Glickman's flawed pricing rule, saving dairy \nfarmers around the country millions of dollars in lost income.\n  Take one look at this chart and you will know why the dairy \ncompromise in the budget agreement is so important to the survival of \nthis country's dairy farmers.\n  Why, because every farmer in every state in the red would lose money \nout of their pockets if Secretary Glickman's flawed pricing rule known \nas option 1-B were to be put in place. The dairy compromise corrects \nthis and creates a pricing formula that is fair for both farmers and \nconsumers.\n  For three years the farmers in New England have had a program that \nworks. It's called the Northeast Dairy Compact. Because the Dairy \nCompact pilot program has worked so well--no less than twenty-five \nstates have approved Compacts and are now asking Congress for approval.\n  Today, I am so pleased two of the people responsible for creating the \nidea of the dairy compact are here in Washington today. Bobby Starr and \nDan Smith are two Vermonters that over 10 years ago put their heads \ntogether in an effort to help protect the Vermont way of life.\n  It was my hope and the hope of the majority of the Senate that we \ncould have expanded the compacts into other regions so other states \ncould benefit from having a means of stabilizing prices for both their \nfarmers and consumers.\n  Unfortunately, this time we were not able to expand the dairy compact \ninto other regions. However, a great deal of progress has been made as \nmore and more states are seeing the benefits of protecting their dairy \nfarmers and rural economies through the use of Interstate Compacts.\n  Given the broad support for compacts among the states, we all know \nthat the issue of regional pricing is one that will continue to be \ndebated. I am pleased with the tremendous progress the Southern states \nand other Northeastern states have made to move their compacts forward.\n\n[[Page S14996]]\n\n  While the debate continues, this reasonable compromise allows the \nNortheast Compact to continue as the pilot project for the concept of \nregional pricing\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact has given farmers and consumers hope. The \nCompact, which was authorized by the 1996 farm bill as a three-year \npilot program, has been extremely successful.\n  The Compact has been studied, audited, and sued but has always come \nthrough with a clean bill of health. Because of the success of the \nCompact it has served as a model for the entire country.\n  Mr. President, I am of course aware that some of my colleagues oppose \nour efforts to bring fairness to our states and farmers by continuation \nof the Dairy Compact pilot project.\n  Also, unfortunately, Congress has been bombarded with misinformation \nfrom an army of lobbyists representing the national milk processors, \nled by the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) and the Milk \nIndustry Foundation. These two groups, backed by the likes of Philip \nMorris, have funded several front groups to lobby against this \ncompromise.\n  Their handy work has been seen recently in misinformed newspaper \neditorials, deceiving advertisements and uninformed television ads. \nYesterday Senator Leahy and I came to the floor to correct the \nmisinformation contained in the Wall Street Journal Editorial.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to set the \nrecord straight about the operation of the Northeast Compact. It is \ncrucial that Congress understand the issues presented by dairy compacts \non the merits, rather than based on misinformation.\n  When properly armed with the facts, I believe you will conclude that \nthe Northeast Dairy Compact has already proven to be a successful \nexperiment and that the other states which have now adopted dairy \ncompacts should in the future be given the opportunity to determine \nwhether dairy compacts will in fact work for them as well.\n  Contrary to the claims of the opposition, regional compact regulation \nremain open to the interstate commerce of all producer milk and \nprocessor milk products, from whatever source. Compacts establish \nneither ``cartels'', ``tariffs'' nor ``barriers to trade'' and are not \n``economic protectionism.''\n  According to the opponents characterizations, dairy compacts somehow \nestablish a ``wall'' around the regions subject to compact regulation, \nand thereby prohibit competition from milk produced and processed from \noutside the regions.\n  These are entirely misleading characterizations.\n  It is really quite simple and straightforward: All fluid, or beverage \nmilk sold in a compact region is subject to uniform regulation, \nregardless of its source within or outside the compact region.\n  This means that all farmers, including farmers from the Upper \nMidwest, providing milk for beverage sale in the region, receive the \nsame pay prices without discrimination. It can thus be seen that there \nis no economic protectionism or the erection of barriers to trade.\n  Except for uniform regulation, the market remains open to all, and \nthe benefits of the regulations are provided without discrimination to \nall participating in the market, including those who participate in the \nmarket from beyond the territorial boundaries of the region.\n  Next, I would like to address the actual and potential impact of \ndairy compacts on consumer prices. In short, opposition claims about \nthe actual and possible impact of dairy compacts on consumers, \nincluding low income consumers, are unfounded and grossly distorted.\n  Over the years, while farm milk prices have fluctuated wildly, \nremaining constant overall during the last ten years, consumers prices \nhave risen sharply.\n  The explanation for this is apparently that variations in store \nprices do not mirror the wild fluctuations in farm prices.\n  In other words, when farm prices go up, the store prices go up, but \nwhen the farm prices recede, the store prices do not come back down as \nquickly or at the same rate. Hence, and quite logically, if you take \naway the fluctuations in farm prices, you take away the catalyst for \nunwarranted increases in store prices.\n  When the 1996 Farm Bill granted consent to the Northeast Dairy \nCompact as a pilot program, Congress gave the six New England states \nthe right under the compact clause of the Constitution to join together \nto help regulate the price paid to farmers for fluid milk in the New \nEngland region.\n  The six New England states realized that in order to maintain a \nviable agriculture infrastructure and an adequate supply of milk for \nthe consumers they needed to work together.\n  When the compact passed as part of the 1996 Farm Bill, the opponents \nwere so sure the compact would not operate as its supporters had \npromised, they asked the Office of Management of Budget to conduct a \nstudy on the economic effects of the Northeast Dairy Compact.\n  The opponents of the dairy compact intended for the OMB study to \ndiscredit the dairy compact. The study did just the opposite. Instead, \nthe OMB study proved just what we had thought--that the dairy compact \nworks and it works well.\n  The OMB studied the economic effects of the Northeast Dairy Compact \nand especially its effects on the federal food and nutrition programs. \nThe study also examined the impacts of milk prices at various levels on \nutilization and shipment of milk, and on farm income both within and \noutside the Compact region.\n  Here's what the study concluded:\n  The New England retail milk prices were $.05 cents per gallon lower \non average then retail milk prices nationally following the first six \nmonths of operation of the Northeast Dairy Compact.\n  The compact over-order payments made in New England through the \nCompact Commission have had little impact on the price consumers pay as \na result of the compact. Consumers, who are well represented on the \nCompact Commission, are very pleased with how the Dairy Compact has \noperated.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact has not added any costs to federal \nnutrition programs, such as the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) and \nthe school lunch and breakfast program, due to compensation procedures \nimplemented by the New England Compact Commission. A program that helps \nprotect farmers and consumers with no cost to the federal government.\n  The OMB study found that the Dairy Compact was economically \nbeneficial to dairy producers. It increased their income from the milk \nsales about six percent.\n  The study concluded that the retail prices in New England were lower \nthan the national average and it increased the income of dairy \nproducers. No wonder twenty-five states are interested in having \ncompacts in their states. And it's no wonder why governors, state \nlegislatures, consumers and farmers alike support the continuation of \nthe Northeast dairy compact.\n  Also, the OMB study concluded that there were no adverse affects for \ndairy farmers outside the Compact region and the study noted that some \ndairy producers outside the region actually received increased \nfinancial benefits through the sale of their milk into New England.\n  The OMB study helped Congress understand just how well the compact \nworks. The opponents of the compact did not get what they had hoped \nfor--instead we all have benefitted, both opponents and proponents of \nthe compact, with the facts.\n  Despite what some of my colleagues have said, the Northeast Dairy \nCompact is working as it was intended to.\n  Instead of trying to destroy an initiative that works to help dairy \nfarmers with no cost to the federal government, I urge my colleagues \nfrom the Upper Midwest to respect the states' interest and initiative \nto help protect their farmers and encourage other regions of the \ncountry to explore the possibility of forming their own interstate \ndairy compact in the future.\n  Mr. President, the Northeast Dairy Compact has worked well. Just \nthink if other commodities and other important resources around the \ncountry developed a program that had no cost to the federal government \nand benefitted both those who produce, sell, and purchase the product.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to \nthis legislation, which would revive an arcane\n\n[[Page S14997]]\n\nand unjust federal dairy policy that has destroyed thousands of family \ndairy farms.\n  Once again, the Senate is faced with dairy riders that fly in the \nface of recommendations from the Secretary of Agriculture, our nation's \ndairy farmers, and numerous taxpayer and consumer groups. It seems that \npolitical favors are more important to some in this Congress than \npolicy decisions that help our nation's dairy farmers.\n  During the last four years neither of these two harmful provisions--\nOption 1A or the Northeast dairy compact--has won Senate approval. I \nask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: why must Senate and \nHouse leaders continue to play political games at the expense of our \nnation's dairy farmers?\n  Mr. President, these backdoor deals must stop. America's dairy \nfarmers deserve a national dairy policy that ensures that all dairy \nfarmers receive a fair price for their milk.\n  Unfortunately, the House and Senate leadership went into a back room, \nand snuck in these two riders that step up the attack on our dairy \nindustry.\n  These decisions were separate even from the eyes and ears of members, \nand most members of the Senate Agriculture committee. With the \nproliferation of these backroom deals, it is no wonder that the general \npublic is frustrated with Congress.\n  The simple fact is that neither of these two dairy riders has been \napproved by both chambers of Congress, or the President.\n  I would like to make my colleagues aware of the history behind these \ntwo provisions. During the last four years, the only Senate vote \nexplicitly on the Northeast dairy compact resulted in a resounding \nrejection.\n  This year, the Senate again voted on a package containing the \nNortheast dairy compact, and it again failed to gain enough support to \ninvoke cloture.\n  Mr. President, the House has yet to take a single vote specifically \non the Northeast dairy compact. Compared to the record of the House, \nthese two votes make the Senate look like experts on the Northeast \ndairy compact.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, the 1996 farm bill required that the \nNortheast dairy compact expire upon implementation of USDA's reforms. \nUnfortunately these dairy riders seek to defy the will of Congress, and \ngive the back of their hand to America's dairy farmers.\n  After tens of thousands of comments, USDA came up with a modest plan \nto reform our 30-year-old milk marketing order structure.\n  More than 59,000 dairy farmers from all over the United States \nparticipated in a USDA national referendum and 96% voted in favor of \nthe United States Department of Agriculture's final rule to consolidate \nthe current 31 federal milk marketing orders into 11, and to reform the \nprice of Class I milk.\n  USDA's proposal garnered nearly uniform support in each of the 11 \nregions, including the Southeast, Midwest, and Northeast.\n  The second of these harmful dairy riders, would overturn these \nreforms.\n  Well, Mr. President, I take the floor today to deliver a simple \nmessage: Congress should not renew a milk marketing order system that \ndevastates family farmers, and imposes higher costs on consumers and \ntaxpayers.\n  There has been a great deal of confusion over the effects of these \nharmful dairy provisions. Some say that mandating Option 1A and a two \nyear extension of the Northeast dairy compact simply preserves the \nstatus quo.\n  This legislation does much more than simply extend the 60-year milk \nmarketing system.\n  A new forward contracting provision in this dairy rider enables \nprocessors to pay farmers much less than the federal blend price for \ntheir milk.\n  This forward contracting provision will also make the market less \ncompetitive for all other producers by reducing demand on the open \nmarket. Since it is likely that forward contracts would be offered to \nonly the largest producers, this provision will result in losses to \nsmall and medium-sized producers, who will become residual suppliers.\n  Mr. President, these dairy provisions shift the attack on our \nnation's dairy farmers into overdrive. This harmful legislation will \ncontinue to push our nation's dairy farmers out of business, and off \ntheir land.\n  For sixty years, dairy farmers across America have been steadily \ndriven out of business, and disadvantaged by the very Federal dairy \npolicy this legislation seeks to revive.\n  In 1950, Wisconsin had over 143 thousand dairy farms. After nearly 50 \nyears of the current dairy policy, Wisconsin is left with only 23 \nthousand farms. Let me repeat: 23 thousand farms.\n  Why would anyone seek to revive a dairy policy that has destroyed \nover 110 thousand dairy farms in a single state? That's more than five \nout of six farms in the last half-century.\n  This devastation has not been limited to Wisconsin. Since 1950, \nAmerica has lost over three million dairy farms. And this trend is \naccelerating, since 1985, America has lost over half of its dairy \nproducers.\n  Day after day, season after season, we are losing small farmers at an \nalarming rate. While these operations disappear, we are seeing the \nemergence of larger dairy farms.\n  The trend toward a few large dairy operations is mirrored in States \nthroughout the nation. The economic losses associated with the \nreduction of small farms goes well beyond the impact on the individual \nfarm families that have been forced off their land.\n  The loss of these farms has devastated rural communities where small \nfamily-owned dairy farms are the key to economic stability.\n  Option 1A also hurts these communities in other ways: through higher \ncosts passed on to both consumers and taxpayers.\n  Option 1A would increase prices for milk and cheese in virtually \nevery state in the country. Low income families and federal nutrition \nprograms, which rely heavily on milk and cheese, will be seriously hurt \nby the price increases mandated by this legislation.\n  The poor and elderly will be especially burdened by higher costs. \nUnder Option 1A and the Compact food stamp recipients would lose $40 \nmillion a year due to increases in beverage milk prices and another $18 \nmillion a year due to increased cheese prices.\n  This legislation also soaks taxpayers with a milk tax by imposing \nhigher costs on every taxpayer because we all pay for nutrition \nprograms such as food stamps and the national school lunch program.\n\n  According to USDA, Option 1A alone would increase the average \nbeverage milk price by nearly five cents a gallon and the cost of milk \nused for cheese by about two cents a gallon.\n  If we add up these costs to all of the federal nutrition programs, \nthe costs mount up quickly.\n  Option 1A would cost the school lunch and school breakfast programs \n$19 million a year in higher beverage milk prices and cheese prices.\n  The WIC program would face over $16 million in higher cheese and milk \nprices.\n  Mr. President, the loss caused by Option 1A to the three major \nnutrition programs is $93 million. These regressive taxes unfairly \nburden children and the elderly. These hidden penalties on America's \nchildren and elderly must not be allowed to continue.\n  The fact is, we need a new national dairy policy that stops \ndevastating small farmers, and imposing higher costs on taxpayers and \nconsumers.\n  During my six years in the United States Senate, and twelve years in \nthe Wisconsin State Senate, the overwhelming message I hear from dairy \nfarmers in Wisconsin, Minnesota and throughout the Midwest, is that we \nneed milk marketing order reform.\n  Congress recognized the need for a new national dairy policy, and in \n1996, mandated that USDA reform the Federal milk marketing order \nsystem.\n  Well, let's take a look at why farmers across the U.S. support USDA's \nreforms. This chart compares Class I milk prices under the final rule \nand the current pricing system.\n  Under USDA's final rule dairy farmers in New England would receive \n19.29 per hundredweight, a $.26 increase over the current system. \nFarmers in eastern New York and Northern New Jersey would receive \n$19.04 per hundredweight, an $.11 per hundredweight increase. In \nNorthern Florida, farmers would receive $20.34, a $.97 increase over \nthe current system.\n  These statistics underscore the importance of USDA's reforms for \ndairy farmers across the nation.\n  As this chart makes clear, USDA's reforms provide relief to America's\n\n[[Page S14998]]\n\ndairy farmers, and begin to re-institute fairness into our dairy \npricing structure.\n  Perhaps even more compelling is this simple bar graph that \nillustrates the national average Class I milk price that farmers \nreceive under the final rule and the current pricing system.\n  As you can see farmers would have received 58 cents more per \nhundredweight under USDA's final rule.\n  Farmers, consumer advocates, and taxpayer groups support USDA's \nreforms, and oppose these harmful dairy riders.\n  Mr. President, America's farmers demanded USDA's reforms. We should \nheed their call and support USDA's final rule.\n  Unfortunately, supporters of this legislation feel that they know \nbetter than America's dairy farmers, and wish to prevent USDA's \nmoderate reforms. Ironically, one of the few changes to Federal dairy \npolicy over the last 60 years has accelerated the attack on small \nfarmers.\n  Despite the discrimination against Wisconsin dairy farmers under the \nEau Claire rule, backdoor politicking during the eleventh hour of the \nconference committee for the 1996 farm bill, stuck America's dairy \nfarmers with the devastatingly harmful Northeast Dairy Compact. This \nprovision further aggravated the inequities of the Federal milk \nmarketing order system by establishing the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact. While the Compact may sound benign, it establishes a price \nfixing entity for six Northeastern States--Vermont, Maine, New \nHampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.\n  The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact Commission is empowered to set \nminimum prices for fluid milk higher than those established under \nFederal milk marketing orders. Never mind that farmers in the Northeast \nalready receive higher minimum prices under the antiquated, 60 year old \nEau Claire rule.\n  The compact not only allows these six States to set artificially high \nprices for their producers, it permits them to block entry of lower-\npriced milk from producers in competing States. Further distorting the \nmarkets are subsidies given to processors in these six States to export \ntheir higher-priced milk to non-compact States.\n  Who can defend this system with a straight face? This compact amounts \nto nothing short of government-sponsored price fixing. It is \noutrageously unfair, and also bad policy.\n  The compact interferes with interstate commerce and wildly distorts \nthe marketplace by erecting artificial barriers around one specially \nprotected region of the nation.\n  The compact arbitrarily provides preferential price treatment for \nfarmers in the Northeast at the expense of farmers in other regions who \nwork just as hard, who love their homes just as much and whose products \nare just as good or better.\n  It also irresponsibly encourages excess milk production in one region \nwithout establishing effective supply control. This practice flaunts \nbasic economic principles and ignores the obvious risk that it will \ndrive down milk prices for producers outside the compact region.\n  Despite what some have argued, the Northeast Dairy Compact hasn't \neven helped small Northeast farmers.\n  Since the Northeast first implemented its compact in 1997, small \ndairy farms in the Northeast, where this is supposed to help, have gone \nout of business at a rate of 41 percent higher than they had in the \nprevious 2 years--41 percent higher.\n  In fact, compacts often amount to a transfer of wealth to large farms \nby affording large farms a per-farm subsidy that is actually 20 times \ngreater than the meager subsidy given to small farmers.\n  We need to support USDA's moderate reforms, reject these harmful \ndairy riders and let our dairy farmers get a fair price for their milk.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today we are considering the District of \nColumbia appropriations bill, which includes not only funding for the \nnation's capital, but also regular appropriations for seven cabinet-\nlevel departments--the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, \nEducation, State, Justice, Commerce, and Interior.\n  The package also includes four major authorization bills covering \nMedicare, foreign operations, satellite television, dairy programs, and \nscrap-metal recycling.\n  Mr. President, under ordinary circumstances, legislation should not \nbe packaged this way. If I were to base my vote merely upon the process \nthat led us to combine these measures into one huge bill, I would vote \nno, as I have on the other omnibus bills that have come before the \nSenate during the last few years. However, I think there are some \nimportant distinctions between the package before us this year and what \nwe have seen in the past.\n  Unlike last year, for example, when free-for-all negotiations \nresulted in an orgy of new spending and wholesale concessions to the \nWhite House, this year the individual parts of the bill were negotiated \nseparately, in a largely orderly process. Unlike last year, any \nadditional spending won by the White House was required to be offset so \nthat net spending would not increase.\n  With the exception of the dairy provisions, which I oppose, I have \nconcluded that I would vote for each of the measures included here if \nwe had the opportunity to vote on them separately. For this reason and, \nbecause on balance, I believe the good in the rest of the package \noutweighs the bad, I will vote aye.\n  Mr. President, when we look back on this legislation five or 10 years \nfrom now, I think we will see one aspect of it as truly historic.\n  The legislation, despite its shortcomings, establishes a historic new \nprecedent against ever again raiding the Social Security trust fund for \nother purposes--a precedent that future Presidents and Congresses will \ndeviate from only at their own peril.\n  The package has been designed to avoid intentionally spending a dime \nof the Social Security surplus. And if our estimates turn out to be \nright, it will be the first time since 1960--the first time in nearly \n40 years--that Congress did not tap the Social Security surplus to pay \nfor other programs. It also means that we will be able to pay down \npublicly held debt by another $130 billion or so this year.\n  Mr. President, I think everyone needs to recognize that estimates of \nspending and revenues can be affected by even the slightest changes in \nthe economy, and so we will need to be prepared to adjust spending \nlevels early next year if it appears that that is necessary to take \nfurther action to safeguard the Social Security surplus. We should even \nconsider putting an automatic mechanism in place, as proposed in \nlegislation I cosponsored with Senator Rod Grams, to make sure Social \nSecurity is never again tapped.\n  In any event, it is important to recognize just how far we have come \nsince 1995. That was the year Bill Clinton sent Congress a budget that \nwould have spent every penny of the Social Security surplus every year \nfor the foreseeable future, and still run $200 billion annual deficits \non top of that. The President's FY96 budget submission would have \nresulted in actual deficits rising from about $259 billion in 1995 to \nroughly $289 billion this year.\n  We did not follow the President's recommendations. We charted an \nentirely different course. The result: We now have a budget that sets \naside the entire Social Security surplus and even runs an estimated $1 \nbillion surplus in the government's operating budget. That is progress.\n  Because we do not raid Social Security, we had to do a better job of \nsetting priorities so that we could take care of those things the \nAmerican people care most about, and to a large degree, I think we \nsucceeded. This bill provides a substantial increase in funds for \nmedical research at the National Institutes of Health. We provide even \nmore resources for education than the President asked for, and we take \na modest first step in the direction of public school choice and \nproviding local school districts with increased flexibility in how they \nwill use federal funds to meet the particular needs of their students. \nWe restore funding for hospitals and nursing homes that care for \nMedicare patients.\n  We also include additional resources for law enforcement, including \nfunding for 1,000 new Border Patrol agents, and funds to combat the \nscourge of methamphetamine in our communities. We are able to provide \nmore money than the President sought for the Violence\n\n[[Page S14999]]\n\nAgainst Women Act. And we provide money to make sure federal agencies \ncan be better stewards of our national parks, forests, and wildlife \nrefuges.\n  We require that international family-planning money be used for just \nthat--family planning, not abortion or lobbying to liberalize the \nabortion laws of other countries. Although the compromise provisions \nwould allow the President to waive the limitations and provide about \n$15 million to groups that engage in such activity, about 96 percent of \nthe dollars would still remain subject to the restrictions.\n  Of course, funding these various priorities means we had to limit \nspending in other areas in order to keep our promise not to raid Social \nSecurity. For example, the National Endowment for the Arts does not get \nthe increase it sought. There will not be as much foreign aid as \nPresident Clinton wanted. We cut the President's Advanced Technology \nProgram. To make doubly sure we keep our pledge to stay out of Social \nSecurity, we include a small across-the-board spending cut to force \nagencies to ferret out waste and abuse.\n  It is hard for me to conceal my disappointment in several regards. \nFirst, I regret that Congress did not protect the projected surplus in \nthe non-Social Security part of the budget. This bill, combined with \nthe other appropriations bills that have already been signed into law, \nwill spend the entire $14 billion surplus that was projected in the \ngovernment's operating budget --excluding Social Security--and it will \nbust the spending caps Congress and the President agreed to only two \nyears ago.\n  Second, there is still far too much wasteful spending in the budget.\n  And third, there is so much advance funding in the bill for FY2001 \nthat it will be difficult for us to stay within our spending targets \nfor next year.\n  On balance, though, it strikes me that the short-term cost of \nexceeding the caps and spending the relatively small non-Social \nSecurity surplus for this year is more than outweighed by the long-term \ndiscipline that will be imposed by the precedent we have set with \nregard to protecting Social Security.\n  Mr. President, with that in mind, I intend to vote for this bill.\n\n\n                    A BAD DEAL FOR WORKING AMERICANS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, a year ago I was here in this chamber \nspeaking on the 1998 Omnibus Appropriations legislation. I criticized \nthe abusive process that made the entire negotiations exclusive, \narbitrary, and conducted behind closed doors by only a few \ncongressional leaders and White House staff, and few Members of the \nCongress had any idea what was in the bill but were asked to approve it \nwithout adequate review and amendments. I also urged the Congress not \nto repeat the mistake that we need to reform the process and start the \nprocess early in the year to avoid appropriations pressure.\n  Many of my colleagues shared my views at the time and agreed that the \nfederal budget process had become a reckless game, and it not only \nweakened the nation's fiscal discipline but also undermined the system \nof checks and balances established by the Constitution.\n  At the beginning of the 106th Congress, I argued repeatedly in this \nchamber that the key to a successful budget process was to pursue \ncomprehensive budget process reforms. I have introduced legislation to \nachieve these goals which includes legislation that would force us to \npass a legally-binding federal budget, allow an automatic continuing \nresolution to kick-in to prevent government shutdown, set aside funds \neach year in the budget for true emergencies; strengthen the \nenforcement of budgetary controls; enhance accountability for Federal \nspending; mitigate the bias toward higher spending; modify Pay-As-You-\nGo (PAYGO) procedures to accommodate budget surpluses; and establish a \nlook-back sequester mechanism to ensure the Social Security surplus \nwill be protected. We also need to pursue biennial budgeting and \ngetting rid of the so-called ``baseline budgeting.''\n  We were assured by Senate leaders that we were going to pursue real \nbudget process reform early this year and that we would never have \nanother omnibus spending bill in the future.\n  Mr. President, I believe what we have before us today is a repeat of \nwhat was promised to never occur again. Once more, with inadequate time \nto review. The Houses passed this omnibus bill with absolutely no \nknowledge of what was in it. This is nearly a play-by-play of 1998 \nbecause we have not reformed our budget process. As a result, after \nseven Continuing Resolutions, we have before us an omnibus spending \nbill that is full of creative financing and earmarked pork programs.\n  Mr. President, when will we ever learn our lessons?\n  Mr. President, it is entirely irresponsible and reckless that \nCongress has over-used advanced appropriations, used directed scoring, \nemergency spending and many other budgetary smoke and mirrors to dodge \nfiscal discipline and significantly increase government spending. Like \nlast year's omnibus bill, this legislation is heavily loaded with \nirresponsible and inappropriate provisions. It is severely flawed by \nnew spending, no CBO scoring, gimmick offsets and billions of pork-\nbarrel programs. Many last-minute spending needs were loaded into this \nomnibus bill just in the last few days. I still cannot even tell you \nwhat they are, since we haven't been given enough time to review it. \nThe double whammy delivered to Minnesota dairy farmers by adding a two-\nyear extension of the Northeast dairy compact and 1 A order reform is \nmy main reason for opposing this bill. These outrageous last-minute \nadditions seriously hurt Mid-West dairy farmers and are the reason why \nwe are still here today.\n  This omnibus bill has again proven that big government is well and \nalive in Washington. The bill provides a total $385 billion for just \nfive spending bills, a significant increase over last year's levels. \nCongress is recklessly and irresponsibly throwing more and more \ntaxpayers' money to help the President enlarge the government. Billions \nof dollars were added to the spending legislation avoiding the normal \ncommittee process, without any amendments and full debate. If hiring \nmore police officers and more elementary school teachers is the \nsolution to stop crime and improve education, let us have an open \ndebate on the merits of the policy through the usual democratic \nprocess. Let's not cut deals behind the closed door in meetings by just \na few.\n  Since we established statutory spending limits, Washington has \nrepeatedly broken them because of lack of fiscal discipline. We have \ndone so again this year.\n  In my judgment, this omnibus spending bill and the other \nappropriation bills have been enacted have spent billions of dollars \nmore than the spending caps if we would use honest numbers to score \nthem. To date, the Congressional Budget Office has not provided us with \nits estimates on this bill. Because of the CBO's inability to score the \nbill, we do not know what the real cost of it, or whether it stays \nwithin the 302(b) allocations.\n  But we do know many accounting rules have been bent in putting this \nbill together to avoid the tighter spending caps. Let me explain: This \nbill relies heavily on the so-called ``directed scoring'' technique for \nit increased spending. Traditionally, Congress always uses the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates for scorekeeping. However, \nbecause the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has more favorable \nestimates for some government programs than the CBO, the Congress \nsimply directed CBO to use OMB numbers to keep score for this year's \nspending bills.\n  One of these OMB estimates the CBO was directed to use is the $2.4 \nbillion spectrum sales revenue expected to be collected next year. We \nall know that level of sales will not be reached. In fact, we \ncriticized the President for using this overoptimistic number in his \npast budgets.\n\n  Just by using the OMB's rosy estimates, without making any hard \nchoices, Congress has increased this year's 302(b) allocations by over \n$17.4 billion. But the real danger is, by the end of the year, the CBO \nwill use its own estimates to score our budget surplus or deficit. If \nOMB's numbers prove to be unrealistic and wrong, we end up spending the \nSocial Security surplus we have vowed to protect and it will be too \nlate to adjust the budget accordingly. This is the last thing we want \nto\n\n[[Page S15000]]\n\ndo. That is why I was disappointed my bill to provide an automatic \nsequester triggered by spending of the Social Security surplus was not \npassed. This procedure is absolutely essential to ensure we keep our \ncommitment to protect Social Security.\n  Again and again, Washington lowers the fiscal bar and then jumps over \nit, or finds ways around it, at the expense of the American taxpayers, \nso all the spenders and those special interests who benefit at other \nexpenses go home happy.\n  Mr. President, abusive use of emergency spending is another gimmick \napplied in this omnibus spending bill, as well as in the other \nappropriation bills we've passed. Last year alone, Congress \nappropriated $35 billion for so-called emergencies. This year again, \nover $24 billion of emergency spending was appropriated. Since 1991, \nemergency spending has totaled over $145 billion. Most of these \n``emergencies'' were used to fund regular government programs, not \nunanticipated true emergencies. Emergency spending is sought as a \nvehicle to add on even more spending priorities and thus to dodge \nfiscal discipline because emergency spending is not counted against the \nspending caps. This has gone too far. We need a better way to budget \nfor emergencies. Most of this spending can be planned within our budget \nlimits. Even natural disasters happen regularly--why not budget for \nthem, as I proposed in my budget process legislation.\n  Mr. President, while I agree ``advance appropriations,'' ``advance \nfunding'' and ``forward funding'' are not uncommon practice here, it \ndoes not mean they are the right thing to do, particularly when these \nbudget techniques are used to dodge much-needed fiscal discipline.\n  In the past five years, ``advance appropriations'' have increased \ndramatically, jumping from $1.9 billion in FY 1996 to $11.6 billion in \nFY 2000, an increase of $9.7 billion over five years. This year, at \nleast $19 billion was advanced into FY 2001 and outyears which will \ncreate even worse problems for us next year and in the future.\n  I understand the upward spending pressure the Congress is facing this \nyear and in the outyears. But I believe we should, and can, meet this \nchallenge by prioritizing and streamlining government programs while \nmaintaining fiscal discipline. We can reduce wasteful, unnecessary, \nduplicated, low-priority government programs to fund the necessary and \nresponsible function of government. But we need a Biennial Budget, as \nSenator Domenici recommends, to give us time to do this.\n  Instead of streamlining federal spending, we have thrown in more \nmoney to please big spenders without the needed analysis to ensure the \nspending will help us solve problems. Like last year's bill, this bill \nlooks like a Christmas tree full of pork projects. Many are added in \nthe last minute negotiation. But we don't know exactly what they are \nand how much they cost, because again we have not been given enough \ntime to review this bill. Here are a few examples as identified by \nSenator McCain:\n  An entirely new title is included in the legislation during last \nminute negotiations, the ``Mississippi National Forest Improvement Act \nof 1999,'' which had not previously been considered in the previous \nSenate or House bills. A half million dollars is added for the Salt \nLake City Olympic tree program. It earmarked $2 million for the \nUniversity of Mississippi Center for Sustainable Health Outreach and $3 \nmillion for the Center for Environmental Medicine and Toxicology at the \nUniversity of Mississippi Medical Center at Jackson. An earmark of $3 \nmillion is added for the Wheeling National Heritage Area and $3 million \nfor the Lincoln Library. It earmarked $2 million for Tupelo School \nDistrict in Mississippi for technology innovation. It includes an \nearmark of $3 million for the Southwest Pennsylvania Heritage Area. It \nalso earmarked $1 million for the completion of the Easter Seal \nSociety's Early Childhood Development Project for the Mississippi River \nDelta Region and $1 million for the Center for Literacy and Assessment \nat the University of Southern Mississippi. It also includes an increase \nof $3.6 million for Washington State Hatchery Improvement.\n  As the result, we've ended up spending much more money than we should \nhave. My biggest fear, Mr. President, is this omnibus spending \nlegislation may allow Congress and the President to spend some of the \nSocial Security surplus by not imposing an adequate across-the-board \nspending reduction.\n  Even counting all the ``directed scoring,'' ``advanced \nappropriations,'' every penny of the $14 billion on-budget surplus and \nother budgetary gimmicks, it is estimated that Congress could still dip \ninto the Social Security surplus by nearly $5 billion. To fill that gap \nwe need to reduce government spending by 0.97 percent across-the-board. \nBut the agreement reached between congressional leaders and the White \nHouse allows only a 0.38 percent reduction which would result in $1.3 \nbillion savings. Clearly, this is done just for face-saving reason, and \nwill not ensure that the Social Security surplus is protected.\n  The proponents of this omnibus bill may quickly point out that there \nare offsets to fund the new spending. But we all know most of the \noffsets are simply gimmicks. The best example is a $3.5 billion \ntransfer from the Federal Reserve surplus to the Treasury.\n  As you know, there is nothing new about this proposal and it has been \naround for quite a while. In the past, Chairman Greenspan called this \ntransfer of the Fed's surplus to the Treasury ``a gimmick that has no \nreal economic impact on the deficit.'' Because it is just an intra-\ngovernmental transfer that would not change the government's true \neconomic and financial position.\n  Other offsets such as a one-day delay in pay for our military and \ncivilians will cause enormous financial hardship for millions of \nAmerican families who depend on the regular paychecks to pay their \nmortgage, daycare for their kids, and other priorities. Many small \nbusinesses and contractors can be adversely affected by this offset as \nwell. Again, this has proven that the victims of Washington's spending \nspree are the American taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, there are many provisions in the omnibus \nappropriations bill I support, such as the BBA Medicare fix which \nincludes reinstatement of Minnesota's DSH allotment, the State \nDepartment Authorization which includes payment of the U.N. arrears and \nmy embassy security proposal, Home Satellite TV access and others. In \nfact I have worked hard on many of these proposals. However, I believe \nthe dairy provisions and the general lack of fiscal discipline in the \nbill have far overshadowed the good provisions. Overall, it is a bad \ndeal for working Americans in general and it is a bad deal for my \nfellow Minnesotans in particular. I therefore cannot in good conscience \nvote for this fiscally irresponsible legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep disappointment \nat the language affecting Federal dairy policy included in the Omnibus \nappropriations bill before us. As the Members know, the Omnibus measure \nincludes an extension of the Northeast Dairy Compact and language on \nreforming our Nation's Federal dairy policy which has been in place \nsince the Depression.\n  It may seem unusual to some Members that a Senator from Iowa would \nhave an interest in this matter. While Iowa's reputation as an \nagriculture powerhouse is well-established and well-deserved, I think \nwhen many people think of agriculture in Iowa, they think of \ncommodities such as soybeans or pork. However, the dairy industry is \nvery important to Iowa as well. The total economic contribution of the \ndairy industry to the Iowa economy is over $1.5 billion annually. \nNearly 10,000 Iowans are employed through dairy farming and processing. \nFurthermore, Iowa ranks 12th in the Nation in Dairy Production. So the \nState of Iowa has good reason to be concerned about Federal dairy \npolicy.\n  I have long been concerned about the impact of the Northeast Dairy \nCompact, which was authorized by the 1996 farm bill and which was due \nto sunset in October of this year, has had, and how it will affect \nproducers in the future. I voted in 1996 to strip the language from the \nfarm bill which allowed for the formation of the Northeast Dairy \nCompact. The only reason the language was included in the farm bill was \npolitical trading at the last minute. Since the inception of the \nNorthwest Compact, it is clear that its consequences have not been \ngood.\n\n[[Page S15001]]\n\n  According to the International Dairy Foods Association, the Northeast \nCompact has cost New England milk consumers nearly $65 million in \nhigher milk prices, at the same time costing child nutrition programs \n$9 million more. Consumers have paid a price that is too high for the \nNortheast Compact. We should not make more consumers suffer the same \nconsequences. I also believe that compacts are an abuse of the \nConstitution. While the Constitution does allow for the formation of \ncompacts, it is usually invoked for transportation or public works \nproject.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact is the first time that compacts have been \nused for the purpose of price fixing for regional interests. For the \nmost effective functioning of the U.S. economy, it must be unified. \nPreventing economic protectionism is at the heart of our Constitution. \nRenewing or expanding compacts flies in the face of that basic tenet. \nFurthermore, neither the Judiciary Committee or the Agriculture \nCommittee, which have jurisdiction over such matters, has had the \nopportunity to review this measure. Such a committee examination is \nwarranted and necessary.\n  One of the things that worries me about dairy compacts is their \npotential effect on other commodities. Higher prices mean more milk and \nless demand. The key to increasing dairy producers' income is expanding \ndemand for milk and dairy products. If we take steps to expand dairy \ncompacts, we will be going in the opposite direction. It is also my \nview that compacts are contradictory to the philosophy of freedom to \nfarm, which my friend, the senior Senator from Vermont, supported. The \nwhole philosophy behind freedom to farm was moving away from the old \n``command and control'', government-run AG policies of the past. We \nneed more free markets and free trade, not less. which brings me to my \nfinal point on compacts. As Chairman of the Finance Committee's \nSubcommittee on Trade, maintaining a strong trade position for the \nUnited States is my top priority. One of the reasons why the United \nStates is the only true superpower left in the world and why our Nation \nremains economically strong while others have faltered is because we \nfunction as one economically. Our economic prosperity is undeniable \nproof of the superiority of free and open markets. If we were to allow \nthe perpetuation of dairy compacts, it would send a very damaging \nsignal to the rest of the world.\n\n  It would send the message that we do not have the confidence that a \nfree and open economy will ensure that producers who come to the market \nwith a quality product will be able to support themselves. Not only is \nthe compact language in this bill unacceptable for dairy producers in \nthe Midwest, but the Omnibus bill also includes language on the \nNation's milk marketing orders that is detrimental to Iowa's dairy \nproducers. Members know that milk marketing orders are a system put in \nplace over 60 years ago to regulate milk handlers in a particular order \nregion to promote orderly marketing conditions.\n  The 1996 farm bill required USDA to cut the number of marketing \norders by over half and implement an up-to-date market oriented system \nof milk distribution. After a great deal of study and comment, USDA \ncame up with two proposals, Option 1-A, and Option 1-B. Option 1-A is \nclose to the status quo and Option 1-B is geared toward the free market \nand modernizing the system. While neither proposal was perfect, Option \n1-B was definitely a better choice. However, given the concerns \nexpressed by the public about both proposals, USDA issued a compromise \ninitiative, which was still preferable to Option 1-A. Unfortunately, \nOption 1-A proponents have succeeded in getting Option 1-A language \nincluded in the Omnibus appropriations bill.\n  Those who favor 1-A sometimes make the argument that the compromise \ndevised by USDA would cost dairy farmers nationwide $200 million. \nHowever, according to the USDA, net farm income would be higher under \nthe compromise that under the status quo which is what 1-A is in many \nways. The Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute, which is \nlocated in my State at Iowa State University, has concluded that 60 \npercent of the Nation's dairy farmers would receive more income under \nthe USDA compromise plan.\n  The unequal treatment of the old system, which is maintained by 1-A, \nartificially raises prices for milk in other parts of the country, \nencouraging excess production which spills into Midwestern markets. \nThis simply lowers the price that Midwestern producers receive.\n  The Federal Milk Marketing order System is out of date and out of \ntouch with modern production and economics. It is long overdue for \nreform and this language in the Omnibus bill just puts that off. My \nproducers and others in other Midwestern States have endured the \ninequities of the Milk Marketing Order System long enough. I am very \ndisappointed that the unfairness of the old system would be perpetuated \nby the language in this bill. We could still correct the mistakes made \nby this bill which would have a tremendously detrimental effect on \ndairy producers within Iowa and the rest of Midwest.\n  I urge the leadership on both sides of the aisle to work with \nMidwestern Senators to help put an end to the unfair treatment of the \nMidwestern dairy farmers. Thank you.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I reiterate my support for the two year \nextension of the very successful Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. \nAnd after all I have read recently--not that one should believe \neverything they read--I feel compelled to set the record straight on \nthis issue one more time.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact has addressed the needs of states in New \nEngland who compacted together within their region to determine fair \nprices for locally produced supplies of fresh milk. All six \nlegislatures and all six governors in New England approved the Compact.\n  In fact, in 1989-1990, the Vermont House passed it unanimously and \nthe Senate passed it 29 to 1. The Maine House passed it 114 to 1 and it \nwas unanimously adopted by the Senate. The legislatures in Connecticut, \nMassachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island adopted it overwhelmingly \nin 1993.\n  I would also note that despite the varying views, party affiliations \nand economic philosophies, this is one issue where the entire New \nEngland Congressional Delegation is united. And that, in and of itself, \nis quite a feat.\n  Let me tell you why New England is united behind the Dairy Compact. \nWe want our family farmers. This way of life is threatened for a number \nof reasons including the encroachment of development which leads to the \nincreased cost of land.\n  I think one Mainer summed it up quite nicely in a letter to the \neditor. In this letter she noted that it was okay to be against the \nCompact ``. . . if you think we will be better off having subdivisions \nwhere our farms once stood, if you believe it's to our advantage to say \ngood-bye to the last family farms and hello to big business controlling \nthe production, distribution and pricing . . . .''\n  In my own state of Maine we have lost 31 percent of our dairy farms \nin the last 10 years. We have 485 dairy farms left and they average 80 \nmilking cows and provide 2100 related jobs. They allow the continuation \nof a rural way of life that is fast disappearing not only in New \nEngland but throughout the country. And it is a way of life that we \nwill not give up without a fight.\n  The men and women who own our dairy farms are doing it because it is \nin their blood--their parents did it, their grandparents did it and in \nmany cases their great grandparents did it. You don't go into dairy \nfarming to make money--you go into it because it is in your blood, it \nis what you know and what you love. And the Compact is the only thing \nstanding between many of these families and the loss of not only their \nfarm but their way of life.\n  In Maine we have a saying that you are ``from away'' if you are not \nfrom Maine. Let me assure you that if you told a Maine dairy farmer \nthat he was part of a price fixing cartel, as several newspapers have \nclaimed, he would immediately know that you were from away . . . far, \nfar away.\n  The beauty of the Compact is that it reflects the New England way of \nlife--self-reliance--we don't ask the federal government for one penny. \nInstead, New Englanders pay a few cents more for milk to support the \nCompact--a very small price to pay to protect our rural way of life.\n  Let me repeat that--we are not asking the federal taxpayer in \nWisconsin\n\n[[Page S15002]]\n\nor Texas or Minnesota to subsidize our farmers--although I might add \nthat New England's taxpayers have historically subsidized farmers in \nother parts of the country.\n  The Compact has proven to be an effective approach to address farm \ninsecurity. The Compact has protected New England against the loss of \ntheir small family dairy farms and the consumers against a decrease in \nthe fresh local supply of milk. The Compact has stabilized the dairy \nindustry in this entire region and protected farmers and consumers \nagainst volatile price swings.\n  Over ninety-seven percent of the fluid milk market in New England is \nself-contained within the area, and fluid milk markets are local due to \nthe demand for freshness and because of high transportation costs, so \nany complaints raised in other areas about unfair competition are quite \ndisingenuous.\n  All we are asking, Mr. President, is the continuation of the \nNortheast Dairy Compact, the existence of which does not threaten or \nfinancially harm any other dairy farmer in the country.\n  Let there be no mistake, the Northeast Dairy Compact does not stand \nalone in the Omnibus bill. Additional dairy language is included in the \nbill that restores the existing federal program, the Milk Marketing \nOrder system, which fixes the price of milk in different regions across \nthe country, and is initiated and approved by producers in specific \nareas.\n  The USDA adopted a final Rule on Milk Marketing Orders in March, a \nrule I might add that favors dairy farmers in the Upper Midwest at the \nexpense of the rest of the country. On September 22, the House \nexpressed its opposition to this rule when they voted 285-140 to \nrestore the current system by placing a moratorium on the Final Rule. \nSo, this is not one region of the country speaking--although some \napparently believe that New England's family farmers make a good \nscapegoat--as 65 percent of the House of Representatives voted to pass \nthe moratorium language.\n  The New England Compact adds about two cents a gallon to the \nconsumer--not 20 cents as the Wall Street Journal would have you \nbelieve. They seem to be under the impression that the farmers set the \nprice for the milk you buy at the store--the fact is that the prices, \nas we all know, are set by the retailer. Under the Compact, New England \nretail milk prices have been among the lowest and the most stable in \nthe country.\n  The opposition has tried to make the argument that interstate dairy \ncompacts increase milk prices. This is just not so as milk prices \naround the U.S. have shown time and again that prices elsewhere are \nmuch higher and experience much wider price shifts than in the \nNortheast Compact states. Just take a look at dairy prices around the \ncountry for a gallon of milk.\n  The price in Bangor and Augusta, Maine ranged from $2.89 to $2.99 per \ngallon from February to April of 1999 and has remained stable at $2.89 \nfor the last several months.\n  In the Boston, Massachusetts market, the price stayed perfectly \nstable--at $2.89--from February to April of 1999.\n  The price in Seattle ranged from $3.39 to $3.56 over the same time \nperiod. Washington State is not in a compact, yet their milk was \napproximately 50 cents higher per gallon than in Maine. The range in \nLos Angeles was from $3.19 to $3.29. In San Diego, the range was from \n$3.10 to $3.62. California is not in a compact.\n  Las Vegas prices were $2.99 all the way up to $3.62. Not much price \nstability there, but then, Nevada is not in a compact. In Philadelphia, \nthe range was $2.78 to $3.01 per gallon--not as wide a shift as Nevada \nbut a much wider price shift than the Northeast Compact states. It's no \nwonder Pennsylvania dairy farmers want to join us.\n  How about Denver--Colorado is not in a compact. A gallon of milk in \nDenver has cost consumers anywhere from $3.45 to $3.59 over the past \nfew months, over one half of a dollar more than in New England. So, the \nNortheast Dairy Compact has not resulted in higher milk prices in New \nEngland, but the milk prices are among the lowest in the country--and \nare among the most stable.\n  Only the consumers and the processors in the New England region pay a \nfew cents extra for milk that already costs less than just about \nanywhere else in the country--to provide for a fairer return to the \narea's family dairy farmers and to protect a way of life important to \nthe people of the Northeast.\n  Also, where is the consumer outrage from the Compact states for \nspending a few extra pennies for fresh fluid milk so as to ensure a \nsafety net for dairy farmers so that they can continue an important way \nof life? I have not heard any swell of outrage of consumer complaints \nover the last three years. Why, because the consumers also realize this \ninitial pilot project, whose costs are borne entirely by the New \nEngland consumers and processors, has been a huge success.\n  So, I ask my colleagues to look at the facts, not the fables being \nspread by those who have simply chosen not to let the facts get in \ntheir way.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to express my \nstrong support for the Northeast Dairy Compact. Since taking effect in \nOctober 1997, the Compact has stabilized milk prices for both farmers \nand consumers in New England.\n  Farmers across the country are unable to make ends meet. The number \nof farmers in New England has declined significantly in recent years. \nIn 1992, Massachusetts had 365 dairy farms. Today, that number has \ndeclined to 290 dairy farms. Farmers in New England are losing a \npriceless heritage, that their families have owned for generations--\nsome since the 1600s. The Northeast Dairy Compact helps ensure that in \nthe face of these difficult times for their industry, our farmers will \nhave a consistent income to preserve their way of life.\n  There are many misconceptions about the Dairy Compact. One of the \nmost serious misconceptions is that taxpayers pick up the cost of the \nCompact. Taxpayers do not pay for this program--it is run at no cost to \nthe federal government.\n  In addition, with respect to competition a Congressional a condition \nimposed on the Compact specifically provides that: ``The Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact Commission shall not prohibit or in any way \nlimit the marketing in the compact region of any milk or milk product \nproduced in any other production area in the United States.''\n  Another misconception is that the Dairy Compact hurts the poor. This \nprogram does not hurt poor people. WIC and the school lunch program are \nexempt. In fact, in New England, the Compact overpaid these programs \nfor two years in a row.\n  When approved in 1996, the purpose of the Dairy Compact was to ensure \nthe viability of dairy farming in the Northeast and to ensure an \nadequate supply of local milk to consumers. The Compact is a price \nsupport, and was never intended to make anyone rich. It was intended to \npreserve small family farms and provide safeguards against excessive \nproduction.\n  The Compact has been a great success. The price of milk has actually \ndropped by an average of 5 cents a gallon across New England, and for \nmany months at a time, prices have remained so stable that no compact \nmoney has been paid to farmers.\n  The Dairy Compact is good for our farmers, preserving their way of \nlife. It is good for the environment, preserving farms and green space \nthat Western Massachusetts is known for. And it is good for consumers, \nstabilizing prices and ensuring a fresh and local supply of milk.\n  We stand for free competition, but we also stand for fair \ncompetition. In many areas of current law, there are long-standing \nprovisions designed to produce competition that is both free and fair. \nThe New England Dairy Compact deserves the support it has received from \nthe Senate in recent years, and I hope that it will continue to receive \nthat support.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is a great day for the critically \nimportant search for medical breakthroughs. I am very pleased to say \nthat the omnibus appropriations act contains a record $2.3 billion \nincrease in support for medical research through the National \nInstitutes of Health. We are now well on our way towards our goal of \ndoubling our nation's investment in the search for medical \nbreakthroughs.\n  This increase will directly benefit the health of the American \npeople. It will speed up the day when we have a\n\n[[Page S15003]]\n\ncure for cancer and other deadly diseases.\n  On top of that, the Senate has passed S. 1268, the Twenty-First \nCentury Research Laboratories Act of 1999. This bill cosponsored by \nSenators Frist, Kennedy, Chafee, Reed of Rhode Island, Mack, Mikulski, \nMurray, Cleland, Helms, Warner, Sarbanes, Schumer, Cochran, Durbin, \nMoynihan, Boxer, Roberts, Reid of Nevada, Specter, Feinstein, Collins, \nInouye and Hagel. I want to thank my colleagues for cosponsoring this \nlegislation, and for their support in getting it passed.\n  This bill addresses a critical shortfall in our nation's medical \nresearch enterprise. I was pleased to work with Senator Specter this \nyear to achieve a $2.3 billion increase for the National Institutes of \nHealth. The Conference Agreement of the Fiscal Year 2000 Labor, Health \nand Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee, provides $17.9 billion for the NIH. This puts us well on \ntrack to double funding for the NIH over the next five years, a target \nthat was agreed to by the Senate, 98-0, in 1997.\n  However, as Congress embarks on this important investment in improved \nhealth, we must strengthen the totality of the biomedical research \nenterprise. While it is critical to focus on high quality, cutting edge \nbasic and clinical research, we must also consider the quality of the \nlaboratories and buildings where that research is being conducted.\n  In fact, Mr. President, the infrastructure of research institutions, \nincluding the need for new physical facilities, is central to our \nnation's leadership in medical research. Despite the significant \nscientific advances produced by Federally-funded research, most of that \nresearch is currently being done in medical facilities built in the \n1950's and 1960's, a time when the Federal government obligated from \n$30 million to $100 million a year for facility and equipment \nmodernization. Since then, however, annual appropriations for \nmodernization of our biomedical research infrastructure have \ndramatically declined, ranging from zero to $20 million annually over \nthe past decade.\n  I am pleased to report that this year we were able to increase that \namount to $75 million in our appropriations bill. While this is an \nimportant improvement, much more is needed. As a result, many of our \nresearch facilities and laboratories are outdated and inadequate to \nmeet the challenge of the next millennium.\n  In order to realize major medical breakthroughs in Alzheimer's, \ndiabetes, Parkinson's, cancer and other major illnesses, our nation's \ntop researchers must have top quality, state-of-the-art laboratories \nand equipment. Unfortunately, the status of our research infrastructure \nis woefully inadequate.\n  A recent study by the National Science Foundation finds that academic \ninstitutions have deferred, due to lack of funds nearly $11.4 billion \nin repair, renovation, and construction projects. Almost one quarter of \nall research space requires either major renovation or replacement and \n70% of medical schools report having inadequate space in which to \nperform biomedical research.\n  A separate study by the National Science Foundation documents the \nlaboratory equipment needs for researchers and found that 67 percent of \nresearch institutions reported an increased need for laboratory \ninstruments. At the same time, the report found that spending for such \ninstruments at colleges and universities actually declined in the early \n1990s.\n  Several other prominent organizations have documented the need for \nincreased funding for research infrastructure. A March 1998 report by \nthe Association of American Medical Colleges stated that ``The \ngovernment should reestablish and fund a National Institutes of Health \nconstruction authority. . . .'' A June 1998 report by the Federation of \nAmerican Societies of Experimental Biology stated that ``Laboratories \nmust be built and equipped for the science of the 21st century . . . \nInfrastructure investments should include renovation of existing space \nas well as new construction, where appropriate.''\n  As we work to double funding for medical research over the next few \nyears, the already serious shortfall in the modernization of our \nnation's aging research facilities and labs will continue to worsen \nunless we take specific action. Future increases in NIH must be matched \nwith increased funding for repair, renovation and construction of \nresearch facilities, as well as the purchase of modern laboratory \nequipment.\n  Mr. President, the bill that passed the Senate today expands federal \nfunding for facilities construction and state-of-the-art laboratory \nequipment through the NIH by increasing the authorization for this \naccount within the National Center for Research Resources to $250 \nmillion in FY 2000 and $500 million in FY 2001.\n  In addition, the bill authorizes a ``Shared Instrumentation Grant \nProgram'' at NIH, to be administered by the Center. The program will \nprovide grants for the purchase of shared-use, state-of-the-art \nlaboratory equipment costing over $100,000. All grants awarded under \nthese two programs will be peer-reviewed, as is the practice with all \nNIH grants and projects.\n  We are entering a time of great promise in the field of biomedical \nresearch. We are on the verge of major breakthroughs which could end \nthe ravages of cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's and the scores of \nillnesses and conditions which take the lives and health of millions of \nAmericans, But to realize these breakthroughs, we must devote the \nnecessary resources to our nation's research enterprise.\n  I want to thank the Association of American Universities, the \nAssociation of American Medical Colleagues and the Federation of \nAmerican Societies of Experimental Biology for their support for this \nlegislation.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this important health care \nlegislation, and I look forward to working with our colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives next year to ensure this legislation is signed \ninto law. Thank you.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate passed today, \nS. 1243, the Prostate Cancer Research and Prevention Act, which I \nintroduced on June 18, 1999 to address the serious issue of prostate \ncancer.\n  This year 37,000 American men will die, and 179,300 will be diagnosed \nwith prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths \nin American men. Cancer of the prostate grows slowly, without symptoms, \nand thus is often undetected until in its most advanced and incurable \nstage. It is critical that men are aware of the risk of prostate cancer \nand take steps to ensure early detection.\n  While the average age of a man diagnosed with prostate cancer is 66, \nthe chance of developing prostate cancer rises dramatically with age--\nwhich makes it important for men to be screened or consult their health \ncare professional. The American Cancer Society and the American \nUrological Association recommend that men over 50 receive both an \nannual physical exam and a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test. \nAfrican-American men, who are at higher risk, and men with a family \nhistory of prostate cancer should begin yearly screening at age 40.\n  Even if the blood test is positive, however, it does not mean that a \nman definitely has prostate cancer. In fact, only 25 percent of men \nwith positive PSAs actually have prostate cancer. Further testing is \nneeded to determine if cancer is actually present. Once the cancer is \ndiagnosed, treatment options vary according to the individual. In \nelderly men, for example, the cancer may be especially slow growing and \nmay not spread to other parts of the body. In those cases, treatment of \nthe prostate may not be necessary, and physicians often monitor the \ncancer with follow-up examinations.\n  Unfortunately, preventive risk factors for prostate cancer are \ncurrently unknown and the effective measures to prevent this disease \nhave not been determined. In addition, scientific evidence is \ninsufficient to determine if screening for prostate cancer reduces \ndeaths or if treatment of disease at an early stage is more effective \nthan no treatment in prolonging a person's life. Currently, health \npractitioners cannot accurately determine which cancer will progress to \nbecome clinically significant and which will not. Thus, screening and \ntesting for early detection of prostate cancer should be discussed \nbetween a man and his health care practitioners.\n  In an effort to help address the serious issues of prostate cancer \nscreening,\n\n[[Page S15004]]\n\nto increase awareness and surveillance of prostate cancer, and to \nunlock the current mysteries of prostate cancer through research, the \n``Prostate Cancer Research and Prevention Act'' expands the authority \nof the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to carry-out \nactivities related to prostate cancer screening, overall awareness, and \nsurveillance of the disease. In addition, the bill extends the \nauthority of the National Institutes of Health to conduct basic and \nclinical research in combating prostate cancer.\n  The bill directs the CDC to establish grants to States and local \nhealth departments in an effort to increase awareness, surveillance, \ninformation dissemination regarding prostate cancer, and to examine the \nscientific evidence regarding screening for prostate cancer. The main \nfocus is to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of various \nscreening strategies for prostate cancer and the establishment of a \npublic information and education program about the issues regarding \nprostate cancer. The CDC will also strengthen and improve surveillance \non the incidence and prevalence of prostate cancer with a major force \non increasing the understanding of the greater risk of this disease in \nAfrican-American men.\n  The bill also reauthorizes the authority of the CDC to conduct a \nprostate screening program upon consultation with the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force and professional organizations regarding the \nscientific issues regarding prostate cancer screening. The screening \nprogram, when implemented, will provide grants to States and local \nhealth departments to screen men for prostate cancer with priority \ngiven to low income men and African-American men. In addition the \nscreening program will provide referrals for medical treatment of those \nscreened and ensure appropriate follow up services including case \nmanagement.\n  Finally, to continue the investment in medical research, the bill \nextends the authority of the National Cancer Institute at the National \nInstitutes of Health to conduct and support research to expand the \nunderstanding of the cause of, and find a cure for, prostate cancer. \nActivities authorized include basic research concerning the etiology \nand causes of prostate cancer, and clinical research concerning the \ncauses, prevention, detection and treatment of prostate cancer.\n  Mr. President, on the very day I introduced this bill last June, I \nparticipated in an event sponsored by the American Cancer Society and \nEndocare to award our former colleague Senator Dole for his leadership \nin raising public awareness for prostate cancer. In 1991, Senator Dole \nwas diagnosed with prostate cancer, and since that diagnosis and \nsuccessful treatment he has turned this potential tragedy into a \ntriumph as he has helped untold others by raising public awareness of \nthis devastating disease. I want to take this opportunity to thank \nSenator Dole and organizations that have worked tirelessly to help \npromote this and other men's health issues, including The American \nCancer Society, The Men's Health Network, and American Urological \nAssociation. I also want to thank these organizations for their support \nand help in drafting this legislation. I am pleased that the Senate has \nacted to pass this important bill, which will help to further increase \nawareness, surveillance and research of this deadly disease, and look \nforward to its ultimate enactment into law.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to add some additional \ncomments to my statement that appeared in the Congressional Record on \nTuesday, November 16, 1999.\n  Just a few days ago, on Tuesday, November 16, several constituents of \nmine were involved in a disastrous truck-related crash on I-285, a \nmajor commuter route around Atlanta. The crash took place during the \nmorning rush hour. Four tractor-trailer trucks were involved in the \ncrash, two of which were tankers hauling flammable materials. Four \npassenger cars were also involved in the crash, and tragically, one \nwoman was killed when her vehicle was crushed between two tractor-\ntrailer trucks. Four others were rushed to the hospital to be treated \nfor injuries. Thankfully, no further fatalities have been reported and \nno evacuation was required due to the sensitive material two of the \ntrucks were hauling. This crash underscores the need to guarantee that \ntruck safety is a priority in this country, and hopefully, reduce the \noccurrence of accidents such as this.\n  H.R. 3419 is a step in the right direction. It creates a new motor \ncarrier safety administration. In a hearing before the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, of which I am a member, the Department of Transportation \n(DOT) Inspector General (IG) testified that the current oversight \nsystem for the trucking industry within the Federal Highway \nAdministration (FHWA) is not adequate. In fact, one of the main \nsupporters of this legislation is Transportation Secretary Slater, who \nsaw the need to create a separate motor carrier oversight \nadministration focused entirely on safety.\n  Now that Congressional sentiment has swung toward adoption of H.R. \n3419 and the establishment of a new Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration, my colleagues and I should track the implementation of \nthis statute to ensure that the new agency will not bring with it the \nproblems associated with the former body. Safety and compliance should \nbe the utmost concerns of this office, with the American motorist as \nthe benefactor of their efforts.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to speak about H.R. 3419, the \nMotor Carrier Safety Improvement Act, which the Senate approved today. \nI commend Senator McCain, chairman of the Commerce Commitee, for \nholding hearings on this issue. These hearings, as well as reports from \nthe Department of Transportation's Inspector General, have shown how \ncritical it is for us all to pay closer attention to the safety \nproblems on our highways.\n  In 1998, 5,374 people were killed in truck-related crashes and over \n127,000 were injured. Although trucks account for only 3 percent of \nregistered vehicles, they are involved in 9 percent of fatal crashes, \nand 12 percent of all highway-related deaths. This is simply \nunacceptable, and we must do all we can to reduce fatalities and \ninjuries on our highways.\n  Recently, I met with one of my constituents, Cynthia Cozzolino, who \nlost her brother, sister-in-law, young nephew, and niece in a horrible \ntruck-related crash last August. This terrible tragedy could have been \nprevented if we made safety a higher priority, particularly truck \ninspection. Worn straps may have contributed to a truck spilling its \nload of concrete piping instantaneously killing this young family \nriding in their van behind the truck.\n  Highway truck traffic is an increasing part of our economy. \nCalifornia highway trucks carry 57 billion tons per mile, second only \nto Texas. In Southern California, the growing goods movement from ports \nand airports will push the current regional truck volume up by 40 \npercent over the next 20 years. One section of Interstate 15 is likely \nto see almost 13,000 truck trips a day. That is why we must do all we \ncan to strengthen our commitment to safety on our highways.\n  I am encouraged by certain key features of H.R. 3419. By establishing \na separate Motor Carrier Safety Administration, at long last we are \nmaking safety a priority. The bill directs the Secretary of \nTransportation to develp a long term strategy for improving commercial \nmotor vehicle, operator and carrier safety. It also directs the \nSecretary to implement safety improvement recommendations from the \nInspector General, and it calls for the development of staffing \nstandards for motor carrier safety inspectors at our international \nborder areas, an important element for California.\n  In addition, strengthening the Commercial Driver License regulations \nby explicitly directing the disqualification of any commercial driver \nfound to have caused a death because of negligent or criminal operation \nof a truck or bus and establishing stern penalties for foreign carriers \nwho operate illegally beyond the current southern border commercial \nzone, are key improvements. Disqualifying these carriers on the spot \nwill send a strong deterrent measure to any foreign trucking or bus \ncompanies who think that they can violate current motor carrier laws \nand regulations with impunity.\n  However, I am concerned that H.R. 3419 is not stronger in terms of \npotential conflict of interest in the research conducted for this new \nadministration. According to testimony before the Surface \nTransportation Subcommittee, in\n\n[[Page S15005]]\n\n1996, the Office of Motor Carriers (OMC) awarded more than $8 million \nto the trucking industry and its consultants to perform research on \nvarious issues, including driver fatigue and graduated licensing. I \nunderstand that such research can form the basis for future rulemakings \ngoverning the trucking industry.\n  The new Motor Carrier Safety Administration must maintain a high \ndegree of integrity and independence. I supported a provision that \nspecifically forbids any research for rulemaking and other programs \nthat is conducted by any entity with a vested economic interest in its \noutcome, and to forbid any individual who serves in a senior position \nwithin the new motor carrier agency from maintaining any affiliation \nwith the trucking industry. H.R. 3419 includes a provision that directs \nthe new motor carrier administrator to comply with the current Federal \nregulations regarding conflict of interest, and it also directs the \nadministrator to conduct a study to determine whether compliance with \nthese regulations is sufficient to avoid conflicts of interest. I look \nforward to the results of that study as well as any swift action by \nCongress to correct this problem if the study finds additional \nprotection for conflicts of interest is warranted.\n  H.R. 3419 would establish a separate administration for Motor Carrier \nSafety. I would prefer to transfer the OMC from the Federal Highway \nAdministration to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \n(NHTSA) and avoid the creation of a separate modal administration. \nNHTSA already issues regulations for newly manufactured trucks, and in \ntruck-car crashes 98 percent of the deaths are suffered by the \npassenger vehicle occupants.\n  Nevertheless, today we have taken an important step toward building \ngreater confidence in highway safety. The creation of a new \nadministration dedicated to safety is a new direction that I hope will \nlead to improved safety for the traveling public.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I would like to rectify some information \nentered into the Record during the debate on the Bankruptcy Reform Bill \non November 5, 1999.\n  A comprehensive bankruptcy study was cited during the course of \ndebate. This study was conducted by Professors Marianne Culhane and \nMichaela White from Creighton University, an impressive institution of \nhigher learning in my home State of Nebraska.\n  When discussing this study, my colleague from Iowa referred to a GAO \nReport that reviewed four different bankruptcy studies, including the \none written by Professors Culhane and White. It is my understanding \nsome comments were made indicating that GAO challenged the methodology \nthe Creighton professors used in conducting this study. After reviewing \nthe GAO Report, that was not my understanding. In fact, the GAO Report \nspecifically says, ``In our review, we found that the Creighton/ABI \nresearchers prepared and analyzed their data in a careful, thorough \nmanner.''\n  In order to clarify the record and any misperceptions about the GAO's \nfindings, I ask unanimous consent the following ``Scope and \nMethodology'' section of GAO Report, number 99-103 ``Personal \nBankruptcy: Analysis of Four Reports on Chapter 7 Debtors' Ability to \nPay'', be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n        GAO Report #99-103; Pages 5 and 6 Scope and Methodology\n\n       To evaluate and compare the four reports' research \n     methodologies, we assessed the strengths and limitations, if \n     any, of each report's assumptions and methodology for \n     determining debtors' ability to pay and the amount of debt \n     that debtors could potentially repay. The comments and \n     observations in this report are based on our review of the \n     March 1998 and March 1999 Ernst & Young reports, the March \n     1999 Creighton/ABI report, and the January 1999 EOUST report; \n     some additional information we requested from each report's \n     authors; independent analyses using the Creighton/ABI \n     report's database; and our experience in research design and \n     evaluation. We reviewed specific aspects of each report's \n     methodology, including the proposed legislation on which the \n     report was based, how the bankruptcy cases used in the \n     analysis were selected, what types of assumptions were made \n     about debtors' and their debt repayment ability, how debtors' \n     income and allowable living expenses were determined, and \n     whether appropriate data analysis techniques were used. We \n     also assessed the similarities and differences in the \n     methodologies used in the four reports.\n       In addition to reviewing the reports, we had numerous \n     contacts with the reports' authors. On March 16, 1999, we met \n     with one of the authors of the Creighton/ABI report, and on \n     March 25, 1999, we met with the authors of the two Ernst & \n     Young reports to discuss our questions and observations about \n     each report's methodology and assumptions. Following these \n     discussions, we created a detailed description of each \n     report's methodology (see app.I), which we sent to the \n     authors of each report for review and comment. On the basis \n     of the comments received, we amended our methodological \n     descriptions as appropriate. The authors of the Creighton/ABI \n     report responded to written questions we submitted. Ernst & \n     Young, Creighton/ABI, and EOUST provided additional details \n     on their methodologies and assumptions that were not fully \n     described in their reports. We did not verify the accuracy of \n     the data used in any of these reports back to the original \n     documents filed with the bankruptcy courts. However, the \n     Creighton/ABI authors provided us with a copy of the database \n     used in their analysis. Ernst & Young declined to provide a \n     copy of their database, citing VISA's proprietary interest in \n     the data. (VISA U.S.A. and MasterCard International sponsored \n     the Ernst & Young reports.) We received the EOUST report in \n     early April and, because of time constraints, did not request \n     the database for the report. We reviewed the Creighton/ABI \n     data and performed some analyses of our own to verify the \n     authors' categorization of data used in their analyses. In \n     our review, we found that the Creighton/ABI researchers \n     prepared and analyzed their data in a careful, thorough \n     manner.\n       The team that reviewed the reports included specialists in \n     program evaluation, statistical sampling, and statistical \n     analysis from our General Government Division's Design, \n     Methodology, and Technical Assistance group. We did our work \n     between February and May 1999 in Washington, D.C., in \n     accordance with generally accepted government auditing \n     standards. On May 18, 1999, we provided a draft of our report \n     to Ernst & Young, the authors of the Creighton/ABI report, \n     and EOUST for comment. Each provided written comments on the \n     report. In addition, on May 28, 1999, we met with \n     representatives from Ernst & Young to discuss their comments \n     on the draft report. Ernst & Young and Creighton/ABI also \n     separately provided technical comments on the report, which \n     we have incorporated as appropriate. The Ernst & Young, \n     Creighton/ABI, and EOUST written comments are summarized at \n     the end of this letter and contained in appendixes III \n     through V.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, just like the rest of our health care \ndelivery system, our nation's military health care delivery system \ncries out for reform. While both systems are plagued with rising costs \nand barriers to full access, the military health care delivery system \nis facing some very unique challenges. I intend to submit the \n``Contract With Our Service Members--Past and Present'' first thing \nnext session. A principal objective of this Contract will be military \nhealth care reform.\n  One of the critical challenges is how best to reconfigure the \nmilitary health care delivery system so that it might continue to meet \nits military readiness and peace-time obligations at a time of \ncontinuous change for our base and force structure.\n  This is a challenge with which I have been grappling for some time. \nIn the process of deciding how to proceed, I have been meeting with, \nand hearing from, many military family members, veterans and military \nretirees from around the country. I was inundated with suggestions for \nreform. In every meeting and every letter, I encountered retired \nservice men and women who have problems with every aspect of the \nmilitary medical care system--with long waiting periods, with access to \nthe right kind of care, with access to needed pharmaceutical drugs, and \nwith the broken promise of lifetime health care for military retirees \nand their spouses. I heard these concerns expressed as I have traveled \nacross the United States over the past several months.\n  One of the areas of greatest concern among military retirees and \ntheir families is the ``broken promise'' of lifetime medical care, \nespecially for those over age 65.\n  I believe grappling with these issues presents a great challenge and \ndemands our very best effort. Not lost on me is the urgent need to \naddress the over-age 65 issue since there are reportedly 1,000 World \nWar II and Korean veterans dying every day. It is imperative that as \nchanges are made to our nation's military force and continue to be made \nin the future with regards to base structure, that Congress not only \nstay fixated on bringing health care costs under control, but that \nsteps be taken\n\n[[Page S15006]]\n\nto retain the health care coverage so critical to our nation's active \nduty personnel, their families, retirees, and survivors. While the \nworld situation necessitates a modified force and base structure \ntransformed for the new millennium, it should not carry with it an \nabandonment of the responsibility that our nation has to assist those \nwho have served our country to obtain access to the health care \nservices they need.\n  Make no mistake, retiree health care is a readiness issue, as well. \nToday's servicemembers are acutely aware of retirees' \ndisenfranchisement from military health coverage, and exit surveys cite \nthis issue with increasing frequency as one of the factors in members' \ndecisions to leave service. In fact, a recent GAO study found that \n``access to medical and dental care in retirement'' was the number five \ncareer dissatisfier among active duty officers in retention-critical \nspecialties.\n  Failure to keep health care commitments is hurting service recruiting \nefforts as well. Traditionally, retirees have been the services' most \neffective recruiters, and their children and those of family friends \nhave had a high propensity to serve. Unfortunately, increasing numbers \nof retirees who have seen the government renege on its ``lifetime \nhealth care'' promises have become reluctant to recommend service \ncareers to their family members and friends. Restoring their confidence \nin their health care coverage will go a long way toward restoring this \ninvaluable recruiting resource.\n  One of the reasons that Congress has not implemented meaningful \nreform in the past is because of the cost of providing quality health \ncare. Although Congress has increased the President's defense budget \nrequests to attempt to meet our future needs, it has squandered \nbillions each year on projects the military did not request and does \nnot need. This year alone, Congress appropriated over $6 billion for \nwasteful, unnecessary, and low-priority projects that have absolutely \nno positive effect on preparing our military for future challenges.\n  Congress also continues to refuse to close military bases that are \nnot essential to our security, permitting politics to outweigh military \nreadiness, at a cost to the taxpayer of nearly $7 billion each year. If \nCongress would allow the Pentagon to privatize or consolidate depot and \nbase maintenance activities, savings of $2 billion each year could be \nachieved. In addition, Congress refuses to eliminate anti-competitive \n``Buy American'' restrictions, which could save almost $5.5 billion \nannually on defense contracts.\n  These common sense reforms alone would free up more than $20 billion \nper year, which could be used to begin remedying our readiness \nshortfalls and provide once-and-for-all a quality health care delivery \nsystem for our aged military retirees.\n  Additionally, most disgraceful is the fact that, while Congress \nwastes taxpayer money on obsolete infrastructure, unneeded weapons \nsystems, and projects that have no meaningful value to the Armed \nForces, it simultaneously refuses to adequately pay the nearly 12,000 \nenlisted military personnel who are forced to subsist on food stamps.\n  In October 1999, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the \nrest of the Joint Chiefs testified before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee on the state of the military and universally declared the \nyear 2000 to be the year of health care reform. Although this was a \ncritical step for the senior uniformed military leadership to \nacknowledge this thinking in their testimony to the Senate, it must not \nbecome our military's Y2K problem and fall prey to election year \npolitics.\n  On October 26, 1999 General Henry Shelton, Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, testified before the Senate Committee on Armed \nServices:\n       Although we have done much over the past year to improve \n     readiness, much more needs to be done to sustain the \n     momentum. This year, for example, we intend to focus on \n     another component that affects personnel readiness, the \n     quality of our military medical system . . . . The Joint \n     Chiefs are fully committed to supporting the Department of \n     Defense efforts to improve both the fact and the perception \n     of military health care for all the beneficiaries. Those who \n     serve or have served proudly deserve quality care.\n\n  One of the critical pieces of the last several years' laws on \nmilitary health care was the institution of several limited pilot \nprojects in Medicare subvention and FEHBP. As important as the select \nlocations was the cooperation that was achieved between several \nagencies who were responsible for implementing the pilot project \nlegislation devised by the Republican Congress. These pilot projects \nserve as important interim measures for health care reform and as a \nvaluable comparisons of the strengths and weaknesses of the military \nhealth care delivery system. Moreover, valuable lessons can be learned \nfrom comparing the current state of the military health care program \nwith those available in the private sector system that may have \napplicability to the military system, to lay the groundwork for a more \ncomprehensive reform effort.\n  The rush to implement military health care reform and the evaluation \nof current health care delivery pilot projects must be balanced with \nthe need to provide critical health care to the over-65 military \nretirees and their families. Their angst towards losing any minimal \nhealth care they had from the time they retired to turning age-65 is \nmultiplied on their 65th birthday. If this is to be the year of \nmilitary health care, a key part of this effort must entail reassuring \nthese older retirees that the Department of Defense will no longer deny \nor ignore their legitimate health care needs. By doing so, Congress \nalso will be taking an essential step to reassure today's \nservicemembers that the government does, in fact, keep its recruiting \nand retention promises concerning health care and other career service \nbenefits.\n  The legislation that I am working on in the Senate would be the next \nstep down the road to meaningful reform of our Nation's military health \ncare delivery system. This legislation would offer the military retiree \nand his family several health care delivery plans to choose from. \nHaving the choice to decide which health care plan works well is \nimportant for two reasons. One to be able to control overall health \ncare reform costs and secondly, each retirees needs are different. Some \nmilitary retirees may not mind driving 100 miles to a military \ntreatment facility for health care as long as they have access to a \nviable, quality pharmaceutical plan. Other military retirees and their \nfamilies may not be able to drive long distances for their primary \nhealth care needs and instead require a health care delivery plan that \nis much closer to their home. Another objective of this health care \nreform plan, is that in the event of another base closure round, any \nplan be portable and less dependent on any military hospital system.\n  Some military retirees live near military installations and would be \nhappy to use military care if they only had access to it. Others who \nlive far from installations may be satisfied with the addition of a \nrelatively low-cost prescription drug benefit. Still others desperately \nneed full-coverage insurance such as FEHBP.\n  I am working on another key health care bill with cosponsors \nRepresentative Norwood from Georgia and Representative Shows from \nMississippi. I have worked closely with my dear friend and Medal of \nHonor recipient, Colonel Bud Day, over the years and he has helped me \nto understand how unfair our health care system is to our military \nretirees and the governments' failure to keep its promise to them. I \nbelieve that if we are to restore the credibility in our government we \nmust begin by keeping our promises to our men and women in uniform, \npast and present.\n  The health care reform plan that is enacted must also promote more \nefficiency in the military health care system. Right now our military \nhealth care system which offers limited health care benefits to those \nover-age 65 retirees is operating $800 million in the red. There are \nmany efficiency practices that the beneficiaries have brought to my \nattention that would improve the military health care delivery system \nthrough: better billing practices, quality control of electronic forms \nprocessing, regular surveys of military health care beneficiaries, and \nbringing the various health care delivery systems under a single system \ncould save hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  The federal government must not abandon the health care coverage \nneeds of our nation's military retirees, their families, and survivors. \nI will continue\n\n[[Page S15007]]\n\nto work over the next couple of months with The Military Coalition and \nThe Military Veterans Alliance, representing nearly 10 million members, \nto enact comprehensive reform of the military health care system, which \nfulfills our obligation to our military retirees, and bolsters \nretention and readiness among today's servicemembers by assuring them \nthat retention promises will be fulfilled once their active service is \nover.\n  Mr. President, next year will be, in the words of the Joint Chiefs, \nthe year of health care reform. I hope that my colleagues will join me \nin supporting the ``Contract With Our Service Members--Past and \nPresent.'' A key objective of this Contract, legislation to reform our \nmilitary health care system, must be successful if Congress is to \nrestore the American people's faith in their government.\n  Thank you and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to offer a few comments about \nH.R. 1693, a bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) \nand clarify the overtime exemption for employees engaged in fire \nprotection activities.\n  This bipartisan bill was passed on the House Suspension Calendar \nwithout objection on November 4, 1999, and just passed the Senate under \na unanimous consent agreement.\n  Generally, under the Fair Labor Standards Act, workers are entitled \nto overtime compensation for hours worked in excess of 40 in a given \nweek. The FLSA contains an exemption for overtime, under Section 7(k), \nfor employees of public agencies who are engaged in fire protection \nactivities. This exemption allows employees engaged in fire protection \nactivities some flexibility in scheduling their work hours. It also \nrecognizes the extended periods of time that firefighters are often on \nduty by allowing firefighters to work up to 212 hours within a period \nof 28 consecutive days before triggering the overtime pay requirement.\n  H.R. 1693 clarifies this firefighter exemption as it relates to \nemergency medical personnel. This bill provides that paramedics who are \ncross-trained/dual role firefighters, and work in a fire department and \nhave the responsibility to perform both fire fighting and emergency \nmedical services, be treated as firefighters for the purpose of Section \n7(k) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. H.R. 1693 does not create a new \nexemption from the FLSA, it merely clarifies the definition of \nfirefighter.\n  Supported by the International Association of Fire Fighters and the \nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs, H.R. 1693 ensures that \nunreasonable burdens are not placed on fire departments when accounting \nfor hours worked. In effect, it elucidates the original intent of the \nSection 7(k) provision of the FLSA, the provisions that apply to \nfirefighters who perform normal fire fighting duties, and hopefully the \nSenate's passage of this clarification addresses the concerns of the \ninterested parties.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this legislation is necessary to resolve \nthe confusion in current law over whether firefighters who are also \ntrained as paramedics are covered by the exemption in section 7(k) of \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  This bill defines ``employee engaged in fire protection activities'' \nto make clear that fire fighters who perform fire fighting duties are \ncovered by the exemption, regardless of the number of hours they spend \nin responding to Emergency Medical Services calls. This legislation \nrestores the original intent of the 1986 law that created the section \nexemption.\n  Significantly, the legislation also states that in order to qualify \nfor the exemption, an employee must have the ``legal authority and \nresponsibility to engage in fire suppression.'' This phrase was added \nfor the express purpose of assuring that single-role emergency medical \npersonnel are not covered by the exemption. Simply sending paramedics \nto the fire academy will not automatically bring them under the \nexemption. Fire suppression must be an integral part of the \nresponsibilities for all employees covered by the exemption.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor and to \nsupport the passage of the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement \nAct, S. 335.\n  I congratulate the distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, for \nher successful efforts to get this legislation adopted to curb \ndeceptive mailings. She has provided strong leadership and sound \nguidance on this important issue. As Chair of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, Senator Collins has worked effectively \nto examine the problems relating to sweepstakes and promotional \nmailings and develop this legislation to strengthen our laws. I applaud \nher work in crafting this bill and her continuing efforts to protect \nconsumers.\n  The Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act includes new \nsafeguards to protect consumers against misleading and dishonest \nsweepstakes and other promotional mailings, including government look-\nalike mailings. The bill grants additional investigative and \nenforcement authority to the United States Postal Service to stop \nunscrupulous mailings and establishes standards for all sweepstakes \nmailings by requiring certain disclosures on each mail piece.\n  This bill is an important step toward the prevention of deception in \nsweepstakes and other promotional mailings. I compliment Senator \nCollins on her efforts, and I am pleased to support the passage of the \nDeceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is \nprepared to pass the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission Act of \n1999. The year 2009 is the 200th anniversary of President Lincoln's \nbirth, and this measure would establish a commission to study and \nrecommend to the Congress activities that are appropriate to celebrate \nthat anniversary.\n  It is most fitting that we make these arrangements to honor Abraham \nLincoln, one of our nation's wisest and most courageous former \nPresidents, on the bicentennial of his birth. The son of a Kentucky \nfrontiersman, Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809 in a log \ncabin. From these humble beginnings, he went on to become the sixteenth \nPresident of the United States. Today, he is perhaps best remembered \nfor leading the Union through a turbulent Civil War and for issuing the \nEmancipation Proclamation, which freed the nation's slaves.\n  Few people have a greater appreciation for President Lincoln than the \nresidents of my home state of Illinois. President Lincoln spent about \neight years in the Illinois State Legislature, and he also represented \nIllinois in the U.S. House of Representatives for a term. The only home \nthat Abraham Lincoln owned is located in Springfield, Illinois. Today, \npeople from all parts of the United States travel to Springfield to see \nAbraham Lincoln's family home, tour the Old State Capital where Mr. \nLincoln said ``a house divided cannot stand,'' and visit his final \nresting place in Springfield's Oak Ridge Cemetery.\n  The Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission Act, which originated in \nthe House of Representatives, provides for the establishment of a \nnational commission to recommend ``fitting and proper'' activities to \ncelebrate the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth. The commission would be \ncomposed of fifteen members, including at least one person appointed by \nthe President on the recommendation of the Governor of Illinois.\n  Congress created a similar commission in anticipation of the \ncentennial of Lincoln's birth in 1909. That year, this country \ncelebrated President Lincoln's birthday in a big way: Lincoln's image \nappeared on a postage stamp, his birthday became a national holiday, \nCongress passed legislation which led to the Lincoln Memorial's \nconstruction, and the White House approved the minting of a Lincoln \npenny. It is appropriate that we again prepare for the anniversary of \nhis birth by passing this measure to establish the Abraham Lincoln \nBicentennial Commission.\n  I close by noting that the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission \nAct of 1999 has tremendous support in both chambers of Congress. The \nbill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 411 to 2 last \nmonth. The Senate version is the product of cooperation among Senators \nHatch, Leahy, Durbin and me. I also commend Judiciary Chairman Hatch, \nranking member Leahy, and their staffs for their efforts to help pass \nthis important bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there are obviously many issues that one \nmight\n\n[[Page S15008]]\n\ndiscuss in the context of the omnibus spending bill that is currently \npending before the Senate. I would like to take a few moments to \nmention two very important issues that have been included in the \npending legislation, the IMF debt initiative and payment of U.N. \narrears.\n  I was extremely pleased that the House and Senate leadership were \nable to reach agreement earlier this week with Secretary of Treasury \nLarry Summers and other administration officials on legislative \nlanguage that will permit the IMF's historic debt relief initiative to \nmove forward. Just a few short days ago, it seemed unthinkable that the \nCongress and the Executive would reach a compromise to permit the \nUnited States to support the IMF debt initiative for highly indebted \npoor nations around the globe before the end of this session of \nCongress.\n  The provisions contained in the pending legislation authorize U.S. \nsupport for IMF participation in the international debt reduction \ninitiative by permitting the United States to vote for the immediate \nnon-market sale of the amount of gold necessary to generate profits of \n$3.1 billion; permit the use of 64% of the interest earned on the \ninvested profits to be used for debt relief; authorize the U.S. share \nof a special reserve account at the IMF to also be used for debt relief \npurposes, and appropriate $123 million for FY 2000 bilateral U.S. debt \nreduction programs that will be undertaken in conjunction with the \ninternational debt initiative.\n  With the enactment of this bill into law, the United States will be \nable to make a major step forward toward achieving the commitments made \nby President Clinton and other so called G-7 heads of state at this \nyear's Cologne Summit. Among other things, this will enable the IMF, \nfor the first time, to utilize its own resources to participate in \ninternational efforts to reduce the mounting debt burden that has been \na yoke around the necks of the most impoverished nations of the world--\ncountries which are home to nearly half a billion people. With this \ndebt relief and the economic reforms that will be an integral part of \nthe IMF's multilateral initiative, the poorest countries in Africa and \nLatin America can now approach the next millennium with prospects for a \nbrighter future. I am extremely pleased that bipartisanship ultimately \nwon the day during negotiations of this important issue.\n  Another important issue with major international implications has \nalso finally been successfully resolved, namely the authorization and \nappropriation of $926 million in long overdue U.S. payments to the \nUnited Nations. While I would have preferred to see this issue treated \non its own merits, rather than linked to restrictions on bilateral \nfunding for family planning programs of foreign private and \ninternational population organizations, at least this issue has been \nfinally resolved, and the United States will not lose its vote at the \nUnited Nations.\n  I believe that extremist elements in the Congress jeopardized United \nStates national security and foreign policy interests by holding up our \npayments to the UN for more than three years. They held this money \nhostage to the unrelated issue of international population programs. I \nam not happy with the compromise that had to be agreed to in order to \nresolve this issue. It is un-American in my view to legislatively seek \nto limit the free speech of foreign non-governmental organizations with \nrespect to local family planning laws as a condition for receiving \nUnited States funding for their important family planning programs. \nWere I to have had the opportunity to vote on this language as a free \nstanding amendment I would have certainly voted against it, as would a \nmajority of the Senate. Unfortunately, because it has been included in \nthe omnibus conference report we do not have that option. We must \nbalance our distaste for this provision against the many positive \nprograms that will be funded, including UN arrears, once this bill \nbecomes law. Having done so, I will vote in favor of the pending \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, the IMF, the United Nations and its related \nspecialized organizations--UNICEF, the International Labor \nOrganization, the World Health Organization, the Commission for Human \nRights el al.--have a daily impact of the lives of the world's people--\nand it is an impact for the better. Without doubt, these international \norganizations further United States national security and foreign \npolicy interests through their programs and initiatives. \nRepresentatives of the United Nations are on the ground in the far \ncomers of the world--in East Timor, Kosovo, Haiti, and Iraq to mention \nbut a few ongoing missions of the United Nations. The United States is \nable to maximize its interests and advance its foreign policy agenda at \nmuch lower cost thanks to our participation in this important \ninternational organization.\n  There are clearly many reasons for voting to support this spending \nbill, despite its many flaws. The IMF Debt Relief Initiative and \npayment of UN arrears are two of the more compelling ones in my \nopinion. I urge my colleagues to support this bill when it comes to a \nvote later today.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, the United States Senate unanimously \npassed much needed legislation to protect some of America's most \nthreatened historic sites, the Vicksburg Campaign Trail and the Corinth \nbattlefield.\n  S. 710, the Vicksburg Campaign Trail Battlefields Preservation Act of \n1999, is a bipartisan measure that authorizes a feasibility study on \nthe preservation of Civil War battlefields and related sites in the \nfour states along the Vicksburg Campaign Trail.\n  As my colleagues know, Vicksburg served as a gateway to the \nMississippi River during the Civil War. The eighteen month campaign for \nthe ``Gibraltar of the Confederacy'' included over 100,000 soldiers and \ninvolved a number of skirmishes and major battles in Mississippi, \nArkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee.\n  The Mississippi Heritage Trust and the National Trust for Historic \nPreservation named the Vicksburg Campaign Trail as being among the most \nthreatened sites in the state and the nation.\n  S. 710 would begin the process of preserving the important landmarks \nin the four state region that warrant further protection. I appreciate \nthe cosponsorship of Chairman Murkowski, Chairman Thomas, and Senators \nLandrieu, Breaux, Cochran, Hutchinson, and Craig on this measure.\n  Mr. President, the Senate also approved S.1117, the Corinth \nBattlefield Preservation Act of 1999, a measure that establishes the \nCorinth Unit of the Shiloh National Military Park.\n  The battle of Shiloh was actually part of the Union Army's overall \neffort to seize Corinth. This small town was important to both the \nConfederacy and the Union. Corinth's railway was vitally important to \nboth sides as it served as a gateway for moving troops and supplies \nnorth and south, east and west. The overall campaign led to some of the \nbloodiest battles in the Western Theater. In an effort to protect the \ncity, Southern forces built a series of earthworks and fortifications, \nmany of which remain, at least for now, in pristine condition. \nUnfortunately, the National Park Service in its Profiles of America's \nMost Threatened Civil War Battlefields, concluded that many of the \nsites associated with the siege of Corinth are threatened.\n  S. 1117 would give Corinth its proper place in American history by \nformally linking the city's battlefield sites with the Shiloh National \nMilitary Park.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Robb, Cochran, and Jeffords \nfor cosponsoring this measure.\n  I would also like to express my appreciation to Chairman Thomas for \nhis ever vigilant efforts on parks legislation, and in particular, for \nmoving both the Vicksburg Campaign Trail and Corinth battlefield bills \nforward.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to recognize Chairman \nMurkowski for his continued stewardship over the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee.\n  Mr. President, I also want to recognize Ken P'Pool, Deputy State \nHistoric Preservation Officer for Mississippi; Rosemary Williams, \nChairman of the Siege and Battle of Corinth Commission; John Sullivan, \nPresident of the Friends of the Vicksburg Campaign and Historic Trail; \nand Terry Winschel and Woody Harrell of the United States Park Service \nfor their support and guidance on these important preservation \nmeasures.\n  Lastly, I would like to recognize several staff members including \nRandy Turner, Jim O'Toole, and Andrew Lundquist from the Senate Energy\n\n[[Page S15009]]\n\nCommittee, Darcie Tomasallo from Senate Legislative Counsel, and Stan \nHarris, Angel Campbell, Steven Wall, Jim Sartucci, and Steven Apicella \nfrom my office, for their efforts to preserve Mississippi's and \nAmerica's historic resources.\n  Mr. President, as a result of the Senate's action today, our children \nwill be better able to understand and appreciate the full historic, \nsocial, cultural, and economic impact of the Vicksburg Campaign Trail \nand the Siege and Battle of Corinth.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to ask my colleagues to join \nSenator Jeffords and me in supporting the enactment of the pending bill \nwhich clarifies the status of church welfare plans under state \ninsurance law. These plans provide health and other benefits to \nministers and lay workers at churches and church-controlled \ninstitutions. It is estimated that more than 1 million individuals rely \non these programs for their health benefits.\n  Today, the status of these programs under state insurance laws is \nuncertain. This legislation merely provides that church welfare plans \nare not engaged in the business of insurance for purposes of state \ninsurance laws that relate to licensing, solvency, or insolvency.\n  In addition, this legislation clarifies that a church plan is single \nemployer plan for purposes of applying state insurance laws. The \nlanguage in the bill is intended to eliminate concerns by network \nproviders and insurance companies about the legal status of a church \nplan under state insurance law. By enacting this legislation, networks \nand insurance companies otherwise doing business in a state will be \nable to offer to church plans the same services they offer to corporate \nbenefit programs.\n  Mr. President, I first became aware of the need for this legislation \nwhen I heard from Bishop Morris from my own state of Alabama. He \nexplained that too frequently church plans are denied access to network \nproviders that offer discounted rates. He also explained that from \ntime-to-time questions arise about the legal right of church plans to \nprovide coverage under state insurance law. He asked me to look into \nwhat I could do help clarify the legal status of health plans \nmaintained by churches and synagogues. It seemed like a reasonable \nrequest since Congress has authorized churches to maintain \ndenominational benefit programs. However, this is also a technical area \nof the law that involves constitutional issues of separation of church \nand state. It also involves technical issues regarding insurance and \nbenefit laws.\n  This legislation has been carefully crafted with the help of the \nchurch benefits community represented by the Church Alliance, a \ncoalition of more than 30 denominational benefit programs. While they \nmay differ on questions of theology, it is obvious that they are united \nin their efforts to serve those who serve their respective churches and \nsynagogues. I also want to commend the National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners for their assistance in helping to work out the \nlanguage of this bill. It is obvious that State Insurance Commissioners \nrespect the right of churches to maintain benefit programs that serve \nclergy and lay workers.\n  Mr. President, churches should be commended for the commitment they \nhave demonstrated, in some cases for more than a hundred years, to \noffer comprehensive benefit programs to their employees. These programs \nhave many unique design and structural features reflecting the fact \nthat they are maintained by denominations. As we consider health care \nlegislation in Congress, I believe that it is important for all of us \nto recognize these unique features and to be mindful of the important \nrole these church-maintained programs perform within their respective \nchurches.\n  In order to give my colleagues and the public a better understanding \nof this legislation, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \nof the bill appear immediately after my remarks.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of ministers, rabbis, and church lay workers \nacross this country who receive benefit coverage from church plans, I \nurge passage of this legislation.\n\n Clarification of Church Welfare Plan Status Under State Insurance Law\n\n       Section 1 provides a statement of purpose. This section \n     provides that the only purpose of this Act is to clarify the \n     status of church welfare plans under certain specified state \n     insurance law requirements and the status of a church welfare \n     plan as a plan sponsored by a single employer. This Act \n     clarified the status of church plans under state law. It also \n     addresses the problem of health insurance issuers refusing to \n     do business with church plans because of concern that church \n     plans could be classified as unlicensed entities.\n       Subsection 2(a) provides that a church welfare plan is \n     deemed to be sponsored by a single employer that does not \n     engage in the business of insurance for the purposes of state \n     insurance laws described in subsection (b). This subsection \n     permits network providers and insurance companies to \n     establish the same contractual relationships with a church \n     plan as they are allowed to establish with any single \n     employer plan covered under the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act (ERISA) in such state.\n       Subsection 2(b) describes state insurance laws that (1) \n     would require a church welfare plan or an entity that can \n     administer or fund such a plan (only to the extent that it \n     engages in such activity) to be licensed; or (2) relate to \n     solvency or insolvency (including participation in guaranty \n     funds and associations). For example, state insurance laws \n     that impose reserve requirements or require posting of \n     security would be described in this subsection. Similarly the \n     plan is deemed to satisfy the licensing requirements of state \n     insurance law.\n       Subsection 2(c)(1) defines the term ``church plan.''\n       Subsection 2(c)(2) defines the term ``reimburses costs from \n     general church assets.'' The affect of this definition is to \n     provide that church welfare plans are not engaging in the \n     business of insurance for certain state insurance law \n     provisions otherwise described in this subsection 2(b).\n       Subsection 2(c)(3) defines the term ``welfare plan.'' This \n     subsection clarifies that the term ``welfare plan'' only \n     includes church plans and does not include HMOs, health \n     insurance issuers and other entities doing business with \n     church plans or organizations sponsoring or maintaining the \n     plan.\n       Subsection 2(d) provides that while the Act exempts church \n     welfare plans from state licensing requirements, states \n     preserve authority to enforce state insurance law provisions \n     that remain applicable to church plans. This subsection deems \n     welfare plans to be licensed for purposes of all other \n     insurance laws not specifically excluded in subsection 2(b). \n     This subsection is necessary because under some state \n     insurance laws, only entities that are actually licensed can \n     be subject to enforcement action under any provision of such \n     law.\n       Subsection 2(e) provides that while subsections (a) and (b) \n     deem that a church plan reimburses costs or provides \n     insurance from general church assets for the purpose of \n     determining its status under certain state insurance laws, \n     the rights of plan participants and beneficiaries, including \n     those who actually make plan contributions, are not otherwise \n     affected by the application of section 2.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nnewspaper article appear in the Record following my statement on H.R. \n1180, Work Incentives/Tax Extenders Conference Report.\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 12, 1999]\n\n                   A Budget Too Flush To Fight About\n\n                          (By Alice M. Rivlin)\n\n       Washington--The United States political system, arguably \n     the most effective in the world, has an uncanny penchant for \n     making its successes look like failures. The wrangling now \n     going on in Washington over the federal budget is an ugly, \n     confusing spectacle--long on finger-pointing and gotcha \n     moves, short on conciliation and statesmanship. As the \n     vetoes, gimmickry and accusations of ``raiding Social \n     Security'' fly up and down Pennsylvania Avenue, it is hard to \n     remember that the battle is over marginal adjustments in an \n     increasingly responsible fiscal policy.\n       The federal budget is already in substantial surplus--\n     revenues exceeded expenditures by about $120 billion in the \n     fiscal year 1999, which would have seemed like a miracle only \n     a few years ago--and the public, polls indicate, is pushing \n     politicians to raise the bar. The new goal, harder but \n     entirely appropriate, is an even bigger surplus, sufficient \n     to reduce the debt and help the economy prepare for the rapid \n     aging of the population.\n       Acrimony over small changes in a successfully balanced \n     budget is a welcome change from the 1980's, when there was so \n     much more to be acrimonious about. The huge deficits of that \n     decade were clear evidence of policy failure.\n       The stunning success of this decade began when President \n     George Bush and the leaders of Congress hammered out an \n     agreement in 1990 that raised some taxes and set explicit \n     caps on future discretionary spending. The effect was not \n     immediately apparent because the recession the next year cut \n     revenues, but the ground-work for a falling deficit had been \n     laid.\n       The goal of President Clinton's budget plan in 1993, \n     extended the caps and raised some taxes, was to cut the \n     deficit in half in four years. The deficit for the fiscal \n     year 1992 was $290 billion--a $50 billion surplus in Social \n     Security, offset by a $340 billion deficit in the rest of the \n     budget. No one thought that\n\n[[Page S15010]]\n\n     getting to overall balance was a goal realistic enough to \n     talk about, let alone reaching balance without counting the \n     Social Security surplus.\n       But now that the overall budget has been balanced for two \n     years, it's time to follow the public's leaning and adopt the \n     more ambitious objective of balancing the budget without \n     counting the Social Security surplus.\n       Paradoxically, although this raising of the bar is highly \n     desirable, the reasons have little to do with Social \n     Security.\n       Two or three decades from now, we will have a much higher \n     ratio of retirees to workers, and the standard of living of \n     both groups will depend on making the economy grow faster, so \n     more goods and services are available to be consumed by \n     everyone. Running a larger government surplus would help the \n     economy grow. It would reduce the national debt, put downward \n     pressure on interest rates and encourage new investment.\n       It doesn't matter much whether the surplus is in the Social \n     Security fund or the rest of the budget; it is the debt \n     reduction that helps the economy grow. Explaining the raising \n     of the bar as ``not spending the Social Security surplus'' is \n     a convenient way of suggesting a connection between the aging \n     of the population and the need for growth. But the current \n     budget debate does not affect the status of the Social \n     Security fund or the rights of beneficiaries in any way. \n     That's a debate for another (post-election) day.\n       If political discourse were more civil, Congress and the \n     president would have settled their differences over the \n     fiscal year 2000 budget long before now, probably by enacting \n     modest increases in the spending caps and celebrating the \n     fact that the surplus is larger than anyone expected. Then \n     they would have gone on to explain why an even bigger surplus \n     would be a good thing for future growth.\n       A growing surplus can only be achieved by restraining \n     spending growth and avoiding a major tax cut. A tax cut would \n     hurt prospects for economic growth by encouraging more \n     consumer spending and forcing the Federal Reserve to raise \n     interest rates to avoid inflation.\n       With any luck, the new budget will be wrapped up in a few \n     days and Congress will go on to other business. The public \n     will breathe a small sigh of relief but will not realize that \n     it ought to be celebrating.\n       The good news is that the budget surplus is growing, no \n     significant tax cut is being considered, and politicians are \n     beginning to notice that the public wants them to act \n     responsibly for the long term and reduce the federal debt.\n       That's a lot of good news. It's a shame the process is so \n     ugly.\n\n\n                          noaa vessel rainier\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, during the last month of negotiations on \nthe FY00 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations conference report, \nthere has been much discussion between the Alaska delegation and \nCommerce Department officials regarding where to homeport the Rainier. \nThe Rainier is one of four hydrographic survey vessels currently \nhomeported in Seattle. However, the Rainier spends nearly all of its \ntime performing hydrographic surveys in Southeast Alaska, where the \nneed for hydrographic surveys is great. Substantial amounts of time and \nmoney are wasted every time the Rainier transits the 650 miles between \nSeattle and Southeast Alaska.\n  Alaska has more than half of the United States' coastline, and no \nState is more dependent on marine transportation. Nonetheless, most of \nsoutheast Alaska lacks adequate hydrographic surveys. In fact, more \nthan half of NOAA's critical backlog of survey areas is in Alaska. Much \nof that backlog is in southeast Alaska, where three cruise ships ran \naground this summer. These ships ran aground in critical backlog areas \nand other areas that are literally not on the map. New coastline opens \nup every time a receding glacier creates a new inlet, giving vessels \naccess to totally uncharted waters.\n  Chairman Young of the House Resources Committee met personally with \nCommerce Secretary Daley on this issue recently. The Secretary agreed \nthat Alaska was an appropriate home for the Rainier. The city of \nKetchikan has offered to make space available for the Rainier and to \nprovide $300,000 cash to offset the one-time cost of the move. Moving \nthis vessel to Ketchikan makes good fiscal sense and good policy sense. \nI urge the Secretary to relocate the Rainier to Ketchikan at once.\n\n\n                         pacific salmon treaty\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, I would like to explain the provisions relating to Pacific \nsalmon and the Pacific Salmon Treaty included in the conference report \nfor the fiscal year 2000 Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations bill. \nThe conference report provides funding to implement the 1999 Pacific \nSalmon Treaty Agreement between the United States and Canada and for \nPacific coastal salmon recovery efforts in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, \nand California. Section 623 of the conference report authorizes this \nfunding and addresses other issues which are critical to the success of \nthe 1999 Pacific Salmon Treaty Agreement.\n  Section 623(a) establishes the Northern Boundary and Transboundary \nRivers Restoration and Enhancement Fund and the Southern Boundary \nRestoration and Enhancement Fund. The 1999 Agreement requires the \nUnited States to capitalize these two funds at $75,000,000 and \n$65,000,000, respectively, over the next 4 years. Interest earned from \nthese funds will be spent each year to develop better information to \nsupport resource management, to rehabilitate and restore marine and \nfreshwater habitat, and to enhance wild stock production. This \ninvestment will complement a C$400,000,000 Canadian investment in \nhabitat restoration and license buyback programs.\n  Each fund will be managed by a bilateral committee of three United \nStates and three Canadian representatives. Appropriately, the three \nUnited States representatives on the Northern Fund Committee are \nAlaskans: Alaska's Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner to the Pacific \nSalmon Commission and the Regional Administrator of the Alaska Region \nof the National Marine Fisheries Service. Likewise, the three United \nStates representatives on the Southern Fund Committee are from the \nLower 48: one representative of the States of Washington and Oregon; \none representative of the treaty Indian tribes; and the Regional \nAdministrator of the Northwest Region of the National Marine Fisheries \nService. I expect that the Northern Fund Committee will consult with \nthe Northern Panel of the Pacific Salmon Commission on funding \nproposals prior to making its decisions. Likewise, the Southern Fund \nCommittee should consult with the Southern Panel.\n  Section 623(b) implements the 1999 Agreement by addressing several \nconditions to that agreement. First, it provides that the $20,000,000 \nappropriated to capitalize the Northern Fund and the Southern Fund will \nnot be made available until two events occur. First, the parties to the \nBoldt-related litigation must be sign and file stipulations staying \nthat litigation for the duration of the 1999 Agreement. Second, the \nSecretary of Commerce must determine that the conduct of Alaska's \nfisheries under the 1999 Agreement, without further clarification or \nmodification of the management regimes contained in the 1999 Agreement, \ndo not cause jeopardy to salmon species listed under the Endangered \nSpecies Act. If the Secretary of Commerce requires alterations, \nmodifications, or any other changes to the fishery management regimes \ncontained in the Treaty, this condition is not satisfied.\n  The 1999 Agreement is expressly conditioned on both of these \nrequirements being met. The document titled ``Understanding of United \nStates Negotiators,'' signed June 22, 1999, by eight United States \nnegotiators, describes the stipulations to be filed, extended, or \notherwise addressed for the duration of the 1999 Agreement. Similarly, \nthe transmittal letter which accompanied the 1999 Agreement, signed \nJune 23, 1999 by the Chief Negotiators for the United States and \nCanada, states that the 1999 agreement is conditioned on whether the \nconduct of Alaska's fisheries under the Treaty violates the Endangered \nSpecies Act. It is important to note that Congress has every reason to \nbelieve Alaska's fisheries do not cause jeopardy to listed salmon \nstocks. Alaska's fisheries operated under a ``no jeopardy'' finding \nbefore our fishermen gave up 25 percent of their Chinook catch in order \nto get a deal on the 1999 Agreement. To address process concerns, this \nsubsection requires the parties to request that the court enter the \nstipulations before the end of the year, and that the court enter the \nstipulations by March 1, 2000.\n  Sections 623(b)(3) and 623(b)(4) specify conditions under which the \nSecretary of Commerce may ``initiate or reinitiate'' consultation on \nAlaska Fisheries under the Endangered Species Act. Subsections (b)(3) \nand (b)(4) address any consultation on Alaska fisheries which is \ncommenced after the initial consultation required in subsection (b)(1). \nBy using the words ``initiate or\n\n[[Page S15011]]\n\nreinitiate,'' Congress has addressed both those species which are \ncurrently listed under the Endangered Species Act as well as any \nspecies listed under ESA in the future. Therefore, before the Secretary \nof Commerce may initiate consultation on any listed species, including \nany species listed after this Act has passed, and before the Secretary \nmay reinitiate a previously conducted consultation, the conditions in \nsubsections (b)(3) and (b)(4) of section 623 must be met.\n\n  Section 623(b)(3) requires the Secretary of Commerce to issue a \njeopardy determination on Southern United States fisheries before he \nmay initiate or reinitiate consultation on Alaska fisheries. Section \n623(b) defines Southern United States fisheries as the directed Pacific \nsalmon fisheries in Washington, Oregon, and the Snake River basin of \nIdaho that are subject to the Pacific Salmon Treaty. Subsection (b)(3) \nwill also require the Secretary to develop the maximum sustainable \nyield (MSY) data or other escapement data necessary to make such a \ndetermination. The Secretary should work with the Pacific Salmon \nCommission to develop this information.\n  Section 623(b)(4) requires the Secretary of Commerce to provide the \nPacific Salmon Commission a reasonable opportunity to implement the \n1999 Agreement including, if necessary, the weak stock provisions in \nthe 1999 Agreement, and to make a determination that the 1999 Agreement \nwill not meet MSY goals before he may initiate or reinitiate \nconsultation on Alaska fisheries under ESA. The phrase ``reasonable \nopportunity'' is intended to provide sufficient time for the 1999 \nAgreement to work. If the Pacific Salmon Commission implements the weak \nstock provisions, the phrase ``reasonable opportunity'' is intended to \nprovide sufficient time for the weak stock provisions to work as well. \nA reasonable opportunity will encompass several life cycles of the \nsalmon under consideration.\n  Subsection (b)(4) purposefully adopts the recovery standard contained \nin the Pacific Salmon Treaty. This standard requires that the weak \nstock provisions return escapements as expeditiously as possible to \nmaximum sustainable yield or other biologically-based escapement \nobjectives agreed to by the Pacific Salmon Commission. This subsection \nrecognizes that conservation is the foremost tenet of the Pacific \nSalmon Treaty. The Treaty also recognizes the importance of the salmon \nfisheries to the social, cultural, and economic well-being of the West \nCoast. Therefore, the Treaty seeks to satisfy its conservation \nobjective with minimum disruption to the commercial, tribal, and sport \nfisheries. Recognizing these, objectives, the determination of whether \nescapement objectives have been met as expeditiously as possible must \nbe made over a reasonable period of time, likely encompassing several \nlife cycles of the salmon species under consideration.\n  The most important feature of this law is that it requires the \nSecretary to delay the enforcement of the Endangered Species Act until \nthe Pacific Salmon Commission has an opportunity to implement the \nTreaty and, if necessary, the weak stock provisions of the Treaty. This \nlater-enacted law relieves the Secretary of his duty to apply the \nEndangered Species Act during the time the Commission is implementing \nthe Treaty and the weak stock provisions. This is important because the \nCommission is better able to recover weak stocks using the Treaty than \nis the Secretary using the Endangered Species Act. The Commission can \nrequire harvest restrictions in Canada, where up to half of the \ncoastwide Chinook harvest is caught. Unlike the Pacific Salmon Treaty, \nthe Endangered Species Act does not apply in Canada. Subsection (b)(4) \nrecognizes the important role the Pacific Salmon Commission should play \nin the recovery of weak stocks by ensuring that the Commission has the \nopportunity to fully implement the weak stock provisions of the Pacific \nSalmon Treaty.\n  Section 623(c) makes needed changes to the voting structure of the \nPacific Salmon Commission. The Pacific Salmon Treaty Act of 1985 \nrequired the three voting United States Commissioners to reach \nunanimous agreement before making a decision on behalf of the United \nStates. This requirement was put in place without knowing how \ndisruptive it would prove to subsequent negotiations. In practice, it \nhas allowed Canadian negotiators to leverage northern and southern U.S. \ninterest against each other. Subsection (c) prevents this unintended \nconsequence by providing that the southern U.S. interests represent the \nUnited States on southern fisheries and Alaska represents the United \nStates on northern fisheries. In fact, the 1999 Agreement itself did \nnot take shape until Alaska and Canada were able to negotiate northern \nfisheries issues without interference from southern interests. Chinook \nsalmon, which can migrate through northern and southern jurisdictions, \nare exempt from this provision.\n  Section 623(d) authorizes $20,000,000 total to capitalize the \nNorthern Fund and the Southern Fund. To meet a condition of the 1999 \nAgreement, these amounts will not be released until stipulations have \nbeen signed and court orders requested in certain litigation involving \nthe application of tribal fishing rights. Subsection (d) also \nauthorizes $58,000,000 for salmon recovery efforts in Alaska, \nWashington, Oregon, and California. Amounts appropriated to the four \nStates are subject to a 25 percent non-federal match requirement. \nStates may meet this requirement with cash or other in-kind \ncontributions supported by existing state funding.\n  I understand Washington State and Oregon will use their shares of \nthis funding to address the significant habitat issues they face in \nthose States. Alaska has neither enjoyed the benefits nor suffered the \nconsequence of extensive development inside its borders, although some \nwould say that we have suffered the consequences of development \nelsewhere through the harvest restrictions our fishermen have endured \nover the years. I expect that in addition to habitat restoration, \nAlaska will participate in other programs consistent with Treaty \nimplementation, such as marketing initiatives. Alaska also has the \nauthority to participate in salmon initiatives in other States and on \ntribal, lands. Many of the tribes will likely use their funding to \nparticipate in demonstration projects on supplementation including the \nuse of Mitchell Act hatcheries to increase production of wild stocks. A \nclose analysis of NMFS's artificial propagation policy may lead to \ndifferent policies which help meet the recovery goals outlined in the \nPacific Salmon Treaty. I look forward to the results of the States and \ntribal efforts.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one of the bills that will pass today as \npart of an Energy and Natural Resources Committee package is S. 769, \nwhich provides a final settlement on certain debts owed by the city of \nDickinson, North Dakota to the Bureau of Reclamation. The legislation, \nwhich was introduced by Senator Kent Conrad and myself, is virtually \nidentical to that introduced during the last Congress.\n  The Dickinson Dam Bascule Gates Settlement Act (S. 769) will afford \nlong overdue relief to the citizens of Dickinson. Let me briefly \nexplain why the debt liquidation is needed and appropriate. For one \nthing, the Bureau of Reclamation built a faulty project. The debt was \nincurred by the city of Dickinson for construction of a dam with gate \nstructures which never worked properly. In addition, the need for the \nbascule gates as regulating structures to help provide a reliable local \nwater supply was eclipsed by the construction of the Southwest \nPipeline. The pipeline is part of the Garrison Diversion Project which \nis managed by the same Bureau of Reclamation.\n  Consequently, it makes no sense for the city of Dickinson to have two \nwater supply systems when it needs only one--especially when the first \nsystem was a faulty one. The city has already repaid more than $1.2 \nmillion for the bascule gates, even though they now provide virtually \nno benefit to the city.\n  The legislation itself is actually quite simple. It would permit the \nSecretary of the Interior to accept one final payment of $300,000 from \nthe city of Dickinson in place of a series of payments, totaling about \n$1.5 million, required by city's current repayment contract. The final \npayment may be adjusted for payments made after June 2, 1998.\n  The bill also clarifies that the city of Dickinson will be \nresponsible for up to\n\n[[Page S15012]]\n\n$15,000 in annual operation and maintenance (O) costs. This amount \nrepresents the average costs for O on the gate structures over the \npast 15 years. The bill as introduced was not explicit on this point \nand Senator Conrad and I have worked with the Energy Committee on an \namendment that is part of the reported bill.\n  I want to thank Chairman Frank Murkowski, Ranking Member Jeff \nBingaman, Subcommittee Chairman Gordon Smith, and their staffs for \ntheir cooperation and assistance. I also want to underscore the \nleadership of Senator Conrad in developing this legislation and the \nexcellent work of his Deputy Legislative Director, Kirk Johnson. May I \nalso commend Dickinson Mayor Fred Gengler and City Administrator Greg \nSund for their help and persistence in seeking a fair resolution to \nthis matter.\n\n\n                       TECHNICAL EDIT TO H.R. 486\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as the prime sponsor of S. 1547, the Senate \ncompanion bill to H.R. 486, I would like to make remarks on a technical \nedit to H.R. 486. I believe Sec. 3(f)(1) of Sec. 5008 needs some \nclarification. Subsection (1)(D) states very clearly that the \n``Commission shall act to preserve the contours of low-power television \nlicensees pending the final resolution of a class A application.'' The \nCommission's function to preserve the protected contours is very clear. \nBut creating separate subsections for the certification and application \nprocesses may have created some uncertainty regarding the timing of \nwhen the Commission should begin to provide this protection. I want to \nassure my colleagues that I agree with the prime sponsors of H.R. 486 \nthat the front-end certification process is an integral first step in \nthe application process. It is clearly our intent that as soon as the \nCommission is in receipt of an acceptable certification notice, it \nshould protect the contours of this station until final resolution of \nthat application. Of course, this provision does not exempt licensees \nfrom other provision of this act.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, for those who may wonder why H.R. 3427, \nwhich was deemed enacted as a separate law in H.R. 3194, the D.C. \nAppropriations bill is called the ``Admiral James W. Nance and Meg \nDonovan Foreign Relations Authorization Act for 2000 and 2001,'' it is \nbecause of our love, affection and respect for Admiral Bud Nance and \nMeg Donovan.\n  Bud Nance was Chief of Staff of the Foreign Relations Committee until \nhe passed away on May 11.\n  Bud served his country his entire adult life--as an ensign aboard the \nUSS North Carolina in the Pacific Theater during World War II and later \nas a test pilot and fighter pilot. Among his many honors, he earned two \nDistinguished Service Medals and capped off his distinguished 38-year \nnavy career as skipper of the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal.\n  Bud went on to serve as President Ronald Reagan's Deputy National \nSecurity Advisor. And at my request in 1991 Bud became minority staff \ndirector for the Foreign Relations Committee. From January 1995 until \nhis passing in May, he served as Chief of Staff for the majority. Bud \nrefused to take the job until I agreed that he would not take a \npaycheck. Bud said that his country had been good to him and this was \nhow he could give something back to his country.\n  Bud was my lifelong friend. We were born two months apart, two blocks \napart in the little town of Monroe, North Carolina. I miss my friend; \nit was a blessing to know him.\n  I am pleased that the House and the Senate agreed to recognize Bud \nand his influence on this bill, which was the last bill on which he had \nthe opportunity to work. In addition, Meg Donovan has been added to the \nbill's name. I know Bud would have been honored to share this bill with \nMeg for whom he had a deep affection.\n  Like Bud, Meg Donovan, who died at age 47 of cancer last October, had \nspent much of her life in government service and international affairs. \nShe served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs at \nthe State Department at the time of her death, and before that was a \nlongtime House International Relations Committee staff member.\n  Meg worked closely with the Senate on the confirmation of key foreign \naffairs nominations, including those of Secretary of State Warren \nChristopher, and later, Madeleine K. Albright. In the Congress, she \nworked primarily on issues dealing with political and religious \ndissidents, minorities and other persecuted groups, including Tibetans, \nSoviet Jews and women.\n  Both Bud and Meg are missed by the staffs of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and the House International Relations Committee, \nand by me and countless others, all of whom are pleased that this \nlegislation bears the names of these two fine Americans.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe extension of the Northeast Dairy Compact. I also wish to commend my \ncolleagues from New England for all of their hard work on this issue. \nSenators Jeffords, Specter, Leahy, and others all have worked \ndiligently to protect the dairy farmers in our region. I thank them for \ntheir efforts.\n  As my colleagues know, the Northeast Dairy Compact was approved by \nCongress in 1996 as a part of the Freedom to Farm bill. It was \nimplemented after the Secretary of Agriculture found that there was a \n``compelling public interest'' for its creation.\n  A state-generated response to the decline in the New England dairy \nindustry over the last decade, the Dairy Compact has preserved local \nmilk supplies for the Northeast. In 1978, there were 6,439 dairy farms \nin New England. By 1992, the number of dairy farms fell to 3,974. \nDuring this same time, the number of dairy farms in my home state fell \nfrom 93 to 41--a 60 percent decrease. As I stand here today, there are \nonly 30 dairy farms remaining. 93 to 30. This certainly is an alarming \nnumber.\n  Why is this alarming? Dairy farms are the essence of New England--\nindependent and hard working--the very symbol of our region. They are \nnot in far away rural areas such as those in other parts of the \ncountry. Most are close to fast growing areas which are ripe for \ndevelopment. It would be very easy for any one of our local dairy \nfarmers to sell their land to area developers and settle for an easier \nlifestyle.\n  In New England, we value the contributions of our dairy farmers. As \nareas feel the pressure of population growth, and the resulting stress \non the environment, it becomes more and more important to support dairy \nfarming and the benefits we all reap from their existence. We do not \nwant to see them disappear. To have them extinguished from the New \nEngland countryside would be the equivalent of the Liberty Bell leaving \nPennsylvania, the Statue of Liberty leaving New York, and Mount \nRushmore being torn down for townhomes in South Dakota.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact works. It is only fitting that we are \nhere today to extend its existence. To do otherwise would jeopardize \nthe progress that has been made to preserve our lands and the farming \neconomy in New England.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for their attention, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'd like to commend the efforts of those of \nmy colleagues who joined in the effort to make an important change to \nthe Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999. As initially \ndrafted, the conference report on H.R. 1554 caused many of us great \nconcern because it included two provisions which could have \ndiscriminated against Internet and broadband service providers by \nexpressly and permanently excluding any ``online digital communication \nservice'' from retransmitting a television signal or other audiovisual \nwork pursuant to a compulsory or statutory license. Like many of my \ncolleagues, I was deeply concerned that in the race to adjourn, \nCongress would neglect to fix these potentially damaging provisions.\n  Under the agreement which has been reached on this bill, these \nprovisions have been deleted. This was the right thing to do: these two \nprovisions had been added to the conference report late in the process, \nafter agreement had been reached on the fundamental parameters of the \nbill, and without any public debate. Now that the provisions have been \nremoved, the committees of jurisdiction will have an opportunity to \nconsider the proper application of the compulsory and statutory \nlicensing\n\n[[Page S15013]]\n\nprovisions of the Copyright Act to Internet and broadband service \nproviders.\n  Given the enormous importance of the Internet for enhancing consumer \naccess to programming, it is essential that Congress give full \nattention to this issue early next year. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to ensure that we take steps to further enhance the range \nof choices consumers have in the marketplace.\n  I also wanted to take a moment to commend Senator Baucus and others \nfor their efforts in securing an agreement to address the problems that \nsmall-market and rural areas now face in obtaining satellite broadcasts \nof their local television stations. By my estimates, the only market in \nVirginia that will get local-into-local service with the current bill \nis the metropolitan D.C. area, leaving over 94% of satellite households \nin my state without this crucial service. All Virginians, however, and, \nindeed, all Americans, deserve quality local satellite service, and I \nintend to make this issue a top priority when Congress returns next \nyear.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate passed the Intellectual \nProperty and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999. This bill makes \nmany needed and timely reforms to the Satellite Home Viewer Act which \noriginally passed almost 12 years ago. I have said for many months I \nbelieved this was a measure that Congress should enact before \nadjourning this year, and am pleased that we have been able to move \nforward on this important piece of legislation.\n  For a number of years, great strides have been made by providers of \ndirect broadcast satellite to compete for customers with cable, the \ntraditional provider of multichannel video services. Congress \nrecognized this marketplace development and the necessity to update the \nrules of the road to advance such competition.\n  Satellite television providers have a unique product to offer, and \nmore and more consumers are opting for television via satellite, \nincluding my own son Chet. During a visit in his home, I learned \nfirsthand just what this debate is all about. So I disagree with those \nwho say this is just a broadcaster bill or this is just a satellite \nbill. Clearly, both sides had to compromise, and the end result is one \nthat is fair to the various industry segments.\n  As always, when dealing with such contentious issues in the \nlegislative process as were confronted in this measure, the competing \ninterests of several parties had to be balanced. A number of \ncompromises were reached, and the bill considered by the full Senate \ntoday will be good for consumers and good for competition.\n  This bill allows, for the first time ever, satellite providers to \noffer local signals in local markets. Consumers value their local \nsignals. They want to see their local news, their local weather, their \nlocal sports. Promoting localism was a goal of the conferees, while at \nthe same time giving the satellite industry the tools it needed to grow \nits business. This provision will go a long way toward freeing \nsatellite providers to compete head-on with cable for customers who \nwant their local signals, or to provide service in many areas where \ncable is not even an available option.\n  This measure will not only boost competition in the multichannel \nvideo marketplace, but will also ensure that consumers are not stranded \nin a catch-22, without service. I know many of my colleagues, myself \nincluded, heard from literally hundreds of thousands of constituents \nacross the country. Constituents who had, in good faith, subscribed to \nsatellite television. Constituents who were about to lose, or had \nalready lost, their distant network programming channels, through no \nfault of their own. S. 1948 includes a reasonable, balanced approach to \nrestore eligibility for many of these subscribers, while preventing \nfurther pending shut-offs.\n  Other consumer friendly provisions were adopted. An improved model to \nmore accurately predict eligibility to receive distant network signals \nfrom a satellite provider. Increased certainty in the waiver process \nwhen dealing with their local broadcasters.\n  I feel very strongly that consumers should not be put in a bind again \nby being sold a service, only to have it taken away.\n  The revised rules of the road will help level the playing field for \nthe direct broadcast satellite industry as well. Copyright rates are \nslashed. Existing satellite copyright compulsory licenses are extended \nfor 5 years. A 90-day waiting period to begin serving current cable \ncustomers who want to switch to satellite is eliminated. And the FCC \nwill be required to review the distant signal eligibility standard and \nrecommend improvements to Congress. The compromise also allows for a \nphase-in period for obtaining permission to bring local signals into \nmarkets, so that consumers and local stations benefit from local-into-\nlocal as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, the offering of local-into-local is an expensive \nundertaking. Many of my colleagues in Congress, particularly those who \nrepresent rural states, recognize that economics will drive local-into-\nlocal into larger, urban markets first. They wonder whether rural and \nsmall markets will receive this service.\n  While debating the merits of the overall bill, this legitimate \nconcern was raised. A concern that I share as well. I want my \nconstituents to be able to choose a satellite provider for television \nwithout having to sacrifice watching their local broadcast stations. \nThe largest designated market area in my home state of Mississippi is \nJackson, which ranks number 89 out of more than 200 designated market \nareas. Satellite providers have clearly indicated they are likely to \noffer this new service in the top 60 to 70 markets. This translates \ninto a lack of comparable choices for my constituents, and for millions \nof other Americans across the country. So this is an important issue \nthat deserves the attention of Congress.\n  From the beginning, Senator Burns has been the champion of the idea \nof a loan guarantee program to foster the development of systems to \ndeliver local-into-local in rural and small market areas. Although a \nnumber of Senators have stood up to talk about how important this \nprogram is for their respective states, it has been Senator Burns who \nhas stood firm and fought for this program.\n  It is Senator Burns who is responsible for establishing the process \nfor the full Senate to consider the loan guarantee proposal early next \nyear.\n  I also want to thank Senator Gramm, the distinguished Chairman of the \nSenate's Banking Committee, for his cooperation in moving this \nlegislation forward.\n  Based on my conversations with him and other Members, I was pleased \nthat a unanimous consent agreement was reached. This agreement requires \nthat a loan guarantee bill be reported to the Senate by March 30, 2000. \nIt is my intention to get this provision enacted into law soon \nthereafter.\n  Mr. President, I want to be clear. This unanimous consent agreement \ndoes not delay the implementation of the loan guarantee program. In \nfact, Senator Burns' proposal, if passed today, would still be subject \nto Fiscal Year 2001 appropriations anyway. So the earliest this program \ncould take effect under any scenario is in Fiscal Year 2001. The agreed \nupon schedule for consideration of the loan guarantee authorization is \nconsistent with the appropriations timetable.\n  So, I believe the right incentives are in place to timely act on this \nmatter when the Senate reconvenes next year. And I hope we can all work \ntogether, from both sides of the aisle. Without this kind of incentive, \nmillions of Americans could be left behind.\n  Mr. President, the participation of Members was integral in bringing \nthis bill to fruition. I want to commend Senator Hatch, Chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, for his leadership and determination to \ncomplete the Senate and House negotiations on this legislation. He \nworked diligently for weeks, dealing with major competing interests to \nachieve a balanced policy. Senator Hatch, Senator McCain, Chairman of \nthe Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, Congressman \nBliley, Chairman of the House Commerce Committee, and Congressman Hyde, \nChairman of the House Judiciary Committee, along with all of the other \nMembers of the conference, contributed greatly to the process, and I am \ngrateful to them for their service.\n  This bill would not have been completed without the dedicated efforts\n\n[[Page S15014]]\n\nand countless long hours of negotiation among staff. Their hard work is \nvery much appreciated, and I want to take a moment to recognize who \nthey are: Monica Azare, Ed Barron, Pete Belvin, Renee Bennett, Shawn \nBentley, Benjamin Cline, Tony Coe, Manus Cooney, Colin Crowell, Troy \nDow, Jon Dudas, Julian Epstein, Paula Ford, Doug Farry, Bob Foster, \nMitch Glazier, Jim Hippe, Tim Kurth, Jon Leibowitz, Peter Levitas, Andy \nLevin, Justin Lilley, Garry Malphrus, Maureen McLaughlin, Mark Monson, \nAnn Morton, Al Mottur, Mitch Rose, Jim Sartucci, Jonathan Schwantes, \nand Alison Vinson.\n  Mr. President, this bill is an improvement over the current state of \nplay in today's multichannel video marketplace. It is not perfect, but \nit is a positive step forward in advancing competition among industries \nand choice for consumers.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like briefly to address Section \n2002 of the Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act \nof 1999, which is an amendment to the Omnibus package, to clarify its \nmeaning with my colleague who drafted the provision.\n  There are a number of United States companies that have applied to \nthe FCC for licenses to operate non-geostationary satellite systems in \nthe so-called ``Ku-band.'' These firms are spending substantial amounts \nof private capital to develop satellite systems that will provide a \nhost of telecommunications services to benefit the public. The \nsatellite systems that have applied for licenses in the Ku-band are \ndesigned to operate globally on a primary basis, and already are \ntreated as primary users of the Ku-band in the International Table of \nFrequency Allocations.\n  Mr. President, I bring this up because section 2002(a) directs the \nFCC to consider issuing licenses, possibly in the same bands, for new \nterrestrial communications services that provide local television to \nrural areas. Section 2002(b)(2) provides that the FCC must ensure that \nany new licensees for local television in rural areas do not cause \nharmful interference to primary users of the spectrum, presumably the \nKu-band spectrum.\n  I want to clarify that Section 2002(b)(2) requires the FCC to prevent \nharmful interference not only with those who have been designated as \nprimary users on the date of enactment of this Act, but also with \nprospective primary users of the Ku-band. If the FCC were to \nmisinterpret this section, that is, if the FCC prevented only harmful \ninterference with those who are primary users on the date of enactment, \nthe public could be denied the substantial benefits of emerging \nsatellite technologies.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree with my colleague that the authors of this bill \ndid not mean to interfere with the expert technical and regulatory \njudgment of the FCC with respect to licensing applicants in the Ku-\nband. The term ``primary user'' in Section 2002 is intended to include \nprimary users, regardless of whether these users are primary on the \ndate of enactment or are later designated as primary. The provision in \nno way seeks to grant preferential regulatory treatment to terrestrial \nlicense applicants over satellite system applicants. While there \nappears to be an error in the report accompanying this legislation, \nwhich incorrectly states that the statute says that ``existing'' \nprimary users must be protected, clearly the statute does not contain \nthis qualifier, and it is our intent that the FCC protect primary \nusers, whether designated now, or later.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, on November 9, 1999, the House of \nRepresentatives overwhelmingly passed (411-8) the conference report on \nH.R. 1554, the Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform \nAct of 1999. Arriving at a conference report compromise was a long \nprocess. For months, conferees have been negotiating over these \nprovisions. The bill the Committee produced was a good bill, and that \nis underscored by the overwhelming, bipartisan support the final \nversion received.\n  However, the Senate will not act on this bill propr to adjourning for \nthe year. Instead, Congress will recess without passing the complete \nConference Committee version of H.R. 1554. In an attempt to achieve \nsome of the gains from this bill, a modified version of the Satellite \nHome Viewers Act will be attached to the final omnibus appropriations \nbill and passed by Congress. However, it will be absent one important \nprovision that would help ensure that rural citizens are not overlooked \nas they often are in other sectors.\n  The two major direct broadcast satellite (DBS) companies have stated \nto Congress that they will only serve the most popular markets with \nlocal broadcast channels once the statutory restriction prohibiting \nthis action is removed. An incentive needs to be there for businesses \nto develop this same service for households in second tier markets and \nrural areas as well. The conference report to H.R. 1554 would have \nprovided $1.25 billion in loan guarantees for satellite companies that \nseek to serve these often overlooked markets. It was an idea I strongly \nsupported because it would have encouraged development of this service \nin second tier and rural markets in Georgia and elsewhere in the \ncountry.\n  Instead, a single Senator demanded the removal of this provision \nbecause of procedural issues and because, at the end of a legislative \nsession it generally takes unanimous consent to expedite consideration \nof each measure, the bill presented to the Senate as part of the final \nappropriations bill reflects an acquiescence to this demand. To respond \nto those of us who supported the loan guarantee, the Chairman of the \nBanking Committee has promised to take up this provision and pass \nappropriate legislation by April 1, 2000. In the meantime, millions of \nsatellite viewers who live in middle and rural America will not have \nthe opportunity to view their local channels nor will they have the \nsolace in knowing such service will be coming soon. This is very \ndisappointing, and it is my sincere hope that the promise to act \nswiftly on the loan guarantees will be kept in an environment where \npromises and compacts are too often ignored.\n  As a member of the Commerce Committee, I have been closely following \nthis bill throughout the entire process. At the heart of this debate is \nviewers' access to local broadcast television. I say to my colleagues \nthat rural Americans deserve the same access to their local broadcast \nstations that urban and suburban DBS customers will soon enjoy. I will \nwork next year to ensure that this loan guarantee program is acted upon \nswiftly.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this conference report represents a \nfirst step in promoting satellite as a competitor to cable. The \nconference was presented with two bills which approached a number of \nthe major issues in very different ways. In order to reach an \nagreement, compromises were made. As a result, I believe consumers are \nbetter off with the passage of this bill, and satellite companies are \nnow in a better position to compete with cable companies.\n  A number of provisions in particular will improve and expand \nsatellite service to consumers. This conference report establishes a \nframework for satellite companies to deliver local network signals into \nlocal markets. This allows satellite consumers to receive their local \nnetwork stations by satellite. The satellite companies have indicated \nthat it is crucial that they are able to deliver local broadcast \nsignals to satellite consumers if they are to compete with cable. I \nhope going forward, satellite companies embrace this provision and \nprovide local signals to as many markets as possible, including those \nin rural areas.\n  In addition to these provisions, the conference report directs the \nFCC to establish a waiver process to allow satellite consumers who \ncannot receive their broadcast signals over an outdoor antenna, to \nobtain a waiver and be allowed to get distant network signals. This \nprovision establishes a uniform waiver process and ensures that a \nconsumer's request for a waiver will be addressed within 30 days. The \nconference report also requires the FCC to improve the accuracy of the \nmethodology used to predict which consumers cannot receive their \nbroadcast signals over the air, and therefore, can obtain distant \nnetwork signals by satellite. Language also has been placed in the bill \nto improve the negotiating position of the satellite companies in their \nnegotiations with broadcasters to obtain programming. Hopefully, this \nprovision\n\n[[Page S15015]]\n\nwill help satellite providers to obtain programming from broadcasters \non fair and reasonable terms, and ultimately, provide consumers with \nservice at a competitive price.\n  As noted previously, compromises were made. As the bill advanced \nthrough committee, I opposed the grandfathering of satellite customers \nwho had been illegally provided distant network signals. At that time, \nI stated that illegal activities should not be rewarded. Satellite \ncompanies should not benefit from a grandfather of illegally provided \ndistant broadcast signals to consumers. Nonetheless, the conference \ndecided to allow satellite consumers who can receive their local \nnetwork signals of Grade B intensity over an antenna, to continue to \nreceive distant network signals by satellite. It also allowed satellite \nconsumers who receive distant broadcast signals through big (C-band) \ndishes to continue receiving such service regardless of whether their \ndistant broadcast signals have been cut-off or have been scheduled to \nbe cut-off. In this bill, we have taken a number of steps to provide a \nbetter framework for the provision of satellite service. Therefore, I \nhope satellite companies will comply with the law going forward.\n  I expect the passage of this conference report will result in the \ndelivery of better satellite service to consumers, and ensure that \nsatellite companies can provide consumers with a competitively priced \noption to cable service.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, the so-called \n``patent reform'' act was placed in the Satellite Home Viewer Act in \nthe waning hours of the conference. Even though this bill did not clear \nthe Senate floor in regular order and never had a vote on the floor of \nthe Senate and was highly controversial for three years the proponents \nhad to resort to these tactics to secure passage. The Satellite Act was \nvery important and many Americans were relying on its passage so it \nprovided the leverage. This is an unfortunate development in this \nlegislative battle. Over the strenuous objections of several members, \nthe bill stayed in the conference report. The inventors never even got \na debate on the floor of the Senate. I think the entrepreneurs of \nAmerica deserve far better than this sort of treatment.\n  Special recognition should be given to the staff of the Alliance for \nAmerican Innovation for their hard work on behalf of American \nInventors, particularly Steven Shore and Beverly Selby. Also, \nCongresswoman Helen Bentley labored tirelessly on behalf of America's \ninventors, they deserve a great deal of recognition for their fight. As \ndoes Jim Morrison of the National Association of the Self Employed. \nThey won many victories in this battle and the proponents had to resort \nto these sorts of tactics to defeat them. It is unfortunate how this \nbill was handled, the American inventors deserved a debate and a vote--\nfor all that they do for America, they deserve better. We are going to \nbe watching carefully the impact of this bill on innovation in America.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, for the past several months I have served \nas a member of the House-Senate conference on H.R. 1554, the Satellite \nHome Viewer Improvement Act of 1999, which has been reported as a part \nof H.R. 3194, the District of Columbia Appropriations Act. The \nSatellite Home Viewer Improvement Act is a complicated and technical \nbill, but at its heart lies a simple premise--to protect interests of \nconsumers by allowing more choices in the market for television \nproviders. The conference agreement does this by allowing satellite \ncompanies the same opportunity to provide local signals that cable \nproviders currently enjoy--and this increased competition should lead \nto better prices and better services for consumers. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting the act.\n  As is to be expected in any complex piece of legislation, there were \na number of difficult issues, and many public policy goals to be \nconsidered. The most important of these public policy goals is to \nprotect the interests of consumers, and we needed to consider two \nfactors in that regard--enhancing consumer choice in television \nservice, and protecting the local television stations that so many rely \non for their news, traffic, weather and sports. Accordingly, the \nconference agreement features a number of compromises that aim to \nprotect both of these consumer interests.\n  Perhaps the best example of this is the so-called ``must carry'' \nprovision. This provision requires that if a multi-channel video \nprovider (for example cable, or satellite) is carrying any broadcast \nsignals in a given market, that provider must carry all broadcast \nsignals in a given market. This requirement protects local television \nstations by assuring that their signals will be carried, whether \nconsumers are purchasing satellite service or cable service. At first \nthis may limit the number of markets that satellite providers can \nreach, but as technology and satellite capacity increase we are \nconfident that satellite service, and the benefits of local signal \ncompetition, will reach more and more markets. This provision does not \ngo into effect until January 1, 2002, in order to give the satellite \ncompanies time to further develop their technology and improve their \nproduct for consumers.\n  In the meantime, this act offers a number of other benefits to \nconsumers. It sets the copyright rate for local signals at zero, and \ncuts the copyright rate for the so-called ``distant local signals'' by \nas much as 45 percent. It provides a ``grandfather'' clause for a large \ngroup of consumers already receiving satellite service, who might \notherwise be cut off by a federal court ruling. And it makes it easier \nfor consumers to determine what type of satellite service they are \neligible for, a process which in the past has been somewhat difficult.\n  As many of my colleagues have noted, this act may not completely cure \nthe competitive problems faced by consumers in the marketplace for \nvideo services. Certain provisions will require further action by the \nFederal Communications Commission and by Congress. But it is a good \nstep in the right direction. I believe the Satellite Home Viewer \nImprovement Act of 1999 will increase competition in these markets, and \nit will increase consumer choice. In the short run, and in the long \nrun, this act is good for competition, and good for consumers.\n\n\n           COMPULSORY LICENSING AND ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDERS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to explain to my colleagues an \nimportant change made to the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of \n1999, which was reintroduced as S. 1948 and included in the measure \nbefore us today. As my colleagues may know, I and other Senators had \nbeen very concerned that two sections of the legislation would unfairly \nhave discriminated against Internet service providers. Many of my \nconstituents were concerned that sections 1005(e) and 1011(c) of the \nlegislation would be interpreted by the courts or the Copyright Office \nto expressly and permanently exclude any ``online digital communication \nservice'' from retransmitting a transmission of a television program or \nother audiovisual work pursuant to a compulsory or statutory license \nunder the Copyright Act.\n  I am pleased to report that these potentially damaging provisions \nwere deleted from the bill before us. As my colleagues may know, these \nprovisions originally were inserted in conference, even though the \ncommittees of jurisdiction had never held hearings on them, had never \nreceived any record evidence as to their need, and had never considered \nthem in open debate. The committees of jurisdiction in the House and \nthe Senate will now have an opportunity to carefully consider the \napplication of the Copyright Act to the Internet and broadband service \nproviders.\n  As someone proud to represent most of the major Internet service \nproviders in the world. I have little doubt about the importance of the \nInternet and other online communications technologies for enhancing \nconsumer access to information and programming. Online technology has \ntransformed the way consumers receive information, including \naudiovisual works. It undoubtedly will bring other benefits, but only \nif Congress makes certain that it does not place unreasonable barriers \nin the way.\n  Because rapid technological changes are having an ever more \nsignificant impact on our economy, it is essential that the Congress \ngive full attention to this issue early next year.\n\n[[Page S15016]]\n\n            the intellectual property and communications act\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased that Sec. 2002 of S. 1948 \ndirects the Federal Communications Commission to expedite its review of \nlicense applications to deliver local television signals into all local \nmarkets. it's my understanding that the FCC has had applications \npending before it since January, which, if approved, would clear the \nway for nationwide deployment of an innovative digital terrestrial \nwireless system for multi-channel video programming. This new \ntechnology will benefit all Americans by providing robust competition \nto incumbent cable systems in Massachusetts and across the entire \nnation. Equally important, it will provide rural Americans with the \nsame access to local signals as their urban and suburban counterparts. \nUnder Sec. 2002(b)(2), the FCC shall ensure that licensees will not \ncause harmful interference to existing primary users of the spectrum. \nMoreover, the FCC, consistent with its mission to manage the spectrum \nin the public interest, will address, any coordination related to new \nusers of a particular band.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the American \nInventors Protection Act of 1999, which is incorporated into the \nSatellite Home Viewers Act Conference Committee Report. I am a Member \nof that Conference Committee. Ultimately, the Satellite Home Viewers \nAct Conference Committee Report will be included in this year's omnibus \nappropriations bill, the District of Columbia Appropriations Act of \n2000.\n  With regard to the American Inventors Protection Act, I am \nparticularly pleased with the Act's inclusion of the first inventor or \n``prior user'' defense, created by Subtitle C. Unfortunately, the fact \nthat this Act is being considered by the Senate in the closing days of \nthe legislative session has limited the Judiciary Committee's ability \nto include a complete legislative history on the Act. As a Member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, my intent is that this statement supplement \nthe Senate's legislative history with regard to Subtitle C of the \nAmerican Inventors Protection Act.\n  The prior user defense to patent infringement is of great importance \nto the financial services industry. For years, the financial services \nindustry developed ``back office'' methods and processes that are \nfundamental to the delivery of many financial services. The House \nJudiciary Committee Report refers to the breadth of the types of \nmethods and processes used by the financial services industry: ``These \nfinancial services may embody methods or processes incorporated into \nany number of systems including, but not limited to, trading, \ninvestment and liquidity management, securities custody and reporting, \nbalance reporting, funds transfer, ACH, ATM processing, on-line \nbanking, check processing and compliance and risk management. In each \nof these systems, multiple processing and method steps are acting upon \na customer's data without its knowledge.'' Minor changes in the bill \nsince it was reported by the House Judiciary Committee do not affect \nthe scope of methods to be considered under this Title.\n  Virtually no one in the industry believed that these methods or \nprocesses were patentable. Instead, the only legal protections believed \nto be available were those granted under trade secret laws. Last year, \nin State Street Bank & Trust Company v. Signature Financial Group, \nInc., the financial services industry was dealt a blow when the Court \nof Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that business methods can be \npatented. Early this year, the Supreme Court denied certiorari in that \ncase, making it official. After State Street, methods and processes \nthat were developed by the financial services industry years ago are \nsubject to patent. Some of these methods and processes are transparent \nto the end user of the services and can be ``reverse engineered'' and \nthen easily copied. A later user of the method can now patent a method \nor process that another inventor had developed and put into use first. \nThe actual inventor would then be prohibited from using his own \ninvention, or be required to pay royalties to the subsequent inventor.\n  This situation is clearly unfair. Fortunately, Subtitle C of the \nAmerican Inventors Protection Act partially corrects the unfortunate \nconsequences of the State Street decision by adding a new section to \nthe patent code establishing the ``prior user'' defense. Specifically, \nthis provides a defense to a claim of patent infringement where a \nperson has commercially used or made serious preparations to \ncommercially use a process that later becomes the subject matter of a \npatent issued to another. Under this subtitle, an ``internal commercial \nuse or arm's length commercial transfer of a useful end result'' \nincludes a method or process, the subject matter of which may be \ndirected to an information or data processing system providing a \nfinancial service, whether in the form of physical products, or in the \nform of services, or in the form of some useful results.\n\n  The term ``method'' should be interpreted broadly so that it includes \nany ``method of doing or conducting business,'' including a process. \nThe method that is the subject matter of the defense may be an internal \nmethod of doing business, a method used in the course of doing or \nconducting business, or a method for conducting business in the public \nmarketplace. It can be a method used in the design, formulation, \npreparation, application, testing, or manufacture of a product or \nservice. A method is any systematic way of accomplishing a particular \nbusiness goal. The defense should be applicable against patent \ninfringement claims regarding methods, and to claims involving machines \nor articles of manufacture used to practice such methods (if such \napparatus claims are included in the asserted patent). In the context \nof the financial services industry, methods would include financial \ninstruments (e.g., stocks, bonds, mutual funds), financial products \n(e.g., futures, derivatives, asset-backed securities), financial \ntransactions, the ordering of financial information, any system or \nprocess that transmits or transforms information with respect to \neventual investments or financial transactions, and any method or \nprocess listed as examples by the House Judiciary Committee in its \nreport.\n  Of course, the defense is not a general license; it extends only to \nthe specific subject matter claimed in the patent. A person asserting \nthe defense under this new section has the burden of establishing it by \nclear and convincing evidence. As used in this title ``person'' \nincludes each parent, subsidiary, affiliate, division, or other entity \nrelated to the holder of the defense when they are accused of \ninfringement of the relevant patent. If the defense is asserted by a \nperson who is ultimately found to infringe a patent, and subsequently \nfails to demonstrate a reasonable basis for asserting the defense, then \nthe court must award attorneys fees under section 285 of Title 35.\n  The first inventors defense is not available if a person has \nabandoned commercial use of the subject matter. In the context of this \nAct, abandonment means cessation of use with no intent to resume. In \nthe financial services industry, certain activities are naturally \nperiodic or cyclical. Intervals of non-use because of factors such as \nseasonal needs, or reasonable intervals between contracts, should not \nbe considered abandonment.\n  Mr. President, subtitle C strikes a balance between the rights of the \nlater inventor who obtains patent protection to enjoy his exclusive \nrights in the claimed subject matter, and the inherent fairness to the \nearlier user to continue to use its methods and processes to conduct \nand, even expand, its business. Thus, by creating a personal, prior \nuser defense, subtitle C would give the patent owner its statutory \npatent rights enforceable against all except the earlier inventor and \ncommercial user of common subject matter.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Satellite Home \nViewer Improvement Act of 1999 which is now included as part of this \nyear's Omnibus Appropriations Bill. Simply put, these changes in the \nlaw are long overdue.\n  It should come as no surprise that the final version of this \nlegislation is the product of compromise. Certainly, no one received \neverything they wanted. However, at the end of the day, everyone can \nwalk away and say they got something. That holds true for broadcasters, \nsatellite companies and, most importantly and to the greatest degree, \nconsumers.\n\n[[Page S15017]]\n\n  The single most important thing that this bill will do is ``level the \nplaying field'' so that satellite companies can better compete with \ncable. It does so by changing the anomaly in the law that prohibits \nsatellite companies from broadcasting local signals to local people, \nlowering the royalty rates paid by satellite companies and, among other \nthings, removing the unconscionable 90 day waiting period that a \nconsumer must endure before switching from cable to satellite service. \nWe also grant a six month ``grace period'' for ``local-into-local'' \nretransmission consent agreements. I am not so sure that this is quite \nthe ``Holy Grail'' for consumers that some believe it is; however, I \ndoubt the sky is going to fall down for the networks either.\n  To ensure that all local stations are carried and to keep the playing \nfield as level as possible, this legislation imposes full ``must \ncarry'' obligations by 2002 upon satellite providers, just as current \nlaw does on cable. That is, if a satellite company carries one local \nstation in a market, then it must carry all the local stations. Now, \nreasonable people can disagree about ``must carry''--the Supreme Court \nupheld its constitutionality by a slim 5-4 vote--but it is only fair to \napply it evenly to both cable and satellite companies.\n  This Conference Report also lays to rest many of the thorny disputes \nthat have served only to hurt consumers. Both the Senate and the House \nhave agreed to ``grandfather'' those consumers in the Grade B service \narea who currently receive ``distant network'' signals. To be sure, \nsome satellite companies have been bad actors in this debate and so \nhave some subscribers. Nonetheless, short of deposing each and every \nconsumer, it's best to put these problems behind us and start off on a \nclean slate. We expect that going forward the letter of the law will be \nadhered to and respected--heavy penalties await those who would do \notherwise, and rightfully so.\n  The matter of ``if and when'' a consumer should receive a waiver from \na local broadcaster currently resembles a Sherlock Holmes mystery. So \nwe order the FCC to draft ``consumer-friendly'' regulations to govern \nthe waiver process. Our bill tells local broadcasters that if they fail \nto act on waiver requests within 30 days, the request will be \n``deemed'' approved. We trust the FCC will improve and simplify this \nprocess even further.\n  Just as importantly, we ask the FCC to take a hard look at whether \nthe Grade B standard is sufficient to determine what a good picture is \nin today's world. The truth is that if there's a fairer standard out \nthere, then we should apply it. Rest assured, the Congress will get the \nlast bite at the apple by requiring the FCC to report back to Congress \nwith its findings, rather than allowing the Commission to ``self-\nexecute'' its new study.\n  Let me make one final point regarding one of the most difficult \nmatters in Conference: retransmission consent. The original House \nlanguage was predicated on the belief that there exists unequal \nbargaining positions between the broadcasters and the satellite \ncompanies. Our Senate bill took precisely the opposite approach. But \nour law comes out somewhere in the middle: it will prohibit exclusive \ndeals, ensure that parties negotiate in ``good faith'' when making \nthese agreements, and put some teeth into ``good faith'' by adding the \n``competitive marketplace considerations'' language.\n  That said, there may be some disagreement as to what exactly this new \nprovision means. At the very least, ``competitive marketplace \nconsiderations'' may simply be interpreted as the normal, everyday \njostling that takes place in the business world. At the very most, a \n``competitive marketplace'' would tolerate differences based upon \nlegitimate cost justifications, but not anti-competitive practices such \nas illegal tying and bundling. The answer probably lies somewhere \nbetween these two interpretations and we trust the sometimes confused \nFCC, as we often do, to properly divine the real intent of a somewhat \nconfused Congress.\n  Again, this isn't a perfect bill. Far from it. But we can't let the \nperfect be the enemy of the good. This measure will allow satellite \ncompanies to compete more aggressively with cable; it will provide more \nchoice for consumers; with luck, it may even discipline rising cable \nrates. So I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan, fair, and \ncomprehensive legislation that was the product of a great deal of hard \nwork and negotiation. We owe consumers no less than that.\n  Mr. President, one final note: I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the names of the Conference Committee staff to \nshow my appreciation for their hard work. They are to be commended for \nputting in the long hours it took to get this bill done.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 Conference Staff\n\n       Shawn Bentley, Senate Judiciary Committee--Senator Hatch\n       Troy Dow, Senate Judiciary Committee--Senator Hatch\n       Pete Belvin, Senate Commerce Committee--Senator McCain\n       Mitch Rose, Senator Stevens\n       Paula Ford, Senate Commerce Committee--Senator Hollings\n       Al Mottur, Senate Commerce Committee--Senator Hollings\n       Maureen McLaughlin, Senate Commerce Committee--Senator \n     McCain\n       Peter Levitas, Senate Judiciary Committee--Senator DeWine\n       Ed Barron, Senate Judiciary Committee--Senator Leahy\n       Jon Leibowitz, Senate Judiciary Committee--Senator Kohl\n       Jonathan Schwantes, Senate Judiciary Committee--Senator \n     Kohl\n       Jim Hippe, Senator Thurmond\n       Jim Sartucci, Senator Lott\n       Renee Bennett, Senator Lott\n       Justin Lilley, House Commerce Committee--Representative \n     Bliley\n       Ed Hearst, House Commerce Committee--Representative Bliley\n       Linda Bloss-Baum, House Commerce Committee--Representative \n     Bliley\n       Mitch Glazier, House Judiciary Committee--Representative \n     Hyde\n       Vince Garlock, House Judiciary Committee--Representative \n     Coble\n       Monica Azare, House Commerce Committee--Representative \n     Tauzin\n       Bob Foster, House Commerce Committee--Representative Oxley\n       Andy Levin, House Commerce Committee--Representative \n     Dingell\n       Colin Crowell, House Commerce Committee--Representative \n     Markey\n       Ann Morton, House Commerce Committee--Representative \n     Boucher\n       Ben Cline, House Judiciary Committee--Representative \n     Goodlatte\n       Garg Sampak, House Judiciary Committee--Representative \n     Conyers\n       Bari Schwartz, House Judiciary Committee--Representative \n     Berman\n       Tim Kurth, Office of the Speaker\n       Doug Farry, Office of the Majority Leader\n       Tony Coe, Senate Legislative Counsel\n       Steven Cope, House Legislative Counsel\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Appropriations conference report before \nus contains most of the text of the Conference Report accompanying H.R. \n1554, a reform of the Satellite Home Viewers Act. In addition to \nSatellite Home Viewers Improvement Act, this legislation contains two \nother major intellectual property bills, a major reform of the patent \nsystem and a bill to protect against the growing problem of \n``cybersquatting,'' whereby the valuable names of businesses and \nindividuals are registered by others in bad faith to either trade on \nthose names or damage their value. These three pieces of legislation \nare major reforms that help American consumers and American businesses. \nI will briefly discuss these reforms in turn.\n  As the Chairman of the Conference Committee and sponsor of the \noriginal Senate copyright legislation underlying the Satellite Home \nViewer Improvements Act, I am delighted that the conferees have been \nable to put together a comprehensive package of consumer-friendly \nreforms for satellite viewers. The bill reflects an enormous effort on \nthe part of members and their staffs on both sides of Congress from \nboth parties, and represents a major advance in copyright and \ncommunications law.\n  The world of video communication has changed enormously since \ntelevision began some 70 years ago in the small home workshop of \ninventor and Utah native Philo T. Farnsworth, who, together with his \nwife and colleagues, viewed the first television transmission: a single \nblack line that rotated from vertical to horizontal. At the risk of \noffending those who may disagree, I think TV programming has greatly \nimproved since the Farnsworths' rotating black line. Since that day in \nthe Farnsworths' workshop, television viewers have benefitted from \nsteady advances in technology that have brought increased access to an \never more diversified range\n\n[[Page S15018]]\n\nof programming choices. The television industry has progressed from one \nor two over-the-air broadcast stations, to a full range of broadcast \nnetworks delivering local and syndicated national programming, to cable \ntelevision delivering both broadcast and made-for-cable programming. \nAnd in the past decade, satellite carriers, delivering to customers \nwith both large and, increasingly, small dishes are emerging as new and \npotent competitors in the television delivery business.\n  The legislation before us today will--for the first time --allow \nsatellite carriers to provide local subscribers with their local \ntelevision signals. This means every television viewer in Utah can have \naccess to Utah news, weather, sports, and other locally-relevant \nprogramming, as well as national network programming. Emerging \ntechnology now makes this possible, and our bill will make it legal. \nThe bill also reduces the copyright fees that are passed along to \nsubscribers. As a result, eligible viewers in parts of Utah unserved by \nover-the-air television will enjoy access to network stations at lower \nprices.\n  Let me illustrate some of the benefits of this legislation for Utah \nand for Utahns. Similar benefits can accrue across the country if this \nlegislation is fully utilized. Many areas of Utah are unserved by over-\nthe-air television or even by cable systems. Satellite service has been \nthe only television option for many Utahns. Up until the passage of \nthis conference report, these Utahns were able to get network stations, \nbut usually from cities outside of Utah, such as New York or Los \nAngeles. And, those Utahns who had satellite dishes but lived in areas \nwhich did receive local television over-the-air could not legally get \nany network television programming using their satellite dishes, but \nhad to get them with an off-air antenna or by cable. Under the \nprovisions of this conference report, every Utahn will be able to get \nlocal network programming, which includes both national network shows \nlike ``ER'' and ``The X-Files'' and local news, weather, sports, and \npublic affairs programming. And those people who live in the so-called \n``white areas'' that are unserved by local television can get local \nprogramming from Salt Lake City, as well as keep their distant signals \nif they wish to. Making Utah information and entertainment available to \nall Utahns is a great benefit to us as a state, and helps bind us \ntogether as a community. And in 2002, the satellite carriers will be \nrequired to carry all the local television stations, just like cable. \nThis means that viewers will have the same range of local programming \nas they have come to expect from cable, and that the viewers, rather \nthan satellite carriers, will be able to choose which local stations to \nwatch.\n  Making local television signals available to all Utahns, and citizens \nof similar communities across the country, is the most important reason \nfor this legislation. But there are many other benefits to consumers: \ncopyright rates for satellite signals are cut almost in half, and the \nlocal signals are free. The Federal Communications Commission will work \nto ensure that eligibility decisions for distant network signals are \nclearer and prompter. Some satellite subscribers have expressed \nfrustration that they do not get prompt responses from local television \nstations to distant signal eligibility waiver requests, although the \nsituation is better in Utah than in some other places. To remedy the \nproblem, we included a provision that says if a subscriber asks a local \nstation for a waiver to allow them to get distant network signals, this \nconference report requires a response in 30 days or the waiver is \ndeemed approved. There was a provision in the previous law that \nrequired cable subscribers to wait 90 days after unhooking their cable \nbefore they could get satellite service. We removed that waiting period \nso that Utahns who want to switch from cable can do so immediately.\n  We heard from the owners of recreational vehicles that they wanted to \nbe able to put satellite dishes on their RV's when they go camping or \ntraveling. In this bill, we allow RV owners who comply with certain \ndocumentation requirements to get satellite service. So Utahns do not \nneed to leave their satellite service behind when they travel. The same \nrules would apply to long-haul truckers.\n  Recent lawsuits enforcing the distant signal eligibility rules under \nthe copyright act have put many satellite subscribers in danger of \nlosing their distant network signal service. Let me be clear that I do \nnot condone or support what appears to have been law-breaking by the \nsatellite carriers. But I am concerned about subscribers being caught \nin the middle, especially those who are not clearly served by over-the-\nair television from their local broadcasters. So, in this legislation, \nwe protect the eligibility for satellite service received by current \nsubscribers have who do not get a city-grade or Grade A signal. In this \nway, we can protect those subscribers who may have been misled about \ntheir eligibility and who may be in an area that is not clearly served, \nso that they will not be out their investment. With regard to the \nsignal intensity rules that make up the eligibility standard for \ndistant signals, we have asked the FCC to give us their best judgment \nabout how we should reform the law, so that we can have their best \ninput before we consider any further major reforms on this issue.\n\n  I have talked about the benefits that will accrue to satellite \nsubscribers if the satellite carriers take full advantage of these \ncopyright license reforms. But the benefits are not just limited to \nsatellite subscribers. There will be benefits to cable subscribers, \ntoo, that will come from a satellite industry equipped to compete with \ncable head on in the market. Satellite service consistently ranks high \non consumer surveys for service satisfaction. It has a vast array of \nchannels for viewers to choose from. As I mentioned earlier, the growth \nof the satellite television business has been phenomenal, even without \nthe ability to deliver local television stations. Recent consumer \nsurveys indicate that 85 percent of respondents said that the lack of \nlocal signals is the reason why consumers who considered buying \nsatellite service decided not to. Imagine the growth in this industry \nnow that they will be able to compete with cable with the offering of \nlocal programming. What does this all mean for cable subscribers? One \nof the reasons why many believe cable is rated low on customer \nsatisfaction is that it usually does not have a real competitor. Many \nlocal cable systems know its customers have nowhere else to go, so they \ndo not exert themselves as much to please the customer as they might \nwith a competitor. Armed with local signals, as well as the rest of the \nbenefits satellite offers, there should be a new spark of competition \nin those areas where local satellite service is available. That will \nlead to lower prices, increased choices, and happy customers for both \nsatellite and cable, and all television viewers.\n  Today we are also considering a patent reform package which contains \nthe most significant reforms to our nation's patent code in half a \ncentury. This bill, which Senator Leahy and I introduced as the \n``American Inventors Protection Act,'' is one of the most important \nhigh-tech reform measures to come before this body. It is widely \nsupported by an overwhelming majority of members on both sides of the \naisle, by the Administration, and by a broad coalition of industry, \nsmall businesses, and American inventors. Its consideration here today \nis imminently appropriate on the eve of a new millennium in which \nAmerica's ability to compete and the strength of our economy will \ndepend on the strength of the patent system and the protections it \naffords.\n  Intellectual property, and patents in particular, are among our \nnation's greatest assets. From semiconductor chip technology, to \ncomputer software, to biotechnology, to Internet and telecommunications \ntechnology, the United States remains the undisputed world-leader in \ntechnological innovation. In fact, according to Newsweek Magazine, the \nUnited States is home to seven of the world's top ten technology \ncenters, which includes my own state of Utah. Moreover, American \ncreative industries now surpass all other export sectors in foreign \nsales and exports. As the Internet, electronic commerce, and new \ninnovative technologies increasingly drive the growth of our economy, \nthe strength of our patent system and its ability to respond to the \nchallenges of new technology and global competition will be more \nimportant than ever. This bill will enable our patent system to meet \nthese challenges and to protect American inventors and American \ncompetitiveness into the next century.\n\n[[Page S15019]]\n\n  As many of my colleagues know, this bill is a compromise bill that \nreflects years of discussion and extensive efforts to reach agreement \non all sides. Since first introducing this bill as an omnibus measure \nin the 104th Congress, we have literally engaged in countless hours of \ndiscussions and adopted over 100 amendments to this bill in order to \nforge a consensus on a package of responsible patent reforms. The \nSenate made significant progress toward consensus in the last Congress \nwhen the Judiciary Committee reached several key compromises to \nstrengthen the bill's protections for small businesses and independent \ninventors. I was pleased to see those efforts continued in the House \nthis year, where the supporters and former opponents of the bill agreed \nto sit down and work through their differences in an effort to produce \na constructive patent reform bill. As a result of these cooperative \nefforts in the House and Senate, the bill before us now enjoys \noverwhelming bipartisan, bicameral support, and it is now endorsed by \nthe most vocal opponents of earlier reform measures.\n  This broad support is reflected in the several votes that have \nalready occurred on this measure this year. The House has passed this \nbill three times this year, including by a 376-43 vote on the bill as \nstand alone measure in August and by a 411-8 vote on the bill as part \nof the conference report on the ``Intellectual Property and \nCommunications Omnibus Reform Act.'' The Senate Judiciary Committee \nalso passed the bill by an 18-0 roll call vote earlier this month.\n  Having touched upon some of the compromises that have brought people \ntogether on this bill, let me take just a minute to highlight what this \nbill will do for American inventors.\n  1. The bill protects against fraudulent invention promoters which \nprey upon novice inventors.\n  2. It reduces patent fees for only the second time in history, saving \nAmerican inventors an estimated $30 million each year. The bill will \nalso ensure that patent fees are not used to subsidize trademark \noperations and will require the PTO to study alternative fee structures \nto encourage maximum participation by small inventors.\n  3. It protects American companies and their workers from patent \ninfringement suits as a result of recent policy changes that have \nallowed patents to begin to issue on internal business methods that \nwere previously thought to be unpatentable and which have been used \nunder trade secret protection.\n  4. It guarantees that every diligent inventor with a patentable \ninvention will receive at least 17 years of patent protection (which is \nwhat they would have received pre-GATT); most will receive a great deal \nmore.\n  5. It allows American inventors and innovators to see foreign \ntechnology at least 12 months earlier than today, while allowing \nAmerican inventors to maintain protections of existing law that allow \nthem to keep their inventions secret during patent pendency. It also \ngives American inventors new protections by given them provisional \nrights during the pendency of internationally published applications.\n\n  6. It creates a new optional administrative procedure in the Patent \nand Trademark Office to reduce litigation costs for patent owners and \nto allow members of the public to participate in testing the validity \nof patents, all while fully protecting patent holders against \nrepetitive challenges.\n  7. It restructures the Patent and Trademark Office to eliminate red \ntape and provide greater oversight by the American inventing community, \nespecially by small businesses and independent inventors.\n  8. It protects our national security by requiring the PTO to maintain \na program with the Office of Personnel Management to identify national \nsecurity positions at the PTO and by protecting strategic information \nfrom disclosure.\n  9. Finally, it restricts the ability of the PTO Commissioner to \nexchange U.S. patent data with certain foreign nations.\n  In short, this is one of the most important technology-related bills \nto come before Congress in recent memory. It has been years in the \nmaking and reflects the input of many, many people from all sides. The \ntime to act on this package of reforms has clearly come, and I am \npleased that the Senate is finally taking this measure up.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate will complete action on the \n``Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act'' and send that \nlegislation to the President. In short, this is another key high-tech \nbill that will curb the harmful practice of ``cybersquatting''--a term \nused to refer to the deliberate and bad-faith registration of Internet \ndomain names in violation of the rights of trademark owners. \nCybersquatting is a very serious threat to consumers and the future \ngrowth of electronic commerce. For example, we heard testimony in the \nJudiciary Committee of consumer fraud being perpetrated by the \nregistrant of the ``attphonecard.com'' and ``attcallingcard.com'' \ndomain names, who set up Internet sites purporting to sell calling \ncards and soliciting personally identifying information, including \ncredit card numbers. Sammy Sosa had his name cybersquatted and used for \na website that implied his endorsement of the products being sold. \nThere are countless other similar examples of so-called ``dot-con'' \nartists who prey on consumer confusion and trade on the goodwill of \nothers.\n  The fact is that if consumers cannot rely on brand-names online as \nthey do in the world of bricks and mortar store-fronts, few will be \nwilling to engage in e-commerce. Those who do will bear substantial \nrisks of being confused or even deceived. Few Internet users would buy \na car, fill a prescription, or even shop for books online if you they \ncannot be sure who they are dealing with.\n  This legislation will go a long way to ensure this sort of online \nbrand-name protection for consumers. At the same time, the bill \ncarefully balances these interests of consumers and trademark owners \nwith the interests of Internet users and others who would make fair or \notherwise lawful uses of trademarked names in cyberspace.\n  As with trademark cybersquatting, cybersquatting of personal names \nposes similar threats to consumers and e-commerce in that it causes \nconfusion as to the source or sponsorship of goods or services, \nincluding confusion as to the sponsorship or affiliation of websites \nbearing individuals' names. In addition, more and more people are being \nharmed by people who register other peoples names and hold them out for \nsale for huge sums or money or use them for various nefarious purposes. \nI am particularly troubled at the prospect of what someone might do \nwith websites bearing the name of such people as Mother Teresa, which I \nunderstand are currently being offered for $7 million by a \ncybersquatter.\n  For this reason, I was pleased that the House amendments to the \nSenate bill clarified that famous names that enjoy service mark status, \nsuch as celebrity actors and very likely Mother Teresa, are included. \nAs I have said, however, this bill should not be just about protecting \ncelebrities. I am thus pleased that the legislation in this conference \nreport goes further to protect those whose names don't meet the \nrelatively high threshold of a famous mark, but who are nonetheless \ntargeted by cybersquatters. For example, ESPN has reported that a \nnumber of cybersquatters have targeted the names of high-school \nathletes in anticipation that they may some day become famous. Earlier \nversions of the House and Senate bills would not have protected these \nindividuals, but this legislation will. Furthermore, this bill directs \nthe Commerce Department to report to Congress on ways to better protect \npersonal names against cybersquatting and to work in conjunction with \nthe Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to \ninclude personal name disputes in the ICANN dispute resolution policy.\n  This a key measure to promote electronic commerce and to protect \nconsumers and individuals online. While I recognize the global nature \nof the cybersquatting problem, I believe this legislation is an \nimportant start to a worldwide solution--as evidenced by the fact that \nthe latest ICANN dispute resolution policy reflects a number of the \npolicies embodied in the Senate bill. I appreciate Senator Abraham's \neffort to move this bill through Congress, and I am pleased we will \npass it today.\n  These are important intellectual property reforms that are helpful to \nAmerican consumers and American\n\n[[Page S15020]]\n\nbusinesses. They are the product of the hard work of many people. Mr. \nPresident, I would like to thank many people who have worked hard to \nget this conference report agreed to and passed. First, let me thank \nand personally congratulate each of my colleagues on the Conference \nCommittee for their diligent work in achieving this goal, especially my \ndistinguished Ranking Member and original co-sponsor Senator Leahy, as \nwell as Chairman McCain, and Senators Thurmond, Stevens, DeWine, \nHollings, and Kohl, all of whom made important contributions. On the \nHouse side, I extend my gratitude and congratulations to Chairman \nHyde and Chairman Bliley and to Representatives Coble, Tauzin, \nGoodlatte, Oxley, Dingell, Conyers, Markey, Berman, and Boucher. Of \ncourse, this successful result is also the product of tireless efforts \nby our capable staffs, who have worked through many late nights and \nweekends, to make this successful resolution possible. Among the many \nSenate staff members who have made critical contributions are Manus \nCooney, Shawn Bentley, and Troy Dow of my staff; Bruce Cohen, Ed \nBarron, Beryl Howell of Senator Leahy's staff; and from the other \nSenate conferees, Mitch Rose, Pete Belvin, Maureen McLaughlin, Paula \nFord, Al Mottur, Gary Malphrus, Jim Hippe, Pete Levitas, Jon Leibowitz, \nJohn Schwantes, and many others on the Senate side. Let me congratulate \neach of them on their work. Tony Coe of Senate Legislative Counsel and \nBill Roberts of the Copyright Office both put in many long hours to \nprovide technical assistance. I know I speak for all of the Senate \nconferees in expressing my gratitude to all these first-rate staff \nmembers, as well as to the fine staff on the House side. The leadership \nstaff from both houses, particularly Jim Sartucci and Renee Bennett \nfrom Senator Lott's staff and Doug Farry from Representative Armey's \noffice were key liaisons in this process.\n\n  On patent reform, let me note my very sincere appreciation to the \nRanking Member on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, with whom I \nhave worked for the better part of three Congresses to bring about \nthese important reforms. His leadership on the Democratic side has been \na key part to getting this bill done. I want to also recognize the \nextraordinary efforts of our House colleagues on this bill. Chairman \nCoble, who is the bill's primary sponsor in the House, along with the \nRanking Member on the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property, \nCongressman Berman, as well as Chairman Hyde and Ranking Member \nConyers, have all dedicated tremendous time and effort over the last \nfour years to moving this legislation forward. Their able leadership is \nreflected in the support this bill received in the House. But I want to \nmention in particular Congressman Rohrabacher and Congressman Campbell \nwho in years past had led the opposition in the House to this bill. It \nis because of their efforts to work cooperatively with the proponents \nof this legislation in the House to craft a package of truly \nresponsible reforms on behalf of American inventors that we have a bill \nbefore us today. I want to recognize them for their leadership, and for \ntheir good faith both in the House and in the Senate this year.\n  Finally, with respect to cybersquatting legislation, I want to again \ncommend the Senator from Michigan, Senator Abraham, for his sponsorship \nof this legislation, as well as the Ranking Member, Senator Leahy, with \nwhom I have again worked hand in hand to bring this bill to final \npassage.\n  All of these people and others were instrumental in the success of \nthis legislation, but let me express an especially warm thanks to \nSenator Leahy, with whom I have worked closely on these and so many \nother intellectual property matters, and to the Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Stevens. We worked particularly \nclosely in the satellite reform conference, and he played a unique and \ncrucial role in the ultimate passage of this package of important \nintellectual property legislation. I thank him for his leadership and \nhis steadfast support. And let me single out the efforts of Mitch Rose \nof Senator Stevens' staff who worked along with my staff and Steve \nCortese of Senator Stevens' Appropriations Committee staff, under \nSenator Stevens' leadership, to ensure that these important \nintellectual property matters were ultimately enacted into law despite \nthe difficulties encountered in the process. They are superb public \nservants and they work for one of the finest members of this August \nbody with whom I have had the pleasure of working. Finally, let me \nmention Bruce Cohen, Ed Barron, and Beryl Howell of Senator Leahy's \nstaff, who, along with Senator Leahy, work with me and my staff with \nexceptional cooperation on intellectual property matters. We have had a \nparticularly productive relationship on these important matters, and I \nlook forward to continuing that relationship. On my own staff, I \nexpress my appreciation for the work of Shawn Bentley and Troy Dow, who \nhave labored long and hard to successfully enact this legislation, and \nI thank their families for their support of their efforts on behalf of \nAmerican innovators, creators, and consumers. Finally, let me thank my \nChief Counsel, Manus Cooney, for overseeing all of this fine work, and \nputting in countless hours of strenuous effort to ensure its \ncompletion. He is a consummate leader, and I thank him for his stellar \nservice.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statements of Senators Leahy, \nDeWine, and Kohl, followed by a number of colloquies between myself and \na number of different senators on diverse matters included in the \nsatellite conference report, be included in the Record at this point as \nthough read, together with supporting documents, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee is about to achieve \nan end-of-the-session high technology sweep that comes on the heels of \nlandmark Internet and intellectual property reforms that our committee \nachieved in the 105th Congress.\n  Others are observing that this is the most productive and forward-\nlooking two years of achievement in updating intellectual property laws \nof this or any previous era. I believe they are right.\n  We may never have another such set of opportunities where we are able \nto provide so many benefits to consumers, innovators and to the high \ntechnology innovators in the business community in such a short span of \ntime.\n  In one fell swoop we are providing consumers with local-into-local \ntelevision, protecting patent terms, spurring innovation and enhancing \nelectronic commerce and protecting trademarks.\n  One of the challenges we face at this early stage of the Information \nAge is to bring the order of intellectual property law to the Wild West \nof the Internet and to other burgeoning information technologies. That \nchallenge is at the heart of these three bills.\n  I want to make just a couple points about each of them. The patent \nbill is long overdue. It will put American innovations on a more equal \nfooting with European and Japanese inventors. It also helps protect \ninventors against invention promotion scams and against needless PTO \ndelay in approving patents.\n  The anti-cybersquatting bill protects merchants who want to be able \nto control where their names and brands are being displayed and protect \nthem from abuse. More than 200 years ago Ben Franklin said that a \nperson's honor and good name is like fine china--easily broken but \nimpossible to mend. This is still the case today and the bill protects \nthe rights of trademark holders against malicious abuse. It arms on-\nline merchants and consumers with new tools to derail these \n``squatters'' who try to create bad waves for honest cybersurfers.\n  And then there is the satellite bill, which is a charter for a new \nera of television service competition that will benefit consumers in \nseveral tangible ways. It sets the stage for the first real head-to-\nhead competition between cable and satellite TV that will be a brand \nnew experience for hundreds of communities.\n  It will contribute a new unifying influence and greater sense of \ncommunity in states like Vermont, where citizens in most of the state \nfor the first time will have access to all Vermont stations. It will \navert further waves of programming cutoffs to satellite TV customers, \nincluding what would have been the largest cutoff of all, in December.\n  The satellite bill will, over time, mean that some families will be \nable to\n\n[[Page S15021]]\n\nget local network television for the first time ever. I believe that \nmaking local television signals available throughout much of a state \nwill be a unifying force and enhance public participation in state and \ncommunity issues. It will remove the artificial isolation caused by \nmountain ridges or distance from broadcast towers. It will also prevent \nthese infuriating and seemingly mindless cutoffs and promote direct \nhead-to-head competition with cable.\n\n  We have had some major bumps in the road in getting here with these \nthree bills.\n  I want to mention the rural satellite TV provisions. I know that we \nhad preliminary discussions about this six months ago and that \nDepartment of Agriculture attorneys and program experts met with our \nstaffs to go over the details months ago.\n  I proposed that USDA handle this loan guarantee program because they \nhave 50 years of experience with financing rural telephone and rural \nelectric cooperatives. Vast areas of this nation were able to get \nelectric and telephone service solely because of these programs.\n  It is hard to believe in this day and age, but thousands of Americans \nstill remember when these USDA loan programs gave them electricity for \nthe first time.\n  I am disappointed that the final bill does not include this provision \nthat we worked on--but I am pleased that the Senate leaders have worked \nout an arrangement with us so that this matter will be resolved early \nnext year.\n  Without this loan guarantee program I am convinced that rural areas--\n75 percent of the U.S. landmass--might not receive local-into-local \nsatellite TV until 10 or 20 years after urban areas do.\n  Another major hurdle concerned a request by AOL and YAHOO for changes \nto the bill. This concerned whether or not they should receive a \ncompulsory license to show regular TV programming over the Internet. \nChairman Hatch and I resolved this by agreeing to have hearings on this \nimportant matter of convergence of technology and the protection of \ncopyrighted material--converging TV, data, telephone, messages and \nother transmissions through broadband technologies while protecting \nownership rights to copyrighted material.\n  A third bump in the road was over the GAO study Senator Hatch and I \nproposed of current practices regarding the patent protection for \nbusiness methods resulting from the State Street case. In the end, we \ntook out that language but agreed that we would ask the GAO to look \ninto this for us. This issue will test the limits of what is proper \nsubject matter to be patented and what is not. I can easily see Senator \nHatch and I having more than one hearing on this issue.\n  So here we are in the death throes of this session of Congress. It is \nsatisfying to know that some of the farthest-reaching achievements of \nthis session are the products of the work of the Judiciary Committee, \nand of my partnership with Chairman Hatch.\n  I am delighted that as Conferees on the satellite bill that we have \nbeen able to put this complex and important legislation, which \noriginated with the Hatch-Leahy Satellite Home Viewers Improvements Act \nin the Senate, into final form.\n  We worked closely with a number of Senators and members of the other \nbody on this important legislation. Any time that you work with four \nCommittees in a Conference there are a lot of members and staff who do \nvery creative and important work late into the night, night after night \nafter night.\n  I want to single out just a few staff even though I know I am leaving \nout many who deserve equal praise. Shawn Bentley with Chairman Hatch \ndisplayed enormous poise and breath of knowledge regarding satellite TV \nissues. He balanced, as did his Chairman, a variety of complex issues \nvery carefully and very well.\n  Troy Dow similarly was extremely helpful regarding patent and \ncybersquatting issues and deserves a great deal of credit.\n  I want to also thank Ed Barron of my staff regarding the satellite TV \nand patent bills and Beryl Howell on cybersquatting. They both worked \nvery diligently on these and other issues and did a great job.\n  Subcommittee Chairman DeWine and ranking Member Kohl were also \nConferees, along with Senator Thurmond, and played a major role \nregarding satellite TV issues.\n  This bill will provide viewers with more choices and will greatly \nincrease competition in the delivery of television programming, while \nensuring minimal interference with the free market copyright system \nthat serves our country so well.\n  For years I have raised concerns about the lack of competition with \ncable TV and escalating cable rates. This bill will allow satellite TV \nproviders to compete directly with cable in offering local stations and \nwill give consumers a wider range of choice. It also protects local TV \naffiliates while postponing certain cutoffs of satellite TV service.\n  Most promisingly, the bill will permit local TV signals, as opposed \nto distant out-of-state network signals, to be offered to viewers via \nsatellite. Vermont is a state in which satellite dishes play a very \nimportant role, and I know that Vermont viewers eagerly await the day \nwhen their local stations will be available by satellite.\n  It is absurd for home dish owners--whether they live in Vermont, \nUtah, or California--to have to watch network stations imported from \ndistant states instead of local stations. They should have a choice. I \nexpect the satellite industry to do everything in its power to extend \nlocal-to-local coverage beyond the biggest cities and into important \nsmaller markets such as those in Vermont, and the satellite industry \nshould not expect further Congressional largesse if it fails to do so.\n  One satellite company called Capitol Broadcasting has already \ncommitted to serve Vermont once its spot beam technology satellites \nhave been launched and other technological requirements have been put \nin place. I am counting on that happening over the next two or three \nyears.\n  I was very pleased to have met with the moving force behind Capitol \nBroadcasting--Jim Goodmon. This company was formed by his grandfather, \nA. J. Fletcher, in 1937. Under Jim Goodmon's management, Capitol \nBroadcasting has expanded into satellite communications, the Internet \nand high definition television. In April, Jim received the Digital \nTelevision Pioneer Award from Broadcasting and Cable magazine. One of \ntheir stations, CBC, was the first broadcaster to transmit a high \ndefinition television digital signal. I look forward to helping \ninaugurate their local-into-local service into Vermont.\n  I expect that others will compete in Vermont. I understand the \nEchoStar, under its CEO, Charlie Ergen, and DirecTV, are also looking \nat providing service to Vermont.\n\n  Providing local TV stations to Vermont dish owners will lead to head-\nto-head competition between cable and satellite TV providers which \nshould lead to more services for Vermonters at lower prices. Also, the \nbill will allow households who want to subscribe to this new satellite \nTV service to receive all local Vermont TV stations over the satellite.\n  The goal is to offer Vermonters with more choices, more TV \nselections, but at lower rates. In areas of the country were there is \nthis full competition with cable providers, rates to customers are \nconsiderably lower.\n  Over time this initiative will permit satellite TV providers to offer \na full selection of all local TV channels to viewers throughout most of \nVermont, as well as the typical complement of superstations, weather \nand sports channels, PBS, movies and a variety of other channels.\n  This means that local Vermont TV stations will be available over \nsatellite to many areas of Vermont currently unserved by satellite or \nby cable.\n  I have gotten lots of letters from Vermonters who complained about \nthe current situation where local TV stations challenged their right to \nreceive that signal.\n  Under current law, it is illegal for satellite TV providers to offer \nlocal TV channels over a satellite dish when you live in an area where \nyou are likely to get a clear TV signal with a regular rooftop antenna \nat least half of the time.\n  This means that thousands of Vermonters living in or near Burlington \ncannot receive local signals over their satellite dishes.\n\n[[Page S15022]]\n\n  Under current law, those families must get their local TV signals \nover an antenna which often does not provide a clear picture. This bill \nwill remove that legal limitation and allow satellite carriers to offer \nlocal TV signals to viewers no matter where they live in Vermont.\n  Presently, Vermonters receive satellite signals with programming from \nstations in other states--in other words they would get a CBS station \nfrom another state but not WCAX, the Burlington CBS affiliate.\n  By allowing satellite providers to offer a larger variety of \nprogramming, including local stations, the satellite industry would be \nable to compete with cable, and the cable industry will be competing \nwith satellite carriers. Cable will continue to be a very effective \ncompetitor with its ability to offer extremely high-speed Internet \nconnections to homes and businesses.\n  As mentioned earlier, the second major improvement in this initiative \nis that satellite carriers that offer local Vermont channels in their \nmix of programming will be able to reach Vermonters throughout Vermont. \nThe system will be based on regions called Designated Market Areas, or \nDMAs. Vermont has one large DMA covering most of the state and part of \nthe Adirondacks in New York--the Burlington-Plattsburg DMA--and parts \nof two smaller ones in Bennington County (the Albany-Schenectady-Troy \nDMA) and in Windham county (the Boston DMA).\n  This new satellite system is not available yet, and may not be \navailable in Vermont until two to three years from now. Companies such \nas Capitol Broadcasting are preparing to launch spot-beam satellites to \ntake advantage of this bill. Using current technology, signals would be \nprovided by spot-beam satellites using regional uplink sites throughout \nthe nation to beam local signals up to one or two satellites. Those \nsatellites could use 60 spot beams to send those local signals, \nreceived from the regional uplinks, back to satellite dish owners. High \ndefinition TV would be offered under this system at a later date.\n  Under this bill, Vermonters will have more choices. I want to point \nout that those who want to keep their current satellite service can do \njust that.\n  In addition, we have protected the C-Band dish owners who have \ninvested a lot of money in this now out-dated, but still used, \ntechnology. I did not think it was fair to pull the plug on them.\n  Those who want to stick with cable, or with regular broadcast TV, are \nwelcome to continue to participate that way.\n  Since technology advances so quickly, other systems could be \ndeveloped before this bill is fully implemented that would provide \nsimilar service but using a different technology.\n  The bill will also extend the distant signal compulsory license in \nSection 119. In almost all respects, the distant signal license will \napply in the same way in the future as it applies today. The most \nimportant exception is that the bill will allow continued delivery of \ndistant network stations to thousands of Vermonters and residents of \nother states who would otherwise have distant network satellite service \nterminated at the end of the year (or who have had such service \nterminated by court order since July 1998).\n  The purpose of this temporary ``grandfathering'' is not to reward \nsatellite carriers that have broken the law. Rather, the purpose of the \ngrandfathering is to assist certain subscribers in Vermont and \nelsewhere who might have been misled by satellite companies into \nbelieving that they were eligible to receive distant network \nprogramming by satellite. The purpose is also to aid in achieving a \nsmooth transition to local-into-local programming which avoids many of \nthese issues.\n  The subscribers who will be grandfathered are those who are not \npredicted to receive a signal of Grade A intensity from any station \naffiliated with the relevant network, along with certain additional C-\nband subscribers.\n  I want to make clear that I do not condone lawbreaking by satellite \ncompanies or anyone else, and nothing that Congress is doing today \nshould be read in that light. Satellite companies remain liable for \nevery other remedy provided by the Copyright Act or other law for any \ninfringements they have committed. Satellite carriers should not be \nheard to argue for any grandfathering beyond what Congress has \nexpressly approved, or to contend that they should be relieved of any \nother available remedy because of Congress' actions.\n  The second change to Section 119 is that there will no longer be a \n90-day waiting period for cable subscribers that is currently part of \nthe definition of ``unserved household.'' This change will help to make \nthe satellite industry more competitive with cable, an objective I know \nevery member of this body shares. Third, the bill will limit to two the \nnumber of distant signals that a satellite carrier may deliver to \nunserved households.\n\n  Except with respect to these specific changes in Section 119, nothing \nin the law we are passing today will take away any of the rights and \nremedies available to the parties to copyright infringement litigation \nagainst satellite carriers. Nor does anything in this bill suggest any \ncriticism of the courts for enforcing the Copyright Act. It is their \njob to apply the law to the facts.\n  It is crucial to our system that all players in the marketplace, \nincluding satellite carriers, be required to obey the law and held \naccountable in the courts for the consequences of their own \nlawbreaking. Indeed, if a particular satellite carrier has engaged in a \nwillful or repeated pattern or practice of infringements, it should be \nheld to the statutory consequences of that misconduct.\n  The addition of the word ``stationary'' to the phrase ``conventional \noutdoor rooftop receiving antenna'' in Section 119(d)(10) of the \nCopyright Act merits a word of discussion. As the Ranking Member of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over copyright \nmatters, and one of the original sponsors of this legislation, I want \nto emphasize that use of this word should not be misunderstood.\n  The new language says only that the antenna is to be ``stationary''; \nit does not say that the antenna is to be improperly oriented, that is \npointed in way that does not obtain the strongest signal. The word \n``stationary'' means, for example, that testing should be done using a \nstationary antenna, as the FCC has directed.\n  Satellite companies must not be encouraged to urge consumers to point \nantennas in the wrong direction to qualify for different treatment.\n  As to antenna orientation, the relevant guidance is provided in \nSection 119(a)(2)(B)(ii)(II) of the bill, which specifies that the \nFCC's procedures (requiring correct orientation) be followed. Since \nsatellite dishes must be properly oriented to receive a picture at all, \nit would make no sense to specify misorientation of over-the-air \nantennas.\n  Permitting misorientation would also be inconsistent with the entire \nstructure of the definition of ``unserved household,'' which looks to \nwhether a household is capable of receiving a signal of Grade B \nintensity from a particular type of affiliate, that is an ABC station \nor a Fox station, not whether it is capable of receiving all of the \nstations in the market.\n  As I mentioned before, the Copyright Act amendments direct courts to \ncontinue to use the accurate, consumer-friendly prediction and \nmeasurement tools developed by the FCC for determining whether \nparticular households are served or unserved. If the Commission is able \nto refine its so-called ``ILLR'' predictive model to make it even more \naccurate--as I hope it will--the courts should apply those further \nrefinements as well.\n  In fact, the Copyright Act amendments in the bill specifically \naddress the possibility that the FCC may be able to modify its ILLR \nmodel to make it even more accurate. Specifically, the Act provides in \nnew Section 119(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I) of the Copyright Act that if the FCC \nshould later modify the ILLR model to make it still more accurate, \ncourts should, under Section 119(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I), use the even more \naccurate version in the future for predictive purposes.\n  Whether a proposed modification to the ILLR model makes it more \naccurate is an empirical question that the Commission should address by \ncomparing the predictions made by any proposed model against actual \nmeasurements of signal intensity. The Commission's analysis should \nreflect our\n\n[[Page S15023]]\n\npolicy objective: to determine whether a household is--or is not--\ncapable of receiving a signal of Grade B intensity from at least one \nstation affiliated with the relevant network.\n  The FCC has properly recognized that reducing one type of errors, \nunderprediction, while increasing another type of errors, \noverprediction, does not increase accuracy, but simply puts a thumb on \nthe scale in favor of one side or the other. The issue under Section \n119(a)(2)(B)(ii) is the overall accuracy of the model, as tested \nagainst available measurement data, with regard to whether a household \nis, or is not, capable of receiving a Grade B intensity signal from at \nleast one affiliate of the network in question.\n  The conferees and many other members of this body have worked hard to \nachieve the carefully balanced bill now before the Senate. I urge my \ncolleagues to give it their full support. Most of all, I thank and \ncongratulate my distinguished colleague and good friend, Chairman \nHatch, for his outstanding work over many months on this important \nbill, which will provide lasting benefits for my constituents in \nVermont and for citizens in every other state.\n\n  I'm also pleased that the Conference Report directs the Federal \nCommunications Commission to take expedited action on getting new \ntechnologies deployed that can deliver local television signals to \nviewers in smaller television markets. We've known all along, if we \npass legislation authorizing local-into-local, the DBS carriers would \nreadily deliver local channels to those subscribers who are fortunate \nenough to live in the largest markets. There are 210 local television \nDesignated Market Areas in our country, and most Vermonters live in the \n91st-ranked DMA. That is why it is so important for the FCC to expedite \nreview of alternative technologies, such as the digital terrestrial \nwireless system developed by Northpoint Technology, which are capable \nof delivering local signals into all markets on a must carry basis.\n  I want to briefly mention the patent bill.\n  This patent bill is important to America's future. I have heard from \ninventors, from businesses large and small, from hi-tech to low-tech \nfirms--this bill will give American inventors and businesses an \nimproved competitive edge now enjoyed by many European countries.\n  We should be on a level playing field with them.\n  This bill reduces patent fees for only the second time in history. \nThe first time that was done was in a Hatch-Leahy bill passed by the \nSenate in the 105th Congress.\n  All the concepts in this bill--such as patent term guarantees, \ndomestic publication of patent applications filed abroad, first \ninventor defense--have been thoroughly examined. Indeed, they have been \nincluded in several bills that the Congress has carefully studied.\n  I wish to point out that the Senate Judiciary Committee last year \nalso developed a strong bill--S. 507--which contained many of the same \nconcepts and approaches found in H.R. 1907 and S. 1798.\n  American business needs this patent bill, American technology \ncompanies need this patent bill, American inventors and innovators need \nthis patent bill.\n\n  The Administration says that we must have the reforms in this bill. \nIt will: reduce legal fees that are paid by inventors and companies; \neliminate duplication of research efforts and accelerate research into \nnew areas; increase the value of patents to inventors and companies; \nand facilitate U.S. inventors and companies' research, development, and \ncommercialization of inventions.\n  In Vermont, we have a number of independent inventors and small \ncompanies. It is, therefore, especially important to me that this bill \nbe one that helps them as well as the larger companies in Vermont like \nIBM.\n  Over the past several years, Congress has held eight Congressional \nhearings with over 80 witnesses testifying about the various proposals \nincorporated in the bill. Republican and Democratic Administrations \nalike, reaching back to the Johnson Administration, have supported \nthese similar reforms.\n  I also want to thank Secretary Daley and the Administration for their \nunflagging support of effective patent reform.\n  The ``American Inventors Protection Act'' was designed to make \ntargeted improvements to the patent code in order to enable the \nAmerican patent system to meet the challenges of new technology and new \nmarkets as we approach the next millennium.\n  The bill builds upon compromises forged in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee in the 105th Congress, as well as additional compromises in \nthe House of Representatives in the 106th Congress, to achieve these \ngoals while protecting and promoting the interest of American inventors \nat home and abroad.\n  I also want to discuss the comments of Senators Schumer and \nTorricelli regarding the patent bill and the State Street decision. I \nlook forward to working with both of those Senators on the issues they \nraise. I expect that the Committee will have hearings on this matter \nnext year. Also, the Conference Report on the bill contains a detailed \nanalysis of these important issues which was accepted by all Conferees.\n  The FY 2000 Omnibus Appropriations bill also includes provisions that \nSenator Hatch and I and others have crafted to address cybersquatting \non domain names. We have worked hard to craft this legislation in a \nbalanced fashion to protect trademark owners and consumers doing \nbusiness online, and Internet users who want to participate in what the \nSupreme Court has described as ``a unique and wholly new medium of \nworldwide human communication.'' Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844.\n  Trademarks are important tools of commerce. The exclusive right to \nthe use of a unique mark helps companies compete in the marketplace by \ndistinguishing their goods and services from those of their \ncompetitors, and helps consumers identify the source of a product by \nlinking it with a particular company. The use of trademarks by \ncompanies, and reliance on trademarks by consumers, will only become \nmore important as the global marketplace grows larger and more \naccessible with electronic commerce. The reason is simple: when a \ntrademarked name is used as a company's address in cyberspace, \ncustomers know where to go online to conduct business with that \ncompany.\n  The growth of electronic commerce is having a positive effect on the \neconomies of small rural states like mine. A Vermont Internet Commerce \nreport I commissioned earlier this year found that Vermont gained more \nthan 1,000 new jobs as a result of Internet commerce, with the \npotential that Vermont could add more than 24,000 jobs over the next \ntwo years. For a small state like ours, this is very good news.\n  Along with the good news, this report identified a number of \nobstacles that stand in the way of Vermont reaching the full potential \npromised by Internet commerce. One obstacle is that ``merchants are \nanxious about not being able to control where their names and brands \nare being displayed.'' Another is the need to bolster consumers' \nconfidence in online shopping.\n  Cybersquatters hurt electronic commerce. Both merchant and consumer \nconfidence in conducting business online are undermined by so-called \n``cybersquatters'' or ``cyberpirates,'' who abuse the rights of \ntrademark holders by purposely and maliciously registering as a domain \nname the trademarked name of another company to divert and confuse \ncustomers or to deny the company the ability to establish an easy-to-\nfind online location. A recent report by the World Intellectual \nProperty Organization (WIPO) on the Internet domain name process has \ncharacterized cybersquatting as ``predatory and parasitical practices \nby a minority of domain registrants acting in bad faith'' to register \nfamous or well-known marks of others--which can lead to consumer \nconfusion or downright fraud.\n\n  Enforcing trademarks in cyberspace will promote global electronic \ncommerce. Enforcing trademark law in cyberspace can help bring consumer \nconfidence to this new frontier. That is why I have long been concerned \nwith protecting registered trademarks online. Indeed, when the Congress \npassed the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, I noted that:\n\n       Although no one else has yet considered this application, \n     it is my hope that this\n\n[[Page S15024]]\n\n     antidilution statute can help stem the use of deceptive \n     Internet addresses taken by those who are choosing marks that \n     are associated with the products and reputations of others.\n\n  The Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 has been used as I \npredicted to help stop misleading uses of trademarks as domain names. \nOne court has described this exercise by saying that ``attempting to \napply established trademark law in the fast-developing world of the \nInternet is somewhat like trying to board a moving bus. . .'' Bensusan \nRestaurant Corp. v. King, 126 F.3d 25. Nevertheless, the courts appear \nto be handling ``cybersquatting'' cases well. As University of Miami \nLaw Professor Michael Froomkin noted in testimony submitted at the \nJudiciary Committee's hearing on this issue on July 22, 1999, ``in \nevery case involving a person who registered large numbers of domains \nfor resale, the cybersquatter has lost.''\n  For example, courts have had little trouble dealing with a notorious \ncybersquatter, Dennis Toeppen from Illinois, who registered more than \n100 trademarks--including\n\n``yankeestadium.com,'' ``deltaairlines.com,''\n\n and ``neiman-marcus.com''--as domain names for the purpose of \neventually selling the names back to the companies owning the \ntrademarks. The various courts reviewing his activities have \nunanimously determined that he violated the Federal Trademark Dilution \nAct.\n\n  Similarly, Wayne State University Law Professor Jessica Litman noted \nin testimony submitted at the Judiciary Committee's hearing that those \nbusinesses that ``have registered domain names that are confusingly \nsimilar to trademarks or personal names in order to use them for \npornographic web sites * * * have without exception lost suits brought \nagainst them.''\n  Even as we consider this legislation, we must acknowledge that \nenforcing or even modifying our trademark laws will be only part of the \nsolution to cybersquatting. Up to now, people have been able to \nregister any number of domain names in the popular ``.com'' domain with \nno money down and no money due for 60 days. Network Solutions Inc., the \ndominant Internet registrar, recently announced that it was changing \nthis policy, and requiring payment of the registration fee up front. In \ndoing so, NSI admitted that it was making this change to curb \ncybersquatting.\n  In addition, we need to encourage the development of alternative \ndispute resolution procedures that can provide a forum for global users \nof the Internet to resolve domain name disputes. For this reason, I \nauthored an amendment that was enacted last year as part of the Next \nGeneration Internet Research Act authorizing the National Research \nCouncil of the National Academy of Sciences to study the effects on \ntrademark holders of adding new top-level domain names and requesting \nrecommendations on inexpensive and expeditious procedures for resolving \ntrademark disputes over the assignment of domain names. Both the \nInternet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers and WIPO are also \nmaking recommendations on these procedures. Adoption of a uniform \ntrademark domain name dispute resolution policy should be of enormous \nbenefit to American trademark owners.\n  We should encourage the sensible development of case law in this \narea, the ongoing efforts within WIPO and ICANN to build a consensus \nglobal mechanism for resolving online trademark disputes, and the \nimplementation of domain name registration practices designed to \ndiscourage cybersquatting. The legislation we pass today as part of the \nOmnibus Appropriations bill for the upcoming fiscal year is intended to \nbuild upon this progress and provide constructive guidance to trademark \nholders, domain name registrars and registries and Internet users \nregistering domain names alike.\n\n  This legislation has been significantly improved since it was first \nintroduced. As originally introduced by Senator Abraham and others, S. \n1255, the ``Trademark Cyberpiracy Prevention Act'', proposed to make it \nillegal to register or use any ``Internet domain name or identifier of \nan online location'' that could be confused with the trademark of \nanother person or cause dilution of a ``famous trademark.'' Violations \nwere punishable by both civil and criminal penalties.\n  I voiced concerns at a hearing before the Judiciary Committee that, \nin its original form, S. 1255 would have a number of unintended \nconsequences that would have hurt rather than promoted electronic \ncommerce, including the following specific problems:\n  The definition was overbroad. As introduced, S. 1255 covered the use \nor registration of any ``identifier,'' which could cover not just \nsecond level domain names, but also e-mail addresses, screen names used \nin chat rooms, and even files accessible and readable on the Internet. \nAs one witness pointed out, ``the definitions will make every fan a \ncriminal.'' How? A file document about Batman, for example, that uses \nthe trademark ``Batman'' in its name, which also identifies its online \nlocation, could land the writer in court under that bill. \nCybersquatting is not about file names.\n  The original bill threatened hypertext linking. The Web operates on \nhypertext linking, to facilitate jumping from one site to another. The \noriginal bill could have disrupted this practice by imposing liability \non operators of sites with links to other sites with trademark names in \nthe address. One could imagine a trademark owner not wanting to be \nassociated with or linked with certain sites, and threatening suit \nunder this proposal unless the link were eliminated or payments were \nmade for allowing the linking.\n\n  The original bill would have criminalized dissent and protest sites. \nA number of Web sites collect complaints about trademarked products or \nservices, and use the trademarked names to identify themselves. For \nexample, there are protest sites named ``boycott-cbs.com'' and \n``www.PepsiBloodbath.com.'' While the speech contained on those sites \nis clearly constitutionally protected, as originally introduced, S. \n1255 would have criminalized the use of the trademarked name to reach \nthe site and made them difficult to search for and find online.\n  The original bill would have stifled legitimate warehousing of domain \nnames. The bill, as introduced, would have changed current law and made \nliable persons who merely register domain names similar to other \ntrademarked names, whether or not they actually set up a site and used \nthe name. The courts have recognized that companies may have legitimate \nreasons for registering domain names without using them and have \ndeclined to find trademark violations for mere registration of a \ntrademarked name. For example, a company planning to acquire another \ncompany might register a domain name containing the target company's \nname in anticipation of the deal. The original bill would have made \nthat company liable for trademark infringement.\n  For these and other reasons, Professor Litman concluded that, ``as \nintroduced, S. 1255 would in many ways be bad for electronic commerce, \nby making it hazardous to do business on the Internet without first \nretaining trademark counsel.'' Faced with the risk of criminal \npenalties, she stated that ``many start-up businesses may choose to \nabandon their goodwill and move to another Internet location, or even \nto fold, rather than risk liability.''\n  Domain name cybersquatting is a real problem. For example, \nwhitehouse.com has probably gotten more traffic from people trying to \nfind copies of the President's speeches than those interested in \nadult material.\n\n  While the problem is clear, narrowly defining the solution is \ntrickier. The mere presence of a trademark is not enough. Legitimate \nconflicts may arise between companies offering different services or \nproducts under the same trademarked name, such as Juno Lighting Inc. \nand Juno online services over the juno.com domain name, or between \ncompanies and individuals who register a name or nickname as a domain \nname, such as the young boy nicknamed ``Pokey'' whose domain name \n``pokey.org'' was challenged by the toy manufacturer who owns the \nrights to the Gumby and Pokey toys. A site may also use a trademarked \nname to protest a group, company or issue, such as pepsibloodbath.com, \nor even to defend one's reputation, such as www.civil-action.com, which \nbelongs not to a motion picture studio, but to W.R. Grace to rebut the \nunflattering portrait of the company as a polluter\n\n[[Page S15025]]\n\nand child poisoner created by the movie.\n  There is a world of difference between these sorts of sites and those \nwhich use deceptive naming practices to draw attention to their site \nfor example, whitehouse.com, or those who use domain names to \nmisrepresent the goods or services they offer, for instance, \ndellmemory.com, which may be confused with the Dell computer company.\n  We must also recognize certain technological realities. For example, \nmerely mentioning a trademark is not a problem. Posting a speech that \nmentions AOL on my web page and calling the page aol.html, confuses no \none between my page and America Online's site. Likewise, we must \nrecognize that while the Web is a key part of the Internet, it is not \nthe only part. We simply do not want to pass legislation that may \nimpose liability on Internet users with e-mail addresses, which may \ncontain a trademarked name. Nor do we want to crack down on newsgroups \nthat use trademarks descriptively, such as alt.comics.batman.\n  In short, it is important that we distinguish between the legitimate \nand illegitimate use of domain names, and the cybersquatting \nlegislation that we pass today does just that.\n\n  Due to the significant flaws in S. 1255, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee reported and the Senate passed a complete substitute to that \nbill. On July 29, 1999, Senator Hatch and I, along with several other \nSenators, introduced S. 1461, the ``Domain Name Piracy Prevention Act \nof 1999.'' This bill then provided the text of the Hatch-Leahy \nsubstitute amendment that the Senate Judiciary Committee reported \nunanimously to S. 1255 the same day. This substitute amendment, with \nthree additional refinements contained in a Hatch-Leahy clarifying \namendment, was passed by the Senate on August 5, 1999.\n  This Hatch-Leahy substitute provided a better solution than the \noriginal, S. 1255, in addressing the cybersquatting problem without \njeopardizing other important online rights and interests.\n  Following Senate passage of the bill, the House passed a version of \nthe legislation, H.R. 3208, the ``Trademark Cyberprivacy Prevention \nAct'', which has been modified for inclusion in the FY 2000 Omnibus \nAppropriations bill.\n  This legislation, now called the ``Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer \nProtection Act'', would amend section 43 of the Trademark Act by adding \na new section to make liable for actual or statutory damages any domain \nname registrant, who with bad-faith intent to profit from the goodwill \nof another's trademark, without regard to the goods or services of the \nparties, registers, traffics in or uses a domain name that is identical \nor confusingly similar to a distinctive trademark or dilutive of a \nfamous trademark. The fact that the domain name registrant did not \ncompete with the trademark owner would not be a bar to recovery. This \nlegislation also makes clear that personal names that are protected as \nmarks would also be covered by new section 1125.\n  Furthermore, this legislation should not in any way frustrate the \nglobal efforts already underway to develop inexpensive and expeditious \nprocedures for resolving domain name disputes that avoid costly \nand time-consuming litigation in the court systems either here or \nabroad. In fact, the legislation expressly provides liability \nlimitations for domain name registrars, registries or other domain name \nregistration authorities when they take actions pursuant to a \nreasonable policy prohibiting the registration of domain names that are \nidentical or confusingly similar to another's trademark or dilutive of \na famous trademark. The ICANN and WIPO consideration of these issues \nwill inform the development by domain name registrars and registries of \nsuch reasonable policies.\n\n  Uses of infringing domain names that support liability under the \nlegislation are expressly limited to uses by the domain name registrant \nor the registrant's authorized licensee. This limitation makes clear \nthat ``uses'' of domain names by persons other than the domain name \nregistrant for purposes such as hypertext linking, directory \npublishing, or for search engines, are not covered by the prohibition.\n  Other significant sections of this legislation are discussed below:\n  Domain names are narrowly defined to mean alphanumeric designations \nregistered with or assigned by domain name registrars or registries, or \nother domain name registration authority as part of an electronic \naddress on the Internet. Since registrars only register second level \ndomain names, this definition effectively excludes file names, screen \nnames, and e-mail addresses and, under current registration practice, \napplies only to second level domain names.\n  The terms ``domain name registrar, domain name registry, or other \ndomain name authority that registered or assigned the domain name'' in \nSection 3002(a) of the Act, amending 15 U.S.C. 1125(d)(2)(a), is \nintended to refer only to those entities that actually place the name \nin a registry, or that operate the registry, and would not extend to \nother entities, such as the ICANN or any of its constituent units, that \nhave some oversight or contractual relationship with such registrars \nand registries. Only these entities that actually offer the challenged \nname, placed it in a registry, or operate the relevant registry are \nintended to be covered by those terms.\n\n  Liability for registering a trademark name as a domain name requires \n``bad faith intent to profit from that mark''. The following non-\nexclusive list of nine factors are enumerated for courts to consider in \ndetermining whether such bad faith intent to profit is proven:\n  (i) the trademark or the intellectual property rights of the domain \nname registrant in the domain name;\n  (ii) whether the domain name is the legal name or the nickname of the \nregistrant;\n  (iii) the prior use by the registrant of the domain name in \nconnection with the bona fide offering of any goods or services;\n  (iv) the registrant's legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the \nmark at the site accessible under the domain name;\n  (v) the registrant's intent to divert consumers from the mark owner's \nonline location in a manner that could harm the mark's goodwill, either \nfor commercial gain or with the intent to tarnish or disparage the \nmark, by creating a likelihood of confusion as to the source, \nsponsorship, affiliation or endorsement of the site;\n  (vi) the registrant's offer to sell the domain name for financial \ngain without having used, or having an intent to use, the domain name \nin the bona fide offering of goods or services or the registrant's \nprior conduct indicating a pattern of such conduct;\n  (vii) the registrant's intentional provision of material, false and \nmisleading contact information when applying for the registration of \nthe domain name, intentions, failure to maintain accurate information, \nor prior conduct indicating a pattern of such conduct;\n  (viii) the registrant's registration of multiple domain names that \nare identical or similar to or dilutive of another's trademark; and\n\n  (ix) the extent to which the mark is or is not distinctive.\n  Significantly, the legislation expressly states that bad faith shall \nnot be found ``in any case in which the count determines that the \nperson believed and had reasonable grounds to believe that the case of \nthe domain name was a false use or otherwise lawful.'' In other words, \ngood faith, innocent or negligent uses of a domain name that is \nidentical or confusingly similar to another's mark or dilutive of a \nfamous mark are not covered by the legislation's prohibition.\n  In short, registering a domain name while unaware that the name is \nanother's trademark would not be actionable. Nor would the use of a \ndomain name that contains a trademark for purposes of protest, \ncomplaint, parody or commentary satisfy the requisite scienter \nrequirement.\n  Bad-faith intent to profit is required for a violation to occur. This \nrequirement of bad-faith intent to profit is critical since, as \nProfessor Litman pointed out in her testimony, our trademark laws \npermit multiple businesses to register the same trademark for different \nclasses of products. Thus, she explains:\n\n       Although courts have been quick to impose liability for bad \n     faith registration, they have been far more cautious in \n     disputes involving a domain name registrant who has a \n     legitimate claim to use a domain name and registered it in \n     good faith. In a number of cases,\n\n[[Page S15026]]\n\n     courts have refused to impose liability where there is no \n     significant likelihood that anyone will be misled, even if \n     there is a significant possibility of trademark dilution.\n\n  In civil actions against cybersquatters, the plaintiff is authorized \nto recover actual damages and profits, or may elect before final \njudgment to an award of statutory damages of not less than $1,000 and \nnot more than $100,000 per domain name, as the court considers just. In \naddition, the court is authorized to forfeit, cancel, or transfer the \ndomain name to the plaintiff. To reduce frivolous litigation and the \nrisk of reverse domain name hijacking, the court is authorized to award \ncourts and attorneys' fees to the prevailing party.\n\n  In Rem Actions. The bill would also permit an in rem civil action to \nbe filed by a trademark owner in the judicial district in which the \nregistrar, registry or other domain name authority that actually \nregistered or assigned the domain name is located. Such an action may \nbe filed only in circumstances where the domain name violates the \nowner's rights in the trademark and where the court finds that (1) the \ntrademark owner was not able to obtain in personam jurisdiction over \nthe domain name registrant; or (2) the owner through due diligence was \nnot able to find the domain name holder to bring an in personam civil \naction by sending notice to the registrant at the postal and email \naddress provided to the registrar and publishing notice as the court \nmay direct promptly after filing the action.\n  The remedies of an in rem action are limited to a court order for \nforfeiture or cancellation of the domain name or the transfer of the \ndomain name to the trademark owner. To protect the domain name \nregistrant, the registrar or registry shall not transfer, suspend, or \nmodify the domain name during the pendency of the action except as the \ncourt may order. By contrast to the House-passed version of this \nlegislation, under the legislation passed today, a trademark holder \nwould be permitted to file an in rem action only when in personam \njurisdiction cannot be exercised.\n  In Porsche Cars North American Inc. v. Porsche.com, 51 F. Supp. 2nd \n707, the court dismissed an in rem action against a domain name, even \nthough Network Solutions Inc. had surrendered the underlying domain \nname registration documents to the court to give it control over the \n``res.'' The court held that in rem actions against allegedly diluting \nmarks are not constitutionally permitted without regard to whether in \npersonam jurisdiction may be exercised, The court explained:\n\n       Porsche correctly observes that some of the domain names at \n     issue have registrants whose identities and addresses are \n     unknown and against whom in personam proceedings might be \n     fruitless. But most of the domain names in this case have \n     registrants whose identities and addresses are known, and \n     who rightly would object to having their interests \n     adjudicated in absentia. The Due Process Clause requires \n     at least some appreciation for the difference between \n     these two groups, and Porsche's pursuit of an in rem \n     remedy that fails to differentiate between them at all is \n     fatal to its Complaint.\n\n  This legislation does differentiate between those two different \ncategories of domain name registrants and limits in rem actions to \nthose circumstances where in personam jurisdiction cannot be obtained.\n  Liability Limitations. The bill would limit the liability for \nmonetary damages and, in certain circumstances, for injunctive relief \nof domain name registrars, registries or other domain name registration \nauthorities for any action they take to refuse to register, remove from \nregistration, transfer, temporarily disable or permanently cancel a \ndomain name, where the action is taken pursuant to a court order or in \nthe implementation of reasonable policies prohibiting the registration \nof domain names that are identical or confusingly similar to another's \ntrademark, or dilutive of a famous trademark.\n  Prevention of Reverse Domain Name Hijacking. Reverse domain name \nhijacking is an effort by a trademark owner to take a domain name from \na domain name registrant who registered the domain name legitimately \nand in good faith. There have been some well-publicized cases of \ntrademark owners demanding the take-down of certain web sites set up by \nparents who have registered their children's names in the .org domain, \nsuch as two year old Veronica Sam's ``Little Veronica'' website and 12 \nyear old Chris ``Pokey'' Van Allen's web page.\n  In order to protect the rights of domain name registrants in their \ndomain names, the legislation provides that registrants may recover \ndamages, including costs and attorney's fees, incurred as a result of a \nknowing and material misrepresentation by a person that a domain name \nis identical or similar to, or dilutive of, a trademark. Moreover, \nshould the domain name registrant prevail in a suit for cybersquatting, \nthe registrant as the prevailing party is authorized to award costs and \nattorneys' fees.\n\n  In addition, a domain name registrant, whose domain name has been \nsuspended, disabled or transferred, may sue upon notice to the mark \nowner, to establish that the registration or use of the domain name by \nthe registrant is lawful. The court in such a suit is authorized to \ngrant injunctive relief, including the reactivation of a domain name or \nthe transfer or return of a domain name to the domain name registrant.\n  Personal Names. Commercial sites are not the only ones suffering at \nthe hands of domain name pirates. This issue has struck home for many \nin this body. The Congress is not immune: while cspan.org provides \ndetailed coverage of the Senate and House, cspan.net is a pornographic \nsite. Moreover, Senators and presidential hopefuls are finding that \ndomain names like bush2000.org and hatch2000.org are being snatched up \nby cyber poachers intent on reselling these domain names for a tidy \nprofit.\n  This legislation addresses this problem by making liable a domain \nname registrant in a civil action for injunctive relief, including \nforfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of a domain name for registering \nthe name of another living person with the specific intent to profit by \nselling the domain name for financial gain to that person or any third \nparty. This provision applies only prospectively.\n  In addition, the legislation directs the Commerce Department in \nconsultation with PTO and the Federal Election Commission to study and \nreport to Congress on procedures for resolving disputes over personal \nnames registered as domain names and to collaborate with ICANN on these \nprocedures.\n  Cybersquatting is an important issue both for trademark holders and \nfor the future of electronic commerce on the Internet. Any legislative \nsolution to cybersquatting must tread carefully to ensure that \nauthorized remedies do not impede or stifle the free flow of \ninformation on the Internet. In many ways, the United States has been \nthe incubator of the World Wide Web, and the world closely watches \nwhenever we venture into laws, customs or standards that affect the \nInternet. We must only do so with great care and caution. Fair use \nprinciples are just as critical in cyberspace as in any other \nintellectual property arena. In my view, this legislation respects \nthese considerations.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today as the Senate \nfinishes its consideration of the last in a package of four very \nimportant intellectual property related ``high-tech'' bills that Senate \nLeahy and I introduced earlier this year. Three of those bills--the \n``Trademark Amendments Act of 1999,'' the ``Patent Fee Integrity and \nInnovation Protection Act of 1999,'' and a Copyright Act technical \ncorrections bill--were passed by the House and Senate and signed into \nlaw in August of this year. The fourth of those bills--the ``Digital \nTheft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement Act'' (S. 1257)--was \npassed by the House with an amendment and returned to the Senate. Each \nof these bills is designed to promote the continued growth of vital \nsectors of the American economy and to protect the interests and \ninvestment of the entrepreneurs, authors, and innovators who fuel their \ngrowth.\n  Technology continues to be the driving force in the American economy \ntoday, and American technology is setting new standards for the global \neconomy, from semiconductor chip technology, to computer software, \nInternet\n\n[[Page S15027]]\n\nand telecommunications technology, to leading pharmaceutical and \ngenetic research. In my own state of Utah, these information technology \nindustries contribute in excess of $7 billion each year to the State's \neconomy and pay wages that average 66 percent higher than the state \naverage. Their performance has placed Utah among the world's top ten \ntechnology centers according to Newsweek Magazine. Similar success is \nseen in areas across the country, with the U.S. being home to seven of \nthe world's top ten technology centers and with American creative \nindustries now surpassing all other export sectors in foreign sales and \nexports.\n  Underlying all of these technologies are the intellectual property \nrights that serve to promote creativity and innovation by safeguarding \nthe investment, effort, and goodwill of those who venture into these \nfast-paced and volatile fields. Strong intellectual property \nprotections are particularly critical in the global high-tech \nenvironment where electronic piracy is so easy, so cheap, and yet so \npotentially devastating to intellectual property owners--many of which \nare small entrepreneurial enterprises. In Utah, 65 percent of these \ncompanies have fewer than 25 employees, and a majority have annual \nrevenues of less than $1 million. Intellectual property is the \nlifeblood of these companies, and even a single instance of piracy \ncould drive them out of business. What's more, without adequate \ninternational protection, these companies would simply be unable to \ncompete in the global marketplace.\n  That is why we enacted a number of measures last year to provide \nenhanced protection for intellectual property in the new global, high-\ntech environment. For example, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act \n(DMCA) implemented two new World Intellectual property Organization \nTreaties setting new global standards for copyright protection in the \ndigital environment. We also paved the way for new growth in online \ncommerce by providing a copyright framework in which the Internet and \nother new technologies can flourish.\n\n  The ``Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement \nAct'' builds upon those protections by raising the Copyright Act's \nlimit on statutory damages to make it more costly to engage in cyber-\npiracy and copyright theft. Section 504(c) of the Copyright Act \nprovides for the award of statutory damages at the plaintiff's election \nin order to provide greater security for owners, who often find it \ndifficult to prove actual damages in infringement cases--particularly \nin the electronic environment--and to provide greater deterrence for \nwould-be infringers. The current provision caps statutory damages at \n$20,000 ($100,000 in cases of willful infringement), which reflects \nfigures set in statute in 1988 when the United States joined the Berne \nConvention. The combination of more than a decade of inflation and \nrevolutionary changes in technology have rendered those figures largely \ninadequate to achieve their aims. The bill before us updates these \nstatutory damage provisions to account for both these factors.\n  Under the bill, the cap on statutory damages is increased by 50 \npercent, from $20,000 to $30,000, and the minimum is similarly \nincreased from $500 to $750. For cases of willful infringement, the cap \nis raised to $150,000. This will not mean that a court must impose the \nfull amount of damages in any given case, or even that it will be more \nlikely to do so. In most cases, courts attempt to do justice by fixing \nthe statutory damages at a level that approximates actual damages and \ndefendant's profits. What this bill does is give courts wider \ndiscretion to award damages that are commensurate with the harm caused \nand the gravity of the offense. At the same time, the bill preserves \nprovisions of the current law allowing the court to reduce the award of \nstatutory damages to as little as $200 in cases of innocent \ninfringement and requiring the court to remit damages in certain cases \ninvolving nonprofit educational institutions, libraries, archives, or \npublic broadcasting entities.\n  The House of Representatives amend the bill to include an amendment \nto the ``No Electronic Theft (NET) Act.'' The NET Act--enacted to curb \ndigital piracy by expanding criminal copyright infringement to include \ncertain electronic infringements done without an intent to profit--\ndirected the U.S. Sentencing Commission to revise the sentencing \nguidelines for crimes against intellectual property to ensure that the \napplicable guideline range is sufficiently stringent to deter such \ncrimes and to provide for consideration of the retail value and \nquantity of the infringed upon items with respect to which the crime \nagainst intellectual property was committed. This directive, and its \nspecificity, reflected the concern on the part of Congress that the \nexisting guidelines' reliance on the value of the infringing items \n(i.e., the street value of a bootlegged video) both underestimates the \ntrue economic harm inflicted on copyright owners and results in \npenalties that are so disproportionately low that U.S. attorneys are \nsimply unwilling to prosecute such cases. Despite Congress' directive, \nthe old guidelines remain in place unamended. The result is that today, \nnearly two years later, there has been only one case brought under the \nNET Act, and electronic piracy continues as a significant and growing \nconcern.\n  The House amendment to S. 1257 would revise the outstanding NET Act \ndirective to require the Sentencing Commission to amend the sentencing \nguidelines to provide an enhancement based upon the retail price of the \nlegitimate items that are infringed upon and the quantity of the \ninfringing items, as well as to require the Commission to act within a \nset time. While the proposed revision is consistent with Congress' \nintent to strengthen the sentencing guidelines applicable to \nintellectual property-related crimes and to better reflect the economic \nharm in cases of electronic piracy, there was some concern that the \namended guidelines would overstate economic harm or have other \nunintended consequences with respect to infringements not involving \ndigital reproductions.\n  The amendment Senator Leahy and I are offering today--which is the \nresult of many hours of discussions and the subject of widespread \nagreement--will leave the existing NET Act directive unchanged, but \nwill require the Commission to act on that directive within the later \nof 120 days from the bill's enactment or 120 days from the first date \non which there are sufficient voting members of the Sentencing \nCommission to constitute a quorum. I expect that the Sentencing \nCommission will move expeditiously once its commissioners are in place \nto complete revision of the applicable sentencing guidelines as \ndirected by the NET ACT, and that it will do so in a manner that is \nconsistent with Congress' intent to provide improved deterrence in this \narea.\n  In sum, this bill is an important high-tech measure that will spur \ncreativity and enhance protection for American copyrighted works at \nhome and abroad. I want to thank Senator Leahy for his assistance, \ncooperation, and leadership in this process, and I look forward to the \nSenate swiftly passing this bill with the Hatch-Leahy Amendment.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, For years the American people have become \nincreasingly cynical about our federal government and apathetic about \npolitical participation. There are many reasons for this unfortunate \nstate of affairs. This year's budget exemplifies several.\n  One reason is our inability to do what every family and business must \ndo, balance our budget. After years of large, chronic deficits, last \nyear we finally, if barely, balanced the federal budget. If great care \nis not taken, the budget will not be balanced for long.\n  Another reason is Washington's unwillingness to be honest with the \nAmerican people. This budget is only the latest example. Proponents \nclaim it is balanced. It is not. They say it does not raid social \nsecurity, but it does. It purports to meet certain ``emergencies'', \nwhen no reasonable person could possibly consider them such. It's time \nwe ended this ``business as usual'' in Washington and began to regain \nthe trust of the American people.\n  I oppose this bill because it spends too much and uses gimmicks that \nwill make future budgets even more difficult. It ignores the greatest \nfinancial challenge facing our nation, entitlement reform, and makes \nmatters even worse by taking money from the Social Security Trust Fund \nto pay for spending today. It foreshadows a return of\n\n[[Page S15028]]\n\nchronic deficits. If we must resort to such foolishness when times are \ngood, what will happen when times are tough? It makes the prospect of \nmeaningful tax cuts much more remote because it spends the surplus and \nthen some.\n  There are circumstances that could justify my support for this budget \nand some of the items that I object to. But none exist now. If \nmeaningful entitlement reform had been included. If the economy were \nweak and the gimmicks were only temporary expedients, not the permanent \nfixtures they promise to be. If we had a few more years, not just one, \nof balanced budgets under our belt. There are several good things in \nthis budget, things I strongly support: funding for 100,000 additional \nteachers in our classrooms, putting 50,000 additional police officers \non our streets, relief for hospitals and other providers from excessive \nMedicare cuts, enhanced Land and Water Conservation funds, expanded \nbiomedical research through NIH, expanded Head Start and increased \nAfter School Care.\n  All of these have merit. All should be done. But we must have the \nhonesty and integrity to pay for them, or the restraint to wait until \nwe can, and not just perpetuate the cynicism created by annual budget \ncharades.\n  I look forward to voting for a future budget. One that preserves and \nstrengthens the foundation of financial security so important to our \nnation's well-being. Even more, I look forward to that day when this \nCongress enjoys the respect and admiration of our fellow citizens. This \nbudget will not hasten that day.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today is a historic day in the United \nStates Senate. With the inclusion of the Superfund Recycling Equity Act \nin the 1999 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, we have righted a wrong to the \nrecycling industry of this Nation. We have removed the Superfund bias \nagainst recycled materials and set this country back on a path to \npromoting reuse of all recyclable materials. The Superfund Recycling \nEquity Act of 1999 will finally place traditional recyclable materials \nwhich are used as feedstocks in the manufacturing process on an equal \nfooting with their virgin, or primary feedstock, counterparts. \nTraditional recyclables are made from paper, glass, plastic, metals, \nbatteries, textiles, and rubber.\n  Mr. President, we have been working to right this wrong for over six \nyears. During the 103d Congress, I first introduced a bill to relieve \nlegitimate recyclers of scrap metal from unintended Superfund \nliability. The bill was developed in conjunction with the recycling \nindustry, the environmental community, and the Administration. We \nworked closely together and consistently agreed that liability relief \nfor recyclers is necessary and right. The language in this bill is the \nculmination of a process that we have been working on since 1993.\n  As I'm sure you can see, Mr. President, the push to relieve these \nlegitimate recyclers of this unintended liability has received broad, \nbipartisan support. This bill has received 67 co-sponsors in the Senate \nthis year and thanks to the strong leadership of Senators Lott, \nDaschle, Chafee, and Warner, we have successfully brought this \nimportant piece of legislation to the floor.\n  Mr. President, as the sponsoring member of this legislation when I \nwas a member of the House of Representatives, I would like to make a \ncouple of important points. First, this Superfund Recycling Equity Act \nis both retroactive and prospective. Slightly different standards must \nbe met for recyclers to be relieved of Superfund liability for \nrecycling transactions that occurred prior to the date of enactment \nthan for those that occur after the date of enactment. But in either \nscenario, legitimate recyclers of paper, glass, plastic, metals, \ntextiles, and rubber will no longer be treated as if they were \n``arranging for the disposal'' of materials containing hazardous \nsubstances each time they sell their materials as manufacturing \nfeedstocks. Rather, they will be treated as if they were selling a \nproduct, which is the same standard to which suppliers of virgin \nmaterials are held. Virgin materials are in direct competition with \nrecyclables and this legislation will help to increase recycling in our \nnation.\n  Recognizing that this issue has been the focus of much litigation, \nthe Congress intended that the recycling situation be clarified through \nthe Superfund Recycling Equity Act. That is why we have written this \nlegislation in such a fashion that virtually all lawsuits that deal \nwith recycling transactions of paper, glass, plastic, metals, textiles, \nand rubber are extinguished by this legislation. Only those lawsuits \nbrought prior to enactment of this legislation directly by the United \nStates government against a person will remain viable. All other \nlawsuits brought by private parties, or against third party defendants \nin lawsuits originally brought by the U.S. Government will no longer \nproceed under this legislation. This will resolve the inequities \nsuffered by recyclers in a quick, fair, and equitable manner.\n  It should also be reiterated that this bill addresses the product of \nrecyclers, that is the recyclables they sell which are utilized to make \nnew products. This does not affect liability for contamination that is \ncreated at a facility owned or operated by a recycler. Neither does it \naffect liability related to any process wastes sent by a recycler for \ntreatment or disposal. In order to assure that only bonafide recycling \nfacilities benefit from this bill, a number of tests have been \nestablished within the bill by which liability relief will be denied to \nsham recyclers.\n  With the passage of this important legislation, we have taken a bold \nstep in the right direction for America. We have taken a step to \npromote legitimate recycling and to put recycled materials on an equal \nfooting with new materials.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as original co-sponsors of the Safe Senior \nAssurance Study Act of 1999 (S. 818), Senator Reid and I wish to \nexpress, for the record, our gratification for the language contained \nin the conference report on H.R. 3194 concerning physician supervision \nof anesthesia services under Medicare's Conditions of Participation.\n  We read the report as calling upon the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to base her determination as to appropriate supervision \nstandards on sound scientific outcome data--a principle which is at the \ncore of S. 818, which was to assure that Medicare beneficiaries will \ncontinue to receive the highest quality medical care--one which I am \nsure is shared by every member of this body--and the Senator from \nNevada and I think adoption of the report will help us attain this \nobjective.\n  Preliminary data from recent outcome research has suggested that \nsupervision of anesthesia care by physicians trained in that discipline \nrepresents an important factor in anesthesia safety, and we want to be \ncertain that the Secretary takes the final results of this research \ninto account. Medicare beneficiaries have resoundingly said, in \nresponse to recent national surveys, that they favor retention of the \ncurrent supervision rule, and in our view, any change in that rule must \nbe supported by scientific data showing that anesthesia safety for our \nnation's seniors would not be impaired. We congratulate the committees \nwith jurisdiction over Medicare in the House and Senate for their clear \ncommitment to this view.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as the Senate finally concludes its work \nfor the legislative year, I want to outline my position on a few of the \nfinal issues. Unfortunately, I needed to travel back to Washington \nstate to attend the funeral of my good friend and mentor, Pat McMullen, \nand missed three votes.\n  Before leaving, I voted in favor of the ``motion to proceed'' to the \nomnibus appropriations bill, which also included fixes to the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 and the tax extenders package. With that vote, I \nregistered my support for this important funding and corrections bill. \nI also would have voted in favor of the Work Incentives Act.\n  First, I would like to address just some important provisions in the \nomnibus appropriations bill. There are many things that we do here that \nhave little direct impact on the lives of real people and real \nfamilies. However, this legislation is one of those times when we act \nto provide real help and real hope to working families, children and \nour senior citizens.\n  The package that we are about to enact, provides an additional $2 \nbillion\n\n[[Page S15029]]\n\ninvestment in the National Institutes of Health (NIH). There are few \npeople in this country who are not touched in some way by the research \nsupported by NIH. An additional $2 billion keeps us on track to \ndoubling our investment in medical research. Research that saves lives \nand prevents human suffering. Our investment has already brought us \ncloser to finding a cure for devastating diseases like Parkinson's, \nleukemia, heart disease, and breast cancer. We must continue this \ncommitment as this investment is about saving dollars and lives. The \nimpact on Washington state is also significant. I am proud of the fact \nthat Washington state is one of the top recipients of NIH grants. The \noutstanding research being conducted at research institutions like the \nUniversity of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center \nare known throughout the world. We are truly a world leader in medical \nresearch.\n  This appropriations package will also provide additional resources to \nimprove access to quality health care for the uninsured and the most \nvulnerable. The additional funding for the Centers for Disease Control \n(CDC) and the additional $100 million provided for Community Health and \nMigrant Health Care Centers provide a critical health care safety net \nfor those working families who simply cannot afford insurance. There \nare more than 80 clinics in Washington state providing quality, \naffordable health care services who will be able to expand and meet the \ngrowing needs of the uninsured populations.\n  I am pleased we have been successful in providing, for the first \ntime, a direct appropriation to support poison control efforts and \neducation and training for Children's Hospitals. I have been a long \ntime proponent of these efforts and recognize the importance of this \ninvestment in our children.\n  Overall, this appropriations package includes a $34.5 billion \ninvestment in health care programs. This investment will strengthen the \npublic health infrastructure, provide essential prevention and \ntreatment services to individuals with mental illness and ensure that \nour senior citizens are not forgotten. The additional $45 million \nprovided to support Older Americans Act programs ensures that we can \nhonor our commitment to our nation's elderly by providing important \nservices like nutritional assistance, employment training, respite \ncare, in-home care, and abuse prevention.\n\n  In addition, as part of this appropriations bill, we have succeeded \nin saving quality health care for millions of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe corrections to the Balanced Budget Act address the unintended \nconsequences of the reductions called for in 1997. Then, we anticipated \na total of $100 billion over five years to ensure Medicare's solvency. \nUnfortunately, our estimates have proven incorrect and we were facing \nwell over $200 billion in reductions which are impacting quality care \nfor millions of seniors and the disabled. The BBA97 corrections provide \nadditional resources for home health care, skilled nursing facilities, \nnursing homes, hospitals, cancer treatment centers, teaching hospitals \nlike the University of Washington, community health care centers, \nrehabilitation services, and health maintenance organizations. This one \ntime correction will prevent the closing of facilities or home health \ncare agencies and does not jeopardize our goal of solvency for the \nMedicare Trust Fund. I know from my own health care providers and my \nown hospitals what this fix means. I also know that without it, rural \nhealth care was in real jeopardy. I told my constituents that I would \nnot leave for the year until we acted to address the looming crisis. \nThis has been accomplished in a bipartisan and comprehensive manner.\n  I would also like to address the tax extenders package included in \nthis bill. I generally support the tax extenders package. It includes \nthe expansion of some tax credits that I have strongly supported over \nthe years. First, the research and experimentation tax credit \nrepresents a critical investment for our nation. If we are to continue \ncreating more and higher-paying jobs for American workers, we must \nencourage the business community to invest in research and development. \nThis bill does just that. I have cosponsored two bills to make the R \ntax credit permanent, so I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto make that happen.\n  I am also pleased this legislation includes extensions of the \nWelfare-to-Work Tax Credit and the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which \nhelp us move toward our goal of ensuring that all Americans benefit \nfrom the new economy.\n  This extenders package also includes an extension of employer \nprovided educational assistance. I am disappointed the package does not \ninclude compensation for graduate school assistance. I believe this \ncommission is short-sighted. At a time when the American economy is so \nrapidly changing, we need to ensure that our workforce is able to meet \nthe demands of the new economy.\n  Our tax code should also reflect our commitment to cleaner energy. \nWhile this package extends the wind and biomass tax credit, it does not \nexpand the definition of biomass to include open loop biomass. \nMeanwhile, it expands the code to include incentives for the production \nof energy from chicken waste. I have no doubt that some of my \ncolleagues are trying to address legitimate animal waste issues in \ntheir states. However, if the code is to be expanded, it should be \nexpanded to include open loop biomass. If Congress considers major tax \nlegislation next year, this should be a top priority.\n  While the efforts I have mentioned above help businesses and the \npoor, the bill also helps middle class Americans. In 1997, we passed \nimportant non-refundable tax credits, like the child tax credit, that \nhave greatly benefitted the middle class. This legislation will ensure \nfamilies can continue to use these credits without being affected by \nthe alternative minimum tax.\n  Finally, the Senate passed another piece of important legislation \ntoday: the Work Incentives Act. The WIA bill rewards those disabled \nindividuals who want to go back to work but face the prospect of \nfalling off the so called ``health care cliff.'' We have been \nsuccessful in treating many illnesses and injuries that once \npermanently disabled workers. They may not be cured but can be \nproductive. Unfortunately, if they do try and return to work they lose \ntheir link to life, their health insurance. This legislation, of which \nI am proud to have been an original cosponsor, will allow workers to \nreturn to work and continue to receive Medicare. It will also allow \nmany to buy-in to Medicaid. This legislation is not just about giving \npeople the chance to return to some kind of productive life. It is \nabout saving precious dollars as well. Workers who give up their Social \nSecurity disability payments to go back to work will be paying taxes \nand contributing to the Social Security and Medicare Trust Fund. This \nis a win-win for all of us. It is also the kind of policy that simply \nmakes sense. People should not be penalized for trying to go back to \nwork.\n  Mr. President, I have voted in support of the motion to proceed to \nthis omnibus appropriations, B.B.A. of '97, and tax extenders package. \nI am particularly pleased we have been able to secure yet another year \nof commitment to our children by helping reduce class sizes in the \nearly grades. I will be working hard to ensure this important program \nis authorized in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act next year. \nI must also note extreme disappointment in the decision to pit United \nNations dues against women's reproductive health care. I remain \ncommitted to family planning throughout the world and will be working \nwith the administration to ensure the United States continues to lead \nthe way in protecting women's health, including our reproductive \nhealth.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support \nfor this final Appropriations package. This is a good package that \nprotects the Social Security surplus from being raided to pay for non-\nSocial Security spending, that provides sufficient funds for important \nnational programs, and which addresses critical issues specifically for \nMichigan. I trust that the President will be able to sign this quickly \nand get these Fiscal Year 2000 funds to the programs that will disburse \nthem to Michiganians as soon as possible.\n   Mr. President, I am confident that this package will not raid the \nSocial Security surplus as has been the norm for almost 30 years. The \nCongressional Leadership and the Administration\n\n[[Page S15030]]\n\nhave crafted a package of appropriations and offsets that will not \ntouch the Social Security surplus The precise bookkeeping agreed upon \nby the Administration and Congress used in this bill will help regulate \nhow these funds are actually spent by the government, so that we don't \nspend the Social Security surplus. These aren't gimmicks, but finely \ncrafted tools necessary for the Office of Management and Budget to \nensure that bureaucrats don't spend their funds faster than Congress \nintended, so as to protect the Social Security surplus.\n  However, for those that are concerned that such tools could \npotentially be insufficient to control the rate of spending, and may in \nfact lead to the government dipping into the Social Security surplus, I \nwill carefully track the revenue and outlay totals for the Federal \nGovernment over the next few months. And if it appears that we are \nfalling behind in maintaining a sufficient buffer to protect the Social \nSecurity surplus, then I will immediately introduce and push for as \nlarge of a rescission package as necessary to prevent that from \noccurring. But that, in my opinion, will not be necessary. Already for \nthe first month of Fiscal Year 2000, the Congressional Budget Office is \nreporting that we are running $6.4 billion ahead of last year, or \nalmost $77 billion more in net revenue than last year. Considering the \nCBO estimated that net revenues would actually drop by $1 billion \nbetween Fiscal Years 1999 and 2000, I believe we will have more than \nenough of a non-Social Security surplus buffer to accommodate even the \nworst case assumptions that CBO may put forward.\n  As a specific note, Mr. President, one of the tools used to control \nspending in this package is an across-the-board 0.38 percent cut in \ndiscretionary spending. Although I would rather see specific cuts to \nachieve the $1.3 billion in fiscal discipline provided by this cut, \nsuch as cutting in half the funding for the Space Station, this is a \nmodest enough cut to be palatable, especially considering the \nsignificant latitude given the executive agencies in finding these \ncuts. However, because of the vagaries of the budget process, the pay \nof Congressional Members has been exempted from this cut. I cannot \nsupport such unequal treatment, and declare that I will return an equal \nproportion of my Senatorial pay to the Department of Treasury. Nothing \nelse would be fair.\n  But this package is not just about what it does not do. Mr. \nPresident, this appropriations package does a great deal of good as \nwell. It increases funding for Head Start by over 10%, while providing \nover $35 billion for education in general, including funds for 100,000 \nnew teachers while also significantly expanding the discretion local \nschool districts will have to use that money for teacher testing and \nquality training. It will put 50,000 more police on our streets as well \nas providing over $2.1 billion for assistance programs to local law \nenforcement agencies. The National Institute of Health will see its \nfunding increased by 15% to almost $18 billion, while important high-\ntech legislation that I sponsored to stop the poaching of corporate and \nidentifiable World Wide Web address names by unscrupulous profiteers \nand carpet-baggers does not continue unimpeded.\n  And maybe most significantly, the unintended effects upon Medicare \nand Medicaid of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, as well as the onerous \nadditional regulations levied by the Health Care Financing Agency in \nimplementing that Act, will be softened through the provision of over \n$27 billion in additional health care funds over the next 10 years. \nThis will provide specific relief for Michigan's hospitals by easing \nthe reductions in the reimbursements they receiving for treating our \nMedicare beneficiaries in Michigan, and thereby expanding the access \nfor quality medical care. It will also increase the unrealistically low \nreimbursement rates set for Skilled Nursing Facility care, while also \nensuring that the arbitrary $1,500 per patient cap on physical and \nrehabilitative therapy set by the Administration is not allowed to deny \nour seniors the help they need to recover from such debilitating \nconditions as strokes and severe heart conditions. It improves the \nability of women to receive pap smear tests, provides greater access to \nrenal dialysis treatment, while also making immunosuppressive drugs \nmore readily available. And it provides very much needed protection for \nRural Health Clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers from \ncapricious reductions in their reimbursements, thereby allowing them to \nprotect the uninsured and Medicare dependent population that they \noverwhelmingly serve.\n\n  But, Mr. President, this package is good for Michigan is well as our \nnation. A number of issues that significantly affect my constituents \nare addressed in this package. Our unique Great Lakes environment is \nprotected through the continued funding of the Great Lakes \nEnvironmental Research Laboratory, increased funding for the Great \nLakes Fishery Commission, Sea Lamprey control, and Sea Grant Research \nfunds, as well as funding for a new simulator at the Great Lakes \nMaritime Academy in Traverse City to ensure our commercial shipping \nmaintains its peerless safety record. This appropriations package funds \nworthy projects such as Detroit's Focus:HOPE information technology \ntraining program for the city's poorest residents, Central Michigan's \ncharter school and education performance institute, Northern Michigan's \nOlympics Training Facility, and almost $2.5 million in funding to \nprotect and preserve Isle Royale National Park and Keweenaw National \nHistorical Park. This bill brings new Tribal funding for a new band of \nthe Pottawatomi Indians and $15 million more in PILT (Payment in Lieu \nof Taxes) funds which are desperately needed by Michigan's more rural \ncounties. And on the international front, this package provides almost \n$2 million to support the Middle East Peace Process through the Wye \nRiver Accord agreement, as well as a number of policy and funding \ninitiatives overseas such as continued support for Armenia in its \ndispute over Nagorno-Karabakh and the further development of education \nand infrastructure in Lebanon.\n  Mr. President, many will try to make political hay out of opposing \nthis bill for this or that various reason. But on the whole, this final \nappropriations package achieves three very important goals: it stops \nthe 30-year raid by big Washington spenders on the Social Security \nTrust Fund, it adequately funds important national priorities, and it \naddresses several specific programs in Michigan important to my \nconstituents. We were sent to Washington to govern, Mr. President, and \nat this point in the session, I asked myself if I was going to be an \neffective legislator, or simply a politician. I'm glad I chose the \nformer in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the appropriation for the Department of \nEducation includes an additional $134 million, added during final \nnegotiations over the bill, to promote school accountability and \nimprovement under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965, which funds educational services to educationally \ndisadvantaged children. These funds will provide critical resources to \nschools most in need--those in need of improvement and identified for \ncorrective action under Title I.\n  Dedicated funds are necessary to develop improvement strategies and \nto hold schools accountable for continuous student improvement. The \nfederal government directs over $8 billion dollars of federal funding \nto provide critical support programs for disadvantaged students under \nTitle I, but the accountability provisions in Title I have not been \nadequately implemented due to insufficient resources. Title I \nauthorizes state school support teams to provide support for schoolwide \nprograms and to provide assistance to schools in need of improvement \nthrough activities such as professional development or identifying \nresources for changing instruction and organization. In 1998, only \neight states reported that school support terms have been able to serve \nthe majority of schools identified as in need of improvement. Less than \nhalf of the schools identified as being in need of improvement in 1997-\n98 reported that this designation led to additional professional \ndevelopment or assistance. Schools and school districts need additional \nsupport and resources to address weaknesses soon after they are \nidentified, promote a progressively intensive range of interventions \nand continuously assess the results of interventions.\n  The money provided in this appropriations bill can be used to ensure\n\n[[Page S15031]]\n\nthat school districts have necessary resources available to implement \nthe corrective action provisions of Title I, by providing immediate, \nintensive interventions to turn around low-performing schools. The \ntypes of intervention that the school district could provide using \nthese funds include:\n  (1) Purchasing necessary materials such as up-to-date textbooks, \ncurriculum, technology;\n  (2) Providing intensive, ongoing teacher training.\n  (3) Providing access to distance learning;\n  (4) Extending learning time for students--after school, Saturday or \nsummer school--to help students catch up;\n  (5) Providing rewards to low-performing schools that show significant \nprogress; and\n  (6) Intensive technical assistance from teams of experts outside the \nschool to help develop and implement school improvement plans in \nfailing schools. The terms would determine the causes of low-\nperformance--for example, low expectations and an outdated curriculum, \npoorly trained teachers, unsafe conditions) and assist in implementing \nresearch-based models for improvement.\n  The portion of the bill relating to these additional funds also \nrequires that school districts give students in Title I schools the \noption of transferring to another public school if the schools they \nattend have been identified as in need of improvement. This requirement \napplies only to districts that receive a portion of this additional \nmoney, and not to districts that do not accept these additional funds. \nWhile I have a bill that is supportive of right to transfer at the \ncorrective action stage of the Title I accountability system, it is my \nunderstanding that the language in this appropriation bill apples only \nto schools accepting funding from this new funding source of $134 \nmillion.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is very unfortunate that the Senate \nfinds itself in virtually the same position as we did last year with \nappropriations matters. As my colleagues will recall, we voted on a \ngiant omnibus appropriations bill which contained eight appropriations \nbills, plus numerous other authorizing legislation. It ran on for \nnearly 4,000 pages and weighed in at some 40 pounds. It was called a \n``gargantuan monstrosity'' by the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd.\n  But it was a monstrosity not just because of its length. It was also \nin the size of its insult to the democratic process, to individual \nSenators, and to the people they represent.\n  It was bad enough that no Senator was able to read the bill before \nthey were required to vote on it. Worse still was the fact the bill was \npresented to the Senate in a ``take it or leave it'' form. No \namendments were permitted. Every Senator was effectively muzzled.\n  I voted against that bill. Not because it didn't contain good \nprovisions, good for the country, and good for my State of Montana. It \ndid. I opposed that bill because writing such an important piece of \nlegislation should not be done behind closed doors among a small group \nof people with no recourse for the others. I said at the time that the \nprocess dangerously disenfranchised most Senators, House Members, and \nthe American people.\n  Many of my colleagues agreed with my sentiments then. And there were \nstatements that this would not happen again. But it has.\n  True, this bill is somewhat shorter. It covers only five \nappropriations bills, not eight. It has fewer authorizing bills \nattached to it.\n  However, it still was written largely by a relatively few people, \nmembers of the majority, representatives from the Administration, a few \nmembers of the minority. And all behind closed doors, again.\n  But the bigger danger this year is that we are passing major bills by \nreference. The text of four appropriations bills and four authorizing \nbills appears nowhere in this bill. Instead, this bill provides for \ntheir enactment by referring to them by number and date of \nintroduction, which just so happens to be less than 48 hours ago.\n  Members of the Senate do not have this language before them. Even if \nwe could offer amendments, how would we do it? How can you amend a bill \nthat is included only by reference? Even more fundamentally, will bills \nthat are enacted into law ``by reference'' withstand a Constitutional \nchallenge that they violate the presentment clause?\n  The courts will have to decide the Constitutional issues. But it is \none more reason why I believe this is a very dangerous process. It \nfurther erodes the rights of the minority, indeed the rights of all \nSenators. Coming, as I do, from a state with a small population, we \ndepend greatly on the Senate to protect our states' interest, something \nthat cannot always be done in the House of Representatives, where \npopulation determines voting power.\n  Mr. President, we already face a population that is increasingly \ncynical of government and those who serve it. People believe more and \nmore that government does not look after their interests, but only \nafter special interests. And the more we operate behind closed doors, \nwithout an open, public process, the more we feed that cynicism. And \nthe more we encourage mistrust.\n  That is not healthy for our democracy or our people. One of the best \nthings Montanans did when we rewrote our State constitution in 1972 was \nto require open government, at all levels. It has helped keep \ngovernment officials honest and helped the people have faith in that \ngovernment. I wish this process were as open.\n  Someday, I hope that the Congress will return to the open process on \nappropriations bills and authorizing bills we had not so long ago. We \ncould debate issues, offer amendments, make compromises, win, lose. But \nall in front of the people.\n  But this bill goes too far in the other direction and therefore, I \ncannot support it.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, as we near the end of this session of \nCongress, there are some accomplishments we should celebrate and some \ndisappointments we should work to remedy in the next session of the \n106th Congress. While there are many items in the appropriations and \ntax bills that benefit our nation, there are a few I'd like to \nhighlight. This year's final budget package will continue to provide \nmore crime reduction and school safety funding so our children are \nsafer in their neighborhoods and in their schools. It will continue our \nefforts to reduce class size so our children get more individualized \nattention from a top-quality teacher. And it will provide what I hope \nwill be the first installment of school modernization funding so that \nour children's schools are safe and equipped for the future.\n  With the passage of the appropriations and tax measures this session, \nCongress will uphold its commitment to continue reducing crime on our \nstreets and in our schools. We've come a long way from the original \nSenate committee bill that would have killed the COPS initiative, which \nhas placed 100,000 new police officers in our communities since 1994. \nThis year's appropriations bill provides enough funding to hire another \n50,000 officers over the next few years, and it sets aside $225 million \nin Department of Justice funding for school safety initiatives. The \nfirst obligation of government is to provide for the safety of every \nman, woman, and child, and I believe our funding levels for COPS and \nschool safety programs live up to that obligation.\n  We will also be living up to the commitment we made last year to hire \n100,000 new teachers so our children's class sizes are smaller and \ntheir individual time with their teachers is greater. We made a down \npayment last year and hired 29,000 teachers. This year, we will provide \n$1.3 billion to states so we can keep those teachers in the classroom \nand hire even more. But as we all know, school systems can't hire new \nteachers if they don't have the extra classrooms. So, I'm especially \npleased that we have finally recognized the school infrastructure \ncrisis in America.\n  The tax package we will pass today will provide an additional $800 \nmillion in zero interest bonds under the Qualified Zone Academy Bond \nInitiative. These bonds will help our neediest schools renovate \nbuildings that are relics of the past and turn them into schools of the \nfuture. It will help them purchase new equipment--from classroom \ncomputers to new, safe school buses. It will help them train teachers \nand develop challenging curricula to raise expectations and achievement \nscores of our nation's students.\n\n[[Page S15032]]\n\n  The continuation of this school renovation initiative is just one \ncomponent of the school modernization bill I introduced with many \nothers in July, and I am grateful to so many education, labor, and \nprofessional organizations for their unwavering support. I thank my \ncolleagues who co-sponsored the legislation, Rep. Charlie Rangel for \nhis work on similar legislation, and the administration's commitment to \nensuring that our schools are safe and modern havens for learning. \nWe're sending the right message to our nation's school boards, \nteachers, parents, and students: that we see the leaky roofs, that we \nsee the cracked walls, that we see all the trailers--and that we're \nwilling to help.\n  But there remains much unfinished business. Over 14 million children \nattend schools in need of extensive repair or complete replacement. \nTwelve million children attend schools with leaky roofs, and 7 million \nchildren attend schools with safety code violations. Our schools are on \naverage over forty years old. They're overcrowded, they're under-\nequipped with technology, and many are unsafe. In Virginia alone, there \nare over 3,000 trailers being used to hold classes. In short, our \nnational renovation needs total $112 billion and our new construction \nneeds total $73 billion. Given these tremendous needs, I view the $800 \nmillion in the this year's tax package as the first installment of the \nnationwide renovation and modernization of our children's schools.\n  Mr. President, the other major disappointment of this session \nconcerns one of our nation's most important transportation arteries. I \nam quite dismayed that this Congress has not lived up to its \nresponsibility to fund the replacement of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. \nThis is the only federally owned bridge in the entire country. It is a \nmajor gateway in the Washington metropolitan area, and a critical route \nfor commerce along the entire east coast. We have an obligation to \nsupport its replacement.\n  I worked closely with the administration to advance this project, and \nI was gratified by the fact that funding was among the administration's \ntop priorities during the budget negotiations. Unfortunately, however, \nCongress declined to provide funding, so we will revisit the issue next \nyear, when construction is scheduled to begin. We have become all too \nfamiliar with the devastating effects of traffic jams in this area--on \nour economy, on our environment, and most importantly, on our quality \nof life. The unresolved matter of funding for the Woodrow Wilson \nMemorial Bridge project continues to threaten the region, and I intend \nto continue the fight next session to be fiscally responsible and \nresponsive to our region's biggest transportation need.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the two bills we passed today--the tax \nextenders bill and the Omnibus Appropriations Act--like this entire \nsession of Congress, can be summarized by four words: the good, the \nbad, the missing, and the undone.\n  Let me begin with the good, because we have achieved victories on \nseveral important Democratic priorities. Funding for after-school \nprograms was more than doubled. As a result, there will be spaces for \n675,000 young people.\n  In another priority of mine, the days of the sweet deal for the big \noil companies will be over next March 15. At that time, the Interior \nDepartment will finally be allowed to issue a regulation to ensure that \noil companies pay their fair share of oil royalties to the federal \ngovernment when they drill on federal land, ending the $66 million \nannual loss to the taxpayers.\n  I was also pleased to see a 42 percent increase in funding for the \nlands program, known as the Lands Legacy Initiative. Most of this money \nwill be used to acquire lands and historical sites so that they can be \npreserved for future generations.\n  There are other good things as part of the budget agreement: funding \nto reduce elementary school class sizes; putting 6600 cops on the \nstreets and in the schools; paying the arrears the United States owes \nto the United Nations; debt relief for developing countries; full \nfunding for the Middle East Peace Agreement; a $2.3 billion increase in \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health; correcting problems with \nMedicare funding that were part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, so \nthat we ensure seniors continue to have access to health care, \nparticularly home health care and nursing home care; a $108 million \nincrease in funding for nutrition assistance for pregnant women and \ninfants; extension of some important tax credits, including the \nResearch and Experimentation Tax Credit, employer-provided educational \nassistance, and trade adjustment assistance; and most of the anti-\nenvironmental riders were stripped out of the bill or were \nsignificantly weakened.\n  But, Mr. President, despite these good things, I am voting against \nthe bill because of the bad things as well as the things that are \nmissing.\n  First, let me comment on the process. If the Republican controlled \nCongress had done its work and passed the appropriations bills by \nOctober 1, which is what is supposed to happen, we would not have \nneeded these protracted and secretive negotiations that gave undue \npower to just a handful of people. As my colleague from Nebraska said, \nthis whole process turned government ``of the people, by the people, \nand for the people'' into ``government of and by four people''.\n  I want to mention three specific provisions of this bill that I \noppose. First, the funding for international family planning is \ninadequate. We have had level funding for this program for four years \nnow. And on top of that, the omnibus appropriations bill reinstates the \nso-called Mexico City policy that prevents organizations from using \ntheir own, privately-raised money to provide abortion services or to \nlobby against draconian abortion laws. Under the provisions of this \nbill, the President could waive this restriction, but if he does, the \nfunding would be cut $12.5 billion, which could deny contraception to \nover 40,000 women for an entire year.\n  I was also extremely dismayed to find in this bill a provision that \nwould allow pharmacists to deny women in federal health plans \nprescriptions for contraceptive drugs, if they claim a sort of \n``conscientious objector'' status. This is an outrageous assault on the \nright of women to receive the full range of health benefits.\n  Also, this bill contains an absolutely unnecessary--and potentially \ndangerous--across the board spending cut. This cut will affect funding \nfor education and health care and medical research and veterans. It is \na silly way to do business, and it is unnecessary. Congress should have \ndone its job and made the decisions about what is important and what is \nnot.\n  There are also a lot of holes in this legislation, a lot of things \nmissing. These are things that were in there at one point or on the \ntable for discussion, but for some reason were taken out. I am talking \nabout the lack of hate crimes legislation, which passed the Senate. I \nam talking about my amendment, which also passed the Senate \nunanimously, to ban the sale of guns to people who are intoxicated. \nThere is once again no long-term, large-scale commitment to repair \nAmerica's schools. There is no prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare, so that millions of senior citizens will not have to make a \nchoice between medicine and food. There is not enough money for after-\nschool programs. And the rural loan guarantee program for satellite \nTV--something that is crucial to rural communities around the country--\nwas taken out of the bill at the request of one senator.\n  In the category of the undone, this Congress will go home for the \nyear without having acted on several issues of enormous importance to \nall Americans--things that the people have said over and over again \nthey want us to do. This includes: a real patients bill of rights, \ncommon sense gun control, campaign finance reform, and an increase in \nthe minimum wage.\n  Some will say that we could not do these things because we did not \nhave the money. Let me point out that if this Republican-controlled \nCongress had not insisted on increasing the defense budget by about $8 \nbillion more than the President said we needed, then we would have had \nplenty of money to pay for both the well-deserved pay raise for our \nservicemen and women and the priorities I have just talked about.\n  So, Mr. President, I regret that this bill was not all it could have \nbeen and that this Congress did not accomplish all that it should have. \nBut, I look forward to the next session in the hope\n\n[[Page S15033]]\n\nthat we finally address the priorities of the American people.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, to quote Yogi Berra, it's deja vu all over \nagain. A little less than a year ago Congress passed an Omnibus \nAppropriations bill for fiscal year 1999. That legislation combined \neight separate appropriations bills and included $200 billion in \ndiscretionary spending. Last year's Omnibus spending bill also included \n$21 billion in emergency spending--$13 billion of which directly \nreduced the surplus for Fiscal Year 1999 and $5 billion of which \nreduced the surplus for Fiscal Year 2000. Members decried the process \nthat led to last year's bill, threw themselves on the mercy of the \nAmerican public asking forgiveness, and vowed that it would never \nhappen again.\n  One senior Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity about the \nlevel of frustration with last year's budget process, said earlier this \nyear: ``We are looking for ways to avoid what happened last year. We \nare determined not to go through that again this year.'' Unfortunately, \nMr. President, here we are again--only worse. This year's bill clearly \ndemonstrates that Congress has not learned from its past mistakes.\n  What makes this bill even more insidious is that we not only repeat \nlast year's mistakes, but in fact, build upon them with even more \ncreative ways to flaunt fiscal discipline. For that reason, I will \noppose it.\n  Mr. President, I am not alone. I ask unanimous consent immediately \nafter my remarks an editorial which appeared in today's Washington Post \ntitled ``. . . And Brought Forth a Mouse'' be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit 1.)\n  I fully understand, Mr. President, that we work with budget \nprojections that are subject to revision as economic factors change. We \nmust base our decisions, however, using reasonable assumptions of what \nwill occur, not rosy expectations of what the future might bring. The \nbeginning of this congressional session was filled with opportunity--\nopportunity brought about by 5 years of fiscal discipline. That \ndiscipline helped to fuel a strong economy and produce the first budget \nsurplus in more than a generation. Indeed, budget surpluses are \nprojected far into the future.\n  Instead of seizing this opportunity to use those resources in \nimproving our long-term fiscal future, Congress seems content to \nfritter them away on short-term political giveaways. A strong economy \nand favorable budget outlook give Congress a wonderful opportunity to \nmake important investments for our future. What are some of those \ninvestments?\n  Early in 1999, Democrats and Republicans stated that saving Social \nSecurity and strengthening Medicare were the first items of business on \nthis year's legislative agenda. The President made this statement \nduring his State of the Union Address earlier this year:\n  ``Now, last year we wisely reserved all of the surplus until we knew \nwhat it would take to save Social Security. Again, I say, we shouldn't \nspend any of it--not any of it--until after Social Security is truly \nsaved. First things first.''\n  My colleagues may remember that we followed the President's statement \nwith a considerable amount of applause. Both commitments--extending the \nsolvency of Social Security and strengthening Medicare--have been \nignored. Both American political parties are identified co-conspirators \nin this unsavory result. There will be no structural changes to extend \nthe solvency of the Social Security program. In fact, the most positive \nSocial Security achievement we can cite underscores our failure to \nsolve this important problem.\n  The only meaningful step Congress has taken to improve Social \nSecurity is an agreement not to spend the Social Security surplus--an \nagreement, I might add, that we have violated to the tune of $17 \nbillion. The culmination of these negotiations will result in a budget \nthat reduces the federal debt by $130 billion. That debt reduction, \nhowever, would have been $168 billion had we remained true to our \ncommitment to save Social Security first. We could have reduced the \nFederal debt by an additional $38 billion had we not spent the full $21 \nbillion on-budget surplus and $17 billion of the Social Security \nsurplus. But even had we kept this promise, it would have done nothing \nto extend the program's insolvency date of 2034. Accomplishing that \ngoal will require additional resources--resources that could come from \nthe on-budget surpluses as long as they can be preserved.\n  Mr. President, we must hold true to our commitment to ensure Social \nSecurity's solvency until 2075. Our actions on Medicare are even more \ndeplorable. We started this year with the goal of extending the \nsolvency of the Medicare Trust fund and possibly expanding the benefits \nfor beneficiaries, such as providing a prescription drug benefit. \nInstead, however, we've gone backwards. The Medicare benefit package \nhas not been modernized. Efforts to rationalize the program have been \nrejected.\n  Finally, and perhaps most disappointingly, the solvency of the \nHospital Insurance Trust Fund has been reduced by 1 year. Estimates at \nthe beginning of this year placed the date of insolvency for the \nHospital Insurance Trust Fund in Fiscal Year 2015. As a result of the \nunfunded additional Medicare spending included in this bill, the \ninsolvency date has moved forward to Fiscal Year 2014.\n  Not only were we unfaithful to the commitments we made regarding \nSocial Security and Medicare, we missed other opportunities to make \nconstructive use of the on-budget surplus.\n  Mr. President, we could have further strengthened the economy by \npursuing tax reform. We could have made critical investments to protect \nour national treasures such as the National Park system. Or we could \nhave reduced the disgraceful number of Americans, particularly \nchildren, who don't have access to health care. These proposals have \none thing in common--a bold, coherent vision. This final appropriations \nbill and its blizzard of special interest handouts reflects no such \nvision. It contains no bold initiatives worthy of the 21st century. \nInstead it fritters away a substantial portion of the surplus--\nsquandering resources that could instead be used to build a better \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, how did we get here? At the beginning of the year, CBO \nprojected the FY 2000 on-budget surplus to be $21 billion. In May \nCongress passed a supplemental appropriations bill providing $15 \nbillion for reconstruction aid for Central America and the Caribbean, \nassistance to Jordan pursuant to the Wye River accords, farm loan \nassistance, and funding for our operations in Kosovo. Much of the May \nsupplemental bill was designated as an emergency and thus was not \noffset with corresponding spending reductions or revenue increases.\n  The consequence of that legislation was a $15 billion reduction in \nthe non-Social Security surplus--$7 billion of which reduced the FY \n2000 on-budget surplus. Passage of the May Supplemental transformed a \n$21 billion surplus into a $14 billion surplus. In August, Congress \npassed the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture appropriations bill that \nincluded more than $8 billion of ``emergency'' spending. Like the \nSupplemental before it, these ``emergency'' funds were not offset with \ncorresponding spending reductions or revenue increases.\n  Therefore, this spending directly reduced the FY 2000 surplus. A $14 \nbillion on-budget surplus quickly shrunk to $6 billion.\n  In October, Congress considered the appropriations bill covering the \nDefense Department. Incredibly, that legislation designated funding for \nroutine operations and maintenance as an emergency. That designation, \nas with those proceeding it, means that the no offsets were required. \nNo offsets, however, does not mean that the spending does not have a \nreal economic effect. The emergency spending included in the Defense \nAppropriations bill further reduced the Fiscal Year 2000 on-budget \nsurplus by $5 billion, which the next column in my chart illustrates.\n  Mr. President, by the end of October Congress' voracious spending \nreduced the on-budget surplus from $21 billion to $1 billion. With \npassage of this Omnibus appropriations bill, Congress will not only \ncomplete its assault on the on-budget surplus but also begin its raid \non the Social Security surplus.\n\n[[Page S15034]]\n\nThe $21 billion on-budget surplus projected for FY 2000 has vanished. \nIn addition, this Omnibus bill spends $17 billion of the FY 2000 Social \nSecurity surplus.\n  Mr. President, no amount of budget trickery or accounting slight of \nhand can hide these facts. Those attempting to obscure this reality \nwill soon be exposed. At the end of the year the Congressional Budget \nOffice will total up the cost of our actions and tell us how they \naffected the national debt. The debt will no doubt be reduced in Fiscal \nYear 2000. Because of these budgetary tricks and shenanigans, however, \nwe will miss the opportunity to make an even more substantial reduction \nin the national debt and the burden it imposes on our Nation. Worse \nyet, we have already staked claims against the on-budget surpluses \nprojected beyond next year.\n  For example, at the beginning of the fiscal year the discretionary \nspending limit was $572 billion. With this bill, actual spending will \nbe closer to $610 billion. If we assume that Congress maintains this \nlevel of spending--$610 billion--for each of the next ten years, CBO's \nprojected on-budget surplus of $996 billion shrinks by $145 billion. \nThese are the on-budget surpluses CBO projected in July assuming we \nwould adhere to the discretionary spending caps.\n  The orange bars show the surpluses we can expect if we hold freeze \nspending at the levels established for Fiscal Year 2000 for each of the \nnext four years.\n  As my colleagues can see, it is increasingly unlikely that the large \non-budget surpluses over which we salivated throughout the summer will \nmaterialize.\n  In addition, this budget agreement contains other items--Medicare \nspending and tax breaks--which are not offset by either spending \nreductions or additional revenues.\n  The Omnibus appropriations bill includes changes to the Medicare \nreimbursement rules which increase Medicare spending by $1 billion in \nFiscal Year 2000 and $27 billion over the next ten years.\n  That increased spending will come directly out of the Social Security \nsurplus in Fiscal Year 2000 and from the on-budget surplus in later \nyears.\n  This afternoon we will consider a bill to extend certain expired \nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  Earlier this month, the Senate passed legislation that extended these \nprovisions on a fiscally responsible basis.\n  That bill was fully offset, and as such, would not have jeopardized \nthe on-budget surplus.\n  I regret that the product coming out of the Conference is not as \nresponsible.\n  The ``extenders'' bill before us today will reduce the on-budget \nsurplus over the next ten years by $18 billion.\n  These spending commitments--a higher discretionary spending baseline \nas a result of the Fiscal Year 2000 appropriations bills, the extenders \nbill and the BBA addbacks--will spend almost 20 percent of the $996 \nbillion on-budget surplus projected for the next ten years.\n  In fact, Mr. President, the additional spending as a result of the \nBBA addbacks and the lost revenue from the extenders bill are likely to \ncompletely wipe out the Fiscal Year 2001 surplus.\n  CBO projects that Medicare spending will increase by $6 billion in \nFiscal Year 2001 as a result of this bill.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the ``extenders'' \nlegislation will reduce revenues in Fiscal Year 2001 by $3 billion.\n  That $9 billion cost is greater than the $3 billion on-budget surplus \nthat will remain in Fiscal Year 2001 assuming spending for that year is \nfrozen at this year's levels.\n  Mr. President, what did we buy with this torrent of spending?\n  Certainly some positive things are included in this legislation.\n  I am deeply concerned, however, with many of the provisions in this \ngargantuan bill and their implications for our future.\n  Let me give you two examples.\n\n\n                              yellowstone\n\n  Many of the decisions reflected in this agreement were made in \nisolation and will have unexpected negative consequences.\n  The individual operating budgets for the national parks have not been \nadjusted to accommodate the full 4.8 percent federal employee pay \nraise.\n  Instead, their budgets reflect only a pay raise of 4.4 percent.\n  The additional 0.4 percent must be absorbed through reductions in the \nremainder of their budgets--principally operations and maintenance.\n  The parks must absorb an additional 0.4% reduction as a result of the \nacross-the-board cut included in this bill.\n  Yellowstone National Park's budget is $24 million--90 percent of \nwhich goes to pay salaries.\n  The combination of the pay raise shortfall and the across-the-board \ncut will force a reduction of $200,000 from the operations and \nmaintenance accounts.\n  Why is this important?\n  Yellowstone National Park was included as one of this year's ten most \nendangered parks by the National Parks and Conservation Association.\n  It has been referred to as ``the poster child for the neglect that \nhas marred our national parks.''\n  The policies established in this bill, combined with the previously \nadopted pay raise, raise serious concerns that the quality of our \nnational parks will continue to decline.\n  I do not allege that anyone started out with this goal, but the \nconsequences of this budget agreement may have that result.\n  I suspect this example of Yellowstone National Park will be repeated \nthroughout the federal government.\n\n\n                              bba addbacks\n\n  This bill also represents a triumph of special interests.\n  Having previously beaten back the Patient's Bill of Rights \nlegislation, the managed care industry uses this bill to further \nadvance its financial position.\n  $8.7 billion of the $27 billion of additional Medicare spending in \nthis bill will go to the HMO industry.\n  Mr. President, what this means is nearly one-third of the Medicare \nmoney in this bill will go to the managed-care industry even though \nthey only cover one-sixth of the beneficiaries.\n  This comes at a time when the General Accounting Office and Medpac \nsay that HMOs are being overpaid, not underpaid, by Medicare.\n  I find it strange, Mr. President, that lobbyists for the managed care \nindustry came to Capitol Hill crying for help when they tell their \nshareholders a very different story.\n  Let me read excerpts from a few HMOs' recent press releases.\n  For example, Pacificare said this in its press release announcing its \nthird quarter earnings: ``We posted strong revenue growth * * * due to \nmembership growth and favorable premium pricing. Our confidence in and \noutlook on the future is very positive.'' (Oct. 27, 1999)\n  Aetna had this to say: ``This is the seventh consecutive quarter of \ngrowth in operating earnings per share for Aetna * * * Aetna U.S. \nHealthcare continued to post solid commercial HMO membership \nincreases.'' (Oct. 28, 1999)\n  United Health Group made the following bold proclamation: ``Our \nstrong results continue to be driven by a balanced combination of \ngrowth, operating margin expansion, and capital structure enhancement. \nWe look for ongoing progression in these key areas as we move into and \nthrough the year 2000.'' (Nov. 3, 1999)\n  These are surprisingly upbeat statements coming from an industry that \ncame to Congress crying the blues.\n  The Medicare section of this bill has other deficiencies.\n  An opportunity for reform through competitive-bidding of the HMO \nindustry was cut off at the knees in a midnight assault.\n  This bill includes language prohibiting the Secretary of HHS to \nnegotiate with durable medical equipment providers to secure better \nprices for the Medicare program and Medicare beneficiaries.\n  By putting off the implementation of these provisions, possibly for \nyears, we are taking millions of potential savings out of the pockets \nof Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The question members of Congress must ponder over the coming holidays \nis how to avoid a repeat of this awful process next year.\n  I hope that the FY 2001 budget will be one that I can support.\n  In order for that to occur, next year's budget must start with a \nbipartisan process.\n\n[[Page S15035]]\n\n  This first 10 months of this year were spent with the President and \nCongress ignoring each other's existence.\n  Only during the past ten days--fully 40 days after the fiscal year \nend--did the two sides begin negotiating a conclusion to this year's \nbudget clash.\n  We must break the cycle of end-of-the-year budget showdowns that \nproduce nothing but partisan rancor.\n  We must also press for budget reforms that will ensure the bad habits \nof the past two years do not become institutionalized.\n  While there are many targets for reform, at the top of the list is \nthe need to change the manner in which we designate certain spending as \nan ``emergency''.\n  Two-thirds of the reduction of this year's surplus--more than $25 \nbillion--happened because Congress overrode fiscal discipline by using \n``emergency'' designations.\n  Senator Snowe of Maine and I have introduced legislation that would \nestablish permanent safeguards to protect the surplus from questionable \n``emergency'' uses.\n  Specifically, that legislation would do the following:\n  1. Create a 60-vote point of order that prevents non-emergency items \nfrom being included in emergency spending bills.\n  2. Create a 60-vote point of order that allows members to challenge \nthe validity of items that are designated as ``emergencies.''\n  3. Require a 60-vote supermajority in the Senate for the passage of \nany bill that contains ``emergency'' spending.\n  Given that next year is a Presidential election year, it is unlikely \nthat much will be accomplished.\n  An issue that will receive a great deal of attention in next year's \nelection will be how best to use the on-budget surplus.\n  Several Presidential candidates have already outlined proposals that \nenvision using the on-budget surplus for larger goals.\n  Vice President Gore supports the President's proposal for using some \nof the on-budget surplus to extend the solvency of the Social Security \nprogram.\n  He has also outlined a series of steps to expand health care coverage \nto the uninsured.\n  Senator Bradley has championed a plan to extend health care coverage \nto 95% percent of the nearly 45 million uninsured adults and children.\n  Governor Bush supports cuts in marginal tax rates, reductions in the \nso-called marriage penalty, and the elimination of the estate tax.\n  Senator McCain would dedicate a portion of the surplus to tax cuts \nand transitioning the Social Security program to one that incorporates \nindividual accounts.\n  Incidentally, Senator McCain characterized this deal as ``a scathing, \nunconscionable depiction of the way we do business in Washington.''\n  Other candidates have proposals--transitioning to a flat tax, \neducation reform--most of which look to the on-budget surplus as a \nmeans of financing.\n  These are all significant ideas, but if Congress continues this \nyear's pattern in Fiscal Year 2001, they will be ideas starved for the \nresources to make them a reality, whomever the people elect.\n  Ultimately, the American people will provide their input on this \nmatter through the decision they make next November.\n  Next year's budget should not short-circuit those ideas.\n  Instead, the goal for next year's budget should be to protect the \nsurplus and therefore preserve the options available to the next \nPresident.\n  We must avoid a last minute, unfunded spending spree like that \ncontained in the bill before us today.\n  Mr. President, it is a major disappointment that we didn't exercise \nthis kind of fiscal discipline in 1999.\n  But when we return to inaugurate the second session of the 106th \nCongress, we will have the benefit of a new century, a new millennium, \nand a fresh start.\n  I hope that we can use that opportunity to seize the future rather \nthan repeating the mistakes of the past.\n  This session began with great opportunities. We had a budget surplus. \nWe had a strong economy. We had an opportunity to make decisions that \nhave long-ranging positive effects on our economy. We have largely \nfrittered away all of those opportunities.\n  The President and the congressional leadership began the year by \njoint commitment that our first priority was going to be to save Social \nSecurity and to strengthen Medicare. What happened after we finished \nthe applause at the State of the Union? What has happened is we have \nignored both of those commitments.\n  Social Security: No structural change. We have not extended by a \nsecond the solvency of the Social Security program. Yes, as the Senator \nfrom New Mexico said, we have reduced the national debt by $130 billion \nas a result of funds from the Social Security trust fund. That is the \ngood news. The bad news is we should have reduced it by $168 billion, \nwhich is what we would have done had we preserved all of the surplus \nfor strengthening Social Security and Medicare. His statement admits \nthe fact that $17 billion of Social Security surplus has, in fact, been \nspent for purposes other than reducing the national debt and saving \nSocial Security.\n  Medicare: We have made no structural changes in Medicare. Medicare, \nin fact, has 1 year less solvency as a result of what we are doing than \nit did when we started this process in January.\n  How did we get here? We got here because we have frittered away $168 \nmillion surplus down to $130 billion by a series of, first, emergency \nspending, and then an avalanche of budget gimmickry at the end of the \nsession, much of which is in the bill we are about to vote on which has \nchewed up all of the non-Social Security surplus and $17 billion of the \nSocial Security surplus.\n  What is the long-term consequence? The long-term consequence is we \nhave already spent $190 billion of our 10-year non-Social Security \nsurplus of $996 billion. One out of every $5 that we had in January for \nthe non-Social Security surplus we have either spent or committed in \nthe fiscal year. In fiscal year 2001, we have already spent all but $3 \nbillion of the over $40 billion of the non-Social Security surplus. And \nwith the actions we are about to take, we are going to be into Social \nSecurity for the next fiscal year by over $6 billion. That is what we \nhave done with all the opportunities that were available.\n  I hope we will have learned from these lessons that we will apply \nsome basic principles for next year, that we will try to be more \nbipartisan, that we will try to adopt some processes that will \nconstrain us against the kinds of actions that have led to this sorry \nstate of affairs this year, that we will commit we will exercise real \nfiscal discipline so the American people, based on who they elect as \nPresident in November of next year, will have an opportunity to make \nsome fundamental decision.\n  Do they want our surplus to be used for Social Security? Do they want \nit to be used for Medicare? Do they want it to be used for tax cuts? Do \nthey want it to be used to reduce the number of Americans who do not \nhave health care coverage? What are their priorities? We are spending \nthe money like drunken sailors and the American people are being denied \nthe opportunity to state their opinions as to what we should be doing \nwith their money.\n  It is with regret, as we have repeated against what we did last year, \nI must vote no on the legislation that will soon come before the Senate \nas the concluding fiscal act of 1999 and hope we will do better next \nyear.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Washington Post, November 19, 1999]\n\n                    . . . And Brought Forth a Mouse\n\n       It is fitting that this legislative year should end with an \n     almost imperceptible across-the-board spending cut that will \n     not be across the board. It is hard to think of a single \n     aspect of the budget that has not been seriously \n     misrepresented in the past nine months of debate. There is \n     always a certain amount of straying from the truth in regard \n     to budgets. This year it has reached Orwellian proportions.\n       The final agreement on which the House was to vote last \n     night and the Senate thereafter was touted yesterday by both \n     sides as a major achievement. The major achievement consisted \n     of no more than passage six weeks into the fiscal year of the \n     last five of the 13 regular appropriations bills on which the \n     operation of the government depends. Those 13 ordinary bills \n     are the only fiscal accomplishment of a Congress that began \n     with lofty talk on the part of the president as well as the \n     leadership of both parties of solving long-range fiscal \n     problems. They solved\n\n[[Page S15036]]\n\n     none. The only consolation is that, by virtue of \n     incompetence, they managed not to make any seriously worse, \n     either.\n       The Republicans crow that they came through the year \n     without using the Social Security surplus to help finance the \n     rest of government. But (a) that's a non-accomplishment, in \n     the sense that the same IOUs are put in the trust fund \n     whether the surplus is used to finance other programs or pay \n     down debt. And (b) it didn't happen. They achieved the result \n     on paper only, by use of gimmicks. In some cases, they simply \n     denied that spending for which they voted--and which they \n     busily called to the voters' attention as evidence of why \n     they should be reelected--would actually occur. They \n     disappeared it. In other cases, they simply kicked it over \n     into next year. It will hugely compound their problems then. \n     There has been much talk that a new fiscal standard has been \n     obliquely adopted, whereby the rest of government, meaning \n     all but Social Security, will hereafter have to live within \n     its own means. That would be fine with us, but what this \n     year's record suggests is not a new standard to be adhered to \n     so much as a new one to be systematically lied about.\n       Meanwhile, they did what they always do in writing end-of-\n     session bills. They stuffed it full of goodies, using public \n     funds or power to curry favor with the folks back home. There \n     is fine print in the legislation meant to benefit Sallie Mae, \n     the giant and decidedly non-needy Student Loan Marketing \n     Association; dairy farmers; the recycling industry; \n     transplant surgeons; and who knows who else. Most of these \n     are provisions that, for good reason, could not pass on their \n     own. The president called the agreement a ``hard-won victory \n     for the American people.'' In fact, it's a shabby, showy end \n     to perhaps the least productive, nastiest and most \n     duplicitous session of Congress in modern memory. They should \n     hang their heads as they scurry home.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD Mr. President, I don't know if many of my colleagues \nhave actually taken the time to read the bill before us.\n  If they have, they would have found some interesting provisions.\n  For example, Section 1001, titled ``PAYGO Adjustments.''\n  It appears at the very end of the printed text of H.R. 3194.\n  There are three subsections to this provision, and from what I can \ntell, this is what they do.\n  The first subsection declares that the mandatory spending that was \nfolded into this bill--I believe mostly the provisions that restore \nMedicare funding--are not to be scored against the discretionary \nspending caps.\n  The second subsection then declares that the Medicare funding shall \nnot be scored on the PAYGO ledger.\n  In other words, Mr. President, the roughly $16 billion in mandatory \nspending provided in the Medicare portions of this bill over the next 5 \nyears will be completely excluded from the statutory budget rules that \nrequire such spending to be offset.\n  The last subsection, Mr. President, then zeroes out the PAYGO ledger \nentirely.\n  This means that no spending in this bill and none of the net cost of \nthe tax expenditures in the tax extenders bill--none of it--will be \ncounted on the PAYGO ledger.\n  It won't have to be offset this year, next year, or ever.\n  Mr. President, what is going on here?\n  Why is this language needed?\n  It is needed, Mr. President, if you don't want to pay for the \nmandatory spending done in this bill or the net revenue losses in the \ntax extenders bill.\n  The proponents of this language may wish to argue that they are using \nthe budget surplus to pay for all of this.\n  Mr. President, let me ask them: ``What surplus is that?''\n  We did not have a surplus this past fiscal year.\n  And given the track record of this Congress, when September 30, 2000 \nrolls around, there is an excellent chance we won't have a surplus \nthen, either--at least not without counting the Social Security Trust \nFund revenues.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I was pleased to add my name to a measure \nthe senior Senator from Texas was circulating honoring among others the \nNobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman.\n  As many know, Professor Friedman made famous the phrase: ``There is \nno free lunch.''\n  Well, Mr. President, I must tell my colleagues that passing a law \ndeclaring a free lunch will not make it so.\n  Congress can declare that the Medicare provisions of this bill will \nnot cost anything, but that doesn't make it true.\n  Congress can declare that the tax extenders bill will not result in \nany lost revenue, but again, that will not make it true.\n  Mr. President, the PAYGO Adjustments section isn't the only one that \ntries to declare a free lunch.\n  We see it in the indefensible use of the so-called emergency \ndesignation.\n  I'll take just one example, the decennial census.\n  Mr. President, we have known for many years that there would be a \ncensus taken next year.\n  In fact, it's provided for in our Constitution.\n  In a very real sense, we have known for over 200 years that there \nwould be a census next year.\n  It comes as no surprise.\n  But you wouldn't know that if you read this bill, Mr. President.\n  This measure provides that nearly $4.5 billion in funding for the \ncensus is to be declared an emergency.\n  An emergency, Mr. President.\n  Who are we kidding?\n  Next year's census is an emergency?\n  This is nothing more than a budget gimmick to avoid having to make \ntough choices.\n  Mr. President, I have no doubt there are other examples of the misuse \nof the emergency designation in this bill.\n  Over the next few weeks we will probably see news stories about just \nwhat Congress views as an emergency.\n  Mr. President, as must be painfully obvious to my colleagues by now, \nthe dairy provisions alone in this bill make it completely unacceptable \nto me, and I will be voting against the bill for that reason.\n  However, even if those provisions were not included in the \nlegislation, I would still oppose it, and I would oppose it in part for \nthe budget gimmicks that are strewn throughout it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I cannot support this budget deal because \nit spends the budget surplus, breaks our pledge to reduce the size and \nintrusiveness of the government, fails to deliver the tax relief \nAmerican families deserve, and further imperils the Social Security \nsystem upon which so many Americans depend for their retirement \nsecurity.\n  The ``budget crisis'' has become an annual, end-of-the-year ritual in \nwhich closed-door deals produce even more fodder for public cynicism \nabout their government. This budget deal short-changes American \ntaxpayers and benefits special interests, illustrating once again that \nthe President and a majority of the Congress would rather spend the \nbudget surplus on big government, special interest giveaways, and pork-\nbarrel spending.\n  This deal makes a mockery of our obligation to responsibly exercise \nthe ``power of the purse'' conferred on the Congress by the \nConstitution.\n  It busts the budget caps set just two years ago by more than $20 \nbillion.\n  It obscures the true cost of the deal by using $36 billion in budget \ngimmickry.\n  It contains nearly $14 billion in everyday, garden-variety pork-\nbarrel spending.\n  It spends every dime of the non-Social Security surplus, instead of \nsetting that money aside to provide tax relief to American families, \nand shore up Social Security and Medicare.\n  It resorts to an across-the-board budget cut to avoid dipping into \nthe Social Security surplus, rather than making the hard choices among \nspending priorities.\n  Some people have said this year's deal is not as bad as last year's \ndeal. Looking at some statistics, that could be true to a certain \nextent:\n  Last year, the omnibus appropriations bill was 4,000 pages long and \nweighed over 40 pounds; this year's stack of bills is only about 1,500 \npages long but it's almost a foot high.\n  Last year's deal was done 21 days late and covered 8 of the regular \nappropriations bill that funded 10 federal agencies; this year's deal \ncovers only 5 of the regular spending bills for 7 agencies, but it's 50 \ndays overdue--more than twice as late as last year.\n  Last year, the negotiators added more than $20 billion in extra \nspending; this year, they only added a little more than $6 billion.\n  And last year, the whole deal was wrapped up in a single bill that \nincluded the text of 7 spending bills and a host of other legislation; \nthis year, we are casting one vote, but it will count as a vote on each \nof 10 separate bills.\n\n[[Page S15037]]\n\n  I guess one could legitimately claim, based on those statistics, that \nthis year's deal is not as bad as last year's deal. But like last year, \nthis year's budget-busting behemoth is not amendable by any Member of \nCongress not involved in the negotiations over the past several weeks. \nLike last year, the process was deliberately designed to prevent any \nMember of Congress from changing any aspect of this back-room deal. \nWhat a farce.\n  Mr. President, like last year, this non-amendable budget deal is \nloaded down with pork, its true cost is obscured by budget gimmickry, \nand it is weighed down by policy ``riders'' that have no place in \nbudget bills.\n  Before this deal was cut, the Senate had already passed spending \nbills containing over $13 billion in wasteful, unnecessary, and low-\npriority spending that was added without benefit of consideration in \nthe normal, merit-based review process. That's more than the $11 \nbillion added by Congress for Fiscal Year 1999, and almost twice the $7 \nbillion wasted in Fiscal Year 1998. On my website, I have published 264 \npages of pork-barrel spending projects in the appropriations bills that \npassed the Senate earlier this year.\n  The bill before the Senate today contains even more everyday, garden-\nvariety pork-barrel spending--almost half a billion dollars more than \nin the original bills. Some items which agencies were ``encouraged'' or \n``urged'' to fund in earlier versions of these appropriations bills \nhave now been earmarked for funding. Other projects that were earmarked \nin report language are now included in the bill language. Presumably, \nthese further clarifications of Congressional intent were included to \nimprove upon the already near certainty that these pork-barrel projects \nwill be funded ahead of other projects of possibly higher priority or \nmore deserving of the taxpayers' support.\n  Just a few examples of new earmarks and special interest items in \nthis bill include:\n  $2 million for the University of Mississippi for a phytomedicine \nproject.\n  $1 million for the Noble Army Hospital of Alabama bio-terrorism \nprogram.\n  $300,000 for the Vasona Center Youth Science Institute.\n  $5 million for the International Law Enforcement Center for the \nWestern Hemisphere in Roswell, New Mexico\n  $160,000 for a Mason City, Iowa, bus facility\n  $250,000 for the New York Hall of Science in Queens, New York\n  $100,000 for the Philadelphia Orchestra's Philly Pops to run a jazz-\nin-the-schools program in Philadelphia\n  $2.5 million for the Dante-Fascell North-South Center\n  $1,840,000 for Kansas buses and bus facilities (in addition to the \n$1.5 million already provided).\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues know, over $7.4 billion of the pork-\nbarrel spending in this year's budget is in the defense budget, \nincluding almost $1 billion in low-priority military construction \nprojects. This waste is disgraceful at a time when the Army's most \nrecent assessments of its forces show none of the Army's divisions is \nrated at the highest state of readiness, or C-1. Not one of our Army \ndivisions has the resources and training to undertake the wartime \nmissions for which they are ordered to be ready. Shortfalls in \npersonnel, parts, and funding, combined with extended deployments on \npeacekeeping and other contingency operations, have contributed to a \nserious decline that puts our soldiers at greater risk if a conflict \nwere to erupt, and threatens the ability of our forces to prevail. This \nis a disgrace and an abomination that the American people will not \ntolerate.\n  Mr. President, for those who wonder how these projects are paid for, \nlet's look at the clever budget gimmicks that are included in this \ndeal.\n  First, there is the ``emergency'' spending designation, which most \nreasonable people assume should be used only for disasters, \nemergencies, and other unforeseeable happenings. Well, in this deal, \nthe Congress has expanded somewhat the definition of ``emergency'' to \ninclude: the 2000 census, which we've known about since the \nConstitution was written, routine military training and base \noperations, and even the Head Start program.\n  So-called emergencies in this year's spending bills add up to $24 \nbillion. Some of the uses of these funds are truly emergencies, such as \nalleviating severe economic hardship on small farmers or assisting \nthose devastated by hurricanes. But over half of the emergency funds \nare designated as such in a blatant effort to avoid the discipline of \nthe budget caps. The reality, however, is that ``emergency'' spending \nmust still be paid for by tax revenues. And the tax revenues that will \npay for most of these emergencies are those generated by Social \nSecurity taxes, that are supposed to be reserved to pay benefits for \nretirees.\n  Another gimmick is the use of ``forward-funding'', whereby money is \nappropriated for projects or programs, but it cannot be spent until the \nfirst day of the next fiscal year. This money is not counted against \nthis year's budget caps, but again, it is real spending that must be \npaid for next year, within even more stringent budget caps.\n  Using the ``forward funding'' gimmick, a staggering $10 billion for \njob training, medical research, and education grants is pushed into \nnext year, potentially impairing the management and effectiveness of \nthese programs. In addition, the Department of Defense is directed to \ndelay timely payments on its contracts to save $2 billion. This gimmick \nwill result in higher costs for the Pentagon because of late payment \nfees and disruption in programs under contract.\n  Mr. President, most disgraceful, however, is a new gimmick that will \ndelay paychecks for all military personnel and federal civilian \nemployees for three days from September 29 to October 2, 2000. For the \nsake of a few billion dollars worth of pork, the Congress is \nwithholding hard-earned pay from those who volunteer to serve their \nnation in the military or as a civil servant.\n  The potential impact on these men and women and their families is \nimmeasurable. Many may have to pay late fees on rent or other bills and \npenalties and higher interest on credit cards. Some families, \nespecially those who already are forced to subsist on food stamps, will \nhave to struggle doubly hard to put food on the table while they wait \nfor the Congress to pay them for their service.\n  Mr. President, I find it absolutely outrageous that the Congress \nwould attempt to balance this pork-laden budget deal on the backs of \nour men and women in uniform. Is this the way we show our respect and \nappreciation for those who are willing to put their lives at risk for \nall of our freedoms? Is this the way we repay the families of our \nservice men and women who spend many months and years separated from \ntheir loved ones during wars and overseas assignments? This is \ndisgraceful, and I am ashamed that the Congress would take this action \nagainst those whose duty and sacrifice we should honor, not abuse.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important that the American public know \nthat this paycheck slip gimmick--a gimmick that denies our proud men \nand women in the military, and hard-working people who work for the \ngovernment the pay they have worked for and deserve--this gimmick does \nnot affect the Congress. No one who works on Capitol Hill will get \ntheir paychecks even a day late. No one who was involved in negotiating \nthis abominable deal--not Senators or Congressmen or their staffs--will \nget their paychecks late. Clearly, this demonstrates to the American \npeople the Congress' opinion of its own importance.\n  Several other gimmicks abound in this deal--transferring surplus \nfunds from the Federal Reserve into general revenues, improved \ncollection of student loans, and more rescissions of funding from \nvarious programs, totaling several billion dollars in claimed savings.\n  And finally, in order to get closer to balancing the books on this \nbudget deal, the negotiators picked and chose among the cost estimates \nprovided by the competing budget scorekeepers for the Congress and the \nAdministration, taking the lowest estimate they could find for each \nprogram so that they could squeeze more pork into the deal. The \nnegotiators claim that their deal costs about $17 billion less the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates. What this means is that, despite \nvehement claims to the contrary, $17 billion of the Social Security \nsurplus will be used to pay for the waste and largesse in\n\n[[Page S15038]]\n\nthis budget deal. Taking another $17 billion from an already \nfinancially unstable Social Security system will only exacerbate the \nfears of many Americans about their retirement security.\n  Ironically, Mr. President, none of these specific gimmicks yielded \nenough ``savings'' to bring the budget deal back under control and keep \nour hands out of the Social Security cookie jar. And since no one was \nwilling to volunteer cuts in any of their special interest programs, \nthe negotiators took the easy way out. Rather than setting budget \npriorities, like any American family must do to make ends meet, the \nnegotiators resorted to an across-the-board cut of about $2 billion.\n\n  At first glance, one would think that the President, who so \nstridently objected to this indiscriminate cut when he vetoed an \nearlier bill, would have objected to its inclusion in this deal. But it \nseems that the negotiators decided to give the President a whole lot of \nflexibility in choosing the programs that will be cut. For example:\n  If the President doesn't want to cut the White House travel budget by \nfour-tenths of a percent, he can instead cut funding for the National \nSecurity Council staff.\n  If he doesn't want to cut the staff budget of the Attorney General, \nhe can instead cut the funding for the Waco investigation or take a \nmillion dollars out of programs to prevent violence against women.\n  If he doesn't want to cut the administrative accounts of the \nSecretary of Education, he can cut Head Start by another couple million \ndollars.\n  If he doesn't want to cut the drug czar's office expenses account, he \ncan cut $200,000 or more of the funding for the anti-heroin strategy.\n  If the President doesn't want to cut four-tenths of a percent of the \nfunding for any one program, he can instead cut up to 15 percent of any \nline item approved by the Congress in any appropriations bill this year \nto get the savings.\n  Even though I clearly don't think Congress has done a very good job \nof allocating resources among our nation's priorities, why in the world \nwould the Congress cede to the President the ability to decide where to \ntake almost $2 billion from programs that have been approved by \nCongress through the appropriations process? Frankly, I recommend that \nthe President take that money out of the $13 billion in pork that the \nCongress added to the budget.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me take a moment to talk about the policy \n``riders'' that have found their way into the appropriations process \nthis year. As my colleagues know, the Senate has a rule--Rule 16--that \nis supposed to prevent the inclusion of legislative or authorizing \nprovisions in spending bills. In fact, the Senate voted earlier this \nyear to reinstate that rule. Unfortunately, when a process moves behind \nclosed doors, these ``riders'' seem to proliferate.\n  There were over 65 legislative riders on the appropriations bills \nthat passed the Senate earlier this year, but it seems that every time \nI turn around, I hear about another issue that will be rolled into this \nnon-amendable budget package.\n  Perhaps that is a result of the fact that these end-of-the-year \nbudget deals are usually negotiated by Members of the Appropriations \nCommittee, rather than the authorizers. Or it may be driven by the need \nto garner support for the deal from Members who may have a special \ninterest in an issue. Whatever the reason, the inclusion of legislative \nmatters thwarts the very process that is needed to ensure that our laws \naddress the concerns and interests of all Americans, not just a few who \nseek special protection or advantage.\n  Some of these riders are not necessarily objectionable to me, but the \ncircumvention of the authorization process that took place makes me \nunable to benefit from the advice and recommendations of the committees \nof jurisdiction and their members. I should note, however, that many of \nthe reported efforts to add riders to the bill were unsuccessful, for \nwhich I applaud the negotiators. However, most of the 32 new riders in \nthis bill are highly objectionable because of their content as well as \nthe process that led to their inclusion in this budget deal.\n  For example, one of the last-minute riders in this legislation would \ngrant a new lease on life to the milk cartel known as the Northeast \nDairy Compact, which milks consumers in New England by providing an \nabove-market price to the region's dairy farmers. The compact is set to \nexpire under a bill this Congress passed in 1996, but the pending \nlegislation would reverse this ``Freedom to Farm'' reform. The \nlegislation before us would also overturn milk pricing reforms mandated \nby Congress in 1996, supported by our Department of Agriculture, and \nratified by the nation's dairy farmers in a referendum last summer. \nThese reforms were developed by USDA over a three-year period and \nreflect a consensus-based approach worked out with America's dairy \nfarmers and producers. Consumer groups estimate that blocking milk \npricing reform in favor of the current system, as this legislation \ndoes, will cost consumers across America between $185 million and $1 \nbillion a year--a sharp blow to low-income individuals, who spend more \non dairy products as a portion of household income. I cannot in good \nconscience support the repeal of market-oriented reforms passed by a \nRepublican Congress in 1996 to benefit American consumers. I fear that, \nyet again, a narrow core of special interests has trumped the people's \ninterest in consumer-oriented milk pricing and marketing reforms.\n  Another last-minute rider will carve out liability exemptions for \ncertain recycling businesses under the Superfund law. Although these \nsame provisions are under consideration in a separate bill as well as \npart of a broader Superfund reform effort, this rider affords special \ntreatment to a small group of affected industries with a last-minute \nadd-on that is another of a targeted special interest deal. Superfund \nreform is important to our nation, yet such piece-meal measures can \nthwart the intentions and progress of those who have made good-faith \nefforts to work through a legislative process.\n  Regarding the inclusion in this deal of the restoration of certain \nMedicare benefits, in 1997, Congress made some difficult, but necessary \nchanges in the financial structure of the Medicare system as a part of \nthe Balanced Budget Act. These changes were needed to strengthen the \nsystem and delay its impending bankruptcy from 2001 until 2015. These \nreforms allowed us to preserve and protect the Medicare program while \nincreasing choice and expanding benefits for beneficiaries.\n  However, at the end of last year, many of us began hearing from \nhealth care providers and seniors about the unintended negative \nconsequences which certain provisions may be having on current \nbeneficiaries and providers in the Medicare system. There has been \nincreasing concern that certain reimbursement reductions and caps \ncontained in the Balanced Budget Act could result in access problems \nfor our nation's seniors if they were not adjusted this year. \nPersonally, I have grown increasingly concerned about this problem, \nparticularly about the negative impact on health care delivery which it \nmay pose for our nation's most frail or rural elderly.\n  While I support the overall intentions of these provisions, I am \nconcerned about provisions which have been slipped in to benefit only a \nselect area or specific companies, rather than addressing the national \nproblem of access to safe, quality and affordable health care for \nMedicare recipients. For example, hospitals in Iredell County, North \nCarolina; Orange County, New York; Lake County, Indiana; Lee County, \nIllinois; Hamilton-Middletown, Ohio; Brazoria County, Texas; and \nChittenden County, Vermont are given special consideration for \nreimbursement under the Medicare program. Wesley Medical Center in \nMississippi as well as Lehigh Valley Hospital are given special \nreimbursement consideration under this bill. Meanwhile, the District of \nColumbia, Minnesota, Wyoming and New Mexico are provided increases for \ntheir hospitals. Sadly, Congress has once again taken a well \nintentioned piece of legislation and inserted provisions directly \nbenefitting only a select few at the expense of all taxpayers.\n  Finally, Mr. President, nothing would please me more than being able \nto endorse all the satellite television provisions included in this \nappropriations bill. Some of them are good news for satellite TV \nconsumers, who would\n\n[[Page S15039]]\n\ngain the ability to receive local TV signals as part of their satellite \nTV service package, have discontinued distant network TV station signal \nservice restored, and be relieved of unfair limitations on their \nability to subscribe to distant network signals when their local \nnetwork stations are unwatchable off-air. Cable TV subscribers would \nalso be indirect beneficiaries, because anything that makes satellite \nTV a more attractive alternative to cable TV increases the cable \noperators' incentive to keep monthly rates in check. Considering the \nfact that cable TV rates have increased more than 20 percent since the \npassage of the 1996 Telecom Act, cable subscribers more than deserve \nthis kind of break.\n  Despite all this, and despite the fact that I have worked for over a \nyear and a half to bring procompetitive relief to satellite TV and \ncable TV subscribers, I find myself having to speak out against some of \nthe other satellite TV provisions that also appear in this bill.\n  Why? Because these other provisions substantially undercut the bill's \npromised consumer benefits. Why, then, were they included? To protect \nspecial interests--in this case, the TV broadcasters, the TV program \nproducers, and the professional sports leagues.\n  The primary special interest benefitted by these new provisions is \nthe TV broadcasters. Under the law they're considered to be ``public \ntrustees,'' and as such they have enjoyed considerable protection \nagainst competition, thanks to the Congress (which fears the power of \nthe local network stations) and to the FCC (which fears the Congress).\n  Nevertheless, neither Congress nor the FCC can hold back technology, \nand local broadcasters have increasingly found themselves subjected to \ncompetition from new multichannel video technologies--first cable TV, \nand now, satellite TV. So the last thing the broadcast TV industry is \nreceptive to is the prospect that satellite TV might be able to \nincrease its competitive power and thereby lure more of the local \nbroadcast audience--and revenue base--away.\n  That was one of the reasons why local broadcasters finally sued \nsatellite TV companies that were offering distant network TV stations \nto subscribers who technically weren't entitled to receive them--even \nthough many of these subscribers had, in fact, been receiving them for \nyears without causing any apparent harm to local stations. The lawsuit \nwas successful, and as a result many existing satellite TV subscribers \nfound their distant network stations suddenly dropped, even when they \ncouldn't get satisfactory off-air service from their local stations.\n  Not surprisingly, this led to widespread consumer protest. The House \nand the Senate Commerce Committees passed legislation that, taken \ntogether, would have solved satellite TV consumers' problems without \ninflicting material harm on broadcasters. But the legislation before us \ntoday contains a number of new provisions that will hurt satellite TV \nconsumers and serve no purpose other than protecting the congruent \ninterests of the well-heeled TV broadcasters, program producers, and \nprofessional sports leagues. These new provisions will adversely impact \nthe very competition Congress claims it's trying to enhance, and the \nvery satellite TV consumers Congress claims it's trying to help.\n  The first of these objectionable new provisions directly affects the \nability of satellite TV companies to offer their subscribers local TV \nstations. Specifically, it governs the process whereby satellite TV \ncompanies negotiate with the TV networks for the rights to carry their \nlocal affiliates.\n  This issue has always been one of considerable concern because the TV \nnetworks have the stronger bargaining position, and the incentives, to \nextract unfair prices and conditions from satellite TV companies in \nreturn for giving them the right to carry local affiliates. Satellite \nTV companies' inability to offer local network stations has been cited \nrepeatedly as the principal competitive disadvantage satellite TV \ncompanies face. The TV networks, therefore, begin with a strong \nbargaining advantage. Added to this is the fact that the networks also \nhold substantial cable TV programming interests, which increases the \npossibility that they could seek to extract further competition-\ndampening conditions that would serve the interests of their cable-\nchannel partners. And, of course, the fact that the networks' local \naffiliates have been in litigation with the satellite TV industry adds \nto the concerns about the networks' incentives to withhold consent to \ncarry their local affiliates unless, and until, the satellite TV \ncarriers agree to whatever onerous and unfair terms and prices the \nnetworks might choose to dictate.\n  Now let's see how this legislation deals with this critical issue. \nNot only does this legislation omit fair-dealing requirements that had \nbeen included in the House bill; it adds a new provision, dictated by \nthe broadcast industry, that makes a mockery of any notion of fair \ndealing.\n\n  This new provision gives satellite TV companies a six-month ``shot-\nclock'' to negotiate and obtain a signed retransmission consent \nagreement from a TV network for carriage of its local affiliate. During \nthis time the satellite TV company could begin offering the station to \nits subscribers.\n  But there's a catch if, at the end of six months, the satellite TV \ncompany doesn't get the consent. First of all, the broadcaster, and \nonly the broadcaster, is allowed to file a complaint and request a \ncease-and-desist order from the FCC. Moreover, the legislation doesn't \nsimply deprive an aggrieved satellite TV company of the ability to file \na complaint against an unreasonably recalcitrant broadcaster; it goes \nfurther, and specifically denies the satellite TV company any right to \nclaim that the broadcaster didn't negotiate in good faith. These \npatently unfair provisions are complemented by penalties so stringent \nthat no satellite TV company in its right mind would knowingly risk \nthem.\n  Let's examine exactly what this is will mean in real terms. The big \nbenefit that satellite TV consumers are supposed to get from this \nlegislation is local signals, and their ability to get local signals \ndepends on their satellite TV company's ability to close a deal with \nthe networks, which have strong bargaining power and palpable \ndisincentives to deal dispassionately. So what does this new provision \ndo? It deletes the substantive provision that would have provided a \nstatutory guarantee of fair dealing, adds a complaint process front-\nloaded to benefit the party that has the stronger bargaining position \nand the incentive to deal unfairly, deprives the party that's in the \nweaker bargaining position from raising unfair treatment as a defense, \nand imposes huge penalties on the party with the weaker bargaining \nposition if it fails to enter into an agreement before the six-month \ndeadline expires.\n  In practical terms, this presents any underdog satellite TV companies \nthat don't already have retransmission consent agreements with a set of \nHobson's Choices when it comes to offering local stations. They can, of \ncourse, simply not begin carrying local stations unless and until they \nhave the required retransmission consents. That's the safest thing to \ndo. But if they don't start carrying local signals right away, they \ncertainly won't be offering their customers the ``local stations by \nChristmas'' promised by those who back this legislation. In addition, \nthey'll not only be perpetuating the competitive disadvantage they \nalready face when it comes to competing with cable TV; they'll be \nincurring a completely new competitive disadvantage when it comes to \ncompeting with other satellite TV companies that already have \nagreements. If, on the other hand, a satellite TV company begins \noffering local signals before obtaining the necessary agreements, it \nentails the risk that if the six month negotiation period runs out \nwithout mutually-acceptable terms having been reached, the satellite TV \ncompany will have to either drop the local signals or agree to whatever \nterms the network wants.\n  Pretty clearly, the effect of this new provision is pro-broadcaster, \nnot pro-consumer or pro-competitive. But it's not the only new \nprovision that protects special interests at the expense of the \npublic's interest. This legislation also protects local network TV \nstations from any action by the FCC to change an outdated 50-year old \nlaw whose effect is to prevent many satellite TV subscribers from \nreceiving additional distant network stations.\n  The legislation's new program blackout provisions are another \nCongressional valentine to special interests.\n\n[[Page S15040]]\n\n These provisions could result in blackouts of scheduled network \nprogramming, non-network programming, and especially sports \nprogramming, on the distant stations satellite TV consumers get. This \nwill make the broadcasters and TV program producers happy, at the \nexpense of making millions of satellite TV consumers unhappy when \nuninterrupted reception of distant station programming becomes a thing \nof the past. The sports programming that so many satellite TV consumers \nenjoy is at the greatest risk. In a special favor to the NFL and the \nother professional sports leagues, the legislation will require \nsatellite TV carriers to black out sports programming on distant \nnetwork stations unless the FCC finds it's ``economically prohibitive'' \nfor the satellite TV company to do so--a standard that virtually \nguarantees blackouts. And when these blackouts are imposed, no existing \nsatellite TV subscriber--not even those who have their distant network \nsignal service restored, or the big backyard dish owners who were the \nvery first satellite TV subscribers--would be exempt, no matter how \nlong they have received multiple distant stations without blackouts and \nwithout inflicting any detectable harm on any of the special interests \nat whose behest these new provisions were added.\n  Rather than prolonging this discussion further, let me sum up. Before \nyou now is the latest example of how special interests can, and do, \nmake Congress shape legislation to suit what they want, rather than \nwhat average Americans need and deserve.. At some point, the American \npeople will get fed up, and the ability of special interests to \nexercise unwarranted influence like this will be constrained. \nUnfortunately, that's not going to happen today, and therefore I will \nclose--but not without some promises that, I assure you, I intend to \nkeep.\n  I will continue to do everything I can to make sure that satellite TV \nconsumers are helped, and multichannel competition improves, after this \nlegislation is enacted. I will convene the Commerce Committee early \nnext year to examine how competition and consumers are being affected \nby this legislation. I will introduce and I will move new legislation \nto correct any problems we see.\n  I will also make sure that the FCC does all it can to help Congress \nserve the interests of satellite TV consumers and multichannel video \ncompetition. To begin this process I will send a letter tomorrow to FCC \nChairman William Kennard, requesting that the Commission establish, as \nquickly as possible, the minimum requirements for bargaining in ``good \nfaith'' for retransmission consent agreements, and submit \nrecommendations to Congress, as quickly as possible, on further \nlegislation that will redefine what constitutes a ``viewable'' local TV \nsignal. This will remove the problem that keeps satellite TV \nsubscribers from getting as many distant TV stations from their \nsatellite TV companies as they otherwise could.\n  All these measures will enable us to cure the problems these \nparticular special-interest provisions will cause. In the meantime, \nit's helpful to recall that in the final analysis they won't affect our \neveryday lives as profoundly as other special interests do when it \ncomes to other legislation. The provisions before us today won't \ndetermine how much we must pay in taxes, how we are permitted to \neducate our children, how we obtain health care, or how our seniors \nwill be protected. But in spite of that, they will serve to remind us--\nwhen we watch satellite TV or open our monthly cable TV bills--that, \nwhen it comes to legislation pending before Congress, no corporate \nissue is too small, and no consumer issue is too big, to avoid the \npervasive grasp of entrenched special interests.\n  Mr. President, I cannot support this budget deal.\n  I wonder, Mr. President, when will we begin to listen to the American \npeople? When will we take heed of the absolute cynicism about the ways \nof Washington? When will we reform the way we do business so that we \nmight reclaim the faith and confidence of the people we are sworn to \nserve?\n  Sadly, we seem never to learn. The last-minute, end-of-year budget \nagreement has become a yearly ritual and a tired cliche.\n  Mr. President, we have all year to complete our business in a \nresponsible manner like grownups. But every day, at great expense to \nthe taxpayers, we whirl about in our self-importance, never to be \ndiverted from playing at our pathetic partisan political games.\n  After all the hearings, paper-shuffling, and speech-making, the \ntaxpayers' hard-earned money is spent according to the whims of a \nmassive, hastily compiled budget deal that contains lots of goodies for \nMembers of Congress and special interests, but very little for the \nAmerican people--an annual monument to our arrogance that is chock full \nof pork-barrel spending, special-interest riders, and clever budget \ngimmicks, but not one morsel of family tax relief.\n  Mr. President, in just a few short weeks, we will usher in a new \ncentury and a new millennium. This is a time of renewal and reform. \nJust as individual Americans take stock of themselves and resolve to do \nand be better, perhaps we elected officials might resolve to set a \nbetter example in the way we conduct the people's business. Perhaps in \nthe year 2000, we might address ourselves not to partisan gridlock and \npolitical games, but to restoring the people's faith in their elected \nleaders. Perhaps next year we can spare the American people the grim \nfaces and high drama of the last-minute budget summit, and simply do \nour work responsibly, in the open, and on time.\n  Maybe then we can restore the confidence in our public institutions \nthat is so badly flagging, but is so essential to making the new \ncentury worthy of the highest dreams and aspirations of the people we \nare privileged to serve.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will vote for this final appropriations \npackage, because I believe that, on balance, it is a good product. \nHowever, the situation we are in today is hauntingly familiar to that \nof a year ago, and my disappointment in the appropriations process \ncontinues. Last minute budgeting makes sound decisions increasingly \ndifficult. We should reform the appropriations process to safeguard the \ninterests of taxpayers and achieve a more balanced use of our time and \nresources.\n  We all know that the appropriations process has grown to an \ninordinate length. We spend months holding hearings and negotiations, \ncrafting sound public policy, only to scrap it in a hasty year-end \nscramble when we cobble together a bill negotiated by the White House \nbudget chiefs and a few members of Congress. A 1996 CRS study revealed \nthat budget matters eat up 73% of the Senate's time. I can't imagine we \nspent much less time on budget matters this year.\n  As I have been recommending since 1993, along with our distinguished \nBudget Committee Chairman and many other Senators, Congress should \nadopt a two-year budget cycle, and do the budgeting in non-election \nyears. This would double the time available for non-budget policy \nissues and for carrying out often neglected oversight duties. Our goal \nmust be to engage in lawmaking in the deliberative manner the Founders \nintended.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, once again the Senate is considering a \nmassive appropriations bill in the final hours of a session of \nCongress. This one spends more than $385 billion, contains legislation \nwhich rightly belongs in five separate appropriations bills, and other \nimportant legislation which doesn't belong in an appropriations bill at \nall. This is a process which reflects poorly on the Congress both \nbecause it represents a failure to get the nation's work done on time, \nand because the final rush precludes the kind of careful consideration \nand debate which wise decisionmaking demands. The combination of its \nenormous size and the swiftness with which it was thrown together makes \ncertain that Senators will only after the fact learn full details about \nmany provisions which have been added.\n  Democrats have won critical victories in this bill providing funds \nfor new teachers to reduce class size in our schools, a first \ninstallment toward 50,000 new police officers by 2005, the necessary \nfunding to implement the Wye River peace agreement and more than $514 \nmillion for the Lands Legacy Initiative to preserve and safeguard our \nmost precious public lands, as well as funds for after-school programs \nto benefit 675,000 students. Other needed legislation is included to \nreverse some\n\n[[Page S15041]]\n\nof the unintended consequences of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act on \nhospitals, nursing homes and other health care facilities and \nlegislation to benefit consumers by increasing competition between \ncable and satellite companies and permitting satellite companies to \nprovide local network signals in local markets. However, like last \nyear, even as I acknowledge some important budget victories, I do not \nsupport this process and, on balance, cannot vote for this bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as some of my colleagues know, I have \nbeen posted, here on the Senate floor, day after day this week because \nof my concerns about the dairy provisions that are included in the \nbudget package, and I know other Senators support those provisions \nbecause of the States they represent. For now, I just want to comment \nmore broadly on the budget package and how we got here.\n  Mr. President, we have before us a measure that we are told will \ndirect something like $400 billion in spending in such areas as the \nJustice Department including the FBI, Education including funding for \nlocal school districts, increased security for our foreign embassies, \nthe Interior Department including our national parks system, Health and \nHuman Services including critical funding for aging programs like the \ncongregate and home delivered meals programs, and much more.\n  But, Mr. President, you would not know that by reading this bill. \nThat roughly $400 billion in spending is distributed in a few pages of \ntext. With the exception of District of Columbia funding, it's all on \none page--the last page.\n  I have not been here as long as some of my colleagues, but I cannot \nrecall ever seeing anything like this. Last year's omnibus \nappropriations bill was bad enough. It, too, lumped several \nappropriations bills together into one giant omnibus appropriations \nmeasure. It, too, was loaded with special interest measures that were \nslipped in, never having been debated, and unlikely to pass on their \nown. But at least, Mr. President, the spending done in that bill was \nexplicitly a part of the document formally placed before the Senate. If \nyou took the time to read the several thousand page appropriations \nbill, you would have found those items last year.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us is another matter entirely. It \nlegislates by reference. Other than the DC Appropriations bill, there \nare no details provided in this document that indicate how those \nhundreds of billions of dollars are to be spent, only references to \nother bills.\n  Mr. President, when this bill goes to the President for his approval, \nwhat will he be signing into law? Essentially, he will be signing into \nlaw little more than a glorified table of contents.\n  Mr. President, this is a horrible precedent. This kind of gimmick may \nhave been used before, but never on anything so momentous as an omnibus \nappropriations bill. And it is perhaps fitting that this piece of \nlegislation should be structured the way it is.\n  This bill is the ``poster child'' of the 106th Congress. Unable to \nmeet the budget deadline, we are once again presented with an omnibus \nappropriations bill, laden with the kind of special interest provisions \nthat undermine our budget as well as the confidence of the public. And \nunwilling to bring any but a handful of authorizing bills to the floor \nfor open debate, the leadership has now crammed this perverse bill full \nof legislation that has no business in an appropriations measure.\n  Mr. President, earlier this year this body voted to restore some \norder to the appropriations process by re-establishing the point of \norder against legislating on appropriations. This bill renders that \nexercise utterly meaningless. Worse, it means that while the Senate is \nprecluded from adding authorizing language after thorough debate on the \nfloor, a few people in a backroom are free to add anything they wish, \nwith no debate and out of public view.\n\n  Mr. President, the 106th Congress is not yet half over a but it has \nalready earned itself a sorry reputation. This is the Congress of \nConvenience. The 106th Congress found it inconvenient to finish the \nsimple job of passing appropriations bills before the end of the fiscal \nyear, so it cuts a few backroom deals and lumps five appropriations \nbills together. The 106th Congress found it inconvenient to debate \nauthorizing bills fully and openly, so it bundled several together and \nshoved them into this omnibus appropriations bill. And now, the 106th \nCongress finds it inconvenient to provide even the details of this $400 \nbillion compost heap, so it engages in some drafting gymnastics, and \ngives the public little more than a glorified table of contents.\n  Mr. President, I realize there are some strong feelings about the \nprovisions of this bill. I know that some of my colleagues support some \nof the provisions in this measure. Chances are there are provisions in \nthis measure that I, too, would support, but how would I know? But I \nhope that a few weeks from now, after this thing is enacted, my \ncolleagues will consider just what has been wrought this week and this \npast year. The normal procedures of the Senate and the other body have \nbeen run over by a steamroller in the name of political expediency and \nconvenience, and that cannot be good, even for those who may have \ngained a temporary victory.\n  In the play A Man for All Seasons, there is an exchange between Sir \nThomas More and his son-in-law, Roper. More asks Roper--``What would \nyou do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the devil?'' \nRoger responds--``I'd cut down every law in England to do that!'' More \nthen replies--``Oh? And when the last law was down, and the devil \nturned round on you--where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being \nflat? * * * This country's planted thick with laws from coast to \ncoast--man's laws, not God's--and if you cut them down--and you're just \nthe man to do it--d'you really think you could just stand upright in \nthe winds that would blow then?''\n  Mr. President, the 106th Congress has done more than its share of \nflattening our rules and procedures. Those of us in the minority on the \nissue before us today perhaps feel it most keenly, but let me suggest \nthat many more may come to regret the precedents set by the Congress of \nConvenience.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, I want to express \nmy appreciation for all of the hard work that Senators Stevens and \nByrd, Specter and Harkin have put into the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, Education Appropriations bill in the face of enormous \nbudgetary challenges. I also appreciate all they have done to \naccomodate my priorities during this process.\n  The 20th Century is coming to a close during a time of unprecedented \neconomic growth and budget surpluses. However, as we celebrate our \nnation's prosperity, we must make sure we don't leave any of our most \nvulnerable citizens behind. In my opinion, that's what this bill, which \nfunds vital health and education programs in the year 2000, should be \nabout: making a strong commitment to our aging parents and \ngrandparents--who made this country what it is today, as well as to our \nchildren--who will determine its future.\n  I am pleased that this bill takes several important steps in that \ndirection. First, this bill continues to make early childhood education \nand child care a top priority. I am very pleased that the bill includes \na $608 million increase to the Head Start program. This program gives \nyoung children from lower-income families a real chance to succeed by \nproviding educational, health, and other child care services.\n  Second, I am glad to see that this bill includes a nearly $30 million \nincrease for States to inspect nursing homes and ensure they are safe. \nAs a member of the Senate Aging Committee, I have had the unfortunate \nopportunity to hear firsthand about cases of abuse and neglect in many \nof our nation's nursing homes. Our seniors and disabled deserve the \nbest possible care, and this funding will help make sure they get it. \nIn addition, the bill includes a $1 million increase for the Long-term \nCare Ombudsman program. Ombudsmen serve as advocates for long-term care \nresidents and help them to resolve complaints of neglect and abuse. \nThey are a critical component of ensuring the safety of our seniors in \nnursing homes and other long-term care settings.\n  I am also extremely pleased that the bill includes another $100 \nmillion increase for Community Health Centers. The number of uninsured \nin our country continues to grow. Health centers\n\n[[Page S15042]]\n\nprovide treatment to large numbers of uninsured and should be commended \nfor the incredible work they do. This increase will help them meet the \nincreased demand for care, and ensure that patients get the quality \nhealth care services they need.\n  This bill also fully funds the LIHEAP program. This program is vital \nto low-income families in Wisconsin who need assistance with heating \ncosts during the cold winter months. I am pleased that this bill \ncontinues to make this program a top priority.\n  I am also pleased that in addition to the $2 billion increase for the \nNational Institutes of Health, report language was included in the bill \nthat targets many of the diseases that are devastating families across \nour nation. The bill includes report language I requested to increase \nresearch into epilepsy, particularly intractable epilepsy, which \nprimarily starts in childhood and affects nearly 75,000 of the 3 \nmillion individuals with epilepsy.\n  In addition, at my urging, the bill also includes $90 million for the \nNational Institute of Nursing Research within NIH. Nursing research is \ndifferent from biomedical research but just as necessary. This research \nfocuses on reducing the burden and suffering of illness, improving the \nquality of life by preventing and delaying the onset of disease, and by \nlooking for better ways to promote health and prevent disease.\n  I am pleased that the bill also includes report language that \nstrongly urges more research into Alzheimer's Disease. This devastating \ndisease affects nearly 4 million people in the United States, including \n100,000 in Wisconsin. The total annual cost of Alzheimer care is over \n$100 billion. Searching for new treatments--and ultimately a cure--must \nbe one of our top priorities in biomedical research, to alleviate both \nthe suffering and the costs associated with this awful disease.\n  I also want to thank Senators Specter and Harkin for their \nwillingness to work with me on some of my other priorities. At my \nrequest, language was included in the Senate report to start a \ndemonstration program within HRSA to increase the number of mental \nhealth professionals in underserved areas--particularly those suffering \nfrom recent farm crises. I am hopeful that HRSA will allocate at least \n$1 million toward this initiative.\n\n  Funds have also been provided to CDC to expand their efforts to \nprevent birth defects through the promotion of folic acid among women \nof childbearing age. I have sponsored, along with Senators Abraham and \nBond, a bill that would authorize $20 million to CDC for this purpose, \nand I am pleased that this appropriations bill gets this initiative \nunderway. In addition, I am pleased that the Ryan White Comprehensive \nCare program received an increase of $86 million to expand services for \npeople living with HIV and AIDS.\n  I'd now like to talk a bit about funding for education. While I am \nconcerned about the use of advance funding for many of our education \nprograms, I am pleased that this bill provides necessary increases for \neducation. Title I--which provides assistance to disadvantaged youth, \nreceived a $209 million increase, although we must do much better than \nthat in the future in order to serve all Title I-eligible children. I \nam also pleased that Special Education received a large increase in \nfunding, although we still have a great deal of work to do to live up \nto our commitment to fund 40% of the costs of the program. We still \nneed to do more in both these areas, but this is a good start.\n  In addition, I strongly support the $253 million increase for 21st \nCentury Community Learning Centers, for a total of $453 million for FY \n2000. I have visited several of these afterschool programs in my State \nand I have seen firsthand how successful and critically important they \nare. These programs give kids a safe place to go after school, keep \nthem off the streets, and out of trouble. It is supported on a \nbipartisan basis, by parents, teachers, and police chiefs. Last year, \nthousands of applications were submitted for only 184 grants. However, \nI believe it deserves an even stronger investment than this bill \nprovides, which is why I voted for an amendment during consideration of \nthe Senate version to provide $600 million for this worthy program. \nAlthough that amendment failed, I will continue to fight for more \nfunding for after-school programs next year.\n  This bill also makes greater strides to give students the tools they \nneed to go to college. First, the bill increases the maximum Pell Grant \naward to $3,300, and I am hopeful we can further increase this amount \nnext year. It also increases the Federal Work-Study program by $64 \nmillion. TRIO programs also received a $45 million increase, and I am \npleased that more students will be able to take advantage of TRIO \nprograms that give lower-income students a better chance to go to \ncollege. I also strongly support the $80 million increase for the GEAR-\nUP program. This program gives many middle school students their first \nreal opportunity to strive toward going to college. I am hopeful that \nwe will further increase funding for this program in future years.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the conference report maintains and \nincreases our commitment to hiring 100,000 teachers and reducing class \nsizes in the early grades. Class size reduction efforts have produced \ntremendous results in Wisconsin and across the nation. It is essential \nthat we continue to provide the resources States and school districts \nneed to put a qualified teacher in every classroom. Our students \ndeserve nothing less.\n  I am pleased that these important education programs have received \nincreases. However, I also have several significant concerns about the \neducation section of the bill.\n  First, I am deeply concerned that the bill level funds the Child Care \n& Development Block Grant. The Senate bill included an amendment, which \nI supported, to increase funding for the CCDBG from $1.2 billion to $2 \nbillion. This amendment had strong bipartisan support because there is \nnow widespread recognition that child care is critical to the success \nof working families. Unfortunately, this amendment was dropped during \nnegotiations of the conference report. This is a serious mistake, and \none that will have serious repercussions for working families. Programs \nfunded by the CCDBG ensure that parents have a safe, educational place \nto send their children during the workday. Businesses experience less \nabsenteeism and greater productivity when their employees know their \nchildren are well taken care of. When families who need quality, \naffordable child care are able to find it, everybody wins. It's that \nsimple. I strongly believe that we must renew our commitment to \nexpanding access to child care, and I will continue to make child care \nfunding a top priority and fight hard for future increases.\n  Second, and even more importantly, I have serious concerns about the \nbill's substantial use of advance funding for education. I am not \nconvinced that this practice is completely benign, and I believe we \nmust watch carefully how the delayed release of education funds impacts \nschool budgets.\n\n  However, I have an even deeper concern about the use of advance \nfunding. The hard truth is this: we would not be forced to use advance \nfunding, nor any budget gimmicks at all, if this bill received the \npriority it deserved. This bill, which funds our most basic needs--\nhealth care and education--was left for dead last. It was raided \nrepeatedly to fund other programs, leaving it at one point with a more \nthan $15 billion shortfall. We would not be in the budgetary box we \nfind ourselves in today if this bill had been the top priority it \nshould be. I hope that in the future my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle will have the will to pass this bill early and send a strong \nmessage that education and health care are our top priorities, not our \nlast.\n  Besides education, there are several other areas of the bill that I \nbelieve must be improved in future budgets. First, while I am pleased \nthat the bill sets aside $19.1 million in the Child Care & Development \nBlock Grant for Resource and Referral programs, I am concerned this \njust isn't enough. R programs serve as a resource to help parents \nlocate quality, affordable child care in their communities. When \nparents need child care, they call R agencies, who have the tools to \ndirect parents to appropriate child care providers in their area that \nmeet each family's unique needs. With growing numbers of parents \nentering the workforce, the need for R is greater than ever. I would \nlike to continue to work with Senators Specter and Harkin, as\n\n[[Page S15043]]\n\nwell as all of my colleagues, on increasing this set-aside to $50 \nmillion to meet the increasing demand for referral services.\n  I am also very concerned about the cut in the Social Services Block \nGrant. The State of Wisconsin and our counties rely on SSBG to fund a \nvariety of social service programs. These include supportive home care \nand community living services for the elderly and disabled, drug and \nalcohol abuse treatment, temporary shelter for homeless families, and \nchild abuse prevention and intervention services. States and counties \nrely on these funds, and it is wrong to renege on our commitment to \nSSBG funding.\n  I am also very concerned about programs for senior citizens under the \nOlder Americans Act. I am pleased to see that the bill includes a $35 \nmillion increase for home-delivered meals to seniors. However, we must \nalso find a way to make a stronger investment in the Supportive \nServices and Senior Centers program. This program provides funds to \nArea Agencies on Aging, which in turn provide a wide range of \nassistance to frail elderly. In addition, we must also provide \nassistance to the growing number of Americans who are taking care of \nelderly and disabled relatives. I am a cosponsor of the Family \nCaregiver Support Act, which provides $125 million in assistance and \nrespite for caregivers. Unfortunately, this bill does not fund this \nnecessary program, but I hope we can enact it into law quickly next \nyear.\n  The National Senior Service Corps is a program we should all be proud \nof and support increased funding. These programs utilize the skills and \nexperience of older Americans in our communities. Foster Grandparents, \nSenior Companions, and RSVP give seniors a chance to work with \nchildren, families and other seniors, and we are all the richer for \ntheir contributions. I am pleased that the bill includes increases for \nthese programs, and I believe we must provide more in the future lest \nwe waste this priceless resource we have in our seniors.\n  In addition to the Labor, HHS component, this Omnibus Appropriations \nbill includes some desperately needed relief for our nation's health \ncare providers. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included many \nprovisions that reduced Medicare payments further than Congress \nintended. Providers have been forced to reduce benefits or worse--many \nproviders in my State and across the nation have closed altogether. I \nhave strongly supported efforts to alleviate those cuts and have worked \nwith many of my colleagues over the past year to fight for a solution. \nI am pleased that the Conference Report includes provisions to assist \nhospitals, home health agencies, skilled nursing facilities and other \nproviders. In the end, Medicare beneficiaries are the ones who truly \nbenefit, and this bill will help ensure that seniors in Wisconsin and \nthroughout the nation continue to receive the health care services they \nneed and deserve.\n  Overall, I believe this is a good bill, and I commend the Chairmen \nand Ranking Members of the Appropriations Committee and the Labor, HHS \nSubcommittee, as well as the Finance Committee, for their hard work. \nUnfortunately, because unrelated dairy provisions that I strongly \noppose were included in this conference report, I reluctantly must vote \nagainst it. However, I want to make clear that I strongly support the \nvast majority of the increases in this bill--increases that will go a \nlong way toward ensuring that our children and our elderly receive the \nimportant services they need. I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Subcommittee for doing such a great job this year under \nsuch difficult budgetary circumstances, and for their willingness to \nwork with me on items of concern to me and my State. I look forward to \nworking with them again next year on this vitally important bill.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I intend to support the consolidated \nappropriations package. This large legislative package--the result of \nhard work by many on both sides of the aisle--provides funding for a \nnumber of programs which are important and affect people in a direct \nway. This bill includes funding for programs under the D.C. \nAppropriations bill, the Interior Appropriations bill, the Foreign \nOperations Appropriations Bill, the Commerce-Justice-State \nAppropriations bill, and the Labor-Health and Human Services-Education \nAppropriations bill.\n  In addition, incorporated in the legislation are other important \nmeasures, including the Satellite Competition and Consumer Protection \nAct, provisions important for dairy farmers in my State, the State \nDepartment Authorization bill, and our Medicare refinement plan. As \nwith any product this large and with as many compromises which were \nnecessary to move the process forward, there will be provisions with \nwhich one will disagree.\n  While this is certainly a substantial legislative undertaking, I \nwould point out that nearly all of the matters contained in this \npackage have previously been debated in full by the Senate and passed \nby wide margins.\n  Mr. President, I would like to highlight some provisions contained in \nthis legislation for which I have advocated. This legislation will \ncontinue the Trade Adjustment Assistance program.\n  Earlier this month, my distinguished colleague on the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Moynihan, and I, stressed the importance of this \nprogram for our American workers during the debate on the Africa Trade \nbill. The Africa Trade bill passed by the Senate extended the authority \nfor the TAA program which lapsed in June of this year. As time did not \npermit us to resolve our differences with the House on the trade \npackage, we needed to insure that the benefits to workers displaced \nfrom their jobs as a result of trade activity be continued. I am very \npleased that this provision is included in this package.\n  The package also includes the Satellite Copyright, Competition, and \nConsumer Protection Act. My State has over 30,000 households which \ndepend on satellite dishes for their television programming and I have \nlong advocated a modernization of the laws affecting satellite \ntelevision programming. I am also pleased that an agreement was reached \nto have the Senate consider legislation which will facilitate satellite \nlocal to local service in small and rural markets, as this will be \nimportant to bring local programming to my constituents.\n  I have joined with my colleague from Delaware, Joe Biden, in \nsponsoring legislation to continue the important programs he has \nchampioned--the COPS program and the Violence Against Women Act. This \nmeasure provides funding for these programs. Also contained in the \npackage is funding for the State Side program under the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. I had joined with our late colleague, Senator \nChafee, in sponsoring legislation to provide these funds for the first \ntime in several years to promote open space and recreation \nopportunities at the discretion of our State governments.\n  The package maintains the commitment we made with the passage of the \nBalanced Budget Act in 1997 to prioritize education. Since the passage \nof the 1997 bill, we have followed through with substantial increases \nin funding for our important education programs and have done so in a \nmanner which promotes flexibility.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to discuss the Finance \nCommittee's Medicare, Medicaid, & SCHIP Refinement Act of 1999, H.R. \n3426.\n  A little more than two years ago Congress passed and the President \nsigned into law the historic Balanced Budget Act of 1997. This \nimportant legislation has been instrumental in making possible the \nbudget surpluses we are beginning to see materialize.\n  However, not all of the consequences of the Balanced Budget Act have \nbeen positive, and many of them were unintended. Two years of \nimplementation allowed us to identify some areas, particularly related \nto Medicare provider reimbursement, that needed to be revisited.\n  The Finance Committee carefully monitored the impact of the Balanced \nBudget Act on various categories of health care providers. In fact, \nthis year the Committee held a number of hearings on Medicare and \nMedicaid matters.\n  Throughout the course of these hearings, providers presented us with \ncompelling testimony about significant fiscal and patient care-related \nproblems that have resulted, unintentionally, from decisions the \nCongress made in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n\n[[Page S15044]]\n\n  Mr. President, let me be clear that we should be proud of the program \nimprovements and the corresponding savings achieved through the \nBalanced Budget Act. We had no intention of fundamentally undoing that \nwork.\n  However, there were problems that needed to be addressed to make sure \nwe pay providers appropriately to meet the real health care needs of \nMedicare beneficiaries. At passage, the 1997 BBA reduced Medicare and \nMedicaid spending by nearly $120 billion. This package restores $27 \nbillion over 10 years to address unintended consequences of the \noriginal law.\n  New provisions in this bill restore some $17 billion in funding over \n10 years. Accordingly, in October, the Committee marked up and \noverwhelmingly passed a package of payment adjustments to fine tune the \npolicies enacted through the Balanced Budget Act. This package was \ndeveloped in a bipartisan manner with the close cooperation of Senator \nMoynihan and his staff.\n  For the past several days, we have been working to reconcile this \nFinance Committee package with a similar bill passed by the House of \nRepresentatives last Friday.\n  The bill before us today represents an excellent compromise between \nthe House and Senate bills, with input from the Administration.\n  The payment adjustments included in the House-Senate compromise \npackage will benefit Medicare beneficiaries by improving payment to all \nsectors of the health care market place--including hospitals, \nphysicians' offices, nursing facilities, community health centers, and \nhome health care agencies, among many others. In addition, the package \nincludes other technical adjustments to Medicaid and the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program.\n  The provisions included in the package are consistent with a few \nbasic goals I have tried to work toward from the beginning of this \nprocess. First, I felt that the overriding purpose of this package \nshould be to address the most significant problems resulting from BBA \npolicies.\n  In my view, larger Medicare reform continues to be an important \nobjective. However, even the White House ultimately agreed this was \nneither the moment nor the legislative vehicle by which to pursue that \ngoal.\n  The Senate Finance Committee will continue in its efforts to develop \na bipartisan consensus on broader Medicare reform when we resume our \nwork in January. That will be the time and place to consider lasting \nand far-reaching Medicare reforms.\n  Second, we sought to keep payment adjustments focused on areas in \nwhich we face demonstrated problems resulting from the Balanced Budget \nAct. Furthermore, we tired to make short-term adjustments in payment \npractices without revisiting the underlying policies set forth in the \nBBA.\n  Finally, it was particularly important to me not to let this become a \npartisan process. These are not partisan issues and I have tried to \nresist any effort to make them so. I am hopeful that this compromise \ncan be supported by all Senators.\n  The provisions included in the package reflect the priorities of \nSenators on and off the Finance Committee. In addition, like all of you \nI have consulted extensively with my own constituents in Delaware, as \nwell as with national health care and beneficiary organizations. They \nare strongly supportive.\n  Mr. President, the provisions included in this conference agreement \nmake some significant contributions to protecting the care provided to \nseniors in nursing homes. We provide increased funding for medically \ncomplex patients and for rehabilitation services in nursing, homes, and \nwe help these facilities' transition to the new payment systems \nrequired under the Balanced Budget Act. The Agreement also includes \nsomething I consider to be of vital importance to Medicare \nbeneficiaries; we put a moratorium on the arbitrary annual dollar cap \non the amount of rehabilitation therapy services a beneficiary could \naccess. In addition, we mitigate the impact of scheduled reductions for \nhome health agencies, increase funding and regional payment equity for \nteaching hospitals, and enhance programs for rural health care \nfacilities.\n  The Conference Agreement also includes important protections for \nhospitals as the new outpatient prospective payment system goes into \neffect next year. I am especially pleased at the steps we have taken to \nstabilize the Medicare+Choice program, so that beneficiaries can count \non Medicare health plan choices in the future.\n  Mr. President, today we have an opportunity to solve the problems \nthat have been interfering with the ability of the provider community \nto make sure our constituents receive the high quality health care they \ndeserve, without retreating from the important policy reforms enacted \nin the Balanced Budget Act. I ask all of you to join me in supporting \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today, the Senate is considering a multi-\nbillion package focused on adjusting certain Medicare provisions in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  That historic legislation made changes in payment structures for \nprograms and providers within Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Many in the Medicare provider community are concerned that these \nchanges have negatively affected their ability to provide adequate \naccess and quality care to their patients.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Administration and my colleagues for \ncompleting the difficult task of designing a bill that addresses many \nof these concerns.\n  I have heard from hospitals, physicians, community health centers and \na variety of other Medicare providers, all of whom are very concerned \nthat the quality of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries may decline \nsignificantly if cuts to provider payments are not softened.\n  There are many provisions in this bill that I would like to see \nenacted. These include a moratorium on the $1500 therapy cap, support \nfor the skilled nursing facilities, cancer centers and disproportionate \nshare hospitals, and enhancements to Medicaid and the Children's Health \nInsurance Program.\n  But while there is some clear evidence that Congress may have erred \nin designing some of the Medicare provisions in the Balanced Budget \nAct, that fact does not relieve us of our fiduciary responsibilities to \nthe American public.\n  Our commitment to revisiting Medicare provider adjustments must be \naccompanied by a commitment to pay for these actions.\n  By refusing to pay for this bill, we are funding changes to a \nbalanced budget agreement in a way that steals from future generations.\n  This is an irony we cannot afford.\n  Mr. President, allow me to explain.\n  To date, we have spent all of our anticipated revenue for Fiscal Year \n2000. Any further government spending comes straight from the Social \nSecurity surplus.\n  It is easy to spend money when it is not your own.\n  Didn't we prove that during the last thirty years of ``borrow and \nspend'' budgeting--a period in which our national debt rose from $366 \nmillion in 1969 to $5.6 billion today?\n  Let's not start down that slope again.\n  Mr. President, I clearly remember the day we passed the Balanced \nBudget Act in 1997. We all congratulated each other on a job well done.\n  We slapped each other on the back and took full and deserved credit \nfor balancing the budget for the first time in a generation.\n  Now we are facing up to some of the realities of that great \nachievement.\n  Just as we took responsibility for our accomplishments in 1997, we \nmust now take responsibility for fixing some of our mistakes.\n  If Congress believes that provider relief is necessary, then it must \nexercise fiscal responsibility and pay for it with true offsets--not \nsurplus funds.\n  Congress has clearly stated that ensuring retirement security for the \nAmerican public is its top priority.\n  Democrats and Republicans have made clear that saving Social Security \nand Medicare must be the first items of business on any legislative \nagenda.\n  But future generations are depending on our deeds--not our words.\n  Mr. President, we must hold true to our commitment to ensure Social \nSecurity's solvency until 2075 and to strengthen and modernize Medicare \nbefore we look to the surplus for any other purpose.\n  During his State of the Union Address, President Clinton made a \ncommitment to bolster Social Security and\n\n[[Page S15045]]\n\nMedicare. Congress has joined him in that commitment.\n  A test of our commitment to protecting Social Security surplus is \nbeing played out on the Senate floor today.\n  Since the beginning of this debate I have offered proposals to \nrestore payments to providers without stealing from Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  When the Finance Committee marked up its bill, I offered an amendment \nthat would have fully offset the cost of this package through a series \nof modest, non-Medicare-related revenue increases.\n  It was my hope that the Committee would have shown the same \nenthusiasm for fiscal responsibility as it did two years ago.\n  However, it thwarted our commitment to save Social Security and \nMedicare by a vote of 14 to 6.\n  I also offered an amendment that would have put a down payment on \ntrue Medicare reform, while saving the Medicare system $4 billion over \n10 years--nearly one third of the overall cost of the bill.\n  This focused on five proven and tested proposals, including a \ncompetitive bidding for part B services provision that was passed \nunanimously by the Finance Committee in 1997.\n  By fulfilling our obligation to help the Medicare system provide \nquality care while promoting cost efficiency, this amendment embraced \nthe same principles that helped us achieve a balanced budget in 1997.\n  But our dedication to these principles now appears to have vanished.\n  The audacity of paying for this bill with the Social Security surplus \nis exacerbated by the fact that it includes provisions that actually do \naway with cost saving programs enacted in the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997\n  Allow me to direct your attention to two of the less heralded \nprovisions in this package.\n  First, the postponement of the enactment of the ``inherent \nreasonableness'' provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 until \nfinal regulations are published. This provision prevents beneficiaries \nfrom realizing millions of dollars in savings by blocking the \ngovernment's ability to negotiate rates with home oxygen and durable \nmedical equipment suppliers.\n  By reimbursing providers on a market basis, the competitive bidding \nprocess will save the system money by setting a true price for medical \ngoods and services, while ensuring that beneficiaries continue to \nreceive comprehensive coverage.\n  By putting off the implementation of this provision, potentially for \nyears, we are essentially taking $500 million of potential savings out \nof the pockets of Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Second, is the inclusion of the following language in the conference \nreport concerning the risk adjuster for Medicare+Choice plans:\n  ``The parties to the agreement note that in 1997, when Congress \nrequired the Secretary to develop a risk adjuster for Medicare+Choice \nplans, it was concerned that those plans that treated the most severely \nill enrollees were not adequately paid. The Congress envisioned a risk \nadjuster that would be more clinically based than the old method of \nadjusting payments. The Congress did not instruct HCFA to implement the \nprovision in a manner that would reduce aggregate Medicare+Choice \npayments. In addition, the Congressional Budget Office did not estimate \nthat the provision would reduce aggregate Medicare+Choice payments. \nConsequently, the parties to the agreement urge the Secretary to revise \nthe regulations implementing the risk adjuster so as to provide for \nmore accurate payments, without reducing overall Medicare+Choice \npayments.''\n  Mr. President, the Health Financing Administration (HCFA) currently \nestimates that risk adjustment will decrease plan payments by \napproximately $10 billion over ten years. This estimate is based on the \nadditional money that plans are paid relative to fee-for-service \nMedicare after adjusting for health status. Plans that serve a higher \nproportion of sicker beneficiaries would not see a decrease in \npayments. Plans that skim the healthiest patients from the Medicare \npopulation would see the biggest decrease in payments.\n  Since first learning that HCFA was planning to decrease plan payments \nunder risk adjustment, lobbyists for the managed care industry have \nbeen claiming that congressional intent was for risk adjustment to be \nbudget neutral, and they have been lobbying this issue on the Hill. \nThey tried to get it into the Senate Finance Committee report but were \nunsuccessful. The language was included in the House Ways and Means \ncommittee report, however. The House-Senate agreement language comes \nstraight from the House report.\n  It's telling that the statute does not explicitly state that risk \nadjustment should be budget neutral. In addition, it's telling that \nlobbyists for the managed care industry have not publicly stated that \ncongressional intent was to make risk adjustment budget neutral.\n  In terms of what congressional intent actually was in BBA 97--I think \nthe story is not entirely clear. It could be that no one thought much \nabout the issue. But regardless of whether you are sympathetic to \nmanaged care plans or not, it is disingenuous to claim definitively \nthat congressional intent was not to reduce plan payments in BBA.\n  This is an outrage Mr. President.\n  I believe that we should correct mistakes that were made in the BBA \nand pay for those mistakes. Equally, it is my feeling that we should \nseize the opportunity to make fundamental reforms to the Medicare \nprogram in order to modernize and improve services for Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  In passing this legislation, we are trading fiscal responsibility for \nfiscal recklessness. We are ignoring innovation in favor of the status \nquo.\n  Mr. President, I am committed to working to find a solution to the \ndifficult problem of bringing Medicare into the 21st Century and \nkeeping it solvent.\n  It was my hope that we would have the opportunity to vote today on a \npackage that represented good public policy and included an offset that \nupheld our commitment to fiscal responsibility.\n  I regret that this is not the case.\n  But most of all, I regret the overt lack of concern that this body \nhas shown for the future generations whose Medicare and Social Security \nbenefits hang in the balance.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Conference Report \nbefore the Senate contains the State Department authorization bill.\n  With enactment of this legislation, we will finally--after three \nyears of effort--approve critical legislation to authorize the payment \nof nearly $1 billion in back dues to the United Nations. Enactment of \nthis legislation will serve, I believe, three important purposes. It \nshould finally end the long-festering feud between the U.N. and \nWashington about our unpaid back dues; it should bring much-needed \nreforms to the world body so that it can more effectively perform its \nmissions; and it should, I hope, end the debate about the utility of \nthe U.N., and restore bipartisan support in Congress for the U.N. \nsystem.\n  The agreement before us will allow us to pay $926 million in arrears \nto the United Nations contingent upon the U.N. achieving specific \nreform conditions, or ``benchmarks,'' to borrow the Chairman's \nexpression.\n  The first set of these conditions can be readily certified--thereby \nreleasing $100 million immediately. The second and third set of \nconditions will be difficult to achieve. But I have great confidence in \nour ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke. And I believe \nthat with the money on the table--that is, with the assurance that the \nU.S. payment will be available--the reforms will be easier to obtain \nthen they might otherwise be.\n  The State Department authorization bill contains several other \nimportant provisions which I would like to highlight briefly.\n  First, the bill authorizes $4.5 billion in funding over the next five \nyears for construction of secure embassies overseas. The tragic embassy \nbombings in East Africa in August 1998 underscored the current \nvulnerability of our embassies to terrorist attack. Simply stated, the \nlarge majority of our embassies around the world do not meet current \nsecurity standards. Thousands of U.S. government employees--both \nAmericans and foreign nationals--are at risk, and we must do all that \nwe can to protect them. In addition to authorizing funding, this bill \ncodifies many important security standards, including the\n\n[[Page S15046]]\n\nrequirement of that embassies be set back 100 feet from the street, and \nthe requirement that all agencies be co-located in the embassy \ncompound.\n  All this is important. But what is essential is that we provide the \nactual funding. So far, aside from last fall's emergency appropriations \nbill, funding for embassy security has fallen far short of need. The \nPresident requested $3 billion in advance appropriations in his budget \nrequest, which was rejected by the Appropriations Committees. We must \ngive our attention to funding this priority matter next year.\n  Second, the bill provides for the establishment of a Bureau of \nVerification and Compliance in the Department of State to monitor arms \ncontrol and non-proliferation agreements. In his plan for the \nintegration of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency into the State \nDepartment, the President proposed that the functions of verification \nand compliance be handled by a ``Special Adviser'' to the \nUndersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security.\n  We think the Administration's proposal is ill-advised. Given the way \nthe State Department operates--where key policy battles are waged among \nbureaus at the Assistant Secretary level --this ``adviser'' would be a \nweak bureaucratic actor, and the function of assuring compliance with \narms control treaties and non-proliferation regimes would thereby be \nunacceptably diminished. Therefore, the conference report includes a \nprovision which requires that this important duty be handled by an \nAssistant Secretary of State for Verification and Compliance.\n  Third, the bill reauthorizes Radio Free Asia (RFA) for another ten \nyears. RFA, which was established in 1994 pursuant to legislation I \nintroduced, broadcasts news and information to the People's Republic of \nChina and other non-democratic states in East Asia. I am pleased that \nCongress has given its further stamp of approval to this important \ninstrument of American foreign policy.\n  It is fitting that this bill is named for two devoted public servants \nwho were deeply involved in the development of foreign policy \nlegislation for the last two decades--James Nance and Meg Donovan.\n  Admiral James W. Nance, known to everyone as ``Bud'', served as staff \ndirector of the Committee on Foreign Relations for most of the 1990s, \nworking with his long-time friend, the Chairman of the Committee, \nSenator Helms. Admiral Nance was a steady hand in guiding the Committee \nstaff for so many years, and was integral to the initial development of \nthe ``Helms-Biden'' legislation in 1997.\n  Meg Donovan was long-time staffer for our House counterpart \ncommittee, serving under Chairman Dante Fascell. After Chairman Fascell \nretired, Meg worked closely with the Foreign Relations Committee on \nbehalf of Secretary Christopher, and then Secretary Albright, as a \nsenior deputy in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs. Meg's advice and \ncounsel was important on dozens of occasions--not only to senior State \nDepartment officials but also to our committee.\n  Bud Nance and Meg Donovan were both deeply committed to a bipartisan \nforeign policy. They were both taken from us too soon. It is therefore \nin tribute to them that we have named this bill--which represents an \nimportant act of bipartisanship--in their honor.\n\n\n              the need for small business superfund relief\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as we end this session of the 106th \nCongress, it is appropriate to reflect on what we have accomplished and \nwhat remains to be done. In particular, Mr. President, I would like to \nfocus on our efforts to enact Superfund reform.\n  As my colleagues know, I have fought for many Congresses to free our \nnation's recyclers from needless Superfund liability. I could not be \nmore pleased to finally accomplish this goal by including the text of \nmine and Senator Daschle's bill, S. 1528, in this year's final \nappropriations package. I know many of you, on both sides of the aisle, \njoin me in celebrating this long-awaited reform of an unfair system.\n  However, our work is not done, Mr. President. Like the recyclers, \nthousands of small businesses are needlessly dragged into the Superfund \nweb each year. Although Superfund is intended to clean up the nation's \nhazardous waste sites, small businesses are being sued for simply \nthrowing out their trash. Certainly we can all agree that potato peels \nand cardboard boxes are far from toxic waste.\n  Yet, another year has gone by without reform for small business. In \nthat year, 165 small businesses in Quincy, Illinois were forced to pay \nover $3 million for legally sending trash to the local landfill. In \nthat year, Administrator Browner again publicly stated her desire to \nget small businesses out of Superfund. In that year, reform efforts \nwere again stymied by those who want to hold incremental reforms \nhostage to comprehensive fixes.\n  Mr. President, we had the opportunity this year to enact targeted \nSuperfund reform for small businesses, but we did not do so. Senators \nand Congressmen on both sides of the aisle, as well as the EPA, agree \nthat we should provide the relief so desperately needed by the small \nbusiness community. For nearly a decade, inaction has left thousands of \nsmall business owners with no choice but to mortgage their businesses, \ntheir employees and their future to pay for damage they did not do. \nSmall businesses struggle to survive under the threat of thousands of \ndollars in penalties and lawsuits--all for legally disposing of their \ngarbage.\n  That's why, Mr. President, I will continue to work to free innocent \nsmall businesses from Superfund liability. I hope my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle will join me in the continued fight for fair \ntreatment of the small businesses that keep our nation's economy \nstrong.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have some comments on issues raised by \nthe conference report to the Interior appropriations bill.\n  On the matter of contract support costs for Bureau of Indian Affairs \nand Indian Health Service programs operated by native organizations \nunder the provisions of P.L. 93-638, I am pleased that we have been \nable to add $10 million to BIA funding and $25 million to IHS funding \nover fiscal year 1999 levels to support additional payments of contract \nsupport costs for these programs. This new funding will allow BIA and \nIHS to bring existing programs' contract support cost payments closer \nto the full amount of negotiated support and will allow a limited \nnumber of new and expanded programs in both agencies to go forward.\n  However, I am concerned that the tribes have been operating, in the \ndistribution of contract support costs, under the assumption that \ncontract support costs are an entitlement under the law. The House and \nSenate committees on appropriations have taken exception to that \ninterpretation and have tried to persuade the IHS to change its \nallocation methodology and to set reasonable limits on the number and \nsize of new and expanded contracts it executes consonant with resources \nmade available by Congress for the payment of contract support costs. \nThe Federal circuit's court of appeals in its October 27, 1999 decision \nin Babbitt v. Oglala Sioux Tribal Public Safety Department (1999 WL \n974155 (Fed. Cir.)) has now affirmed that contract support costs are \nnot an entitlement, but rather are subject to appropriations. Contract \nsupport cases raising similar legal issues are pending in the 10th \ncircuit court of appeals and in various Federal district courts around \nthe country. The Federal circuit's decision was correct both in its \nholding and in its reasoning and should serve as precedent for other \npending cases. To assume that Congress would create a system in which \ntribes receive the majority of their contract support costs through \nfunds appropriated to the Indian Health Service or Bureau of Indian \nAffairs and which requires tribes to seek the balance in court through \nthe claims and judgment fund turns logic on its ear. ``Subject to \nappropriations'' means what it says.\n  The Indian Health Service has made improvements to its distribution \nmethodology in fiscal year 1999 but continues to distribute funds at \nvarying rates for different contracts, compacts and annual funding \nagreements. More disturbing, the current IHS system pays contractors \nwith high overhead costs (relative to program costs) at the same \npercentage rate as it pays contractors with low overhead rates, \nrewarding inefficient operators and creating an incentive to \nmaximize overhead costs.\n\n[[Page S15047]]\n\n  The bill allows the funding in FY 2000 of a limited number of new and \nexpanded contracts through the Indian Self Determination (ISD) Fund of \n$10 million. It is expected that, once the contract support cost total \n(paid at an average rate not to fall above or below the average rate of \npayment of contract support costs to existing contractors in FY 2000) \nfor new and expanded programs has reached $10 million, IHS will not \nexecute any further new or expanded contracts until Congress has \nprovided funds specifically earmarked for that purpose. Existing IHS \npolicy does not permit reduction of existing service providers' funding \nin order to fund new entrants into the system. This bill does not \nmodify that policy. If funds remain in the ISD fund after all new \nentrants have been accommodated, those funds should be distributed \nequitably across existing programs, with particular emphasis on the \nmost underfunded.\n  The Indian Health Service should include as part of its FY 2001 \nbudget request a detailed cost estimate for new and expanded contracts \nso that Congress will be aware of anticipated need when it establishes \na funding level for an ISD account in FY 2001. Congress and the courts \nhave made it plain that IHS can no longer enter into new and expanded \ncontracts without regard to the level of funding provided for that \npurpose by Congress. Congress will be aided in its efforts to establish \na reasonable level of support for new and expanded contracts if the IHS \nprovides accurate estimates of anticipated need as part of the budget \nprocess.\n  The authorizing committees in the Senate and House are encouraged, in \nconsultation with the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs and tribal organizations, to develop timely proposals to \naddress the longer term issues surrounding contract support costs, \nincluding the apparent contradiction between the self-determination \nprinciples laid out in P.L. 93-638 and the legal requirement that \ncontract support costs are ``subject to appropriations.''\n  Our committees encourage the transition of employees from Federal to \ntribal employment as part of self-determination contracts and self-\ngovernance compacts and strongly believe that the IHS should not \nprovide disincentives for such transfers. We have noted that each year \nstart-up costs from new and expanded contracts for the previous year \nare returned to the base for distribution to other contracts. These \nfunds, currently estimated at $4.5 million, will be available in FY \n2000. With my support, the House and Senate Committees on \nAppropriations will soon be sending a letter to the IHS requesting that \nit set aside a portion of base contract support funds associated \nwith prior year start up costs for use as a transition fund for costs \nassociated with employees who elect to transfer from Federal employment \nto tribal employment during the period after which contract support \ncosts for individual contracts have been determined for that year. To \nthe extent set aside funds are not needed for employee transition, they \nshould be distributed equitably among existing contractors, with \nemphasis on the most underfunded contracts.\n\n  In the last fiscal year and the one we are funding now, we will have \nadded a total of $60 million in new contract support cost funding to \nthe IHS budget. We know that these funds are critical to the success of \nIndian-operated health programs and that shortfalls still remain. \nHowever, in the current environment of caps on discretionary spending, \nwe must develop policies that support the self-determination principles \nembodied in P.L. 93-638 while taking into account the fiscal realities \nof limits on funding for these programs. I look forward to receiving \nrecommendations from the authorizing committees, the IHS and BIA, and \ntribal organizations which will address these issues in time for the \ncommittees' consideration during the FY 2001 appropriations cycle.\n  The conference report also includes a provision to authorize the \ninvestment of Exxon Valdez oil spill--or EVOS--settlement funds outside \nof the Treasury. This section is the exact language of legislation, S. \n711, reported by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nearlier this year, and represents an accord struck among many \ninterests. The details of this accord are discussed more fully in the \ncommittee report (Senate Rpt. 106-124) accompanying S. 711. These \ninterests include Koniag, a native regional corporation with a great \ninterests in seeing that their native lands are valued at the level \nthey feel appropriate given their prominence in the oil spill zone.\n  The continuing availability of EVOS funds for habitat conservation \nraises another important issue I hope can be resolved in the coming \nmonths. It regards revenue sharing payments arising from oil spill area \nacquisitions. New additions to refuge lands, such as those from EVOS \nsettlement land acquisitions, qualify adjacent communities to increased \nfederal payments in lieu of taxes under the Revenue Sharing Act of \n1935.\n  In 1995, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agreed to purchase from \nOld Harbor, Akiok-Kaguyak and Koniag Native Corporations over 160,000 \nacres of land within the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge. These lands \nwere acquired using funds derived from the consent decree in \nsettling the United States' and State of Alaska's civil claims against \nExxon, Inc. for damages caused by the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989.\n\n  The Exxon Valdez Trustee Council, which was formed to implement the \nconsent decree, adopted its restoration plan in 1994 with habitat \nprotection as a key component of the plan to recover the damages caused \nby the oil spill. The trustee council subsequently solicited interest \nfrom land owners throughout the spill zone and ranked the habitat based \non its restoration value for the species and services injured by the \nspill. The council, working through State and Federal land managing \nagencies, commissioned land appraisals and authorized negotiations with \nland owners.\n  Negotiated agreements with land owners, resulting in significant \nhabitat acquisitions, exceeded the appraisals approved by Federal and \nState appraisers. The trustee council in its resolutions authorizing \nthese acquisitions with settlement funds made several findings, I'm \nadvised that these findings included the following:\n  ``Biologists, scientists and other resource specialists agree that, \nin their best professional judgment, protection of habitat in the spill \narea to levels above and beyond that provided by existing laws and \nregulations will likely have a beneficial effect on recovery of injured \nresources and lost or diminished services provided by these \nresources.''\n  ``There has been widespread public support for the acquisition of \nthese lands, locally, within the spill zone and nationally.''\n  ``It is ordinarily the Federal Government's practice to pay fair \nmarket value for the lands it acquires. However, due to the unique \ncircumstances of this proposed acquisition, including the land's \nexceptional habitat for purposes of promoting recovery of natural \nresources injured by EVOS and the need to acquire it promptly to \nprevent degradation of the habitat, the trustee council believes it is \nappropriate in this case to pay more than fair market value for these \nparticular parcels.''\n  ``This offer is a reasonable price given the significant natural \nresource and service values protected; the scope and pervasiveness of \nthe EVOS environmental disaster and the need for protection of \necosystems . . .''\n  The trustee council-commissioned appraisals--which were performed in \naccordance with Federal regulations--for the three large parcels \nacquired within Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge are estimates of \nfair market value. However, they varied substantially from the \nlandowners' appraisals and what they believed to be their fair market \nvalue. The landowners rejected the initial offers made by the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service to purchase the lands based on the trustee \ncouncil's commissioned appraisals.\n\n  The estimates of fair market value based on the Federal appraisals \nare below the prices actually paid for the various parcels of land, and \nthey do not consider the purchase price paid in these and other \ngovernmental acquisitions in Alaska. The trustee council, through its \npublic process, difficult negotiations and subsequent findings \ndetermined that the price paid for the lands was a ``reasonable price'' \nfor a variety of reasons including past Federal large scale \nacquisitions.\n\n[[Page S15048]]\n\n  The acquisition in fee of these three large parcels within Kodiak NWR \nnow requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make payments in \nlieu of taxes to the Kodiak Island borough in accordance with the \nRevenue Sharing Act of 1935. The act directs the agency to make such \npayments based on the fair market value of acquired lands.\n  The service is currently using the federally approved appraisals \nestimating fair market value of these three large parcels as the basis \nfor computing the revenue sharing payment to the borough. The borough \nhas rightly challenged the service's determination of fair market value \nbased on the unique circumstances of these acquisitions and the \nfindings made by the trustee council in approving funds for these \nacquisitions.\n  A plain reading of the Revenue Sharing Act (which authorizes the \nSecretary of the Interior to make refuge revenue sharing payments) \nrequires that the determinations of fair market value be made in a \nmanner that ``the Secretary considers to be equitable and in the public \ninterest.'' Clearly, the public interest associated with these unique \nacquisitions has been well documented in the findings of the trustee \ncouncil.\n  The Revenue Sharing Act imposes no legal impediment for the Secretary \nto make a determination of fair market value that incorporates the \nunique circumstances of these acquisitions and the specific findings \nand actions taken by the trustee council. Thus, I urge the Secretary to \nreview the Kodiak Island borough's appeal to the service's \ndeterminations for making revenue sharing payments and do what is fair \nand equitable as called for by the act.\n  These are unique circumstances that exist nowhere else in the \nUnited States and are limited in Alaska to lands acquired in the Exxon \nValdez spill zone with settlement funds. Thus, there should be no \nconsequences for how revenue sharing payments are computed for service \nacquired lands in other parts of Alaska or throughout the rest of the \ncountry.\n\n  At this opportunity, upon the passage of another year's funding for \nthe Federal and Indian lands management agencies, I must call to the \nattention of my colleagues and to the attention of the President of the \nUnited States, an issue that troubles me deeply. Over the years, our \nGovernment has made commitments to native Americans which it has not \nkept. Many Americans thought that practice ended with the new, more \nenlightened self-determination approach to Indian policy. But as one of \nAlaska's representatives in the Senate, members of the President's \nstaff made personal promises to me just last fall on behalf of the \nnative people of the Chugach region which have not been kept.\n  In 1971 Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \n(ANCSA). The act cleared the way for Alaska native people, including \nthe Chugach natives, to receive title to a small portion of their \ntraditional lands as settlement of their aboriginal land claims. The \nact also cleared the way for the additional millions of acres to our \nnational parks, wildlife refuges, forests, and wilderness areas. \nAllowing native people to develop their lands freed them from economic \nbondage to the Federal Government. No longer would they have to depend \nexclusively on the benevolence of the Federal Government for hand-outs. \nThey could create their own jobs, generate their own income, and \ndetermine their own destiny. But only if they had access to their \nlands.\n  Both the administration and the Congress recognized the lands would \nbe virtually valueless if there was no way to get to them. The Claims \nAct recognized that native lands were to be used for both traditional \nand economic development purposes. Alaska natives were guaranteed a \nright of access, under law, to their lands across the vast new parks, \nrefuges, and forests that would be created.\n  In 1971 and again in 1982, under the terms of the Chugach Native Inc. \nsettlement agreement, the Federal Government made a solemn vow to \nensure the Chugach people had access to their aboriginal lands. Now, a \nquarter of a century later, that commitment has not been fulfilled. \nMany of the native leaders who worked with me to achieve the landmark \nNative Land Claims Settlement Act have died after waiting for decades \nwithout seeing that promise honored. Last year, Congressman Don Young, \nchairman of the House Resources Committee, added a provision to the \nHouse Interior appropriations bill that required, by a date certain, \nthe Federal Government to live up to the access promises it made to the \nChugach natives decades ago. In the conference last fall on the omnibus \nappropriations bill, the administration spoke passionately and \nrepeatedly against the provision.\n\n  Why? They fully admitted the obligation to grant an access easement \nexists. They acknowledged further that access delayed is access denied \nand that further delays were harmful to the Chugach people. They \nopposed the provision on the grounds that it was not necessary since \nthey were going to move with all due haste to finalize the easement \nbefore the end of 1998. Katie McGinty, then head of the President's \nCouncil on Environmental Quality sat across from me, looked me in the \neye, and promised me they would fulfill this long overdue promise \nbefore the end of the year.\n  She even offered to issue a ``Presidential proclamation'' promising \nonce again to do what had already been promised and promised and \npromised. My staff worked with OMB on the content of such a \nproclamation, but I told them it would not be necessary. I would take \nher at her word and believed the administration would live up to the \npersonal commitment she made to me.\n  Here we are a year later. Chugach still has not received its \neasement. Ms. McGinty is gone, but her commitment on behalf of this \nadministration remains. It is now the responsibility of others to \nensure the promises she made to me and to Alaska's native people are \nkept.\n  Congressman Young's House resources Committee has reported a bill, \nH.R. 2547, to address this issue legislatively, in the hope of forcing \nthe administration to do what it has promised to do. Senator Murkowski \nhas been tireless in his efforts to get the Federal Government to live \nup to the promises made to Alaskans concerning access to our State and \nnative lands. I support those efforts.\n  But I take the time today to say clearly to this administration that \nthe promises made by our Government to the Chugach people for access to \ntheir lands--and to me personally as their representative--must be \nhonored. Make no mistake, if the promises made to me by officials in \nthis administration last fall are not lived up to soon, if they oppose \nthe efforts of Congressman Young and Senator Murkowski on this issue, \nif they continue to obfuscate and ``slow roll'' this commitment, it \nwill be clear to all that his administration does not perceive the true \nmeaning of Robert Service's memorable phrase: ``A promise made is a \ndebt unpaid!''\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President. On behalf of myself and my cosponsor, \nMinority Leader Daschle, I would like to insert in the Record a \nlegislative history which describes the purpose of each section of S. \n1528, the Superfund Recycling Equity Act of 1999. Throughout the \nnegotiations of this language there has been quite a bit of \nmisrepresentation of the purpose of this bill. I hope this will be \nuseful in clearing the confusion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the legislative history \nbe inserted in the Record at this point.\n\n                    Legislative History for S. 1528\n\n\n                  section 127--recycling transactions\n\n                                Summary\n\n       The Superfund Recycling Equity Act of 1999 (the language of \n     S. 1528) seeks to correct the unintended consequence of \n     CERCLA that actually discourages legitimate recycling. The \n     Act recognizes that recycling is an activity distinct from \n     disposal or treatment, thus sending material for recycling is \n     not the same as arranging for disposal or treatment, and \n     recyclable materials are not a waste. Removing the threat of \n     CERCLA liability for recyclers will encourage more recycling \n     at all levels.\n       The Act has three major elements. First, it creates a new \n     CERCLA Sec. 127 which clarifies liability for recycling \n     transactions. Second, it defines those recycling transactions \n     for which there is no liability by providing that only those \n     persons who can demonstrate that they ``arranged for the \n     recycling of recyclable material'' as defined by the criteria \n     in sections 127(c) through (e) are not liable under section \n     107(a)(3) or (a)(4). The specific definition of ``arranged \n     for recycling'' varies depending upon the recyclable material \n     involved. Third, a series of exclusions from the liability \n     clarification are specified such that\n\n[[Page S15049]]\n\n     persons who arranged for recycling as defined above may still \n     be liable under CERCLA sections 107(a)(3) or (4) if the party \n     bringing an action against such person can prove one of a \n     number of criteria specified in Sec. 127(f). Lastly, new \n     CERCLA Sec. Sec. 127(g) through 127(l) clarify several \n     miscellaneous issues regarding the proper application of the \n     liability clarification.\n\n                               Discussion\n\n       Sec. 127(a)(1) is intended to make it clear that anyone \n     who, subject to the requirements of Sec. 127(b), (c), (d) and \n     (e) arranged for the recycling of recyclable materials is not \n     held liable under Sec. Sec. 107(a)(3) or (4) of CERCLA. \n     Sec. 127 provides for relief from liability for both \n     retroactive and prospective transactions.\n       Sec. 127(a)(2) is intended to preserve the legal defenses \n     that were available to a party prior to enactment of this Act \n     for those materials not covered by either the definition of a \n     recyclable material in Sec. 127(b) or the definition of a \n     recycling transaction within the bill. It is not Congress' \n     intent that the absence of a material or transaction from \n     coverage under this Act create a stigma subjecting such \n     material or transaction to Superfund liability.\n       Sec. 127(b)(1) is meant to include the broad spectrum of \n     materials that are recycled and used in place of virgin \n     material feedstocks. Whole scrap tires have been excluded \n     from eligibility under this provision because of concerns \n     about the environmental and health hazards associated with \n     stockpiles of whole scrap tires. Processed tires including \n     material from tires that have been cut or granulated, are \n     eligible for the benefits of this provision.\n       The term ``recyclable materials'' is defined to include \n     ``minor amounts of material incident to or adhering to the \n     scrap material . . .'' This is because in the normal course \n     of scrap processing various recovered materials may be \n     commingled. An appliance may, for example, be run though a \n     shredder that also shreds automobiles. As a result, the metal \n     recovered from the appliance may come into contact with oil \n     that entered the shredded incident to an automobile. Numerous \n     other examples exist.\n       Sec. 127(b)(1)(A) is intended to exclude from the \n     definition of recyclable material shipping containers between \n     30 and 3000 liters capacity which have hazardous substances \n     other than metal bits and pieces in them. The terms \n     ``contained in'' or ``adhering to'' do not include any metal \n     alloy, including hazardous substances such as chromium or \n     nickel, that are metallurgically or chemically bonded in the \n     steel to meet appropriate container specifications.\n       Sec. 127(b)(1)(B) means that any item of material which \n     contained PCBs at a concentration of more than 50 parts per \n     million (``ppm'') at the time of the transaction does not \n     qualify as recyclable material. Material, which previously \n     held a concentration of PCBs in excess of 50 ppm, but has \n     been cleaned to levels below 50 ppm, would still qualify for \n     exempt treatment. Item, in this context, is meant to apply \n     only to a distinct unit of material, not an entire shipment.\n       This legislation builds a test to determine what are \n     recycling transaction that should be encouraged under the \n     legislation and what are recycling transactions that are \n     really treatment or disposal arrangements cloaked in the \n     mantle of recycling. The test specified in 127(c) applies to \n     transactions involving scrap paper, plastic, glass, textiles, \n     or rubber. Transactions can be a sale to a consuming \n     facility; a return for recycling, whether or not accompanied \n     by a fee; or other similar agreement.\n       Sec. 127(c), (d) and (e), the term ``or otherwise arranging \n     for the recycling of recyclable material'' recognizes that \n     while recyclables have intrinsic value they may not always be \n     sold for a net positive amount. Thus a transaction in which \n     one who arranges for recycling does not receive any \n     remuneration for the material but rather pays an amount, less \n     than the cost of disposal, still qualifies for the protection \n     afforded by this Sec. 127.\n       A commercial specification grade as referred to in \n     Sec. 127(c)91), can include specifications as those published \n     by industry trade associations, or other historically or \n     widely utilized specifications are acceptable. It is also \n     recognized that specifications will continue to evolve as \n     market conditions and technologies change.\n       For purposes of Sec. 127(c)(3), evidence of a market can \n     include, but is not limited to: a third-party published price \n     (including a negative price), a market with more than one \n     buyer or one seller for which there is a documentable price, \n     and a history of trade in the recyclable material.\n       Sec. 127(c)(3) means that for a transaction to be deemed \n     arranging for recycling, a substantial portion, but not all, \n     of the recyclable material must have been sold with the \n     intention that the material would be used as a raw material, \n     in place of a virgin material, in the manufacture of a new \n     product. The fact that the recyclable material was not, for \n     some reason beyond the control of the person who arranged for \n     recycling, actually used in the manufacture of a new product \n     should not be evidence that the requirements of this Sec. 127 \n     were not met.\n       Additionally, no single benchmark or recovery rate is \n     appropriate given variable market conditions, changes in \n     technology, and differences between commodities. Instead, a \n     common sense evaluation of how much of the material is \n     recovered is appropriate. For example, in order to be \n     economically viable as a recycling transaction a relatively \n     high volume of the inbound material is expected to be \n     recovered for feedstocks of relatively low per unit economic \n     value (such as paper or plastic), while a dramatically lower \n     volume of material is expected to be recovered to justify the \n     recycling of a feedstock of very high economic value (such as \n     gold or silver).\n       It is not necessary that the person who arranged for \n     recycling document that a substantial portion of the \n     recyclable material was actually used to make a new product. \n     Instead, the person need only be prepared to demonstrate that \n     it is common practice for recyclable materials that he \n     handles to be made available for use in the manufacture of a \n     new saleable product. For example, if recyclable stainless \n     steel is sold to a stainless steel smelter, it is presumptive \n     that recycling will occur.\n       The first part of Sec. 127(c)(4) acknowledges the fact that \n     modern technology has developed to the point were some \n     consuming facilities exclusively utilize recyclable materials \n     as their raw material feedstock and manufacture a product \n     that, had it been made at another facility, may have been \n     manufactured using virgin materials. Thus, the fact that the \n     recyclable material did not directly displace a virgin \n     material as the raw material feedstock should not be evidence \n     that the requirements of Sec. 127 were not met.\n       Secondary feedstocks may compete both directly and \n     indirectly with virgin or primary feedstocks. In some cases a \n     secondary feedstock can directly substitute for a virgin \n     material in the same manufacturing process. In other cases, \n     however, a secondary feedstock used at a particular \n     manufacturing plant may not be a direct substitute for a \n     virgin feedstock, but the product of that plant completes \n     with a product made elsewhere from virgin material. For \n     example aluminum may be utilized at a given facility using \n     either virgin or secondary feedstocks meeting certain \n     specifications. In this case, the virgin and secondary \n     feedstock materials compete directly. A particular steel \n     mill, however, may only utilize scrap iron and steel as a \n     feedstock because of the design restrictions of the \n     facility. If that mill makes a steel product that competes \n     with the steel product of another mill, which utilizes a \n     virgin feedstock, the conditions of this paragraph have \n     been met. In this example, the two streams of feedstock \n     materials do not directly compete, but the product made \n     from them do. It is the intent of this paragraph that the \n     person be able to demonstrate the general use for which \n     the feedstock material was utilized. It is not the intent \n     that the person show that a specific unit was incorporated \n     into a new product.\n       Section 127 provides for relief from liability for both \n     retroactive and prospective transactions. However, an \n     additional requirement is placed on prospective transactions \n     in this paragraph such that persons arranging for such \n     transactions take reasonable care to determine the \n     environmental compliance status of the facility to which the \n     recyclable material is being sent. Reasonable care is \n     determined using a variety of factors, of which no one factor \n     is determinant. The clause ``not procedural or \n     administratrative'' is included to protect one who arranges \n     for recycling from losing the protection afforded by Sec. 127 \n     due to a record keeping error, missed deadline or similar \n     infraction by the consuming facility which is out of control \n     of the person arranging for recycling. For transactions \n     occurring prior to, or during the 90 days after, enactment of \n     Sec. 127 the requirements of Sec. 127(c)(5) shall not be \n     considered in determining whether Sec. 127 shall apply.\n       The person arranging for the transaction must exercise \n     reasonable care at the time of the transaction (i.e., at the \n     time when the buyer and seller reach a meeting of the minds). \n     Should a consuming facility's compliance record indicate past \n     non-compliance with the environmental laws, but at the time \n     the person arranged for the transaction the person exercised \n     reasonable care to determine that the consuming facility was \n     in compliance with all applicable laws, the transaction would \n     qualify for relief under Sec. 127.\n       In addition, the person must only determine the status of \n     the consuming facility's compliance with laws, regulations, \n     or orders, which directly apply to the handling, processing, \n     reclamation, storage, or other management activity associated \n     with the recyclable materials sent by the person. Thus, for \n     example, a person who arranges for the recycling of scrap \n     metal to a consuming facility would not be responsible for \n     determining the consuming facility's compliance with \n     regulations governing the consuming facilities production of \n     its product, just the consuming facility's compliance with \n     management of the scrap metal as an in-feed material.\n       It is common practice in the industry for scrap processors \n     to otherwise arrange for the recycling of a secondary \n     material through a broker. The broker chooses to which \n     consuming facility the secondary material will be sold. In \n     such cases, it is the responsibility of the broker, not \n     the original person who entered into the transaction with \n     the broker, to take reasonable care to determine the \n     compliance status of the consuming facility. Likewise, a \n     scrap processor may sell material to a consuming facility \n     which in turn arranges for recycling of all or part of \n     that material to another consuming facility. It is only \n     the responsibility of the scrap processor to inquire into \n     the compliance status of the party he arranged the \n     transaction with, not subsequent parties.\n\n[[Page S15050]]\n\n       In determining whether a person exercised reasonable care, \n     the criteria to be applied should be considered in the \n     context of the time of the transaction. Thus, when looking at \n     ``the price paid in the recycling transaction'' in \n     Sec. 127(c)(6)(A) one should look not only at whether the \n     price bore a reasonable relationship to other transactions \n     for similar materials at the time of the transaction in \n     question but should also take into account the circumstances \n     surrounding the individual transaction such as whether it was \n     part of a long term deal involving significant quantities. In \n     addition, market conditions vary considerably over any given \n     time period for any given commodity. Thus, when determining \n     whether the price paid was reasonable, general market \n     conditions, and variations should be considered.\n       Congress recognizes that small businesses often have less \n     resources available to them than large businesses. Thus, \n     Sec. 127(c)(6)(B) acknowledges the fact that a small company \n     may be able to determine less information about the consuming \n     facility's operations than a large company. The size of an \n     individual facility may be an important factor in the \n     facility's ability to detect the nature of the consuming \n     facility's operations.\n       Sec. 127(c)(6)(c) requires a responsible person who \n     arranges for the recycling of a recyclable material to \n     inquire of the appropriate environmental agencies as to the \n     compliance status of the consuming facility. Federal, State, \n     and local agencies may not respond quickly (or respond at \n     all) to inquiries made regarding a specific facility's \n     compliance record. Sec. 127(c)(5) only requires a person to \n     make reasonable inquiries; inquiries need not be made before \n     every transaction. Inquiries need only be made to those \n     agencies having primary responsibilities over environmental \n     matters related to the handling, processing, etc. of the \n     secondary materials involved in the recycling transaction.\n       Sec. 127(d)(1)(B) provides that a person who arranges for \n     the recycling of scrap metal must meet all of the criteria \n     set forth in Sec. 127(c) as they relate to scrap metal and be \n     in compliance with federal regulations or standards \n     associated with scrap metal recycling that were in effect at \n     the time of the transaction in question (not regulations \n     promulgated or standards issued sequent to the time of the \n     transaction). In addition, compliance must only be shown with \n     Solid Waste Disposal Act regulations, which were promulgated \n     and came into effect  subsequent to enactment of Sec. 127.\n       Section 127(d)(1)(C) as modified by Sec. 127(d)(2) is not \n     intended to exclude from liability relief such activities as \n     welding, cutting metals with a torch, ``sweating'' iron from \n     aluminum or other similar activities.\n       Section 127(d)(3) defines scrap metal using the regulatory \n     definition found at 40 CFR 261.1 The Administrator is given \n     the authority to exclude, by regulation, scrap metals that \n     are determined not to warrant the exclusion from liability. \n     Because Sec. 127 grants relief from liability both \n     prospectively and retroactively, any exclusion by the \n     Administrator would only apply to transactions occurring \n     after notice, comment and the final promulgation of a rule to \n     such effect.\n       Persons who arrange for the recycling of spent batteries \n     must meet the criteria specified in Sec. 127(e), in addition \n     to the criteria already discussed above and laid out in \n     Sec. 127(c) for transactions involving scrap paper, plastic, \n     glass, textiles, or rubber.\n       The act of recovering the valuable components of a battery \n     refers to the breaking (or smelting) of the battery itself in \n     order to reclaim the valuable components of such battery. The \n     generation, transportation, and collection of such batteries \n     by persons who arrange for their recycling is an activity \n     distinct from recovery. Thus, a person who generates, \n     transports, and/or collects a spent battery, but does not \n     themselves break or smelt such battery, is not liable under \n     Sec. Sec. 107(a)(3) and (4) provided all other requirements \n     set out in this Section are met.\n       Section 127(e)(2)(A) provides that for spent lead-acid \n     batteries, the party seeking the exemption must show that it \n     met the federal environmental regulations or standards in \n     effect at the time of the transaction in question (not \n     regulations or standards issued subsequent to the time of the \n     transaction).\n       Persons who arrange for recycling as defined by the \n     criteria specified in sections 127(a)-(e) and discussed above \n     may be liable under CERCLA Sec. Sec. 107(a)(3) or (4) if the \n     party bringing an action against such a person can \n     demonstrate that one of the exclusions provided for in \n     section 127(f) apply. Thus, the burden is on the government \n     or other complaining party to demonstrate the criteria \n     specified in section 127(f).\n       Sec. 127(f)(1)(A) is intended to mean that an ``objectively \n     reasonable basis for belief'' is not equivalent to the \n     reasonable care standard. The objectively reasonable basis \n     for belief standard is meant to be a more rigorous standard \n     than the reasonable care standard.\n       Sec. 127(f)(1)(A)(i) means that in order for the government \n     to show that a recycling transaction should not receive the \n     benefit of Sec. 127, it would have to prove that a person \n     knew that the material would not be recycled. Moreover, it is \n     not necessary that every component of the recyclable material \n     be recycled and actually find its way into a new product in \n     order to meet this requirement.\n       For the purposes of Sec. 127(f)(1)(A)(ii), smelting, \n     refining, sweating, melting, and other operations which are \n     conducted by a consuming facility for purposes of materials \n     recovery are not considered incineration, nor would they be \n     categorized as burning as fuel or for energy recovery. \n     However, nothing in this bill shall be construed to limit the \n     definition of recycling so as to restrict, inhibit, or \n     otherwise discourage the recovery of energy through \n     pyroprocessing from scrap rubber and other recyclable \n     materials by boilers and industrial furnaces (such as cement \n     kilns).\n       Sec. 127(f)(1)(A)(iii) sets forth certain obligations upon \n     one who arranges for a recycling transaction which occurs \n     within the first 90 days after enactment and had an \n     objectively reasonable basis to believe that the consuming \n     facility was not in substantive compliance with environmental \n     laws and regulations. This is the corollary to \n     Sec. 127(c)(5). The clause ``not procedural or \n     administrative'' is included to protect one who arranges for \n     recycling from losing the protection afforded by Sec. 127 due \n     to record keeping error, missed deadline or similar \n     infraction by the consuming facility which is out of control \n     of the person arranging for recycling. There is no \n     expectation that the person who arranged for recycling would \n     necessarily have carried out any type of records search or \n     made any extensive inquiries of administrative agencies.\n       The provision in Sec. 127(f)(1)(B) is intended to apply to \n     persons who intentionally add hazardous substances to the \n     recyclable material in order to dispose or otherwise rid \n     themselves of the substance.\n       Sec. 127(f)(1)(C) is intended to mean that reasonable care \n     is to be judged based on industry practices and standards at \n     the time of the transaction. Thus, in order to determine if a \n     person failed to exercise reasonable care with respect to the \n     management and handling of the recyclable material, one \n     should look to the usual and customary management and \n     handling practices in the industry at the time of the \n     transaction.\n       In enacting Sec. 127(i) Congress clearly intends that the \n     exemptions from liability granted by Sec. 127 shall not \n     affect any concluded judicial or administrative action. \n     Concluded action means any lawsuit in which a final judgment \n     has been entered or any administrative action, which has been \n     resolved by consent decree, which has been filed in a court \n     of law and approved by such court. Furthermore, Sec. 127 \n     shall not affect any pending judicial action brought by the \n     United States prior to enactment of this section. Any pending \n     judicial action, whether it was brought in a trial or \n     appellate court, by a private party shall be subject to the \n     grant of relief from liability. For purposes of this section, \n     Congress intends that any third party action or joinder of \n     defendants brought by a private party shall be considered a \n     private party action, regardless of whether or not the \n     original lawsuit was brought by the United States. \n     Additionally, any administrative action brought by any \n     governmental agency but not yet concluded as set forth above, \n     shall be subject to the grant of relief from liability set \n     forth in this Sec. 127.\n       Sec. 127(l)(1) preserves the rights of a person to whom \n     Sec. 127(a)(1) does not apply to raise any defenses that \n     might otherwise be raised under CERCLA. This is consistent \n     with the explanation for Sec. 127(a)(2).\n       By adding Sec. 127(l)(2) Congress intended to make certain \n     that no presumption of liability is created against a person \n     solely because that person is not afforded the relief granted \n     by Sec. 127(a)(1).\n  Mr. DASCHLE. This past Wednesday--the day we finally produced a \nfragile budget agreement--marked the 199th anniversary of the first \ntime Congress ever met in Washington, DC. They met that day in what was \nthen an unfinished Capitol. Several times during the negotiations, the \nthought occurred to me that, if the same people who are running this \nCongress were in charge back then, the Capitol might still be \nunfinished.\n  These negotiations took longer, and were more difficult, than they \nneeded to be. The good news is: We finally have a budget that will keep \nAmerica moving in the right direction. Many longtime members and \nobservers of Congress say this has been perhaps the most confusing, \nconvoluted budget process they can remember.\n  There have been a lot of technical questions these last few weeks \nabout accounting methods, economic growth projections, and CBO versus \nOMB scoring. But the big question--the fundamental question that was at \nthe heart of this budget debate--is quite simple: Are we going to move \nforward--or backward?\n  We have chosen, thank goodness, to move forward. This budget \ncontinues the progress we've made over the last seven years. It \nmaintains our hard-won fiscal discipline. It invests in America's \nfuture. And it honors our values.\n  This budget will put more teachers in our children's classrooms, and \nmore police on our streets. It will enable us to honor our commitments \nto our parents, and fulfill America's obligations as a world leader. \nAnd, it will enable us to protect our environment and preserve precious \nwilderness areas for generations not yet born.\n  I want to thank the Majority Leader, my Democratic colleagues, \nespecially Senator Harry Reid, our whip, and\n\n[[Page S15051]]\n\nSenator Robert Byrd, ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. I \nalso want to thank some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, particularly Senator Stevens, chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  In addition, I want to acknowledge and thank President Clinton and \nVice President Gore, as well as the incredibly skillful, patient White \nHouse negotiating team, especially Chief of Staff John Podesta, Deputy \nChief of Staff Sylvia Matthews, OMB Director Jack Lew; Larry Stein and \nChris Jennings.\n  I also want to thank my own staff, and the staff of Appropriations \nCommittee, who have worked many weekends, many late nights, to turn our \nideas and debate into a workable budget document.\n  Finally, I want to acknowledge our dear friend, the late Senator John \nChafee. Losing Senator Chafee so suddenly was one of the saddest \nmoments in this difficult year. He embodied what is best about the \nSenate. He was a reasonable, honorable man who cared deeply about \npeople. Completing the budget process was a major challenge. But in the \nend, I believe we have produced a budget John Chafee would have \napproved of.\n  This budget invests in our children's education - the best investment \nany nation can make. It maintains our commitment to reduce class size \nby hiring 100,000 teachers. It contains money to help communities \nrepair old schools and build new ones. It will enable more children to \nget a Head Start in school, and in life. And it will allow more young \npeople to attend after-school programs where they will be safe, and \nwhere they will have responsible adult supervision.\n  This budget protects Medicare beneficiaries by providing fair \npayments to the hospitals, clinics, home health care providers and \nnursing homes they rely on.\n  This budget will make our communities safer by putting 50,000 more \npolice officers on the street--in addition to the 100,000 who have \nalready been hired--and by investing in youth crime prevention.\n  This budget will help keep Americans healthy . . . by reducing hunger \nand malnutrition among pregnant women, infants and young children . . . \nand by increasing funding for the National Institute of Health and the \nnational Centers for Disease Control.\n  This budget protects our environment. We took out riders that would \nhave harmed our environment, and put in money to fund the President's \nLands Legacy program.\n  This budget will help working families find affordable housing.\n  It will help farm and ranch families weather these hard times.\n  This budget protects our national security . . . by increasing \nmilitary pay and readiness . . . and by reducing the nuclear threat at \nhome and around the world.\n  This budget will help us fulfill our responsibilities as the world's \nonly superpower. It provides money to pay our UN arrears and fund the \nWye Accord to promote peace to the Middle East. It will also enable us \nto ease the crushing burden of debt on some of the world's poorest \ncountries, so those nations can begin to invest in their own futures.\n  At the beginning of the year, our Republican colleagues proposed an \n$800 billion tax cut. For months, we all heard a lot of debate about \nwhat such a huge tax cut would mean. This budget makes it clear. There \nis no way we could have paid for an $800 billion tax cut without \nexploding the deficit again, or raiding Medicare, education, and other \nprograms working families depend on.\n  Instead of moving backwards on taxes, we're moving forward. We're \ncutting taxes the right way. We're widening the circle of opportunity . \n. . by extending the R tax credit, and other tax credits that \nstimulate the economy . . . and by empowering people with disabilities \nby allowing them to maintain their Medicare and Medicaid coverage when \nthey return to work.\n  There is one other point I want to make about the budget: For every \ndollar Democrats succeeded in restoring these last few weeks . . . for \nteachers, and police officers and other critical priorities . . . we \nhave provided a dollar in offsets. Dollar for dollar, every one of our \npriorities is paid for. If CBO determines that this budget exceeds the \ncaps, the overspending is in the basic budget our Republican colleagues \ndrafted--on their own.\n\n\n                         the unfinished agenda\n\n  As I said, Mr. President, this budget does move the country in the \nright direction--but only incrementally. My great regret and \nfrustration with this Congress, is that we have achieved so little \nbeyond this budget.\n  Look what we are leaving undone! In a year in which gun violence \nhorrified America . . . a year in which gun violence invaded our \nschools and even a day care center . . . the far right has prevented \nthis Congress from passing even the most modest gun safety measures--\nmeasures that would make it harder for children and criminals to get \nguns.\n  The far right has prevented this Congress--so far--from passing a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. More than 90 percent of Americans--Democrats \nand Republicans--support a real Patients' Bill of Rights that holds \nHMOs accountable. So does the AMA, the American Nurses Association--and \n200 other health care and consumer organizations. And so does a \nbipartisan majority in both the House and Senate. Yet the Republican \nleaders in this Congress continue to use parliamentary tricks to deny \npatients their rights. As we leave here for the year, HMO reform, like \ngun safety, has been stuck for months in the black hole of conference \ncommittees.\n  The Republican leadership clearly is hoping that we will forget about \nall the shootings . . . forget about the families who have been injured \nbecause some HMO accountant overruled their doctor and denied needed \nmedical treatment. I am here to tell them: The American people will not \nforget. And neither will Senate Democrats.\n  We will fight to close the gun show loophole. And we will fight to \npass a real Patients' Bill of Rights next year. We will continue the \nfight for meaningful campaign finance reform. We will continue the \nfight to preserve and strengthen Medicare--including adding a \nprescription drug benefit. We will resume the fight for a decent \nminimum wage increase. We will fight for a fair resolution of the \ndairy-pricing issue. And, we will restore the rural loan guarantee \nprogram for satellite TV service, so rural Americans aren't left with \nsecond-class service.\n  It's taken a long time, but we finally have a budget that keeps \nAmerica moving in the right direction. That is a relief, and a victory \nfor the American people. But we still have a long way to go. We are \nleaving here with too many urgent needs unmet. We must do better next \nyear.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Superfund Recycling Equity Act, S. \n1528, is being sent to the President as part of H.R. 3194. This is a \ngreat day for environmental law--this is the day that the public policy \nrestores recycling as a rewarded, rather than punished activity.\n  This is a great day because partisan feuding was set aside so that \nthe Congress could find a realistic, incremental, and common sense \nenvironmental fix. The freestanding Superfund Recycling Equity Act has \nstrong bipartisan support with 68 cosponsors--68 Senators who have \nworked together to advance a fix to a small piece of the Superfund \ndebate.\n  In this controversial world of environmental legislation it is rare \nthat the leaders of the two parties in either Congressional body would \nagree on a piece of legislation. Well, here in the Senate we do. I wish \nto thank Minority Leader Daschle who understood the merits of recycling \nand twice joined with me to sponsor this legislation. Without his \nleadership, this legislation would not have been possible.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to commend the Senators who \noriginally joined Senator Daschle and me in introducing this \nlegislation. Senators Warner and Lincoln, who sponsored this measure in \na previous Congress, have long exhibited their enthusiasm for fixing \nrecycling rules. They are true leaders--leaders who have fostered this \nreasonable, workable, environmental proposal. Senator Baucus, the \nRanking Minority Member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nhas also been an avid supporter of recycling by including a version of \nthe Superfund Recycling Equity Act in his comprehensive Superfund \nreform bill in the 103rd Congress. His six years of leadership in \ntrying to fix public policy for recyclers is appreciated.\n\n[[Page S15052]]\n\n  Mr. President, this bill would not be where it is at today, on the \ncusp of becoming law, had it not been for the active support of the \nlate Senator John Chafee--a dear friend to me and many of our \ncolleagues. John Chafee was a respected leader of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. His advice and counsel helped shape my bill and \nhe was an original cosponsor. I am proud to have been associated with \nhim on this bill and its legislative process. I consider it a tribute \nthat this bipartisan bill, negotiated with the Administration, \nrepresentatives of the national environmental community, and the \nrecycling industry, was supported by John Chafee, a man for whom \nconsensus was so important. I believe this is not a footnote to John \nChafee's legacy; rather I believe that he made this kind of cooperation \npossible.\n  The former mayor of Warwick, Rhode Island, is now the newly appointed \nSenator from Rhode Island. I have already had an opportunity to hear \nour newest senator--Senator Lincoln Chafee--tell me about what Warwick \nhas done with regards to recycling. It is a proud record--a record that \nwould be extended and enhanced by this bill. I find it a credit to John \nChafee's legacy that his son would be working with me on this \nlegislation. Less than a month in the Senate and already Lincoln's \nvoice is being heard in ways that will directly help Rhode Island.\n  Mr. President, I also must recognize the vision of trade associations \nlike American Petroleum Institute and National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses for supporting an incremental solution. It would \nhave been easier for these groups to oppose the bill because it did not \naddress all the fixes for which they have been advocating. However, AFI \nand NFIB recognized that this increment would not jeopardize their \nefforts; rather it exemplifies the efforts of various stakeholders to \naccomplish something positive for the environment albeit it \nincremental.\n  And finally, I must thank the various staff members who have \ndiligently worked toward the passage of this legislation: Eric Washburn \nand Peter Hanson of Senator Daschle's staff, Tom Gibson and Barbara \nRogers of the Environment and Public Works committee staff, Charles \nBarnett of Senator Lincoln's staff, Ann Loomis of Senator Warner's \nstaff, and my former staffer, Kristy Simms, who set the stage for this \nyears success.\n  While too often Senators have seen various interest groups tell \nCongress why we cannot achieve some worthy environmental goal, the \nhistory of the Superfund Recycling Equity Act is replete with evidence \nof people coming together to correct a problem. Everyone, including \nmyself, realizes that comprehensive reform is necessary to fix the vast \narray of problems in many different sectors of the environmental \ncommunity. Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world, so \nCongress must do what is achievable whenever it is possible. This is \ngood public policy --increments will show all parties there is a bridge \nfor bipartisan environmental fixes. Recycling is the first of many \nnecessary fixes, and I would bet my colleagues that it will not be the \nlast fix.\n  This is a great day for many environmental groups who saw a change \nthat they supported, not be taken hostage by the debate that has for so \nmany years paralyzed reforms to Superfund. The original negotiation \nthat resulted in the basis of the bill was tough and long--but it was \nfair. Each of the negotiating partners left items on the table that \nthey would have wanted in an otherwise perfect world. Their collective \napproach was always bipartisan--they never pitted one party against \nanother by pledging one group of interests against another. They \nremained loyal to their agreement for an unheard of five years--an \neternity in Washington. Though this legislation was a long time in \ncoming, I am grateful for its passage.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a great day for my good friend and fellow \nMississippian, Phillip Morris. It is also a great day for the thousands \nof mom-and-pop recycling firms across America, like the one owned by \nPhillip Morris. This legislation protects the legacy of these firms \nwhich in most cases have been handed down through generations--often \nstarted by new immigrants to America nearly a hundred years ago. This \nends the long Superfund nightmare that our nation's recyclers have \nsuffered. Each time they sold their recyclable products they were, \nunintentionally, exposing themselves to costly Superfund liability. \nRemoving Superfund as an impediment to recycling is a predicate to \nhigher recycling rates throughout the nation.\n  The Superfund Equity Act is not about special interests getting a \nfix. No, this bill is about representing constituent interests \nthroughout America and promoting the public interest. That is why \nSenator Daschle and I have 68 cosponsors--cosponsors that range \ncompletely across the liberal and conservative political spectrum, and \nrange across all regions of America.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear, the Superfund Recycling Equity Act \ncorrects a mistake nobody intended to make. When the Comprehensive \nEmergency Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) was enacted \nin 1980, there was no suggestion that traditional recyclables--paper, \nplastic, glass, metal, textiles, and rubber were ever intended to be \nsubject to Superfund liability. As a result of court interpretations, \nhowever, the sale of recyclables as manufacturing feedstock was \nconsidered to be arranging for the disposal of the material and, \ntherefore, subject to Superfund's liability scheme. However, as we have \nall come to know as a matter of public policy, recycling is not \ndisposal; it is the exact opposite of disposal.\n  Mr. President, let me say that again--recycling is not disposal, and \na law is needed to remove this confusion. Sad, but true.\n  Enactment of this legislation clarifies this point and corrects the \nmisinterpretations that have cost recyclers--primarily small family-\nowned businesses--millions and millions of dollars for problems they \ndid not cause. With passage of the Superfund Recycling Equity Act, the \ncosts of cleanup at sites that utilize recyclable materials as \nfeedstock will be borne, rightfully, by those persons who actually \ncause or contribute to the pollution. As a result, those facilities \nwill be less likely to cause contamination because they will no longer \nhave recyclers to help them pay for Superfund cleanup. That's a \npowerful market incentive and will cause the consuming facility to \nbecome more environmentally conscientious.\n  Let me be clear, this legislation will not alter the basic tenants of \nenvironmental law--polluters will still pay. This legislation does not \nrelieve recyclers of Superfund liability where they have polluted their \nown facilities. It also does not protect these businesses when they \nhave sent materials destined for disposal to landfills or other \nfacilities where those materials contributed, in whole or in part, to \nthe pollution of those facilities. Furthermore, the public can expect \nrecyclers to continue to be environmentally vigilant because they must \noperate their businesses in an environmentally sound manner, in order \nto be relieved of Superfund liability.\n  Today is a victory for coalition building that avoids the attack \nstrategies that are so often employed by trade associations in DC. I \nhope they see the wisdom in building coalitions around achievable \nincrements. This is how Congress can move forward. This is how Congress \nshows that it not only hears from its constituents but it acts \nsuccessfully. Hostage taking, distortion, and scorch the earth \napproaches are not productive legislative strategies or lobbying \ntactics. Trade associations need to seek achievable solutions, develop \nresponsible legislative goals, and avoid Beltway attack politics. I am \nextremely pleased that Congress has been able to take this tiny but \nvery important step forward in reforming the Superfund law. I hope this \naccomplishment will inspire others to work for sensible, incremental \nsolutions that help both our environment and our nation's economy.\n  I am proud that today Congress leveled the playing field and created \nequity in the statutory treatment of recycled material and virgin \nmaterials. I am proud to have removed the disincentives to recycling \nwithout loosening any existing liability laws for polluters. I am proud \nto have represented the mom and pop recyclers across America. I'm \nespecially proud of the fact that this was all done in a bipartisan \nmanner.\n\n[[Page S15053]]\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, 2 years ago, as part of the effort to \nbalance the Federal budget, Congress enacted the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997--which we have come to know as the ``BBA.'' Among other \nprovisions, the BBA enacted major changes in the way Medicare pays for \nmedical services. As implementation of these changes proceeds, concerns \nhave been raised that some of them are having unintended consequences \nthat threaten the viability of health care providers--and consequently \nthe overall availability of health care to our constituents.\n  In order to alleviate some of these unintended consequences of the \nBBA, the appropriations conference report before the Senate today \nincorporates by reference H.R. 3426, the ``Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP \nBalanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999.'' This legislation will restore \nsome $17 billion over 10 years to hospitals, skilled nursing \nfacilities, home health agencies, and other Medicare and Medicaid \nproviders. The bill will also facilitate administrative actions that \nwill provide an additional $10 billion of relief to hospital outpatient \ndepartments.\n  H.R. 3426 has many important provisions; here are some of the \nhighlights:\n  Teaching hospitals will receive $600 million in additional Indirect \nMedical Education (IME) payments over fiscal years 2000 and 2001. They \nwill also benefit from other provisions that add money back to hospital \noutpatient departments, and which scale back cuts in Medicare \ndisproportionate share payments to hospitals serving low-income \npatients. I will have more to say about teaching hospitals in a moment.\n  Rural hospitals will be assisted by: an exemption from the new \npayment system for hospital outpatient departments; improvements in the \nCritical Access Hospital (CAH) program; a 5-year extension of the \nMedicare Dependent Hospital program; and an update in payments for Sole \nCommunity Hospitals (SCHs).\n  Skilled Nursing Facilities--usually referred to as SNFs--would \nreceive $2.1 billion of assistance over 10 years by: increasing \npayments for certain medically complex patients; permitting SNFs to \nswitch immediately to a more favorable payment system; and excluding \ncertain high cost items from consolidated billing.\n  The caps on payments for rehabilitation therapy would be suspended \nfor two years pending development of a better payment system; and \nhospice facilities, which are covered under Medicare part A, would \nreceive temporary payment increases in fiscal years 2001 and 2002.\n  Other provisions of the bill would: stabilize the formula used to \ncalculate payment for physician services; lift time limits for state \nuse of a fund for delinking of welfare and Medicaid eligibility; slow \nthe phase-down of a Medicaid cost reimbursement to community health \ncenters and rural health clinics; and provide adjustments to the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program--known as CHIP--which was enacted \nby the BBA of 1997\n\n\n                       graduate medical education\n\n  I would like to focus the remainder of my remarks on one particular \naspect of this legislation--funding for graduate medical education. My \nState of New York is the home to 117 teaching hospitals--almost 10 \npercent of our Nation's academic medical centers.\n  The cumulative effect of several provisions in the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997 has produced an unintended financial burden on teaching \nhospitals. First, the BBA enacted a multi-year reduction in payments \nfor the indirect costs associated with medical education, known as IME \npayments. Second, many teaching hospitals serve a large share of low-\nincome inpatients and have therefore been burdened by the BBA's cuts in \ndisproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments. Finally, many teaching \nhospitals are also subject to the BBA's reductions in hospital \noutpatient department reimbursements.\n  I am pleased that the legislation we are voting on today, mitigates \nthe fiscal pressures on teaching hospitals by adding back Indirect \nMedical Education (IME) funds in fiscal years 2000 and 2001. Teaching \nhospitals in New York will receive more than $150 million in additional \nIME payments over these 2 fiscal years.\n  In addition, the bill's relief to disproportionate share hospitals--\nthose serving low-income patients--will assist the many teaching \nhospitals serving those populations. Finally, teaching hospitals across \nthe Nation will benefit from the nearly $10 billion over 10 years in \nadditional payments to hospital outpatient departments.\n  I am concerned, however, about a change made in this bill to Direct \nGraduate Medical Education (DGME) payments. Medicare DGME payments \ncompensate teaching hospitals for the costs directly related to the \ngraduate training of physicians. Such DGME costs include residents' \nsalaries and fringe benefits, the salaries and benefits of the faculty \nwho supervise the residents, as well as other direct and overhead \ncosts.\n  The current payment methodology for DGME was developed in the \nConsolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). Under \nCOBRA, a hospital-specific per-resident amount was determined based on \neach individual hospital's 1984 Medicare allowable costs. This per-\nresident amount took into account the extent to which teaching \nhospitals already had alternative sponsorship--such as from a \nuniversity, medical school, or faculty practice plan--and locked \npayments at that level, so as not to replace outside funding sources. \nIn determining current DGME payments, 1984 costs are updated for \ninflation and subjected to a formula based on each hospital's number of \ncurrent residents (which is capped under BBA), and each hospital's \nproportion of inpatient Medicare beds.\n  Consequently, there is wide variation in DGME payments from hospital \nto hospital. On average, New York has a higher average per-resident \namount ($85,000/per resident) than the rest of the country ($67,000/per \nresident). However, DGME payments are hospital specific, not region \nspecific; even within New York great variation exists. In New York DGME \npayments range from $156,000 per-resident to $38,000 per-resident. \nThere are a number of factors which account for the variation in the \nhospital specific payments: the level of outside support from non-\nhospital sources; the relationship to the medical school; and state or \nlocal government appropriations. In addition, residents' salaries, \nwhich are determined by geographic cost of living factors, further \nexplains the variation.\n  The version of this legislation that passed the House of \nRepresentatives included DGME language that would change the hospital \nspecific per-resident formula to a payment based on a wage-adjusted \nnational average. I am pleased to say that during negotiations on these \nprovisions, I and the distinguished ranking Democrat on the Ways & \nMeans Committee, Representative Rangel, with Chairman Roth's support \nwere able to significantly narrow the scope of the House provision, \nthereby protecting many teaching hospitals in New York and elsewhere \nfrom abrupt changes in DGME payments. The scaling back of the House \nprovision will provide time to address the complicated DGME system in a \ncomprehensive and fair manner.\n  The negotiations necessary to reach agreement on both the IME and \nDGME adjustments in this legislation clearly demonstrate the need for \nfundamental change in the way that medical education is financed in \nthis country. What is needed is not year-to-year adjustments in \nMedicare funding but an explicit and dedicated source of funding for \nthese institutions--a Medical Education Trust Fund as I have proposed \nthis year and in the past.\n  The legislation that I introduced would require that the public \nsector, through the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and the private \nsector, through an assessment on health insurance premiums, contribute \nbroad-based and fair financial support. Changing the funding source for \ngraduate medical education from primarily Medicare funds to multiple \npayers would protect graduate medical education for the long term. \nTeaching hospitals are national treasures; they are the very best in \nthe world. Yet today they find themselves in a precarious financial \nsituation as market forces reshape the health care delivery system in \nthe United States. The all-payer trust fund I have proposed would \nensure that America continues to lead the world in the quality of its \nhealth care system.\n\n[[Page S15054]]\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Conference \nReport to H.R. 1554, the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act. This is \npro-consumer legislation which will promote much needed competition \namong television providers.\n  This legislation allows satellite carriers to carry local television \nstations for the first time. Consumers now will have a choice between \ncable companies and satellite companies that offer similar programming. \nThis competition should help lower costs and increase quality service \nfor all consumers.\n  In addition, this legislation contains many other pro-consumer \nprovisions. For example, it protects consumers who are about to lose \ntheir distant signals and establishes a new consumer-friendly process \nto determine distant signal eligibility.\n  This legislation also protects local broadcasters who provide a \nvaluable service to our communities. Most importantly, local \nbroadcasters should benefit from the legislation's must carry \nrequirements. The members of the conference also agreed on a provision \nwhich would encourage satellite carriers and other entities to provide \nlocal into local network service in small and rural markets. However, \nthis provision was taken out at the last minute. I strongly support \nfiscally sound ways of encouraging satellite carriers and other \nentities to provide local network television in small and rural \nmarkets.\n  This legislation is a good step in promoting competition among \nsatellite and cable providers. I urge support of this legislation, and \nI look forward to working early next year with other Senators regarding \nlocal into local network service for small and rural markets.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with renewed hope for the \nsafety of our public roads. In 1998, 5,374 people were killed in truck-\nrelated crashes. In my State there is a strong public sense of alarm \nabout this safety problem. And as trucks get bigger and heavier and the \nvolume of trucks on our roads increases, the General Accounting Office \n(GAO) predicts that by the year 2000, over 6,000 people will be killed \nevery year as a result of truck-related crashes. This prediction comes \nat a time when the Office of Motor Carriers (OMC)--the federal agency \ncharged with overseeing truck safety--has failed in its duties to \nprotect the American public. The Department of Transportation Inspector \nGeneral, the National Transportation Safety Board, the GAO and members \nof this Congress have all brought to light and documented the many \ninadequacies of this broken agency.\n  I commend the leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee for pursuing \nthis very important issue. H.R. 3419, The Motor Carrier Safety \nImprovement Act of 1999, addresses the numerous failings of the Office \nof Motor Carriers by strengthening federal motor carrier safety \nprograms, and by creating a new Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration. Although H.R. 3419 takes a large step in the right \ndirection, federal truck safety oversight needs a new look, with a \nfocus dedicated to reducing truck-related fatalities and injuries, and \nnot simply a new agency with new letterhead.\n  The Inspector General in his April 1999 report showed that the OMC \nhas not maintained an ``arm's length'' relationship between itself and \nthe industry it regulates. In fact, the report suggests OMC has \ndeveloped too close a relationship with the industry it must regulate. \nThis has limited OMC in taking the tough regulatory and enforcement \nactions that the accident data suggests are needed to protect public \nsafety. One example of this problem is that the OMC has consistently \nawarded research contracts to the regulated industry to perform some of \nthe most critical, and highly sensitive research on future rulemakings \ngoverning the industry. This practice appears questionable. In order to \nprotect the American public, an independent relationship should be \nestablished by the new Federal Motor Carrier Administration.\n  H.R. 3419 provides us with an opportunity for real progress in \nimproving truck safety, but only if the new Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Administration and its leaders commit to a new culture which \ntruly holds safety as the highest priority. This Congress and the \nDepartment of Transportation must restore the American public's trust \nin federal motor carrier safety programs, and take action that produces \nsafer results.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have some comments on issues raised by \nthe conference report to the Interior appropriations bill.\n  On the matter of contract support costs for Bureau of Indian Affairs \nand Indian Health Service programs operated by Native organizations \nunder the provisions of P.L. 93-638, I am pleased that we have been \nable to add $10 million to BIA funding and $25 million to IHS funding \nover fiscal year 1999 levels to support additional payments of contract \nsupport costs for these programs. This new funding will allow BIA and \nIHS to bring existing programs' contract support cost payments closer \nto the full amount of negotiated support and will allow a limited \nnumber of new and expanded programs in both agencies to go forward.\n  However, I am concerned that the Tribes have been operating, in the \ndistribution of contract support costs, under the assumption that \ncontract support costs are an entitlement under the law. The House and \nSenate Committees on Appropriations have taken exception to that \ninterpretation and have tried to persuade the IHS to change its \nallocation methodology and to set reasonable limits on the number and \nsize of new and expanded contracts it executes consonant with resources \nmade available by Congress for the payment of contract support costs. \nThe Federal Circuits Court of Appeals in its October 27, 1999 decision \nin Babbitt v. Oglala Sioux Tribal Public Safety Department (1999 WL \n974155 (Fed. Cir.)) has now affirmed that contract support costs are \nnot an entitlement, but rather are subject to appropriations. Contract \nsupport cases raising similar legal issues are pending in the 10th \nCircuit Court of Appeals and in various Federal district courts around \nthe country. The Federal circuit's decision was correct both in its \nholding and in its reasoning and should serve as precedent for other \npending cases. To assume that Congress would create a system in which \nTribes receive the majority of their contract support costs through \nfunds appropriated to the Indian Health Service or Bureau of Indian \nAffairs and which requires Tribes to seek the balance in court through \nthe claims and judgment fund turns logic on its ear. ``Subject to \nappropriations'' means what it says.\n  The Indian Health Service has made improvements to its distribution \nmethodology in fiscal year 1999 but continues to distribute funds at \nvarying rates for different contracts, compacts and annual funding \nagreements. More disturbing, the current IHS system pays contractors \nwith high overhead costs (relative to program costs) at the same \npercentage rate as it pays contractors with low overhead rates, \nrewarding inefficient operators and creating an incentive to maximize \noverhead costs.\n  The bill allows the funding in fiscal year 2000 of a limited number \nof new and expanded contracts through the Indian Self Determination \n(ISD) fund of $10 million. It is expected that, once the contract \nsupport cost total (paid at an average rate not to fall above or below \nthe average rate of payment of contract support costs to existing \ncontractors in fiscal year 2000) for new and expanded programs has \nreached $10 million, IHS will not execute any further new or expanded \ncontracts until Congress has provided funds specifically earmarked for \nthat purpose. Existing IHS policy does not permit reduction of existing \nservice providers' funding in order to fund new entrants into the \nsystem. This bill does not modify that policy. If funds remain in the \nISD fund after all new entrants have been accommodated, those funds \nshould be distributed equitably across existing programs, with \nparticular emphasis on the most underfunded.\n  The Indian Health Service should include as part of its fiscal year \n2001 budget request a detailed cost estimate for new and expanded \ncontracts so that Congress will be aware of anticipated need when it \nestablishes a funding level for an ISD account in fiscal year 2001. \nCongress and the courts have made it plain that IHS can no longer enter \ninto new and expanded contracts without regard to the level of funding \nprovided for that purpose by Congress. Congress will be aided in its \nefforts to establish\n\n[[Page S15055]]\n\na reasonable level of support for new and expanded contracts if the IHS \nprovides accurate estimates of anticipated need as part of the budget \nprocess.\n\n  The authorizing committees in the Senate and House are encouraged, in \nconsultation with the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs and Tribal organizations, to develop timely proposals to \naddress the longer term issues surrounding contract support costs, \nincluding the apparent contradiction between the self-determination \nprinciples laid out in P.L. 93-638 and the legal requirement that \ncontract support costs are subject to appropriations.\n  Our committees encourage the transition of employees from Federal to \nTribal employment as part of self-determination contracts and self-\ngovernance compacts and strongly believe that the IHS should not \nprovide disincentives for such transfers. We have noted that each year \nstart-up costs from new and expanded contracts for the previous year \nare returned to the base for distribution to other contracts. These \nfunds, currently estimated at $4.5 million, will be available in fiscal \nyear 2000. With my support, the House and Senate Committees on \nAppropriations will soon be sending a letter to the IHS requesting that \nit set aside a portion of base contract support funds associated with \nprior year start up costs for use as a transition fund for costs \nassociated with employees who elect to transfer from Federal employment \nto Tribal employment during the period after which contract support \ncosts for individual contracts have been determined for that year. To \nthe extent set aside funds are not needed for employee transition, they \nshould be distributed equitably among existing contractors, with \nemphasis on the most underfunded contracts.\n  In the last fiscal year and the one we are funding now, we will have \nadded a total of $60 million in new contract support cost funding to \nthe IHS budget. We know that these funds are critical to the success of \nIndian-operated health programs and that shortfalls still remain. \nHowever, in the current environment of caps on discretionary spending, \nwe must develop policies that support the self-determination principles \nembodied in P.L. 93-638 while taking into account the fiscal realities \nof limits on funding for these programs. I look forward to receiving \nrecommendations from the authorizing committees, the IHS and BIA, and \ntribal organizations which will address these issues in time for the \ncommittees' consideration during the fiscal year 2001 appropriations \ncycle.\n  Mr. President, the conference report also includes a provision to \nauthorize the investment of Exxon Valdez oil spill--or EVOS--settlement \nfunds outside of the Treasury. This section is the exact language of \nlegislation, S. 711, reported by the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee earlier this year, and represents an accord struck \namong many interests. The details of this accord are discussed more \nfully in the committee report (Senate Rpt. 106-124) accompanying S. \n711. These interests include Koniag, a native regional corporation with \na great interest in seeing that their native lands are valued at the \nlevel they feel appropriate given their prominence in the oil spill \nzone.\n  The continuing availability of EVOS funds for habitat conservation \nraises another important issue I hope can be resolved in the coming \nmonths. It regards revenue sharing payments arising from oil spill area \nacquisitions. New additions to refuge lands, such as those from EVOS \nsettlement land acquisitions, qualify adjacent communities to increased \nFederal payments in lieu of taxes under the Revenue Sharing Act of \n1935.\n  In 1995, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agreed to purchase from \nOld Harbor, Akiok-Kaguyak and Koniag Native corporations over 160,000 \nacres of land within the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge. These lands \nwere acquired using funds derived from the consent decree in settling \nthe United States' and State of Alaska's civil claims against Exxon, \nInc. for damages caused by the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989.\n  The Exxon Valdez Trustee Council, which was formed to implement the \nconsent decree, adopted its restoration plan in 1994 with habitat \nprotection as a key component of the plan to recover the damages caused \nby the oil spill. The trustee council subsequently solicited interest \nfrom land owners throughout the spill zone and ranked the habitat based \non its restoration value for the species and services injured by the \nspill. The council, working through State and Federal land managing \nagencies, commissioned land appraisals and authorized negotiations with \nland owners.\n  Negotiated agreements with land owners, resulting in significant \nhabitat acquisitions, exceeded the appraisals approved by Federal and \nState appraisers. The trustee council in its resolutions authorizing \nthese acquisitions with settlement funds made several findings, I'm \nadvised that these findings included the following:\n\n       Biologists, scientists and other resource specialists agree \n     that, in their best professional judgment, protection of \n     habitat in the spill area to levels above and beyond that \n     provided by existing laws and regulations will likely have a \n     beneficial effect on recovery of injured resources and lost \n     or diminished services provided by these resources.\n       There has been widespread public support for the \n     acquisition of these lands, locally, within the spill zone \n     and nationally.\n       It is ordinarily the Federal Government's practice to pay \n     fair market value for the lands it acquires. However, due to \n     the unique circumstances of this proposed acquisition, \n     including the land's exceptional habitat for purposes of \n     promoting recovery of natural resources injured by EVOS and \n     the need to acquire it promptly to prevent degradation of the \n     habitat, the trustee council believes it is appropriate in \n     this case to pay more than fair market value for these \n     particular parcels.\n       This offer is a reasonable price given the significant \n     natural resource and service values protected; the scope and \n     pervasiveness of the EVOS environmental disaster and the need \n     for protection of ecosystems . . .\n\n  The trustee council-commissioned appraisals--which were performed in \naccordance with Federal regulations--for the three large parcels \nacquired within Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge are estimates of fair \nmarket value. However, they varied substantially from the landowners' \nappraisals and what they believe to be their fair market value. The \nland owners rejected the initial offers made by the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service to purchase the lands based on the trustee council's \ncommissioned appraisals.\n  The estimates of fair market value based on the Federal appraisals \nare below the prices actually paid for the various parcels of land, and \nthey do not consider the purchase price paid in these and other \ngovernmental acquisitions in Alaska. The trustee council, through its \npublic process, difficult negotiations and subsequent findings \ndetermined that the price paid for the lands was ``a reasonable price'' \nfor a variety of reasons including past Federal large-scale \nacquisitions.\n  The acquisition in fee of these three large parcels within Kodiak NWR \nnow requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make payments in \nlieu of taxes to the Kodiak Island borough in accordance with the \nRevenue Sharing Act of 1935. The act directs the agency to make such \npayments based on the fair market value of acquired lands.\n  The service is currently using the federally approved appraisals \nestimating fair market value of these three large parcels as the basis \nfor computing the revenue sharing payment to the borough. The borough \nhas rightly challenged the Service's determination of fair market value \nbased on the unique circumstances of these acquisitions and the \nfindings made by the trustee council in approving funds for these \nacquisitions.\n\n  A plain reading of the Revenue Sharing Act (which authorizes the \nSecretary of the Interior to make refuge revenue sharing payments) \nrequires that the determinations of fair market value be made in a \nmanner that ``The Secretary considers to be equitable and in the public \ninterest.'' Clearly, the public interest associated with these unique \nacquisitions has been well documented in the findings of the trustee \ncouncil.\n  The Revenue Sharing Act imposes no legal impediment for the Secretary \nto make a determination of fair market value that incorporates the \nunique circumstances of these acquisitions and the specific findings \nand actions taken by the trustee council. Thus, I urge the Secretary to \nreview the Kodiak Island Borough's appeal to the Service's \ndeterminations for making revenue sharing payments and do what is fair \nand equitable as called for by the act.\n\n[[Page S15056]]\n\n  These are unique circumstances that exist nowhere else in the United \nStates and are limited to Alaska to lands acquired in the Exxon Valdez \nspill zone with settlement funds. Thus, there should be no consequences \nfor how revenue sharing payments are computed for service acquired \nlands in other parts of Alaska or throughout the rest of the country.\n  At this opportunity, upon the passage of another year's funding for \nthe Federal and Indian land management agencies, I must call to the \nattention of my colleagues and to the attention of the President of the \nUnited States, an issue that troubles me deeply. Over the years, our \nGovernment has made commitments to Native Americans which it has not \nkept. Many Americans thought that practice ended with the new, more \nenlightened self-determination approach to Indian policy. But as one of \nAlaska's Representatives in the Senate, members of the President's \nstaff made personal promises to me just last fall on behalf of the \nNative people of the Chugach region which have not been kept.\n  In 1971 Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \n(ANCSA). The act cleared the way for Alaska Native people, including \nthe Chugach Natives, to receive title to a small portion of their \ntraditional lands as settlement of their aboriginal land claims. The \nact also cleared the way for the addition of millions of acres to our \nnational parks, wildlife refuges forests, and wilderness areas. \nAllowing Native people to develop their lands freed them from economic \nbondage to the Federal Government. No longer would they have to depend \nexclusively on the benevolence of the Federal Government for hand-outs. \nThey could create their own jobs, generate their own income, and \ndetermine their own destiny. But only if they had access to their \nlands.\n  Both the administration and the Congress recognized the lands would \nbe virtually valueless if there was no way to get to them. The Claims \nAct recognized that Native lands were to be used for both traditional \nand economic development purposes. Alaska Natives were guaranteed a \nright of access, under law, to their lands across the vast new parks, \nrefuges, and forests that would be created.\n  In 1971 and again in 1982, under the terms of the Chugach Native Inc. \nsettlement agreement, the Federal Government made a solemn vow to \nensure the Chugach people had access to their aboriginal lands. Now a \nquarter of a century later, that commitment has not been fulfilled. \nMany of the Native leaders who worked with me to achieve the landmark \nNative Land Claims Settlement Act have died after waiting for decades \nwithout seeing that promise honored.\n  Last year, Congressman Don Young, Chairman of the House Resources \nCommittee, added a provision to the House Interior Appropriations bill \nthat required, by a date certain, the Federal Government to live up to \nthe access promises it made to the Chugach Natives decades ago. In the \nconference last fall on the Omnibus appropriations bill, \nthe administration spoke passionately and repeatedly against the \nprovision.\n\n  Why? They fully admitted the obligation to grant an access easement \nexists. They acknowledged further that access delayed is access denied \nand that further delays were harmful to the Chugach people. They \nopposed the provision on the grounds that it was not necessary since \nthey were going to move with all due haste to finalize the easement \nbefore the end of 1998. Katie McGinty, then head of the President's \nCouncil on Environmental Quality sat across from me, looked me in the \neye, and promised me they would fulfill this long overdue promise \nbefore the end of the year.\n  She even offered to issue a ``Presidential Proclamation'' promising \nonce again to do what had already been promised and promised and \npromised. My staff worked with OMB on the content of such a \nproclamation, but I told them it would not be necessary. I would take \nher at her word and believed the administration would live up to the \npersonal commitment she made to me.\n  Here we are a year later, Chugach still has not received its \neasement. Ms. McGinty is gone, but her commitment on behalf of this \nadministration remains. It is now the responsibility of others to \nensure the promises she made to me and to Alaska's Native people are \nkept.\n  Congressman Young's House Resources Committee has reported a bill, \nH.R. 2547, to address this issue legislatively, in the hope of forcing \nthe administration to do what it has promised to do. Senator Murkowski \nhas been tireless in his efforts to get the Federal Government to live \nup to the promises made to Alaskans concerning access to our State and \nNative lands. I support those efforts.\n  But I take the time today to say clearly to this administration that \nthe promises made by our Government to the Chugach people for access to \ntheir lands--and to me personally as their Representative--must be \nhonored. Make no mistake, if the promises made to me by officials in \nthis administration last fall are not lived up to soon, if they oppose \nthe efforts of Congressman Young and Senator Murkowski on this issue, \nif they continue to obfuscate and ``slow roll'' this commitment, it \nwill be clear to all that this administration does not perceive the \ntrue meaning of Robert Service's memorable phrase: ``A promise made is \na debt unpaid''!\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased the Senate is \nconsidering the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, to restore some \nof the unanticipated cuts in Medicare and Medicaid made in 1997 and I \ncommend the Senate leadership, the Finance Committee, Senators Roth and \nMoynihan, and the Administration for their hard work in developing this \nbill. The bill includes several important provisions.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 has been one of several factors \nthreatening the overall stability of the health care system in \nCalifornia, which many believe to be on the verge of collapse. Today I \nwill focus on eight provisions of the bill which are particularly \nimportant to California.\n\n\n                california's health care system eroding\n\n  During the past few months, I have met with many California health \ncare leaders who have convinced me that the Medicare and Medicaid cuts \ncontained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have undermined the \nfinancial stability of California's health care system. In the past 6 \nmonths, I have urged President Clinton, Secretary Shalala, and Senators \nRoth and Moynihan to join me in addressing the impact the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 is having on our nation's health care system.\n  California's health care system, in the words of a November 15th Wall \nStreet Journal article, is a ``chaotic and discombobulated \nenvironment.'' It is stretched to the limit:\n  Thirty-seven California hospitals have closed since 1996, and up to \n15 percent more may close by 2005.\n  By 2002, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 will result in cuts of $5.2 \nbillion for California hospitals. For California's two largest Catholic \nhealth systems, Catholic Healthcare West and St. Joseph's Health \nSystem, the loss amounts to over $842 million.\n  Over half of my state's hospitals lose money on hospital operations \nannually.\n  Hospitals have laid off staff.\n  California physician groups are failing at the rate of one a week, \nwith 115 bankruptcies or closures since 1996.\n  Academic medical centers, which incur added costs unique to their \nmission, are facing margins reduced to zero and below.\n  The University of California's five medical centers will lose $225 \nmillion.\n  California hospitals are contending with the impact of BBA while \nfacing a projected margin of negative 7.58 percent by 2002, compared to \nthe national rate of negative 4 percent.\n  For rural California hospitals, because 40 percent of patients \nreceive Medicare and 20 percent receive Medicaid, 69 percent lost money \nin 1998, according to the California Health Care Association.\n  In short, restoring Medicare cuts is crucial to stabilizing \nCalifornia's health delivery system.\n\n\n                               Hospitals\n\n  This bill contains several provisions that will help stabilize \nCalifornia's hospitals by restoring $400 million, according to \npreliminary estimates of the California Health Care Association. This \nbill clarifies that Congress' intent was not to impose a 5.7 percent \ncut in outpatient services, which restores $137\n\n[[Page S15057]]\n\nmillion to California, according to preliminary estimates by the \nCalifornia Health Care Association. Cancer hospitals are held harmless \npermanently. Since Medicare is a major payer for hospital care, \nimproving payment rates and methods is a significant way to stop \nfurther closures and stabilize the system.\n\n\n                          safety net hospitals\n\n  I want to thank the Finance Committee and the Administration for \nincluding a provision maintaining adequate Medicaid payments to \ndisproportionate share hospitals. California has a disproportionate \nburden of uncompensated care. We have one of the highest uninsured \nrates in the country at 24 percent, while the national rate is 17 \npercent. California has the fourth highest uninsured rate in the \ncountry, a rate that has risen over the last 5 years and now totals \nover seven million people. As a result of Medicaid reductions in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997, California's Medicaid disproportionate \nshare hospital program could lose more than $200 million by 2002, \nrepresenting a 20 percent reduction in the program, if what is know as \nthe ``transition rule'' for California's public hospitals is not \nextended. At my urging, this bill continues for California only the \n``transition rule'' allowing California DSH hospitals to calculate \nMedicaid payments at 175 percent of unreimbursed costs. Under this \nprovision, tens of millions of dollars will be restored to California \nhospitals.\n  Public hospitals carry a disproportionate share of caring for the \npoor and uninsured. The uninsured often choose public hospitals and \nfrequently wait until their illnesses are exacerbated when they come to \nthe emergency room, making their care even more costly. Without this \ntransition rule, for example, Kern Medical Center, in Bakersfield, \nwould lose $8 million. Alameda County, would lose $14 million.\n  Forty percent of all California uninsured hospital patients were \ntreated at public hospitals in 1998, up from 32 percent in 1993. The \nuninsured as a share of all discharges for public hospitals grew from \n22 percent in 1993 to 29 percent in 1998. While overall public hospital \ndischarges declined from 1993 to 1999 by 15 percent, discharges for \nuninsured patients increased by 11 percent. Large numbers of uninsured \nadd huge uncompensated costs to our public hospitals.\n\n\n                       medicaid community clinics\n\n  Another important provision is the Medicaid payment method for \ncommunity health clinics. Extending the phase out of cost-based \nreimbursement for community health clinics over four years will help \nalleviate the financial burden associated with the more expedited \nphase-out proposed under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  BBA 1997 allowed state Medicaid programs to phase-out the previous \nrequirement that clinics be paid on the basis of cost. The phase-out \nwas to occur over 5 years. Under the phase-out, health centers could \nlose as much as $1.1 billion in Medicaid revenues. California health \nclinics' could have lost $969 million annually. To halt further \ndecreases in payments to community health, an extended phase-out of \ncost-based reimbursement has been included in the bill which allows \nclinics in fiscal year 2000 to be reimbursed at 95 percent and by 2003 \nat 90 percent of costs.\n  California has over 7 million uninsured, and 306 federally qualified \nhealth centers and 218 rural health clinics that rely on federal \nfunding so that they can provide vital health services to some of the \nstate's sickest and poorest. Over 80 of California's clinics are \nlocated in underserved areas and provide primary and preventive \nservices to 10 percent of the uninsured people in the state. According \nto the federal Bureau of Primary Health Care's Uniform Data System, 42 \npercent of California community health center patients are children, 52 \npercent are adults ages 21-64, and 6 percent are the elderly.\n\n\n                              home health\n\n  I am also pleased that the bill addresses home health care in this \nbill. For example, the provision which delays the 15 percent reduction \nin payment for one year will enable home health providers to transition \nmore smoothly and better maintain continuity of services to patients. \nCalifornia will gain $162 million over 5 years as a result of all the \nhome health provisions included in the bill, according to preliminary \nestimates by the California Association of Health Services at Home.\n  While the intent of the BBA 1997 law was to restrain the growth of \nMedicare home health expenditures, it is now anticipated that home \nhealth expenditures in fiscal year 2000 will be lower than they were \nprojected in 1997. CBO estimated that BBA 1997 would cut $16 billion \nover 5 years. Recent estimates show cuts of $48 billion over 5 years, \nwhich is three times more than originally expected. HCFA's 1998 data \nshows that total Medicare payments to home health agencies declined \nbetween 1997 and 1998 by 33 percent; reimbursements dropped from $1.1 \nbillion to $745 million.\n  California home health providers have suffered immeasurably since \npassage of the BBA. In California, 230 home health agencies have closed \nsince 1997, which is 25 percent of all state licensed agencies, largely \ndue to the effects of BBA, according to the California Association for \nHealth Services at Home. For example, the home health agency at the San \nGabriel Valley Medical Center, which was providing nearly 10,000 \npatient visits per year, was forced to close this year due in part to \nthe effects of the BBA. Additionally, between 1997-1998 there has been \na 12 percent decrease in the number of patients served nationally and a \n35 percent decrease in the number of home health visits nationally. As \nthe population ages and families are more dispersed, it is especially \nimportant to help people stay in their own homes.\n\n\n                           medical education\n\n  I support the provisions included in the bill which alleviate \nreductions in graduate medical education and begin to restore equity in \npayment levels. Freezing cuts in the indirect medical education (IME) \npayment at the current level of 6.5 percent for fiscal year 2000, 6.25 \npercent in 2001, and 5.5 percent in 2002 and thereafter could help \nstabilize teaching hospitals and prevent a loss of about $3 billion for \nteaching hospitals nationwide over five years. For example, freezing \nindirect medical education payment rates represents $5 million to \nUCLA's teaching hospital. California's teaching hospitals as a whole \nwill receive approximately $52 million because of this freeze, \naccording to preliminary estimates by the California Health Care \nAssociation.\n  The bill also takes a good first step to correct Medicare's direct \nmedical education (DME) formula, a geographic disparity in payments, \nthat has paid California teaching hospitals far less than teaching \nhospitals in the Northeast so that California's teaching hospitals can \nbegin to receive payments for medical residents closer to those of \ntheir counterparts in other states. Currently, California teaching \nhospitals receive 40% less in Medicare payments for medical education \nthan similar New York institutions. The DME provision in this bill \nbegins to reform a longstanding inequity in the formula that has \nunfairly compensated medical education in California. California's \nteaching hospitals will benefit from this provision by approximately \n$52 million over five years, according to the California Health Care \nAssociation.\n  Many of the nation's teaching hospitals, including UCLA in \nCalifornia, are premier research and clinical care facilities and will \nbe forced to close down beds and lower the quality of care they provide \nif reductions in indirect medical education (IME) payments continues. \nAccording to the Association of American Medical Colleges, 30 percent \nof all teaching hospitals nationwide are now operating in the red, and \nby 2002, 50 percent of all teaching hospitals will be losing money \nwithout this bill.\n  Academic medical centers deserve protection because they have \nmultiple responsibilities--teaching, research, and patient care--which \ncause them to incur costs unique to such facilities. There are 400 \nteaching hospitals across the country. Teaching hospitals only account \nfor 5.5 percent of the nation's 5,000 hospitals but they house 40 \npercent of all neonatal intensive care units, 53 percent of pediatric \nintensive care units, and 70 percent of all burn units. Our nation's \nteaching hospitals are providing care to some of the nation's sickest \npatients.\n  Academic medical centers also provide care to a disproportionate \nshare of the uninsured and underinsured. They\n\n[[Page S15058]]\n\nprovide 44 percent of all care for the poor. The University of \nCalifornia's academic medical centers are the second largest safety net \nfor a state that has the fourth highest uninsured rate in the country.\n  Medicaid disproportionate share payments to hospitals that serve the \nimpoverished were also reduced five percent over five years as a result \nof the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Teaching hospitals receive two-\nthirds of all Medicaid disproportionate share payments, worth $4.5 \nbillion annually.\n  In California, graduate medical education (GME) funding helps support \n108 hospitals that train more than 6,700 residents over three-to-five \nyear periods. In 1997, the direct medical education funding in \nCalifornia totaled $95 million. Dr. Gerald Levey, the Medical Provost \nat the University of California Los Angeles wrote that:\n\n       In the 5\\1/2\\ years I have been in my position at UCLA, my \n     colleagues and I have implemented virtually every conceivable \n     cost-cutting measure to keep us financially strong in order \n     to compete in the brutal managed care market and maintain our \n     academic mission of research and teaching. Coming on the \n     heels of these measures, the Balanced Budget Act of 197 has \n     served to literally ``break the camel's back.''\n\nTeaching hospitals' ability to serve their communities, advance \nresearch, and train physicians will be compromised if we do not pass \nthis bill.\n\n\n                       adequately paying doctors\n\n  I also thank the Finance Committee and Administration for addressing \nthe issue of the ``sustainable growth rate'' factor in payments to \nphysicians under Medicare. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 changed how \nMedicare physician payment rates are updated every year, including \ncreating the new sustainable growth rate factor. In the first two years \nof using the sustainable growth rate, it appears that errors in its \ncalculations were made because projections were used to determine the \nrate rather than actual data. As a result of these errors, physicians \nare caring for one million more patients than Medicare anticipated, at \na cost of $3 billion according to the American Medical Association.\n  California's doctors have made a compelling case that errors in its \nestimates have caused unintended reductions in payments to physicians. \nThe bill would require HCFA to use actual data beginning in 2001 to \ncalculate payments instead of projections in order to stabilize \npayments to physicians who treat Medicare patients. While it does not \ngo far enough, it is a step in the right direction towards decreasing \nfluctuations in physician payments from year to year.\n\n\n                           retaining medicaid\n\n  Another provision included in this bill that is of great importance \nto California is removing the December 21, 1999 expiration date for the \n$500 million Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) Fund. The \nexpiration date for these funds must be repealed so that states like \nCalifornia can continue to use TANF funds to enroll low-income children \nand adults in Medicaid and CHIP. As part of the 1996 welfare reform, \nMedicaid was ``de-linked'' from cash assistance, and states were given \nincreased matching federal funds for administering a new Medicaid \nfamily coverage category.\n  Of the $500 million provided, as of July 1999, states have only spent \n10 percent. Unless federal law is changed very soon, 34 states, \nincluding California, will lose these funds by the end of this year \nbecause under the law, states have to spend the funds within the first \n12 calendar quarters that their TANF programs are in effect. Thus, \nDecember 31, 1999, California will lose access to the $78 million \nremaining of the $84 million allocated if we do not act. Fifteen other \nstates will lose access to their remaining funds in December as well. \nOn September 30, 1999, sixteen states lost access their funds due to \nthese time limits.\n  We cannot let these funds lapse in California because we need to \nenroll more working, low-income people in Medicaid and children in CHIP \nand ensure that more Californians have access to health services.\n  I thank the Committee and Administration for including this \nprovision.\n\n\n                      medicare managed care reform\n\n  I am pleased with the five-year moratorium placed on NCFA's use of \nhealth status risk adjuster for payments to managed care plans included \nin the bill. HCFA has been using hospitalizations as a measure of \nhealth, which is not only an incomplete measure of health but also \nunfairly penalizes states like California that historically have had a \nheavy penetration of managed care, lower hospital admissions rates and \nshorter hospital lengths of stay. The way Medicare pays managed care \nplans deserves a thorough review to determine if both the payment \nmethodology and the payment rats are appropriate. This moratorium could \ngive us time to conduct a review as well as give HCFA time to develop a \nbetter measure of health. Under this provision, $130 million over five \nyears will be restored so that managed care plans can pay providers \nmore adequately, according to preliminary estimates by the California \nHealth Care Association.\n\n\n              environment post-balanced budget act of 1997\n\n  Circumstances have changed since 1997 when we passed the Balanced \nBudget Act. We have eliminated the federal deficit. Because we have a \nrobust economy, lower inflation, higher GDO growth and lower \nunemployment, we also have lowered Medicare spending growth more than \nanticipated. This climate provides us an opportunity to revisit the \nreductions made by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and to strengthen \nthe stability of health care services, a system that in my state is on \nthe verge of unraveling.\n  We should not end this session without passing this bill. Without it, \nwe could have a more severe health care crisis on our hands, especially \nin my state. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today concludes a grueling debate on the \nstate of the dairy industry. Though the process was long and often \ntimes quite confusing, I think the Senate has come to an agreement on a \npackage that will prove to be beneficial to most interested parties at \nthis time.\n  Mr. President, I must say this process would not have been possible \nwithout the diligent work of one of my former staffers, Congressman \nChip Pickering. I have always said ``once a Lott staffer, always a Lott \nstaffer.'' Although Chip has moved on to represent the people of the \nthird district of Mississippi, he continues to constantly be of great \nhelp to me, and to always keep the best interest of the entire state of \nMississippi at heart.\n  Chip believes that Option 1A is absolutely essential for allowing \nmost dairies in Mississippi and outside the upper Midwest to remain in \nbusiness, and he worked with me to see that this legislation was put \ninto law. He organized House members from across the country to fight \nin order to see that the crucial dairy language we needed became law \nthis year.\n  Chip realizes Option 1A is the only way the interests of \nMississippi's dairy farmers can be protected. Having grown up working \non his family's dairy farm, meeting with dairy farmers across \nMississippi, and working with Mississippi Farm Bureau, Chip knows the \nimportance of this legislation to the survival of dairy farms and to \nthe continued fresh supply of milk for all Mississippians. I thank \nCongressman Pickering for his relentless efforts on behalf of \nMississippi dairy farmers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the conference report to accompany H.R. 3194.\n  The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to table was agreed to.\n\n\n           colloquy between senator warner and senator helms\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I rise to address a number of aspects of the State \nDepartment Authorization Act, which has been included in the final \nomnibus budget package of legislation. This bill contains a number of \nprovisions that, directly and indirectly, affect the jurisdiction of \nthe Armed Services Committee, and I am very concerned by the fact that \nthis major bill was included with virtually no consultation with our \ncommittee. I believe that the process works better when the normal \nlegislative procedures are followed.\n  I would like to raise a specific issue with the distinguished \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Section 1134 of the State \nDepartment Authorization Act prohibits Executive Branch agencies from \nwithholding information regarding nonproliferation matters, as set \nforth in section 602(c) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978, \nfrom the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House International \nRelations Committee, including information in special access programs.\n  I am aware that problems with the dissemination of nonproliferation \ninformation have arisen in the past. DOD has taken steps to correct \nthese problems and has established a policy that special access \nprograms will not include nonproliferation information, as defined in \nsection 602(c) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978. Based on \nmy review of DOD's special access programs, I believe that the \nDepartment of Defense does not now have special access programs which \ninclude such nonproliferation information. I have been assured that, in \nthe future, DOD will provide nonproliferation information to the \nappropriate committees of Congress.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank my colleague, the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee. I too have been assured by the Department that it will not \nuse special access program status to deny the Foreign Relations \nCommittee access to the nonproliferation information required by \nsection 602(c).\n  Mr. WARNER. I am concerned that some might interpret section 1134 of \nthe State Department Authorization Act as requiring expanded access to \nsensitive DOD intelligence sources and methods, as contrasted with \nnonproliferation information itself. I believe that section 1134 would \nnot require DOD to change its current procedures for protecting such \nsensitive sources and methods. Is this also the understanding of the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee?\n  Mr. HELMS. I believe that is correct. If the Department's assurances \nare accurate, then this provision would not modify DOD's current \npolicies regarding the protection of sensitive sources and methods. The \nForeign Relations Committee has no intention of seeking expanded access \nto such sources and methods, or to DOD special access programs, so long \nas DOD lives up to its reporting obligations under existing law. DOD's \npolicy of not handling nonproliferation information within special \naccess channels certainly provides a significant reassurance in that \nregard. Our concern is only to ensure that DOD policy regarding special \naccess programs or intelligence sources and methods not be seen as \nobviating its long-standing legal obligations to inform appropriate \ncommittees of Congress.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is the case now, and I am pleased that DOD has \nassured both of us that the prerogatives of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee will be protected. I thank my distinguished colleague, the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Mr. HELMS. I appreciate these assurances and thank my colleague, the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I am concerned with section 1134 which requires the DCI \nto provide certain information, including information contained in \nspecial access programs, to the chairman and ranking member of the \nForeign Relations Committees. I note that this language on special \naccess programs was added after the bill was passed by the Senate. I \nwish to clarify that the legislative intent of this provision does not \nwish to clarify that the legislative intent of this provision does not \ninclude expanded information relating to intelligence operational \nactivities or sensitive sources and methods.\n  I ask for the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee's \nclarification regarding the companion section in the State Department \nAuthorization bill, section 1131. Am I correct in understanding that \nthis provision does not levy the same requirement upon the Director of \nCentral Intelligence that is required of the Secretaries of Defense, \nState, and Commerce?\n  Mr. HELMS. That is correct, Mr. Chairman. Unlike the other \nSecretaries you have mentioned, the Director of Central Intelligence is \nrequired only to disclose information covered under subparagraph (B). \nThat information relates to significant proliferation activities of \nforeign nations. The Director is exempt from reporting information \nunder subparagraph (A) and (B) which relates to the agency's \noperational activities. The Foreign Relations Committee understands \nthat intelligence operations fall within the jurisdiction of the \nIntelligence Committee, and therefore did not include such activities \nin this reporting requirement.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Chairman for that explanation and yield the \nfloor. I look forward to fully reviewing those provisions in the \nIntelligence Committee next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15059-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.

Mr. President, first of all I applaud the White House--\nthis is probably the first time I have done that in 7 years--for \nresponding to an issue that is very critical, probably one of the most \ncritical issues we will be facing.\n  Going back in the history of recess appointments, the Constitution \nprovided for recess appointments to be allowed, thereby avoiding the \nconstitutional prerogative of the Senate of advice and consent in \ncertain conditions. The major condition was that a vacancy would occur \nduring the course of the recess. This goes back to the horse-and-buggy \ndays when we were in session for 2 or 3 months at a time and then we \nwere gone. So if someone such as the Secretary of State would die in \noffice, it would allow the President to replace that person without \nhaving to go through the advice and consent.\n  Throughout the years, both Democrat and Republican Presidents have\n\n[[Page S15060]]\n\nabused this. They have made recess appointments. In 1985, President \nReagan made quite a few of them. The majority at that time, the \nDemocrats, under the majority leadership of Senator Byrd from West \nVirginia, made the determination that he was making too many recess \nappointments.\n  He challenged the President to submit a letter that would outline \nfuture recess appointments during the Reagan administration. In 1985, a \nletter was sent from President Reagan to then-majority leader, Senator \nByrd from West Virginia that stated no more recess appointments would \ntake place unless the names of the individuals who were considered for \nrecess appointment were submitted in writing in sufficient time in \nadvance that the majority or minority leaders could take some type of \naction.\n  For example, if they were going to have someone recess appointed for \nthe express purpose of avoiding the advice and consent of the Senate, \nthen they would just not go into recess; they would go into pro forma, \nwhere they would have someone in the Chair all the time to make sure \nthat did not happen. Also, it would be an opportunity to make sure they \nwere not doing it for the express purpose of avoiding advice and \nconsent.\n  Last May, there was an appointment during the recess of James Hormel \nto be Ambassador to Luxembourg. There were several people who were \nopposed to his appointment and had holds on his appointment. The major \nreason was not that he was a gay activist, but he had not submitted the \nappropriate financial information to the appropriate committee for \nconsideration. The President went ahead and appointed him.\n  Consequently--that was already done, and there was no attempt to undo \nit even though it was contrary to the Constitution--I sent a letter to \nthe President asking him if he would agree to the same thing Ronald \nReagan agreed to back in 1985. Of course, I did not get a very \nfavorable response. However, I said: In the event I do not do that, I \nwill put a hold on every nondefense or nonmilitary appointment or \nnominee from the President. And I did so.\n  The weeks went by, and finally I got a letter from the President that \nsaid:\n\n       I share your opinion that the understanding reached in 1985 \n     between President Reagan and Senator Byrd cited in your \n     letter remains a fair and constructive framework which my \n     administration will follow.\n\n  I have been concerned because this President has a long history of \ndoing things he says he is not going to do and not doing things he says \nhe will do. Consequently, I sent a letter to the President which I \nsubmitted for the Record last Wednesday. The letter was dated November \n10, signed by myself and 16 other Senators, that said: Make sure you \ncomply with the spirit of this agreement, this letter you have sent; we \nare going to serve notice right now that in the event you have recess \nappointments that do not comply with the spirit of the letter, we will \nput holds for the remaining of the term of your Presidency on all of \nthe judicial nominees. A very serious thing. I repeated this several \ntimes last Wednesday to make sure there was no misunderstanding.\n  Since that time, the White House has cooperated and submitted a list \nof 13 names. I will read these names and the positions for which they \nhave been nominated: Cliff Stuart, EEOC; Delmond Won, Commissioner of \nthe Federal Maritime Commission; Leonard Page, general counsel for the \nLabor Relations Board; Luis Laurado, Development Bank; Mark Schneider, \nPeace Corps; Frank Holleman, Deputy Secretary of Education; Mike \nWalter, Veterans Administration; Mr. Jeffers, whose first name I do not \nhave, J-E-F-F-E-R-S; Bill Lann Lee, Assistant Attorney General for \nCivil Rights; Sally Katzen, Deputy Director of OMB; John Holum, Under \nSecretary for Arms Control and International Security of the Department \nof State; Carl Spielvogel, Ambassador to the Slovak Republic; and Jay \nJohnson--not to be confused with the military Jay Johnson--a nominee \nfor the U.S. Mint.\n\n  Of this list of 13, there are 5 who either have holds on them or \nthere are intended holds on these individuals. Consequently, I make the \nstatement at this time--and I think it is very important the Record \nreflect this accurately and everyone understands it thoroughly--that \nanyone other than the names I will read off--Cliff Stuart, Delmond Won, \nLeonard Page, Luis Laurado, Mark Schneider, Frank Holleman, Mike \nWalker, Mr. Jeffers--if there are any names that are submitted and are \nsought to be appointed during this recess, recess appointments, we, who \nundersigned the letter on the 10th of this month, will put a hold on \nevery judicial nominee who comes before the Senate during the entire \nremainder of the term of President Clinton.\n  I am going to repeat that because it is very important. Any name, \nother than these eight names I just read, who is recess appointed, if \nanyone other than these eight individuals is recess appointed, we will \nput a hold on every single judicial nominee of this President for the \nremainder of his term of office. That means specifically we will not \nagree to Bill Lann Lee, Sally Katzen, John Holum, Carl Spielvogel, and \nJay Johnson.\n  I will conclude with that. I reemphasize, if there is some other \ninterpretation as to the meaning of the letter, it does not make any \ndifference, we are still going to put the holds on them. I want to make \nsure there is a very clear understanding, if these nominees come in, if \nhe does violate the intent as we interpret it, then we will have holds \non these nominees.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, the Senate has been considering this \nbankruptcy bill as the main Senate business since November 4, 1999, \nafter a failed cloture\n\n[[Page S15061]]\n\nvote in September. There have been dozen of votes conducted with \nrespect to this issue, and yet there are still at least a dozen \namendments pending to be offered, debated, and voted upon. It is with \nthis in mind that I need to file this cloture motion on the bill in \norder to ensure we get a final vote, and that will be available when we \ncome back after the first of the year.\n  A lot of good work has been done on this bill on both sides, by the \nmanagers of the legislation and a number of Senators who have worked on \nit--Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, Senator Sessions, on our side; \nSenator Torricelli, on the other side, has been involved; Senator Leahy \nhas worked on this. So there is a lot of work that has been done and a \nlot of relevant amendments that have been voted on.\n  I want to particularly note the good work of Senator Reid because he \nbegan with, I don't know, probably over 100 amendments.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Three hundred.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Three hundred.\n  Mr. LOTT. Three hundred amendments. I do not understand how the \nfertile minds of the Senate can be so productive to produce 300 \namendments on a bill such as this that has been already marked up in \ncommittee. Then we got it down to 36, and it continued to be narrowed.\n  I hope when we come back after the first of the year something can be \nworked out where it will not be necessary to go forward with this. But \nI do believe there is a necessity to have this protection so that we \nwill have this option of cloture so we can complete the bill, if there \nis no other way to do it when we come back after the first of the year.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT. So I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Calendar No. \n     109, S. 625, an act to amend title 11 of the United States \n     Code, and for other purposes:\n         Trent Lott, Chuck Grassley, Paul Coverdell, Mike Crapo, \n           Craig Thomas, Larry E. Craig, Orrin Hatch, Don Nickles, \n           Conrad Burns, Rod Grams, Mitch McConnell, Pat Roberts, \n           Fred Thompson, Slade Gorton, Phil Gramm, and Mike \n           DeWine.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Under rule XXII, this cloture vote will occur on Tuesday, \nJanuary 25, 2000. I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur at 12 \nnoon on Tuesday and the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, and I certainly will not \nobject, let me say the majority leader and I talked about this. I am \nappreciative of his position. I am disappointed he has filed cloture. I \nhope it isn't received in the wrong way by all of those who worked so \nhard to get to this point.\n  I had told my colleagues that if they continue to work and if they \ncontinue to cooperate, if they continue to allow time agreements, that \nwe would not be in a position where we would have to file cloture and \nwe would get to the final passage. That was my commitment. Senator Lott \ndid not make that. I made it to my colleagues. In this case, I am going \nto have to explain to my colleagues why what I said is not what we are \ngoing to do.\n  We are down now to a handful of amendments, with time agreements. So \nI am as convinced today as I was a couple of days ago, as I was before \nthat, that cloture certainly isn't necessary. I am hopeful, with those \ntight time agreements, and with the opportunity to dispose of the \namendments, we can come to final passage. But I will certainly work \nwith the majority leader to see if we might find a way to make that \nhappen.\n  I hope he will work with us to assure those who have relevant \namendments will have an opportunity to have their votes and we can \nfinish.\n  I do not object to the request.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, just \nso we know the numbers, we had 320 amendments and are now down to 14. I \ncompliment Senators on both sides of the aisle. Senator Reid deserves \nenormous credit. Senator Grassley, Senator Torricelli, Senator Hatch, \nand I worked very hard on that. We are working very hard again on both \nsides of the aisle. I think most Senators want a bankruptcy bill. We \nknow there has to be a change.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed that the majority filed cloture on \nthe Bankruptcy Reform Act.\n  This week we made bipartisan progress on the Bankruptcy Reform Act by \ndisposing of amendments. On Wednesday, we were able to clear 9 more \namendments and accepted another one by a roll call vote for a total of \n10 amendments that were accepted to improve this bill.\n  During our debate on the bill, the managers have accepted 37 \namendments to improve the Bankruptcy Reform Act, amendments offered by \nDemocrats and Republicans.\n  Senator Torricelli, Senator Reid and I worked in good faith with \nSenator Grassley and Senator Hatch to clear amendments and set roll \ncall votes on amendments that we could not clear.\n  From a total of 320 amendments that were filed by senators on both \nsides of the aisle on November 5th, Senator Torricelli and I, working \nwith the Assistant Democratic Leader, have narrowed down the remaining \nDemocratic amendments on this bill to a mere handful.\n  We are ready to debate and vote on these Democratic amendments. The \nremaining amendments from our list are all relevant to the issues of \nbankruptcy under our unanimous consent agreement.\n  It appears the majority is refusing to allow the Senate to consider \ntwo amendments. One by Senator Levin on firearm-related debts in \nbankruptcy and one by Senator Schumer on debts incurred through the \ncommission of violence at health service clinics.\n  Both of these amendments are relevant to the issue of bankruptcy.\n  Senator Levin is willing to limit the time on his amendment to 70 \nminutes and Senator Schumer is willing to limit the time on his \namendment to only 30 minutes. These are very reasonable time agreement \noffers.\n  I am a cosponsor of Senator Schumer's amendment, but I am not sure if \nI will support Senator Levin's amendment. But I am sure that both these \nSenators deserve to debate and vote on their relevant amendments. What \nis the majority afraid of? Vote on the amendments up or down?\n  Some of the other remaining amendments focus on adding credit \nindustry reforms to the bill. The millions of credit card solicitations \nmade to American consumers the past few years have caused, in part, the \nrise in consumer bankruptcy filings. The credit card industry should \nbear some of this responsibility and reform its lax lending practices. \nThese amendments improve the Truth In Lending Act to provide for better \ndisclosure of credit information so consumers may better manage their \ndebts and avoid bankruptcy altogether.\n  Last year's Senate bankruptcy reform bill was fair and balanced \nbecause it included credit industry reforms. We should remember that \nlast year's fair and balanced bill passed this chamber by a vote of 97-\n1.\n  We should strive to follow last year's Senate-passed bill as the \nmodel during the remainder of debate on this bill.\n  Democrats are also ready to offer short time agreements on our \nremaining amendments if we cannot agree with the majority on them. Many \nDemocratic senators are willing to offer time agreements of a half hour \nor an hour on their amendments.\n  Democrats are prepared to debate this bill and vote on amendments. \nThis is how the Senate works and how it should work.\n  I commend Senators for coming to the floor last week and this week to \noffer their amendments. Despite hours of debate on four non-germane, \nnonrelevant amendments and party caucuses and extended morning business \nhours last week and this week, Senators from both sides of the aisle \noffered 64 amendments to improve the Bankruptcy Reform Act.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate did not consider the Bankruptcy Reform Act \nyesterday or today. I do not understand why the majority is refusing to \nallow the Senate to debate this bill.\n  Next year, I hope we can have a full and fair debate on the few \nremaining\n\n[[Page S15062]]\n\namendments to the Bankruptcy Reform Act and then proceed to a vote on \nfinal passage.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, enough is enough. Hard-working American \npeople are being denied common-sense legislation that they \noverwhelmingly support, because some on the Democratic side are \ninsisting on votes relating to the politically charged issues of \nabortions and guns. At some point, I would hope that this will stop, \nand we can move ahead with the people's agenda, instead of trying to \nwin political points.\n  We have been on the bankruptcy bill for two weeks now. The Democrats \ndemanded the ability to have votes on other politically motivated, non-\nrelevant issues. We debated and had a vote on minimum wage. We have \nagreed to or voted on 31 Democrat amendments. These are amendments in \naddition to the Grassley-Torricelli package amendment which included \nnumerous other provisions insisted upon by the Democrats.\n  This is a fair, bipartisan bill, drafted jointly by Senators \nGrassley, Torricelli, Biden and Sessions. This legislation was \ndeveloped in a fair and inclusive manner. With the more than 31 \namendments, plus additional amendments jointly developed by Republicans \nand Democrats, such as the Grassley-Torricelli healthcare amendment, \nthe Hatch-Torricelli domestic and child support amendment, the Hatch-\nDodd amendment on protecting educational savings accounts, among many \nothers, this is a much improved bill that provides unprecedented \nconsumer protections, while preserving the bankruptcy system for those \nwho truly need it. What also is included in this bill are unprecedented \nconsumer disclosures that are not even bankruptcy related, but are \nbanking law amendments which Senators Torricelli and Grassley have \ntaken the leadership to develop, and I commend them for that.\n  Mr. President, throughout the process of consideration of this bill, \nat both the drafting stage, at the Committee level, and here on the \nfloor, we have worked hard to address any concerns any member has with \nthe bill. Senators Grassley, Lott and I have been more than patient and \ncooperative. It is apparent, however, that efforts were underway to \ndefeat this important legislation this year by insisting on extraneous \npolitical agenda items, regardless of all the progress we made.\n  We are open to further debate. But this bill, which the Minority had \nsaid would only take two days to complete, was on the floor for two \nweeks. They did not agree to a time limit for debate, but it is now \nclear why that was.\n  I hope we can get the cooperation of the Minority to drop their \nremaining politically-motivated items and pass legislation early next \nyear that provides meaningful and much-needed reform to the bankruptcy \nsystem. Rampant bankruptcy filings are a big problem, and last year \nover 1.4 million Americans filed for bankruptcy. In the same year, \nabout $45 billion in consumer debt was erased in personal bankruptcies. \nUnder current law, families who do not file for bankruptcy are unfairly \nhaving to subsidize those who do. This is our opportunity to do \nsomething about it. I would hope that my colleagues would take the time \nover these next few months and consider the desires of the American \npublic. Let's do what is right and pass this important legislation \nearly next year. Thank you.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me observe one of the problems we had in \nnot being able to complete it even this week. While the sponsors of \nsome of the amendments had indicated--or maybe all the amendments--\nindicated a willingness to have limited time agreements, we had, I \nknow, at least a couple of Senators on this side who were not willing \nto agree to limit the time, therefore possibly tying up half a day or a \nday one a couple of these amendments.\n  We may still be able to work out something where we could have a \nshort time agreed to on both sides and get a vote after the first of \nthe year. But you reach a point, in the final days of a session, where \nmotions are such that you just cannot get that kind of agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15062-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

We have a number \nof bills that are in a position where we could get early agreement out \nof conference, including the trade bill on which we worked so hard. We \nspent 2 weeks getting that out for Africa and CBI.

DuBester, of New Jersey, to be a Member of the \n     National Mediation Board for a term expiring July 1, 2002.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today is a uniquely historic day. One \nhundred and thirty six years ago, Abraham Lincoln gave the Gettysburg \nAddress. 80 years ago today, the United States Senate rejected the ill-\nconceived League of Nations. And 30 years ago, the second manned Apollo \ncapsule landed on the moon and two more Americans walked on the surface \nof the moon.\n  But for the family of Deanna Tanner Okun, this is a singular day. For \nthe United States Senate has just confirmed her Presidential nomination \nto be a Commissioner on the International Trade Commission. (ITC). I \nwould note that it has taken Deanna barely nine days to go from \nnomination to confirmation. That could be close to a Senate record.\n  One of the reasons that Deanna's nomination has sped through so \nquickly is because the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Bill \nRoth, and the Ranking Member, Pat Moynihan were willing to put in the \nwork to hold a confirmation hearing barely six days after Deanna was \nnominated. I greatly appreciate their work in expediting that hearing.\n  But most importantly, I believe the primary reason Deanna's \nconfirmation has gone so smoothly is because of the universal \nadmiration and respect that Senators and professional staff hold for \nher. Deanna is simply a consummate professional and I know that the \nSenate's loss will be offset by the tremendous gain that is being \nachieved today by the ITC. today. I know the Commission will never be \nthe same once Deanna is sworn in.\n  Mr. President, I have been privileged to have worked with Deanna for \nmore than five years. I cannot imagine anyone who is more qualified to \nbecome a Commissioner on the International Trade Commission. Not only \nis Deanna remarkably bright, she is one of the most thorough and \nconscientious individuals I have ever met.\n  She is fully versed in all aspects of international trade matters and \nan expert on U.S. foreign policy issues. No one can doubt her \nintellectual and professional capacity to serve as a Commissioner.\n  Mr. President, I want to repeat some of my prepared remarks for \nDeanna's confirmation hearing.\n  But I want to tell the United States Senate a little about Deanna, \nthe person. she is a remarkably affable and charming individual who, no \nmatter what the pressures--whether negotiating in a markup of a trade \nbill or working under the time constraints of a hearing on spying at \nU.S. weapons laboratories--Deanna never loses her professionalism. She \nalways gets the job done.\n  In the years that she has worked on my staff, she has had to deal \nwith some of the most difficult and tough Senate staffers in the \nleadership and on many committees. I know that every single one of \nthose staff people have universal respect and admiration for the work \nDeanna does and the charm she brings to the job. That is a singular \nfeat that few other Senate staffers can claim.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would note that three years ago, Deanna \nchanged her work schedule from five days a week to four days a week. \nShe did this because she wanted to spend more time raising her two \nbeautiful daughters, Kelsi and Rachel. I can unhesitatingly tell you \nthat in those four days at work, she produces what other staffers could \nmaybe produce in five, more likely six days. She is truly remarkable as \na mother and as a professional staffer.\n  She is a stellar person and I know that her husband Bob and her \nparents take great pride in her confirmation.\n  It is difficult to lose Deanna after all these years. I will miss \nher, but I know that the world trade community will greatly benefit \nfrom her appointment to the Commission.\n  Thank you, Mr. President and to Deanna, I wish you the best of \nsuccess in your new position.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I did not want to speak until that was done. I thank the \ndistinguished majority leader and the distinguished Democratic leader. \nBoth of them are dear friends of mine with whom I have served for many, \nmany years.\n  I thank them for their consideration, especially of Calendar No. 292. \nThat is not simply a number on the calendar. It represents a very real \nperson. Richard Linn is an extraordinary man, extraordinary husband, \nextraordinary father, and wonderful bother. He will do a great job and \nbe an outstanding judge. I thank both leaders for their help and their \nconsideration.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to report on the success that \nthe Senate has enjoyed this session in performing its constitutional \nadvice and consent duties with respect to judicial nominees. The \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate have maintained a low vacancy rate \nin the federal Judiciary, reached an agreement to have votes on certain \ncontroversial nominees, and maintained a fair and principled \nconfirmations process.\n  At the end of the last Congress, the Judiciary Committee and the \nSenate had reduced the number of vacancies in the federal Judiciary to \n50--the lowest vacancy level since the expansion of the Judiciary in \n1990. Indeed, in his January 1999 report on the state of the federal \nJudiciary, Chief Justice Rehnquist applauded the work of the Senate in \nbringing the vacancy number to such a low level, stating: ``I am \npleased to report on the progress made in 1998 by the Senate and the \nPresident in the appointment and confirmation of judges to the federal \nbench. . . .''\n  This session, despite partisan rhetoric, the Senate has maintained a \nlow vacancy rate. The Judiciary Committee reported 42 judicial \nnominees, and the full Senate confirmed 34 of these--a number \ncomparable to the average of 39 confirmations for the first sessions of \nthe past 5 Congresses when vacancy rates were generally much higher. In \ntotal, the Senate has confirmed 338 of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees since he took office in 1993.\n  In addition, the Committee reported 22 Executive Branch nominees to \nthe Senate floor this Session. The Senate has confirmed all of these \nnominees,\n\n[[Page S15064]]\n\nbringing the total number of confirmations for President Clinton's non-\njudicial nominees for which the Committee has jurisdiction to 277 since \n1993.\n  After all of these confirmations, we have reduced the number of \njudicial vacancies to 56--very close to the lowest number of vacancies \nsince the expansion of the Judiciary in 1990. Indeed, the number of \nvacancies at the end of this Session of Congress is 7 less than the 63 \nvacancies that existed when Congress adjourned in 1994 when Bill \nClinton was President and the Democrats controlled the Judiciary \nCommittee. Moreover, we were able to create 9 new district court \njudgeships for a few districts in which the caseloads are very high.\n  In addition, the Committee reported two controversial nominees--\nMarsha Berzon and Richard Paez--to the Senate floor this Session. And \nSenator Lott worked in a bipartisan manner with Senator Daschle to \nreach an agreement to vote on these controversial nominees and other \nnominees by March 15, 2000.\n  A controversial nominee will, of course, move more slowly than other \nnominees because it takes longer to garner a consensus to support such \na nominee. And, depending on the nature of the controversy, the \nCommittee may have to conduct an even more exacting examination of that \nnominee's credentials and respect for the rule of law. Nonetheless, a \ncontroversial nominee will be treated with the utmost respect and \nfairness The more controversial a nominee, however, the more crucial \nthe support of the nominee's home state senators and home state grass \nroots organizations.\n  It was deeply disturbing that earlier this year some implied or \nexpressly alleged that the Senate's treatment of certain nominees \ndiffered based on their race or gender. Indeed, a so-called independent \ngroup claimed that the Senate treated female and minorities nominees \nless favorably than white male nominees.\n  After a flurry of rhetoric, however, the facts began to surface. \nFirst, the so-called independent group--Citizens for Independent \nCourts--was discovered to have prepared its report with the assistance \nof the Democratic, but not Republican, Judiciary Committee staff. \nSecond, a close review of the report revealed that for noncontroversial \nnominees who were confirmed, there was little if any difference between \nthe timing of confirmation for minority nominees and nonminority \nnominees in 1997 and 1998. Only when the President appointed a \ncontroversial female or minority nominee who was not confirmed did a \ndisparity arise. Third, in 1991 and 1992, when George Bush was \nPresident, the Democratically controlled Senate confirmed female and \nminority nominees at a far slower pace than white male nominees. \nFourth, this year, over 50% of the nominees that the Judiciary \nCommittee reported to the full Senate have been women and minorities. \nFinally, even the Democratic former chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Joe Biden, stated publicly that the process by which \nthe committee, under my chairmanship, examines and approve judicial \nnominees ``has not a single thing to do with gender or race.''\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I take the constitutional \nduties of advice and consent and the responsibility for maintaining the \ninstitutional dignity of the Senate very seriously. Although the \nPresident has occasionally nominated controversial candidates, under my \ntenure as chairman, not one nominee has suffered a public attack on \nhis, or her, character by this committee. Not one nominee has had his, \nor her, confidential background information leaked to the public by a \nmember of this committee. And not one nominee has been examined for \nanything other than his, or her, integrity, competence, temperament, \nand respect for the rule of law.\n  The Senate has conducted the confirmations process in a fair and \nprincipled manner, and the process has worked well. As the first \nsession of the 106th Congress comes to an end, the federal Judiciary is \nonce again sufficiently staffed to perform its function under Article \nIII of the Constitution. Senator Lott, and the Senate as a whole, are \nto be commended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15064-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, shared appreciation agreements have the \npotential to cause hundreds of farm foreclosures across the nation, and \nespecially in my home state of Montana. Ten years ago, a large number \nof farmers signed these agreements. At that time they were under the \nimpression that they would be required to pay these back at the end of \nten years, at a reasonable rate of redemption.\n  However, that has not proved to be the case. The appraisals being \nconducted by the Farm Service Agency are showing increased values of \nridiculous proportions. By all standards, one would expect the value to \nhave decreased. Farm prices are the lowest they have been in years, and \nthere does not seem to be a quick recovery forthcoming. Farmers cannot \npossibly be expected to pay back a value twice the amount they \noriginally wrote down. Especially in light of the current market \nsituation, I believe something must be done about the way these \nappraisals are conducted.\n  USDA is attempting to fix the problem with proposed rules and \nregulations but farmers need help with these agreements now. The USDA \nhas published several regulations addressing the issue but the comment \nperiod will further drag out the process. I am fearful that in the \nmeantime more farmers will be forced into foreclosure.\n  My bill mandates by legislation these important regulations. It will \nexclude capital investments from the increase in appreciation and allow \nfarmers to take out a loan at the ``Homestead Rate,'' which is the \ngovernment's cost of borrowing.\n  Farmers should not be penalized for attempting to better their \noperations. Nor can they be expected to delay capital improvements so \nthat they will not be penalized. It will be necessary for most of these \nagricultural producers to take out an additional loan during these hard \ntimes. It is important that the interest rate on that loan will \naccommodate their needs. The governments current cost of borrowing \nequals about 6.25 percent, far less than the original 9 percent farmers \nand ranches were paying.\n  I look forward to working with members in other states to alleviate \nthe financial burdens imposed by shared appreciation agreements. I hope \nthat we may move this through the legislative process quickly to \nprovide help as soon as possible to our farmers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15064-5", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15064-S15065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY RESEARCH LABORATORIES ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, biomedical research is making great \nstrides in providing new treatments for a wide range of diseases. \nThousands of talented scientists across the country are making new \ndiscoveries about the fundamental mechanisms of health and disease. Yet \nthe talents of these researchers are often undermined by a lack of \nadequate facilities and equipment to conduct their crucial work.\n  Numerous authoritative studies have demonstrated that medical \nresearch laboratories are critically in need of reconstruction and \nrepair. The National Science Foundation found that\n\n[[Page S15065]]\n\nover half the institutions conducting biomedical research in this \ncountry suffer from inadequate space for medical research. The \nFoundation also reported that medical research institutions have had to \npostpone nearly $11 billion in renovation and construction projects due \nto lack of adequate funding. As a result, over a quarter of medical \nresearch facilities in the nation are in urgent need of renovation or \nreconstruction.\n  The need to revitalize the infrastructure of our research enterprise \nis recognized throughout the medical community. The Association of \nAmerican Medical Colleges and the Federation of Societies for \nExperimental Biology have both issued statements calling on the federal \ngovernment to provide increased resources for reconstruction and \nrenovation of medical research facilities.\n  The bill before the Senate today significantly increases our \ncommitment by authorizing a substantial increase in the funds available \nto the National Institute of Health to provide peer-reviewed grants for \nlaboratory construction and renovation.\n  Not only have medical research facilities fallen into disrepair, but \nlaboratories frequently lack needed research equipment. Modern medical \ninstruments are increasingly sophisticated. Scientists are gaining new \ninsights into such basic processes as the workings of the brain and the \ngenetic basis of disease. With this increase in sophistication has come \nan increase in cost. The rising price of medical technology means that \nscientists must often curtail research programs, because they lack \naccess to sensitive instruments such as MRI scanners or high resolution \nmicroscopes.\n  To address the acute need for sophisticated scientific instruments, \nthe bill before us also provides needed funds for medical researchers \nto purchase major pieces of scientific equipment. Only by giving \nmedical researchers the equipment they need to use their talents fully \ncan we achieve the scientific breakthroughs necessary to meet our most \npressing health needs.\n  We should not enter the twenty-first century with medical \nlaboratories that lack adequate space, adequate facilities and adequate \nequipment. We must provide the funding that is urgently needed to \nconstruct modern laboratories and give researchers the equipment \nnecessary for their cutting-edge research. I urge my colleagues to join \nwith me in supporting this legislation that is so vital to the health \ncare needs of our nation and I commend my distinguished colleague from \nIowa, Senator Harkin, for his leadership on this and many other \ncritical health care issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15065-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CLINICAL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, biomedical research continues to produce \ngreat advances in our ability to combat deadly diseases, and its \npromise for the future is vast. For that promise to be fully realized \nin improvements in people's health, we need a stronger commitment to \nbring medical discoveries from the laboratory to the bedside. Increased \nsupport for clinical research is vital for developing cures and better \ntreatments for disease. Clinical research brings insight into the most \neffective ways to care for patients. It offers effective ways to reduce \nboth the human and financial costs of disease.\n  Despite these clear benefits, clinical research faces a worsening \ncrisis. The Institute of Medicine, the National Academy of Sciences and \nthe National Institutes of Health have all concluded that the nation's \nability to conduct clinical research has declined significantly in \nrecent years. Passing the bill currently before the Senate will reverse \nthis dangerous decline, by addressing the major factors that have led \nto the weakening of our nation's ability to conduct clinical research.\n  One of these factors is the steep financial barrier than health care \nprofessionals encounter when considering a career in clinical research. \nBurdened with debt from their professional training, clinicians must \noften forego a research career in order to earn the money necessary to \npay back their loans. Our bill will lower the economic barriers to \ncareers in clinical research by providing financial incentives for \ndoctors to conduct patient-research. The bill authorizes the National \nInstitutes of Health to establish a loan repayment program to lessen \nthe debt they must carry if they pursue careers in clinical research. \nThe bill also provides for peer-reviewed grants to support clinical \nresearchers at all stages of their careers.\n  While the current state of clinical research is cause for great \nconcern, the future of this vital health care field is even more \nworrying. Many of today's young clinical investigators have inadequate \ntraining in the methods of clinical research. Dr. Harold Varmus, \nDirector of the National Institutes of Health, has emphasized the need \nfor clinicians to have access to specialized training in patient-\noriented research. This bill will provide grant support for young \nmedical professionals to receive graduate training in such research.\n  To meet the nation's need for clinical research, it is not enough to \nincrease the number of doctors conducting such research. Clinical \nresearchers must also have the facilities necessary to conduct their \nlifesaving work. In these days when hospitals are squeezed more and \nmore tightly by financial pressures, there is little room for them to \ndevote scarce resources to clinical research. To address this problem, \nthe bill provides grants to General Clinical Research Centers, now \nestablished in 27 states, where health professionals can have access to \nthe vital hospital resources necessary to conduct high quality patient-\noriented research.\n  This measure is supported by more than 70 biomedical associations. I \ncommend the Chairman of our Health Committee, Senator Jeffords, for his \neffective leadership on this legislation. It is vital to the quality of \nhealth care in the nation in years ahead, and I urge the Senate to \napprove it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15065-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DEBT RELIEF LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to note that Congress is taking \nthe first important step toward providing debt relief for the Heavily \nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. As co-sponsor, with Senator \nMack, of legislation to authorize U.S. participation in this critically \nimportant international initiative, I believe that easing the debt \nburden of the world's poorest countries is one of the most meaningful \nthings we can do to help these nations eradicate poverty and grow their \neconomies on a sustainable basis.\n  The final version of the Foreign Operations appropriations bill \ncontained enough money and authorizations to permit the HIPC Initiative \nto go forward, but there is more we have to do in Congress, beginning \nearly next year, to provide the resources necessary to address the debt \nburden of the countries that are expected to qualify. As ranking member \non the authorizing subcommittee in Foreign Relations, I intend to work \nhard to achieve the necessary additional authorizations there, \nincluding the very important one for U.S. contributions to the HIPC \nTrust Fund. I would like today to engage Senator Gramm in a colloquy on \nthe commitment I understand he made to the Administration to act on the \nnecessary remaining IMF authorization in the Banking Committee as well.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator. As you know, we agreed on language \nthat would permit the U.S. to support mobilization of the amount of IMF \ngold necessary to provide a stream of interest earnings sufficient for \nIMF participation in the HIPC initiative. However, we agreed that only \n\\9/14\\ of the interest earnings could be used for HIPC debt relief, \nuntil such time as Congress authorized the U.S. to vote in favor of \nusing the remaining \\5/14\\ of the earnings as well. I committed to the \nAdministration that the Banking Committee would act on this remaining \nIMF authorization no later than May 1, 2000. It is my hope, of course, \nthat the Foreign Relations Committee could act with similar dispatch.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Thank you, Senator. I will certainly do everything I \ncan to help you meet your May 1 deadline--in fact, I hope and believe \nwe should be able to act sooner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15065-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15065-S15066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FINANCIAL SERVICES MODERNIZATION ACT\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, a week ago today, President Clinton \nsigned S. 900, The Financial Services\n\n[[Page S15066]]\n\nModernization Act. Beyond the obvious positive implications that this \nlegislation has for the bankers of my state of Arkansas, there is a \nprovision in the bill that I rise to speak of today that has been a \nlong time in coming and will finally bring fairness to Arkansas' \nbanking market.\n  Section 731 of the Financial Services Modernization Act is titled \n``Interest Rates and Other Charges at Interstate Branches.'' This \nsection was not included in the original version of S. 900 that passed \nthis body, but with the support of the entire Arkansas congressional \ndelegation it was added to the House version, and retained in the \nconference committee. Because of the importance of this provision to my \nstate, because of the role that both Arkansas Senators played in \nprotecting this provision in the conference committee, and because \nthere was no debate on the provision in the Senate, I will speak \nbriefly on the history that led to this new law, and the reason it was \nso vitally needed.\n  With the passage of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching \nAct several years ago, the question arose as to which state law \nconcerning interest rates on loans would apply to branches of \ninterstate banks operating in a ``host state.'' Would those branches be \ngoverned by the interest rate ceiling of the charter location or that \nof their physical location? The Office of the Comptroller of the \nCurrency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation addressed this \nissue with opinions that basically gave branches of interstate banks \nthe option of being governed by either their home or host state \nrequirements concerning interest rates by structuring the loan process \nto meet certain requirements.\n  In Arkansas this had a profound effect upon the local banking \ncommunity. Under Article 19, Section 13 of the Arkansas Constitution, \nthe state places the maximum rate that can be charged for many classes \nof loans at 5% above the Federal Reserve Discount Rate. However, over \n40% of the banking locations in Arkansas are non-Arkansas based \ninterstate banks, and were, in effect, not governed by this \nconstitutional provision after Riegle-Neal became the law of the land. \nThe out of state banks were able to price freely, while Arkansas banks \nwere bound by the usury restrictions in the Arkansas Constitution. This \nplaced Arkansas banks at a significant competitive disadvantage.\n  In light of this clear inequity, and because, if left uncorrected, my \nstate could have lost virtually all of its local community banks, the \nArkansas delegation wholly supported the language of Section 731 that \nprovides our local banks with loan pricing parity in all regards with \nnon-Arkansas interstate banks operating branches in Arkansas. Remedying \nthis disparity was our intent, Mr. President, and I am pleased that my \ncolleagues supported its inclusion in the Financial Services \nModernization Act.\n  The local banks in Arkansas play such an important role in the small \nand rural communities they serve. Not only do they provide the capital \nthat fuels the local economy, but they are always out front in charity \nand community service. You always see their names in the back of the \nfootball program, or leading the drive to buy the new band uniforms. \nThe local bankers in my state are much more than business men and \nwomen, they are neighbors and friends, and dedicated to their homes.\n  In short, Mr. President, Congress put Arkansas banks at a severe \ncompetitive disadvantage with the passage of the Riegle-Neal Interstate \nBanking and Branching Act. The entire Arkansas delegation, therefore, \nconsidered it appropriate, if not our duty, to work to rectify this \ninequity here in Congress where it was created. I am glad we were \nsuccessful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15066-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15066-S15067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RICHARD ALLEN LAUDS THE LATE BUD NANCE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have at hand the printed text of the \nbeautiful remarks by Richard Allen, National Security Advisor to Ronald \nReagan during those eventful years of the Reagan presidency. Mr. Allen \nspoke last evening, November 18, in Greensboro, N.C.\n  Mr. Allen's ``Tribute to Bud Nance'' was an assessment of the \nremarkable career of Admiral James W. Nance, a distinguished retired \nNavy officer. All of us knew and admired Bud Nance, who was a beloved \nand admired chief of staff of the Senate Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Richard Allen's address \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the address was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Tribute to Bud Nance\n\n       Just last Friday I flew from Tokyo to Munich, Germany where \n     I met up with President George Bush, who received an \n     important honor in connection with the celebration of the \n     Fall of the Berlin Wall. In his acceptance speech, he said \n     something that struck me as both important and generous: he \n     remarked, ``I am here tonight to accept this award not \n     because of what I did, but because I am standing on the \n     shoulders of giants who made this possible, and in the first \n     instance I refer to my great predecessor in office, Ronald \n     Reagan.''\n       It was an emotional moment for me, for twenty-one years ago \n     this very month my wife, Pat, who is here with me tonight, \n     and I accompanied Ronald Reagan on his very first trip to \n     Germany. We went to Berlin, and stood in front of the \n     monstrous Wall. Reflecting on what it signified, he tensed, \n     turned to Peter Hannaford and to me and said: ``We've got to \n     find a way to knock this thing down.'' Nine years later, as \n     President, he again stood in front of the Wall, and demanded \n     that Mr. Gorbachev come to Berlin to ``tear down this Wall.''\n       Ronald Reagan was one of the giants to whom George Bush \n     referred, but my thoughts turned to this Thursday evening \n     event, and the reflection that one more giant who made all \n     this possible, and upon whose sturdy shoulders Ronald Reagan \n     leaned for years, is my friend of many years, Senator Jesse \n     Helms.\n       So, this evening I have the special honor to pay tribute to \n     two friends with whom I have worked for many years. Both have \n     a special place of honor in my memory and in my heart, and \n     both have given me the great gifts of constant friendship and \n     unfailing loyalty.\n       You must recognize, ladies and gentlemen, that in the world \n     of politics, policy and public affairs, the essential human \n     qualities undergird all relationships. Trust and the ability \n     to rely on another's word are among the most valuable \n     qualities in any life, and nowhere are they better reflected \n     in the lives of Senator Jesse Helms and Admiral James W. \n     Nance.\n       For nearly forty years I have lived in and around \n     Washington and have been an eager student of foreign affairs. \n     I began my first active years as an academic, then worked in \n     the 1968 election as Richard Nixon's foreign policy \n     coordinator, later serving twice with him in national \n     security and international economic affairs in the White \n     House.\n       In the mid-1970s I had the opportunity to meet the freshman \n     Senator from North Carolina, and in 1976 the first real \n     opportunity to work closely with him. In that year, his \n     principled determination made possible a close race between \n     Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. Neither side would allow the \n     other to write the foreign policy platform, and so I was \n     asked to take on that task. It was a special opportunity, and \n     I quickly accepted. Determined to write a platform that \n     reflected real American principles, I finished my draft and \n     flew to Kansas City. There, Senator Helms was shaping the \n     work of the Platform Committee, and the issue of Taiwan was \n     of great importance. With the delegates, Senator Helms and I \n     were able to collaborate in shaping a fair, realistic and \n     helpful plank to support Taiwan against its constant threat, \n     Mainland China. The important point in all this was that \n     every time Jesse Helms gave his word, he delivered, never \n     trimming, never flinching, always sticking to fundamental \n     principles--no matter how strong the opposition.\n       Ever since, he has exemplified the crusade for what is \n     right. Fred Barnes said it best in 1997, when he wrote, \n     ``Next to Ronald Reagan, Jesse Helms is the most important \n     conservative of the last 25 years. No conservative, save \n     Reagan, comes close to matching Helm's influence on American \n     politics and policy--he has led on everything--he has made \n     history. He's an event-making politician, not merely one \n     who's served in eventful times.''\n       So, ladies and gentlemen, this is why I am especially \n     honored to be here to participate in a tribute to a great \n     Senator, a true leader, a man who always keeps his word.\n       The Jesse Helms Center Foundation at Wingate University has \n     a distinguished board of Directors, one of whom is Mrs. \n     Dorothy Helms (Roger Milliken, that champion of good causes). \n     But another of those distinguished persons is not with us \n     this evening, and it is about him--a very special person--\n     that I am honored to speak some heartfelt words.\n       I refer, of course, to Admiral James W. Nance, and \n     extraordinary patriot who was laid to rest on May 19th at \n     Arlington National Cemetery. He was perhaps the Senators' \n     closest confidant after Mrs. Helms, and was a man with whom I \n     was privileged to have a close relationship for nearly two \n     decades.\n       It's just not possible to capture either the depth of \n     sorrow that reigned over Washington when Bud Nance departed \n     this earth,\n\n[[Page S15067]]\n\n     nor is it possible to capture in words the grandeur and \n     beauty of the successive honors and tributes so justly \n     showered upon him as we celebrated his extraordinary career, \n     his lifetime with his loving  family and with us.\n       Bud Nance and Jesse Helms, two distinct persons, friends \n     since they were little boys and friends for life, men who \n     knew and understood each other as stalwart loyalists to God, \n     Family and Country, and who fought side by side for freedom, \n     democracy and just causes. To evoke the name of one is to \n     remind us of the other, and this had a special meaning for \n     me.\n       I had worked for four years with Ronald Reagan in his \n     approach to the 1980 presidential campaign, serving as his \n     foreign policy advisor. Following his landslide victory and \n     during the transition, the Chairman-designate of the Senate \n     Agriculture Committee called to ask if I would meet with a \n     recently retired admiral. As the Chairman put it, ``this is \n     good ole boy I've known for a long time; he's worked in the \n     Pentagon and he knows how to fly planes on and off aircraft \n     carriers. He is tough, smart and loyal.'' The Senator told me \n     he might be interested in ``some kind of junior staff job at \n     the National Security Council,'' which I had been designated \n     to head.\n       Bud Nance came aboard that transition team steaming at \n     thirty knots, said he liked tough assignments, could execute \n     them well, and what did I have for him to do. For starters, I \n     asked him to take on the task of ``cleaning out'' the Carter \n     National Security Council Staff. Bud said: ``Oh, I get it, \n     I'm supposed to be just like a vacuum cleaner, just blow 'em \n     all out of there?'' And he did just that. It was not the last \n     time that Bud would be called upon to clean up an \n     organization!\n       At the honors for Bud in May, Secretary of State Madeleine \n     Albright--who was one of those staffers Bud was assigned to \n     show out the front door--reminded me that Bud had called her \n     for a meeting. Some of the Carter staffers actually thought \n     they should be kept on, and Bud was going to make certain \n     that the delusion was quickly erased. Madeleine Albright, a \n     feisty lady, said to Bud, ``Why are you talking to me? I \n     don't want to work with you people anyway!! As it turned out, \n     she was certainly right. But Bud wasn't taking any chances.\n       Instead of a ``junior position'' on the National Security \n     Council staff, I asked Bud to become my number one Deputy. I \n     knew he would work well with me, but more important, with \n     President Reagan. I was right about that.\n       Bud Nance was just about the finest associate and the \n     hardest working man a fellow could ever have. He insisted on \n     doing the heavy lifting, and served the National Security \n     Council and his President faithfully and well. On one \n     occasion, in the summer of 1981, the Navy decided to run a \n     very important operation into the Gulf of Sidra, near Libyan \n     waters, to establish freedom of navigation there. After we \n     approved the operation, I flew to California with the \n     President for continuing budget discussions. Bud insisted on \n     sleeping the night in the Situation Room, in order to \n     supervise the operation. At about midnight on the West Coast, \n     I got a hotline call from Bud, who in a matter-of-fact tone \n     said, ``Dick, we sent our carrier in there, and two Libyan \n     fellas came flyin' out at us in Russian Migs. We put up our \n     planes, and now the Libyans ain't flyin' any more because \n     they locked their radars onto our boys, and their planes got \n     all tore up with our missiles, and those Libyan boys are \n     definitely down in the drink. Now, if I was you, I'd be \n     callin' the President, and I'm goin' home to get some \n     sleep.''\n       If I were to recite the extraordinary career and \n     accomplishments of this very special man, I'd merely repeat \n     what more than twenty Senators of both parties related to \n     eloquently in their special tributes on the floor of the \n     Senate--filling fifteen solid pages of the Congressional \n     Record. Or I'd retell what his granddaughter, Catherine, and \n     son Andrew said so movingly at the memorable funeral services \n     for this patriot.\n       Leaving the White House in 1982, Bud worked for the Grace \n     Commission on Waste and Fraud in Government, and then for \n     Boeing until Senator Helms drafted him to come up to Capitol \n     Hill and take charge of the Foreign Relations Committee in \n     1991. After the Navy, after the White House, after the Grace \n     Commission, after Boeing, he again accepted the call to duty. \n     Everyone in Washington knew the basis on which he agreed to \n     work again--he declared that he would work free, saying that \n     his pension and Social Security were quite enough, thank you, \n     and that ``America has been good to me.'' He was not \n     permitted to do that, and had to accept the minimum wage of \n     $2.96 a week, later raised by cost of living increases, and \n     eventually was forced to accept the munificent sum of $4.53 a \n     week.\n       Each of us who knew, respected and loved him miss him very \n     much.\n       On May 19th, the motorcade that left the Lewinsville \n     Presbyterian Church in McLean enroute to Arlington National \n     Cemetery stretched for nearly two miles. The cannon fired \n     their salute, the rifles cracked, the bugler played Taps, the \n     Honor Guard stood by, and Bud's pastor asked us to stand for \n     the flyover.\n       North across the Potomac they came, four magnificent F-18 \n     Navy jets, flying in precise formation; as they roared \n     directly over the assembled mourners, three proceeded \n     straight ahead while one ignited his afterburner, peeled off \n     in a long and beautiful arc, flying straight up into the \n     heavens, at once symbolizing Bud's career and the passage to \n     his Maker. It was a profound moment, reminiscent of how much \n     Bud liked that little placard that President Reagan put on \n     his desk on the first morning of his presidency. Its \n     inscription said. ``There's no limit to what a man can do or \n     where he can go if he doesn't mind who gets the credit.''\n       That was Ronald Reagan's unspoken message to his staff and \n     to his Cabinet. Some read and heeded it, others did not. Bud \n     Nance did, because he was just the sort of man who did his \n     job well, and never did mind who got the credit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15067-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15067-S15068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              COY A.

What \nmany do not recognize is the vital importance of building support in \nthe greater community for those brave young men and women who are \nserving in uniform.

Short of Atlanta, Georgia, whose hard work \nand selflessness have contributed greatly to the Reserve and Guard \nprograms of our armed forces.\n  On December 6th, Coy Short will be honored by the State of Georgia \nfor his nine-years of able and visionary leadership as the Chairman of \nthe Georgia Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve. In \nthat capacity he has been responsible for helping to raise employer \nawareness about the importance of Guard and Reserve forces to our \nnational defense.\n  While Coy is going to be saluted for the work he did as Chairman of \nthe Georgia Committee, his commitment to public service goes far deeper \nand runs far longer than his tenure in that position. Clearly, his \ncontributions have benefitted the State of Georgia and the nation. Coy \nbegan his career in public service when as a young 1957 graduate of \nEmory University, he took the oath of an officer in the United States \nArmy and accepted a commission in the Artillery. He rose to the rank of \nCaptain before leaving military service, and his time on active duty \ntaught him many valuable lessons, not the least of which was the \nimportance of maintaining a strong defense and supporting those who \nserve.\n  After leaving the Army, Coy tried his hand at a number of \nentrepreneurial enterprises and while successful, he like many who \nserve their country missed the satisfaction that came from doing \nsomething for the benefit of others. In 1977, he began a career with \nthe Social Security Administration that has been a tremendous success \nby any measure, rising to the position of Deputy Regional Commissioner. \nThe most important gauge of success, however, would be the assistance \nhe has rendered to tens of thousands of Americans. Coy's tireless \nefforts and adept abilities as a manager have earned him repeated \nrecognitions, including the ``Commissioner's Citation'', the highest \naward given by the Social Security Administration.\n  Coy learned at an early age the importance of supporting our men and \nwomen in uniform. Nothing does more for the morale of those who serve \nin the military than to know that they are appreciated by those they \nprotect. Toward that goal, Coy Short has always been more than willing \nto roll-up his sleeves and lend his support to any effort that makes \nlife for our troops a little easier, or demonstrates to them the high \nregard in which they are held by their fellow Americans. He is \nespecially well known for his work as Chairman of the Georgia Committee \nfor Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve, where he has sought to \ninvolve others in this important endeavor. This work is especially \ncritical in a day and age when we increasingly rely on those who serve \nin non-active components to support ``real world'' missions. The \nrecognition that is being bestowed upon him early next month is a \ntestament to the fine job he has done in boosting support in the \ncommunity for our ``citizen-soldiers'', his work has made it easier for \nmen and women to get time off from work to meet their obligations to \ntheir units and help us meet our national defense goals.\n\n[[Page S15068]]\n\n  While we can all be proud of what Coy Short has accomplished as \nChairman of the Georgia Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and \nReserve, his commitment to helping the military is not limited to his \nservice to that body. He also serves as President of the B-29 \nSuperfortress Association, which has restored and put on display at \nDobbins Air Reserve Base one of those classic World War II era bombers, \nnamed ``The Sweet Eloise'', and is working on restoring the tenth C-130 \nHercules to have been produced in Georgia, which will also be displayed \nat that facility. Additionally, Coy serves on the Executive Committee \nof the USO Council of Georgia, as Ambassador for the U.S. Army Reserve, \nand is a member of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce's Greater Atlanta \nMilitary Affairs Council Executive Committee. In the past, he has \nserved as the President of the Atlanta Chapter of the Association of \nthe United States Army and as the Chairman of Peach Bowl's Community \nEvents Committee. Not surprisingly, Coy's efforts have won him \ndeservingly high praise and recognition in many forms including winning \nthe prestigious Sam Nunn Award for Outstanding Support of the National \nGuard; the Oglethorpe Distinguished Service Medal for Outstanding \nSupport of the Georgia Guard; the National Distinguished Service Award \nfrom the Association of the United States Army; the National Committee \nfor Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Award for Outstanding \nPublic Service; the Army Commendation Medal, awarded for public service \non behalf of Army Forces Command; the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce \nPhoenix Award; the Dobbins Air Reserve Base Man of the Year Award; the \nEli White Award of the Old Guard of the Gate City Guard; and, twice \nwinning the National Guard Association's Patrick Henry Award.\n  I am pleased and proud to be able to have this opportunity to commend \nmy good friend, Coy Short, on his many years of public service and the \ninvaluable support he has given to our armed forces, particularly those \nwho serve in the Guard and Reserve. It is my hope that others will be \ninspired to follow the lead that Coy has set for public service. The \nqualities of patriotism, selflessness, and duty were obviously \ninstilled in him at an early age, and we have all benefitted from his \ndevotion to service. Certainly Coy's mother, Eloise Strom, as well as \nCoy's wife Judy, deserve special recognition for the role they played \nin Coy's success.\n  Coy, we appreciate all your good work and know you will continue to \nfind ways to make a difference in the lives of those who live in \nGeorgia, Atlanta, and all those who serve in the armed forces of the \nUnited States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15068-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE DEPARTURE OF STEVEN APICELLA, LEGISLATIVE FELLOW\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize \nmy Legislative Fellow, Steven Apicella, who will be leaving the Lott \nstaff, my team, at the end of this session.\n  I must admit, when Steven first joined us, I was not sure who he was \nor why he was lurking in my meetings. However, I quickly learned that \nthanks to the wisdom of my Chief of staff and then Legislative \nDirector, the Department of Energy had lent me and Mississippi one of \ntheir best.\n  Over the past twenty months, Steven has become an indispensable part \nof my legislative shop. He has worked hard on a broad range of issues--\neach time jumping in feet first, soaking up knowledge, and moving \nlegislation forward in this often complicated process.\n  Steven began his Capitol Hill experience during the lengthy and \ngrueling TEA-21 negotiations. He quickly realized my transportation \npriorities for my home state of Mississippi, and was helpful in making \nsure these issues were not ignored. During these long hours spent \nhammering out the details of TEA-21, Steven earned the respect of \nstaff, as well as mine.\n  Steven advised me on a variety of high-tech issues, and was an active \nparticipant of the team which formulated a focus for the Republican \nTechnology Task Force. He worked with the staffs of several of my \ncolleagues to reach a consensus--often not an easy task.\n  Steven has also been very diligent in advancing a meaningful and \nupdated encryption policy--one that balances national security, law \nenforcement and trade interests. He continually made sure that all \nparties realized that these are not mutually exclusive priorities. \nSteven detected this significant issue and was responsible for bringing \nit to my attention and guiding me as the bill worked its way through \nthe Commerce committee.\n  Digital signatures is another issue Steven has aggressively pursued. \nHe played an active role in getting the government portion of the \nlegislation enacted into law last Congress, and worked extensively \ntoward today's Senate passage of this needed opportunity for the \nprivate sector.\n  An important service on behalf of the State of Mississippi has been \nSteven's diligence on national parks legislation. This year Steven was \nvery helpful in preparing two bills that I introduced in this area--one \nto add the battlefield at Corinth as part of the Shiloh National Park, \nand another to begin the planning for the designation of the Vicksburg \nCampaign Trail. On each of these bills, Steven worked effectively with \nthe Senate committee of jurisdiction and was responsible for getting \nthe funds authorized before introduction. I am happy to say that today \nthose bills passed the Senate by unanimous consent.\n  Finally, with Steven's help I again fought the uphill battle of Title \nBranding. Steven worked with and strengthened a large, bipartisan \neffort to draft and support legislation to brand the titles of severely \ndamaged salvaged vehicles, so consumers will be able to identify \npotentially dangerous used cars before they are purchased. Steven \nsearched for a compromise, and constantly pushed the envelope of \nconsensus. Steven tirelessly championed this pro-consumer bill and his \nefforts brought it to the threshold of Senate passage.\n  Although Steven was assigned areas which were outside the realm of \nhis ``parent'' employer, Department of Energy--he has been an excellent \nambassador. He has helped the staff understand the intricacies of the \nagency and appreciate its problems. As Steven returns to his duties at \nDOE, I hope his experiences and the skills and contacts he has \ndeveloped while serving as a part of my staff will serve him well.\n  Over the past several years, I have been privileged to have the \nservices of legislative fellows, to provide stellar support for my \nefforts. Steven has been fantastic. I thank Steven for his dedication \nand determination, and I thank DOE for their patience--I'm sure they \nare ready to have him back, working his magic there. I wish Steven, and \nhis son Jarrett, Godspeed in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15068-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15068-S15069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMARKS ON THE DEPARTURE OF IVAN SCHLAGER\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today with both pride and sadness \nas we say goodbye to a long time member of my staff, Ivan Schlager. I \nhave known Ivan for nearly 20 years. One cold afternoon at Northwestern \nUniversity in 1983, Ivan approached a woman, he thought to be a staffer \non the Hollings for President Campaign and offered to volunteer on that \neffort.\n  That ``staffer'' turned out to my wife, Peatsy Hollings, and before \nIvan knew what had happened, he was driving and wading through the snow \nof New Hampshire in support of my effort.\n  After finishing at Northwestern and law school at Georgetown, Ivan \njoined the Commerce Committee staff in 1989 and began to assist both \nSenator Rockefeller and myself at the Subcommittee on Tourism and \nForeign Commerce. In this job, he played an important role on many of \nthe international trade agreements concluded over the past decade, \nincluding most notably the Uruguay Round agreement which created the \nWTO and the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n  I truly believe that Ivan is one of the most knowledgeable and \nsubstantive individuals with regard to international trade. He was \ninstrumental in insuring that all voices were heard during these \nimportant debates.\n  More than 3 years ago, Ivan became the Commerce Committee's staff \ndirector and he has overseen its operations since that time. He has \nprovided the committee Democrats with a thoughtful and pragmatic \napproach to a remarkable variety of issues. Moreover, he has developed \na fine working relationship with Chairman McCain, his\n\n[[Page S15069]]\n\nstaff and the remainder of the Republicans on the committee.\n  On many occasions, these relationships have assisted in forging a \nbipartisan consensus on a variety of issues that have helped advance \ngood public policy in areas such as telecommunications and broadcast \npolicy, aviation, trucking and rail issues, technology development and \nenvironmental and oceans concerns.\n  One particular issue stands out, last year's tobacco debate. Under \ndifficult personal circumstances, Ivan worked closely with both \nRepublicans and Democrats to help craft a compromise that was reported \nout of the committee by a 19-1 vote.\n  On other occasions, such as product liability or international trade \nwe have been unable to reach bipartisan consensus and have been forced \nto hash out our differences on the Senate floor. In those instances, I \nhave been blessed to have Ivan's energy, quick thinking, political \nintuition and wise counsel during the debate.\n  As, I mentioned earlier, I first met Ivan when he was in his early \ntwenties. Both Peatsy and I have seen him grow from a college student \nto a dedicated and accomplished public servant. We rejoiced when he met \nand married his lovely wife, Martha Verrill. We celebrated when they \nhad a baby boy, Ethan, and then a second, William. We grieved with him \nwhen his father passed away last year. And today we wish him well as he \nmoves onto his next step in joining the internationally recognized law \nfirm of Skadden, Arps.\n  Ivan, thank you for all that you have done for Peatsy and me, the \nCommerce Committee, and for our country. We will miss you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15069-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS IN THE FIRST SESSION OF THE 106TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the Senate concludes this first session \nof the 106th Congress, I want to take a moment to thank Senator Lott, \nthe majority leader, and Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, for working with us to confirm some of the judges \ndesperately needed around the country.\n  Senator Hatch has pressed forward with three confirmation hearings \nsince October 5, in the last five weeks of this session to bring the \ntotal number of hearings to seven for the year. Those hearings allowed \nfor 12 additional judicial nominees to be reported to the Senate \ncalendar and another two being ready for action by the committee. \nSenator Hatch supported all but one of the nominees voted upon by the \nSenate this year and worked hard to clear judicial nominees reported by \nthe committee for action by the Senate.\n  I thank the majority leader for working with me and Senator Daschle, \nour Democratic leader, to find a way to consider each of the judicial \nnominations reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee. In early \nOctober he committed to working with us and last week he announced that \nhe would press forward for votes on the nominations of Judge Richard \nPaez and Marsha Berzon by March 15 and on the other nominations left \npending on the Senate Executive Calendar, as well. With his assurance, \nSenator Boxer was willing to proceed immediately to consider a \nnomination important to the Senator from Mississippi. I want to commend \nSenator Boxer and Senator Feinstein for their efforts on behalf of both \nJudge Paez and Ms. Berzon. With their support these nominees are each \nnow headed toward final confirmation votes.\n  For the year, the senate confirmed 33 federal judges to the District \nCourts and Courts of Appeals around the country and to the Court of \nInternational Trade. The Senate has voted to fill only 33 of the 90 \nvacancies that have existed throughout the year, however, and there \nremain 36 judicial nominees still pending before the Senate. Most \nregrettably, the Senate rejected the nomination of Justice Ronnie White \non an unprecedented part-line vote. Senator Hatch is fond of saying \nthat the Senate could do better. I agree with him and hope that we will \ncontinue to do much better next year.\n  I began this year challenging the Senate to maintain that pace it \nestablished last year when the Senate confirmed 66 judges. I urged the \nSenate to move away from ``the destructive politics of [1996 and 1997] \nin which the Republican Senate confirmed only 17 and 36 judges.'' We \ndid not achieve much movement in the first 10 months of this year. It \nis my hope that developments over the last week signal that the Senate \nis finally moving toward recognition of our constitutional duty \nregarding judicial nominations and that we will consider them more \npromptly and fairly in the coming months.\n  I note that during the last two years of the Bush Administration, a \nDemocratic Senate confirmed 106 federal judges. To reach that total \nthis Congress, the Senate next year will need to confirm 73 additional \njudges. That will take commitment and work, but we can achieve it. In \n1994, with a Democratic majority in the Senate, we confirmed 101 \njudges, and in 1992, the last year of the Bush Administration, a \nDemocratic Senate confirmed 64 federal judges.\n  Meanwhile we end this year with more judicial vacancies than existed \nwhen we adjourned at the end of last year. We have again lost ground in \nour efforts to fill longstanding judicial vacancies that are plaguing \nthe federal courts. In 1983 vacancies numbered only 16. Even after the \ncreation of 85 new judgeships in 1984, the number of vacancies had been \nreduced to only 33 by the end of the 99th Congress in 1986. At the end \nof the 100th Congress in 1988, which had a Democratic majority and a \nRepublican President, judicial vacancies numbered only 23. In 1999 the \nRepublican Senate adjourns leaving 57 current vacancies with 10 on the \nhorizon.\n  Moreover, the Republican Congress has refused to consider the \nauthorization of the additional judges needed by the federal judiciary \nto deal with their ever-increasing workload. In 1984 and in 1990, \nCongress did respond to requests for needed judicial resources by the \nJudicial Conference. Indeed, in 1990, a Democratic majority in the \nCongress created judgeships during a Republican presidential \nadministration. Two years ago the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates requested that an additional 53 judgeships be authorized around \nthe country. This year the Judicial Conference renewed its request but \nincreased it to 72 judgeships needing to be authorized around the \ncountry. If Congress had passed the Federal Judgeship Act of 1999, S. \n1145, as it should have, the federal judiciary would have 130 vacancies \ntoday. That is the more accurate measure of the needs of the federal \njudiciary that have been ignored by the Congress over the past several \nyears.\n  More and more of the vacancies are judicial emergencies that have \nbeen left vacant for longer periods of time. The President has sent the \nSenate qualified nominees for 15 of the current judicial emergency \nvacancies, which nominations remain pending as the Senate adjourns for \nthe year.\n  Most troubling is the circuit emergency that had to be declared three \nmonths ago by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit. That is a situation that we should have confronted by \nexpediting consideration of the nominations of Alston Johnson and \nEnrique Moreno this year. I hope that the Senate will consider them \nboth promptly in the early part of next year. In the meantime, I regret \nthat the Senate is adjourning and leaving the Fifth Circuit to deal \nwith the crisis in the federal administration of justice in Texas, \nLouisiana and Mississippi as best it can but without the resources that \nit desperately needs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15069-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15069-S15071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, due to the illness of a family member, I was \nunable to participate in much of the debate on the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty. I voted in favor of ratification of the treaty, and, now \nthat there is ample time, I want to express my views on the treaty and \nthe debate prior to the Senate's vote against ratification.\n  In my view, that vote was a sad day for the United States Senate, for \nour nation and for the world. During the debate, my colleague, Senator \nCleland spoke eloquently of the pride he felt as a young man sitting in \nthis chamber 36 years ago when the Senate voted to ratify the first \nnuclear test ban treaty which prohibited atmospheric nuclear tests. I \ndoubt that many people can express a similar sense of pride over the\n\n[[Page S15070]]\n\noutcome of the Senate's consideration of the Test Ban Treaty earlier \nthis fall.\n  My disappointment rests, firstly, with the manner in which this \ntreaty was considered. It can only be characterized as hurried, a \nlegislative rush to judgement. For instance, Senator Byrd, one of the \nmost senior members of this chamber and a former majority leader, rose \nto speak prior to a procedural vote. He dared to ask for fifteen \nminutes to speak during this chamber's headlong rush to vote against a \ntreaty that would ban nuclear explosions throughout the world. The \nmajority was well aware that there were not 67 votes for this treaty, \nand they knew what the final outcome would be. Sadly, though, the \nmajority found it necessary to brush aside the most senior member on \nthis side of the aisle. That is not the way we should conduct business \nin the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, that episode characterized the entire debate on this \ntreaty. There was a hastiness and a needless sense of urgency about \narriving at that ratification vote that we rarely see in this body. The \nsudden scheduling of the vote, prior to a single hearing, brought one \nweek of frenzied focus that some members characterized as ample \nconsideration. I think that it fell far short. All hearings on this \ntreaty were crammed into one week, and most of the floor debate time \nwas allocated on a Friday, prior to a three day weekend and after the \nweek's final vote.\n  The brief debate and vote on this treaty were closely watched within \nthis country and around the world. As evidence of that, most, if not \nall, Senators received a high volume of constituent calls, and no \nSenator is unaware that foreign leaders made rare appeals to this body.\n  The process followed with this treaty bore little resemblance to the \nprocess the Senate normally follows when it receives a treaty. The \nnormal process includes careful consideration of a treaty's merits, an \nairing of the arguments from those who have objections, the addition of \nany safeguards that may be necessary, and, finally, a vote on \nratification. In this case, that process was ignored and, some would \nargue, even maligned.\n  The Senate could have easily avoided a ratification vote, and, given \nthe haste of its actions and the profound importance of the subject at \nhand, should have done so. Moreover, some members on the other side of \nthe aisle clearly stated that they needed more time to examine this \ntreaty, study its implications, and propose any appropriate amendments \nor side agreements. In fact, a majority of this body appeared to want \nmore time to do so. That view is eminently reasonable considering how \nquickly this treaty was considered. Instead, all Senators were forced \nto make a fast decision and put their position on record. It is hard to \navoid the conclusion that the defeat of this treaty was an end in \nitself, rather than a byproduct of considered action. Now, by this \nvote, the United States Senate has allowed friend and foe to conclude \nthat we want more nuclear testing and we need more nuclear explosions. \nWe ignored Senator Levin's injunction to, at the very least, ``do no \nharm.'' Instead, we have at a minimum muddied this nation's \nposition with respect to containing the threat of nuclear warfare. All \nwe had to do to avoid this outcome was to delay the vote. There were \nthose on the other side of the aisle who endorsed doing just that. \nRegrettably, they were overruled by their colleagues who are \noverzealous opponents of this Administration.\n\n  I support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and, as the President \nstated, I expect that the treaty will be ratified--if not this year, \nthen some year. Nuclear test explosions are becoming anachronisms; the \ntide of history is quickly sweeping away the last vestiges of their \nlegitimacy. Prior to the vote, I had decided to support the President's \nrequest to put off the vote on ratification. It had become clear to the \nPresident and me and most other members of this chamber that, despite \nour strong support of this treaty, the Senate was not yet ready to \nsupport ratification. It was with regret that I arrived at that \nconclusion, because no one enjoys putting off a vote that will benefit \nthe people of this nation, and, in this case, the people of the world. \nThis treaty has been signed by over 150 nations. It is supported by \nnearly every member of the United Nations. Clearly it merited several \ndays or even weeks of hearings in which experts on both sides of this \nissue would have a chance to present testimony and answer questions. \nMore than that, though, it deserved to be ratified. Our nation is the \nworld's greatest force for peace and freedom. It is not worthy of that \nstature for us to be outside the community of civilized nations that \nhave committed themselves to an end to nuclear testing.\n  We have missed an opportunity to lead these nations, and to provide \nan example to countries like India and Pakistan, both of whom are on \nthe verge of signing this treaty. Instead, we have, I fear, energized \nforces in those countries and others around the world that favor \nfurther testing or revoking pledges not to test.\n  This treaty will make the world more safe for our children and our \nchildren's children. We have a responsibility, despite the vote, to \nthose future generations to do our part to stop nuclear detonations. If \nwe fail in our responsibility, we will dash the hopes of generations \nyet to come. They may wonder why, when the world finally seemed ready \nto halt nuclear testing, the United States refused to go along.\n  Throughout the Cold War, nuclear tests may have been necessary to \nmodernize this nation's nuclear weapons capability. But at the height \nof tensions with the Soviet Union, President Eisenhower said that the \nfailure to achieve a nuclear test ban ``would have to be classed as the \ngreatest disappointment of any administration, of any decade, of any \ntime and of any party.''\n  In 1992, President Bush, a former CIA Director and Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations, unilaterally halted nuclear weapons tests in the United \nStates. President Clinton subsequently continued the moratorium. This \ntreaty would halt nuclear weapons tests in other nations, as well. It \nwould force other nations to do what this nation has already done and \nhas been doing for these past several years.\n  Since the first test in 1945, the United States has conducted 1030 \nnuclear explosions--more than all other nations combined. As a result, \nwe have far more test data and a far more deadly nuclear arsenal than \nany other nation. This treaty would effectively preserve this nation's \nposition as the pre-eminent nuclear weapons power.\n  It would limit the ability of nuclear-capable nations from developing \nmore sophisticated and more deadly nuclear weapons. It does not outlaw \nimprovements and advancements to weapons, but without the ability to \ntest the new weapons, nations would be hesitant to deploy them.\n  For those nations that do not yet possess a nuclear arsenal, this \ntreaty will hinder their ability to develop such an arsenal. Those \nnations will be barred from conducting and studying a single nuclear \nexplosion. Perhaps they could develop, at some time in the future, a \ncrude nuclear arsenal, but they would face daunting uncertainties \nwithout having witnessed a single explosion.\n  This treaty enhances our national security. It has the support of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff and several former military leaders including \nGen. Colin Powell. Besides solidifying this nation's vast lead in \nnuclear technology and nuclear weaponry, it would assist us in \nmonitoring nuclear explosions throughout the world. Regardless of \nwhether this treaty goes into force, this nation must determine whether \nother nations are conducting nuclear explosions. This treaty mandates a \nglobal network of sensors and allows for on-site inspections, so it \nwould greatly assist this nation in meeting its monitoring \nresponsibilities.\n  Questions have been raised about whether we can maintain the \nreliability of our nuclear arsenal absent more nuclear tests. Many \nnuclear experts, however, assert that we can maintain a reliable \ndeterrent, as we have since 1992, without the nuclear explosions. \nFurthermore, this nation plans to allocate $45 billion over the next \nten years to ensure the reliability of our stockpile. What other nation \nhas greater resources to dedicate to its stockpile? What other nation \nis better able, given its experience, to ensure the reliability of \nnuclear weapons?\n  Our allies, Britain and France, have conducted far fewer nuclear \nexplosions than we have, yet they have ratified\n\n[[Page S15071]]\n\nthis treaty. Over half of the nuclear-capable nations in the world have \nratified this treaty. We have the least to lose and the most to gain if \nthis treaty goes into force. This nation must do its part and help rid \nthe world of these terrible nuclear explosions. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport a reexamination of these issues and a reconsideration of the \nSenate's regrettable course of action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15071-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          S CORPORATION ESOPS\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, in 1996 and 1997, I supported the creation \nof S corporation ESOPs, which--while they may sound a bit obscure to \nsome--are an innovative way of giving employees an ownership stake in \ntheir companies and providing for their retirement.\n  The design of these programs was quite deliberate, and intended to \naccomplish very specific policy objectives. We sought to create not \nonly an administrable structure for these plans, but also a program \nthat encouraged private businesses to give their workers a ``piece of \nthe rock'' and help them save for their retirement. The law therefore \nallows some deferral of tax liability on current-year revenues of a \nparticipating S corporation, but of course only for that portion of the \ncompany's revenues that are put into the ESOP accounts of employees. \nThat is to say, the deferral only exists so long as the monies are not \nrealized by employee-owners; when they withdraw the funds for their \nretirement benefit, they also pay a tax, and in this case, at a much \nhigher rate than standard capital gains.\n  Recently, some have questioned whether this incentive should be \neliminated. I am delighted that a strong bipartisan majority of the \nmembers of the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means \nCommittee have indicated they want to preserve the fundamental \nattributes of S corporation ESOPs. We have carefully scrutinized this \nmatter in recent months, particularly in the context of the tax \nextenders legislation. We have determined that Treasury's proposal to \neliminate the deferral aspect of S corporation ESOPs is a serious \nthreat to the vitality of S corporation ESOPs. In rejecting this \nproposal, Congress has affirmed that--at a time when national savings \nrates are abysmally low, when Americans worry how they will fund their \nretirement, and when we in Congress worry about the future of Social \nSecurity--we cannot afford to undo such important programs.\n  In response to Treasury's concerns with possible abuse of the system, \nwe included a revenue raising provision in the extenders package to \nstrengthen the 1996 law. However, the Treasury Department objected to \nthe provision and it was dropped during the last minute negotiations on \nthe bill. Secretary Summers has agreed to work with me over the coming \nmonths on a provision to strengthen and preserve broad-based employee \nownership of S corporations through ESOPs in the future.\n  Today, there are 100,000 or more workers in America who are using and \nbenefiting from the S corporation ESOP rules that we designed. We have \nreason to be proud of this accomplishment, and to point to it as an \nexample of how we are helping Americans build wealth for their futures \nand their families through private ownership. I believe more workers \nstand to benefit from this great opportunity, which is working as \nCongress intended. I believe, along with a strong bipartisan group of \nmy colleagues, that we must do all we can to sustain and promote S \ncorporation ESOPs. I appreciate the strong support of Chairman Roth and \nother members of the Finance Committee in particular to achieve this \nobjective, and look forward to working with them on an ongoing basis \nfor this very important cause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15071-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15071-S15072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. At the Brandenburg Gate, West Berlin, on June 12, 1987, \nPresident Reagan issued a stunning challenge: ``General Secretary \nGorbachev, if you seek peace if you seek prosperity for the Soviet \nUnion and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this \ngate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this \nwall!'' And less than three years later, the wall crumbled, along with \nthe threat of communism as a viable, universalist alternative to \ndemocracy.\n  I remember reporting on the fall of the Berlin Wall as a newscaster. \nI remember those first tentative attempts to climb over it, and the \nrush of revelers that followed when no shots were fired. Remember, the \nwall was built to keep people in, and freedom out. The guard posts in \nthe East were facing eastward, not toward West Berlin. It is incredible \nthat the tenth anniversary of this seminal event passed almost without \ncomment. For it marked the end of the Soviet Empire, and foreshadowed \nthe end of the Soviet Union itself. The global correlation of forces, \nas the Soviets used to say, aligned with freedom, not oppression.\n  The Wall crumbled because President Reagan was committed to achieving \npeace through strength. The Reagan Doctrine asserted the need to \nconfront and rollback communism by aiding national liberation movements \nin Afghanistan, Angola, Grenada, Cambodia, and Nicaragua. He proved \nthat once countries were in the Soviet camp, they need not remain there \nforever. He realized that our national prestige is reinforced and \nenhanced when we operate with a coherent, concise, and understandable \nforeign policy. And by doing so, he succeeded in inspiring and \nsupporting dissidents behind the Iron Curtain who eroded the mortar of \nthat Wall.\n  In contrast, the Clinton Administration has reacted to foreign policy \ncrises, but has failed to a develop a foreign policy. The \nAdministration has lurched from managing one crisis to another, but \nnever articulated the national interest in accordance with a core \nphilosophy. Instead of consistently safeguarding and promoting our \nvalues abroad, it has acted on an ad hoc basis according to the needs \nof the moment, confusing our allies and emboldening rogue nations. \nSerbia was emboldened to conduct ethnic cleansing in Kosovo; North \nKorea was emboldened to develop nuclear weapons; Saddam Hussein was \nemboldened to strengthen his position in northern Iraq.\n  What is the Clinton Doctrine? We have been told about a ``do-ability \ndoctrine'' whereby the United States acts ``in the places where our \naddition of action will, in fact, be the critical difference.'' \nHowever, that alone cannot be the criteria for U.S. intervention. Under \nthat formulation we could be expected to intervene anywhere in the \nworld. And as Secretary Albright stated as our Ambassador to the U.N. \n``we are not the world's policeman, nor are we running a charity or a \nfire department.''\n  However, as a practical matter, the combination of a ``do-ability \ndoctrine'' with so-called ``assertive multilateralism''--places the \nUnited States in the very position which Secretary Albright derided. It \nhas resulted in both the abdication of our responsibilities and the \nmisguided projection of our power. Instead of applying the Reagan \nDoctrine by equipping and training the Bosnian forces over our allies' \nobjections, the Administration subcontracted our role of arming the \nBosnians to a terrorist regime in Iran, unnecessarily endangering the \nlives of U.S. troops. Instead of arming the Bosnians, we supported our \nallies standing by in U.N. blue helmets, watching unarmed civilians be \nmassacred in Srebrenica. In contrast, the attempt at nation building in \nSomalia, and the refusal to provide equipment requested on the ground \nbecause it would send the wrong signal, sacrificed the lives of 18 \nbrave soldiers without regard to whether such action advanced our vital \nconcerns. When this Administration acts according to the exigencies of \nthe moment instead of according to an underlying philosophy, the \ncountry lurches from paralysis to ``mission creep'' without regard to \nthe national interest.\n  Recently, there has been discussion of the possibility of reworking \nour entire military force structure--which is presently based on the \ncapacity to fight two simultaneous major regional conflicts--in order \nto enable us to commit US troops to an ever-growing number of \nmultilateral ``peacekeeping'' missions. I am concerned that we may \nsacrifice our vital national security interests in order to be able to \nparticipate in peripheral endeavors. We should not be shortsighted. We \nshould not lose sight of what we must do in\n\n[[Page S15072]]\n\norder to accomplish what we can do. Our military should be used to \nprotect our national security interests, not provide peacekeeping in \nareas without strategic significance.\n  That kind of distinction will never happen under the Clinton \nAdministration. President Clinton does not have the clarity of purpose \nof Ronald Reagan. No walls will be torn down. There is no Clinton \nDoctrine. There is only a half-hearted attempt to justify random acts \nunder an artificial rubric and a series of slogans. And our country is \nthe worse for it. We should note the fall of the Berlin Wall symbolizes \nmore than just a victory of liberty over totalitarianism. It shows that \narmed with a core philosophy, a coherent doctrine, and a lot of \ncourage, there is no limit to what we can accomplish.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15072-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ROMANIAN CHAIRMANSHIP OF OSCE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as we attempt to conclude our business \nfor this session of Congress, I wanted to mention an important decision \nthat has just occurred in Istanbul. Mr. President, as you know, Turkey \nis hosting the annual summit of the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe (OSCE). Our President was in attendance, and from \nreports, this summit has been a robust forum for debate.\n  Given recent history, it is impossible to overstate the importance \nthat the OSCE might play in maintaining Europe's peace and stability. \nIt is the only forum available where all the nations of Europe meet to \ndiscuss European concerns. Clearly, the status of European Security is \nmore fluid at this time then at any other in the last 40 years. \nTherefore, one of the very important decisions that the OSCE must make \nat the Istanbul Summit, is who will chair the OSCE in 2001.\n  I am very pleased to announce that the OSCE has chosen the nation of \nRomania to undertake this important leadership role. The United States \nand several leading European nations had advanced Romania's candidacy, \nand I believe that the OSCE has made a very wise choice. Romania's \nvalue as OSCE chair derives from a number of factors. First, Romania's \ngeostrategic position places it in the heart of the region where \nstability is needed most. Despite lying at the crossroads of the \nBalkans, the Caucasus, and European Russia, Romania has managed to \nmaintain excellent relations with all the parties. The OSCE desperately \nneeds leadership that understands the problems of this region, while \nhaving no vested interest in any particular outcome. That is the sort \nof leadership that only Romania can bring to the table. Second, Romania \nis a role model for other Balkan nations. The economic and political \nreforms that Romania has undertaken, have not come easy--but that is \npart of her attraction to the other nations of the region. Romania's \nexperience demonstrates that if willing to make the necessary \nsacrifices, democracy and a liberalized economy are within reach. \nFinally, Romania has a strong tradition of cooperation with this \nnation. Our friendship has been formalized through the 1997 Strategic \nPartnership, as well as Romania's vigorous participation in the \nPartnership for Peace.\n  Mr. President, Romanian chairmanship is a very positive harbinger for \nthe future of Europe, and for the future of the Balkan Region. I \ncongratulate the OSCE for their excellent choice. I wish Romania's \nleadership the very best wishes upon assuming this very weighty \nresponsibility. We look forward to another session of productive \ndialogue and meaningful diplomacy upon their accession to the \nchairmanship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15072-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE 1999 STATE PARKS GOLD MEDAL\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today, I rise with my colleague Senator \nMack to take a moment to recognize our Florida state park system, which \nrecently received the prestigious 1999 National State Parks Gold Medal \nfrom the National Sports Foundation, Inc., a part of the 25,000-member \nNational Sporting Goods Association. The State Parks Gold Medal is \nawarded every other year to the state park system considered America's \nbest. We are proud and honored that Florida's state park system, which \nincludes 151 diverse state parks throughout the state covering more \nthan one-half million acres, received this recognition in October at \nthe National Recreation and Park Association Annual Congress in \nNashville, Tennessee.\n  Congratulations to Governor Jeb Bush, Florida Department of \nEnvironmental Protection, Secretary David Struhs, and the Department's \nDivision of Recreation and Parks Director, Fran Mainella, on this \nachievement.\n  This nation's state parks play a key role in our society--they \nprovide much needed recreational opportunities to Americans while \nprotecting key resources. These parks create the link between our \nnational parks, dedicated specifically to protection of the resources \nfor which the park was created, and our local parks, dedicated \nspecifically to recreation. Without a strong state park system, the \nresources in our national parks will become stressed as people seek to \nfill unmet recreational needs. We are proud that the state of Florida \nrecognizes this connection, and works to maintain a strong state park \nsystem.\n  In honor of ``Florida's State Parks--Voted America's Best,'' Governor \nBush and the Florida Cabinet have designated Saturday, November 20 as a \n``free day'' when admission charges to Florida state parks will be \nwaived for all visitors. We invite all of our colleagues to a free day \nin one or more of America's best state parks that day.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to recognize these \noutstanding natural areas, preserved forever for the enjoyment of this \nand future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15072-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15072-S15073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF JOSEPH E. BRENNAN\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, last Wednesday, the Senate confirmed \nGovernor Joseph E. Brennan as a commissioner on the Federal Maritime \nCommission, and this week Governor Brennan was sworn in for a term to \nexpire in 2003.\n  Governor Brennan, who formerly served as a Member of Congress for \nfour years, where he was a member of the House Merchant Marine and \nFisheries Committee, and Governor of Maine for eight years prior to \nthat, is eminently qualified to confront the challenges facing the \nmaritime community. With his broad experience at both the state and \nfederal level, Governor Brennan is an outstanding choice to serve as a \nCommissioner on the FMC.\n  His service in Congress gave him first-hand knowledge of federal \nmaritime issues as a member of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries \nCommittee that will be invaluable on the Maritime Commission.\n  Established in 1961, the Federal Maritime Commission--FMC--is an \nindependent regulatory agency charged with administering laws relating \nto shipping and the waterborne domestic and offshore commerce of the \nU.S.\n  The FMC's jurisdiction encompasses many facets of the maritime \nindustry. The Chairman and four Commissioners of the FMC are \nresponsible for protecting shippers, carriers and others engaged in \nforeign commerce from restrictive rules and regulations of foreign \ngovernments and from the practices of foreign-flag carriers that have \nan adverse effect on shipping in U.S. trades. The FMC also reviews and \nmonitors agreements under shipping law, reviews and approves or rejects \ntariff filings, issues licenses for ocean freight activities, \nadministers passenger indemnity laws, reviews alleged or suspected \nviolations of shipping statutes, and promulgates rules and regulations \non shipping laws.\n  The maritime sector is vitally important to our economy, and the \nFMC's responsibilities are fundamental to sustaining U.S. \ncompetitiveness in this area.\n  As a Senator from Maine, a state with a rich maritime heritage, I am \nkeenly aware that our nation has always been dependent upon the sea and \nhas thus enjoyed a rich maritime tradition. To this day, our merchant \nmarine remains an integral part of our culture and our economy.\n  Today, one out of every six jobs in the United States is marine \nrelated. America's ports support more than 95 percent of all our \noverseas foreign trade, and within the U.S., more than one billion tons \nof commercial cargo is transported by ship each year. We must\n\n[[Page S15073]]\n\ndo all that we can to preserve our maritime legacy for future \ngenerations, and the FMC plays a key role in the commercial component \nof this legacy.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to recognize Senator McCain, \nChairman of the Commerce Committee, for his leadership, and for making \nit possible to move the nominations of both Governor Brennan and \nAnthony Merck prior to adjournment. I am grateful to Senator McCain and \nto Majority Leader Lott for their efforts to move this nomination \nexpeditiously--and to my colleagues for their support.\n  Finally, I would like to offer my heartfelt congratulations to \nGovernor Brennan. I am very pleased that the President recognized that \nhe would make a valuable contribution to the FMC. As senior Senator \nfrom Maine and a member of the Commerce Committee, I look forward to \nworking with Governor Brennan on maritime issues in the years to come.\n  Mr. President, once again, I would like to thank Chairman McCain \nMajority Leader Lott, and my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15073-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15073-S15074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE RISING COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to address an issue of critical \nimportance to millions and millions of Americans, an issue I have come \nto the floor previously to discuss and an issue that has become one of \nmy highest legislative priorities, the lack of affordable prescription \ndrugs.\n  Today, nearly thirty five percent of Medicare beneficiaries, 14 \nmillion people, have absolutely no coverage for prescription drugs. \nUnfortunately, these are also the same individuals who consume the \nmajority of prescription drugs in our country. Studies indicate that \neighty percent of retirees take at least one prescription drug every \nday and those over the age of sixty-five take on average, eighteen and \na half prescription drugs per year.\n  Older Americans spend a tremendous amount of money out of pocket on \ntheir health care expenses. It is estimated that seniors spend an \naverage of fourteen percent on hospital admission costs, thirty one \npercent on physician visits, thirty four percent on prescription drugs \nand twenty one percent on other health care related expenses. \nPrescription drugs have become the number one health care expense for \nsenior citizens in our country.\n  I came to the floor a few weeks ago to talk about this very same \nissue, but I am addressing this issue again because I believe this \nmatter is too critical for Congress to ignore. It appears as though \nCongress will not reach an agreement before we adjourn for the year, or \neven have a meaningful discussion, on how we will provide relief to the \nmillions of needy seniors throughout our country and my state of South \nDakota who struggle every day to pay for their medications.\n  While prices for the prescription drugs most often used by older \nAmericans are skyrocketing far beyond inflation, recently the \npharmaceutical industry reveled in record breaking stock prices and an \nannouncement of a proposed multi-billion dollar merger between Warner \nLambert and American Home Products. This proposed deal would form the \nbiggest merger in the history of the drug industry and create the \nlargest drug maker in the world. The transaction between Warner Lambert \nand American Home Products is worth nearly seventy three billion \ndollars, billions more than the federal government spends on most of \ntheir thirteen individual appropriation bills.\n  News of this proposed merger, prompted another drug industry giant, \nPfizer, Inc. to announce a counter offer to buy Warner Lambert at a \ncost of eighty two and a half billion dollars.\n  On the heels of the pharmaceutical industry's financial exploits, \n``Families USA: The Voice for Health Care Consumers'' recently released \na report indicating that more than two thirds of the fifty most \ncommonly prescribed drugs for seniors increased in price nearly two to \nthree times faster than the rate of inflation. Last year, wholesale \nprices for fifty prescriptions commonly filled by the elderly rose by \nsix and a half percent even though the overall inflation rate that year \nwas just one and a half percent.\n\n  For example, the drug Lorazepam, used to treat Parkinson's disease, \nincreased three hundred and eighty five percent over the last five \nyears. The report also found that while the median profit for all \nFortune five hundred companies was four and a half percent, \nmanufacturers of drugs most commonly prescribed to seniors relished in \nprofits at or above twenty percent in 1998.\n  The findings in the Families USA study reflect similar results that I \nfound in a study that I had requested from the House Government Reform \nCommittee on drug prices paid by South Dakota seniors.\n  The South Dakota study found that South Dakota's elderly pay more \nthan twice as much for their prescription drugs as does a \npharmaceutical company's favored customers, such as HMO's, large \ninsurance companies or the federal government. The study found that \nprice differentials are as high as one thousand four hundred and sixty \nnine percent for some drugs.\n  For the last several months, I have been holding meetings in \ncommunities across South Dakota on the subject of prescription drug \nprices. The response from seniors and young people alike on this issue \nhas been overwhelming to say the least.\n  I have received nearly five thousand postcards and hundreds more \nletters in response to my request for South Dakotans to contact me with \ntheir opinions on this issue. I have asked South Dakotans to become a \nCitizen Cosponsor of the prescription drug legislation that I \nintroduced with Senator Kennedy, called the Prescription Drug Fairness \nFor Seniors Act''. Our bill would allow Medicare beneficiaries access \nto the same low prescription drug prices that the drug companies offer \ntheir ``favored'' customers, such as HMO's, large insurance companies \nand the federal government. This bill ends the price discrimination \nthat now exists against the segment of the society who rely on \nprescription drugs the most, older Americans. South Dakotans have told \nme that they support this effort to make prescription drugs affordable.\n  Mr. President, we are forcing our senior citizens to make the \nunimaginable choice between ``heating and eating'' or buying their \nmedication. This is a choice that no human being should have to make.\n  With the proposed drug industry merger between Warner Lambert and \nAmerican Home Products, and the recently released Families USA study, \ntoday highlights two more examples which reinforces my belief that we \nneed legislation to help lower the high cost of prescription drugs for \nAmerican consumers.\n  A seventy three billion dollar drug industry merger has the potential \nto decrease any competition that still exists in the industry. Stock \nprices for the pharmaceutical industry are at an all time high which \nadds to their record profits. The losers for all of this are the \nAmerican consumers who are forced to pay increasingly higher prices for \nprescription drugs.\n  By joining forces, these two drug companies expect a total cost \nsavings of over one billion dollars over three years by spreading the \ncost of developing new drugs, while increasing the sales force needed \nto market old and new products. If this merger deal goes through, I \nwonder if the drug companies would be willing to pass along any of \ntheir one billion dollar savings to the thousands of seniors that I \nhave heard from across South Dakota who cannot afford their monthly \nmedication bills?\n  I ask that a summary of the Families USA study be inserted into the \nRecord following my statement.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Hard to Swallow: Rising Drug Prices for America's Seniors\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       For older Americans, the affordability of prescription \n     drugs has long been a pressing concern. Outpatient \n     prescription drug coverage is one of the last major benefits \n     still excluded from Medicare, and the elderly are the last \n     major insured consumer group without access to prescription \n     drugs as a standard benefit. Although many Medicare \n     beneficiaries have access to supplemental prescription drug \n     coverage, too often that coverage is very expensive and very \n     limited in scope. What is more, such coverage is on the \n     decline. As a result, older Americans--who are by far the \n     greatest consumers of prescription drugs--pay a larger share \n     of drug\n\n[[Page S15074]]\n\n     costs out of their own pockets than do those who are under \n     65. This means the prices of prescription drugs have a \n     greater impact on older Americans than on younger persons.\n       Four years ago, Families USA found that the prices of \n     prescription drugs commonly used by older Americans were \n     rising faster than the rate of inflation. To determine if \n     this trend of steadily increasing prices for prescription \n     drugs has improved, remained the same, or worsened, Families \n     USA gathered information on the prices of the prescription \n     drugs most heavily used by older Americans over the past five \n     years. Using data from the Pennsylvania Pharmaceutical \n     Assistance Contract for the Elderly (PACE) program, we \n     analyzed the prices of the 50 top-selling prescription drugs \n     most heavily used by older persons.\n       Our analysis shows that, in each of the past five years, \n     the prices of the 50 prescription drugs most used by older \n     Americans have increased considerably faster than inflation. \n     While senior citizens generally live on fixed incomes that \n     are adjusted to keep up with the rate of inflation, the cost \n     of the prescription drugs they purchase most frequently has \n     risen at approximately two times the rate of inflation over \n     the past five years and more than four times the rate of \n     inflation in the last year.\n\n\n                                findings\n\n       The prices of the 50 prescription drugs most frequently \n     used by the elderly rose by more than four times the rate of \n     inflation during calendar year 1998. (The data on average \n     drug price increases used in this report weight drug price \n     increases by sales. This means that the average drug price \n     increases reported take into account the market share of each \n     of the 50 top-selling drugs. This is the methodology often \n     used by industry sources.) On average, the prices of these \n     top 50 drugs increased by 6.6 percent from January 1998 to \n     January 1999, though the general rate of inflation in that \n     period was 1.6 percent.\n       From January 1998 to January 1999, of the 50 drugs most \n     commonly used by the elderly:\n       More than two-thirds of these drugs (36 out of 50) rose two \n     or more times faster than the rate of inflation.\n       Nearly half of these drugs (23 out of 50) rose at more than \n     three times the rate of inflation.\n       Over one-third of these drugs (17 out of 50) rose at more \n     than four times the rate of inflation.\n       Among the 50 drugs most frequently used by seniors, the \n     following drugs rose more significantly in price from January \n     1998 to January 1999:\n       Lorazepam (manufactured by Mylan and used to treat \n     conditions such as anxiety, convulsions, and Parkinson's), \n     which rose by over 279.4 percent (more than 179 times the \n     rate of inflation);\n       Furosemide (a diuretic manufactured by Watson that is used \n     to treat conditions such as hypertension and congestive heart \n     failure), which rose by 106.6 percent (more then 68 times the \n     rate of inflation);\n       Lanoxin (manufactured by Glaxo Wellcome and used to treat \n     congestive heart failure), which rose by 15.4 percent (almost \n     10 times the rate of inflation);\n       Xalatan (manufactured by Pharmacia & Upjohn and used to \n     treat glaucoma), which rose by 14.5 percent (more than nine \n     times the rate of inflation); and\n       Atrovent (manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim and used as \n     a respiratory agent in the treatment of asthma, bronchitis, \n     and emphysema), which rose by 14.1 percent (more than nine \n     times the rate of inflation.)\n       Over the five years from January 1994 to January 1999, the \n     prices of the 50 prescription drugs most frequently used by \n     older Americans rose twice as fast as the rate of inflation. \n     On average, the prices of these drugs rose by 25.2 percent--\n     twice the rate of inflation,which was 12.8 percent over that \n     period.\n       Of the 50 drugs most frequently used by older Americans, 39 \n     have been on the market for the five-year period from January \n     1994 to January 1999.\n       The prices of 36 of those 39 drugs increased faster than \n     the rate of inflation over the five-year period.\n       More than two-thirds of those drugs (28 out of 39) rose at \n     least 1.5 times as fast as the rate of inflation over the \n     five-year period.\n       Nearly half of those drugs (19 out of 39) rose at more than \n     two times the rate of inflation over the five-year period.\n       More than one-fourth of those drugs (10 out of 39) rose at \n     least three times the rate of inflation over the five-year \n     period.\n       Of the 39 drugs that were used most frequently be seniors \n     and that were on the market for the period from January 1994 \n     to January 1999, the drugs that rose most significantly in \n     price are:\n       Lorazepam, which rose by over 385 percent (more than 30 \n     times the rate of inflation);\n       Imdur (manufactured by Schering and used to treat angina), \n     which rose by 111 percent (almost nine times the rate of \n     inflation);\n       Furosemide, which rose by 107 percent (more than eight \n     times the rate of inflation);\n       Lanoxin, which rose by 88 percent (almost seven times the \n     rate of inflation); and\n       Klor-Con 10 (manufactured by Upsher-Smith and used as a \n     potassium replacement), which rose by 84 percent (more than \n     six times the rate of inflation).\n       Of the 39 drugs that were used most frequently by seniors \n     and that were on the market for the period from January 1994 \n     to January 1999, 31 increased in price on at least five \n     occasions during those five years. During those years, the \n     following drugs increased in price at least seven times:\n       Imdur, which increased 10 times;\n       Premarin (manufactured by Wyeth-Ayerst and used as an \n     estrogen replacement), which increased eight times;\n       Atrovent, which increased eight times;\n       Pravachol (manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb and used to \n     reduce cholesterol), which increased seven times;\n       Synthroid (manufactured by Knoll and used as a synthetic \n     thyroid agent), which increased seven times; and\n       K-Dur 20 (manufactured by Schering and used as a potassium \n     replacement), which increased seven times.\n       During the last two years, there has been an acceleration \n     in price increases of the drugs most commonly used by \n     seniors. From 1995 to 1996 to 1997, those drug prices rose \n     1.3 and 1.2 times faster, respectively, than the rate of \n     inflation. From 1997 to 1998 and 1998 to 1999, those drug \n     prices rose 1.7 and 4.2 times faster, respectively, than the \n     rate of inflation.\n       The median net profit for manufacturers of the 50 most \n     prescribed drugs for senior citizens was 20.0 percent in \n     1998--4.5 times larger than the median net profit of 4.4 \n     percent for all Fortune 500 companies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15074-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15074-S15077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMERICA'S ROLE IN THE 21ST CENTURY\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to day to draw your attention to \nan informative and thought-provoking foreign policy lecture that our \ncolleague and good friend, Mike DeWine, recently gave in Oxford, Ohio, \nat his alma mater--Miami University. His address was a part of Miami \nUniversity's distinguished Hammond Lecture Series, which first began \nnearly 38 years ago in January 1962. Our esteemed former colleague from \nArizona, Barry Goldwater, presented the first lecture in the Series, \nwhich, incidently, Senator DeWine attended during his first visit to \nthe Miami campus.\n  I draw your attention to Senator DeWine's address because it focuses \non a fundamental question that the American people, the President, and \nwe here in Congress must consider. That question is this: ``What role \nwill the United States play in the world, as we enter the 21st Century? \nIn posing this critical question, Senator DeWine discusses several of \nthe challenges and concerns that our country faces in forming a foreign \npolicy doctrine for the future. I encourage you to take some time to \nread this reasoned, well-grounded piece, and consider the questions it \nraises.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the 1999 \nHammond Lecture, given by Senator Mike DeWine, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n           ``America's Role in the World in the 21st Century\n\n       Dr. Shriver, thank you very much. It is always a daunting \n     task to follow Dr. Shriver. And, for that kind introduction, \n     I thank you. President Garland and members of the Hammond \n     Lecture Series Committee--thank you for inviting me to be \n     with all of you here tonight.\n       Dr. Shriver, my wife Fran, and I started at Miami \n     University on the same day. Dr. Shriver started as President \n     in the Fall of 1965, and Fran and I started as freshmen that \n     same day. We all entered Miami together--Dr. Shriver just \n     stayed here a little longer!\n       Fran and I did spend four very productive years here at \n     Miami. We left with two degrees and two children--two \n     children, by the way, who graduated from Miami and have \n     married Miami graduates. Of our eight children, three--so \n     far--also have graduated from Miami.\n       I am particularly honored to be giving the Dr. W.A. Hammond \n     Lecture this year. As Dr. Shriver said, Dr. Hammond lived in \n     our home county--in Greene County. He was a chemist, an \n     industrialist, a community leader--a person who cared \n     passionately about our history, about government, about \n     politics, and about America.\n       His legacy is not just this lecture series. I see his \n     legacy every time that I'm back home. I see it in the long \n     stretch of land that lies along the Little Miami River--still \n     undeveloped and still beautiful. That's just one of his \n     legacies. I also see it when I go to Xenia and see the \n     Galloway log cabin. He was instrumental in preserving it with \n     his own efforts, his own money and his own ingenuity. So, he \n     has left a legacy for us in our home county and a legacy for \n     our state.\n       As a high school freshman, I came on the Miami University \n     Campus to attend the first W.A. Hammond Lecture. The speaker \n     was then United States Senator Barry Goldwater. It was \n     January 1962. It was a rather interesting day for me, because \n     it was actually not only the first time I saw a United States \n     Senator, but it was also the first time I had seen this \n     wonderful campus.\n       One of the things that I recall from that speech by Senator \n     Goldwater is that I\n\n[[Page S15075]]\n\n     thought the question and answer period was a lot more \n     interesting than the speech. I think it's probably typical of \n     most speeches. The speech was fine, but I thought the \n     questions and answers were particularly interesting. So, I \n     hope tonight to spend a significant period of time with you \n     on comment and questions on whatever topics you want to \n     address\n       As we approach a new millennium, as well as the next \n     presidential election, I think it is appropriate for us to \n     discuss where the United States is going as we enter the next \n     century. What kind of a country do we expect our children, \n     our grandchildren, and our great-grandchildren to live in?\n       When John F. Kennedy was running for President in 1960, he \n     said that the job of a president is to lay before the \n     American people the unfinished business of the country. \n     That's still the job of the President--a job, I think also, \n     of Senators and other leaders.\n       So, I'd like to talk tonight about that unfinished business \n     of this country and particularly the unfinished business of \n     this generation and of the next generation.\n       What are the big challenges and other important things that \n     we have to deal with?\n       We have a crisis in education, particularly in our inner \n     cities, and particularly in Appalachia.\n       We must solve--especially in Ohio--the school funding \n     disparity problem and question.\n       We must, as a country, attract the smartest, the best, and \n     the brightest of our students to the profession of \n     education--the profession of teaching.\n       And, quite candidly, our schools of education must continue \n     to aggressively reexamine how they prepare our teachers for \n     the future.\n       We must do a better job of attracting and encouraging \n     professionals and people with real world experiences to make \n     teaching a second career.\n       The Congress, the President, and the American people must--\n     within the next several years--deal with the Medicare \n     question and deal with the Social Security question. For all \n     of the talk by both the President and the Congress--Democrats \n     and Republicans--about ``saving Social Security'' and \n     ``saving'' this surplus for Social Security, the reality is \n     that Social Security and Medicare cannot be ``saved'' without \n     fundamental reform. All of the surpluses in the world cannot \n     hold back the demographic tidal wave of the baby boom \n     generation as it approaches retirement. Reform--reform, not \n     budget surpluses, will save Social Security.\n       There are certainly other issues that this generation must \n     tackle: health care, medical research, and a subject near and \n     dear to my heart--the crisis in our country's foster care \n     system.\n       However, our topic tonight is foreign affairs and what the \n     U.S. role in the world should be in the 21st Century. So, I \n     will now take a stab at that.\n       When Senator Goldwater addressed Miami in 1961, our nation \n     was in the midst of the Cold War, and certainly no typical \n     American family could go through any day without being \n     touched by that larger, global struggle. It was a time of \n     bomb shelters and of school children crawling under their \n     desks. Young American men and women were sent to all corners \n     of the globe--to places they barely could pronounce, spell, \n     or even find on a map--all in defense against communist \n     expansion. We raced the Soviets to the Moon--and won. The \n     Olympic games were seen as epic struggles to reaffirm the \n     strength of our system.\n       Senator Goldwater devoted the first Hammond Lecture to a \n     discussion of the ideological struggle between democracy and \n     communism. And, as he said on that January night nearly \n     thirty-eight years ago: ``We are fighting an ideology that is \n     dedicated to destroying us. We can win this fight against \n     Communism without firing a shot or dropping a bomb.''\n       Perhaps, to his own surprise, Senator Goldwater lived to \n     see the fulfillment of that prophecy. Ten years ago this \n     week, the most dramatic symbol of the Cold War--the Berlin \n     Wall--fell, and most significantly, not because of some \n     advancing army. It fell because its foundation--communism--\n     could no longer sustain itself.\n       In retrospect, the fall of the Soviet Union was neither a \n     complete defeat for totalitarianism, nor really a complete \n     victory for democracy.\n       The end of the Cold War also did not end the nuclear \n     threat.\n       The world remains today a dangerous and very uncertain \n     place. Although we are experiencing a period of peace and \n     prosperity really not seem in our country since the 1920s, \n     this ``peace'' has not been tranquil. American air and ground \n     forces have been dispatched to places such as Saudi Arabia, \n     Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and Serbia. We've engineered military \n     actions against Iraq and strikes against terrorists in the \n     Sudan and the hills of Afghanistan.\n       We stand on the brink of a nuclear arms and missile race in \n     South and East Asia and the Middle East. And, nationalism has \n     raised the prospect of war in several regions--from Central \n     Europe to the Asian Subcontinent. And, nations in our own \n     hemisphere face threats that could undermine--if not \n     overwhelm--the progress of our movement toward democracy that \n     we successfully achieved in this hemisphere over a decade \n     ago. In sum, we have moved from a Cold War to a Hot Peace.\n       The challenges of global stability did not cease with the \n     end of the Cold War. Peace must be protected, enforced, and \n     advanced with the same vigilance and determination we \n     demonstrated to arrive at this point in our history. As Henry \n     Kissinger observed more than ten years ago: ``History knows \n     no resting places; what does not advance must sooner or later \n     decline.''\n       Since the beginning of the so-called American century, when \n     a Canton, Ohio, resident named William McKinley was re-\n     elected to the presidency, our nation's chief executives have \n     faced the challenge of defining America's role in shaping and \n     responding to world events.\n       The eight Presidents who have led our nation during the \n     Cold War were presented with the opportunity to pronounce, or \n     perhaps characterize, the nature of American foreign policy. \n     During that time, we went from a policy of containment to a \n     policy of detente, and from there to a policy of political \n     containment and military buildup. Now, one may agree or \n     disagree with each of these policies, but there is no dispute \n     that each of these Presidents--from Harry Truman to George \n     Bush--led with a clear vision, or doctrine, if you will, that \n     guided U.S. foreign policy and influenced the shaping of \n     multinational affairs during their terms of office.\n       Unfortunately, our current Administration never seized the \n     opportunity to articulate a clear, thoughtful doctrine, \n     outlining America's role and place in a post-Cold War world.\n       Sadly, history will not record nor remember the Clinton \n     doctrine.\n       Instead of a foreign policy geared toward anticipating and \n     shaping events abroad, we have watched events abroad shape \n     our foreign policy.\n       The future and security of our nation must be--absolutely \n     must be--the dominant theme of the next presidential \n     election. Each candidate has to answer one fundamental \n     question: What should be America's role in this post-Cold War \n     world?\n       The next President--working with Congress, with the \n     American people, and with our global partners--must develop a \n     new bipartisan foreign policy doctrine--a McCain Doctrine, or \n     a Bradley Doctrine, or a Gore Doctrine, or a Hatch Doctrine--\n     a doctrine for this country and for our people--a doctrine to \n     define our role as we move into the next century.\n       To be sure, there is not one right answer to what role we \n     should play. These are very, very difficult questions. The \n     world is a complicated place. There are no easy, simple \n     solutions to any of the conflicts and challenges our world \n     faces. But, one thing is certain: Protecting our national \n     security and promoting our interests abroad will depend on \n     the kind of vision, the kind of leadership, and the kind of \n     foreign policy doctrine that our next President brings to \n     this task.\n       As we enter the 21st Century, our next President must--in a \n     bi-partisan manner--engage Congress and the American people \n     in how best to define and how best to articulate a principled \n     and practical approach to U.S. engagements abroad. This means \n     including the American people in an open, foreign policy \n     dialogue. It means getting their support of U.S. involvements \n     in global struggles. And, finally, it means creating a \n     foreign policy doctrine that is neither a Republican nor a \n     Democrat plan, but is rather ``the American plan.''\n       In so doing, I believe that there are certain fundamental \n     principles that should serve as the basis for defining \n     America's role in foreign affairs. So, tonight, I'd like to \n     spend a few minutes sharing some of my thoughts about what \n     those principles are and how they can affect our U.S. role in \n     the 21st Century world. I do not mean for this to be an \n     exhaustive list, but I believe that our foreign policy must \n     include, at the very least, these principles.\n       And so, I offer them in the spirit of discussion and \n     dialogue--in the spirit of what I expect of the next \n     President. That means that I expect the next President to \n     lead this discussion with the American people, with an \n     understanding that the choices are tough, and many times the \n     choices we are faced with are not good ones. And, while it is \n     tough, unless we start the dialogue--unless we start the \n     discussion--unless we frame it with the sense of where do we \n     go as a country in the post-Cold War era, we are never going \n     to end up where we want to be and where we need to be.\n\n\n                            principle no. 1\n\n       The first, and perhaps most obvious, principle is that the \n     United States must lead. We have to lead in foreign affairs. \n     Our country must be an active, engaged player in the world, \n     striving for solutions that look beyond the short-term. Our \n     credibility in the world community depends on it.\n       Without a clear vision and direction for U.S. foreign \n     policy, our nation will continue on an aimless path. After \n     more than forty years of a bipolar-driven foreign policy, the \n     end of the Cold War put this country at a fundamental foreign \n     policy crossroads. Seven years later, tragically, we are \n     still at that crossroads.\n       A lack of solid U.S. leadership in the area of foreign \n     affairs has not come without cost. Our military has been \n     deployed around the world to its breaking point. Our \n     credibility in the world community certainly has declined. \n     And, the world is even more dangerous and unstable now than \n     during the Cold War.\n       I've noted already some examples of exactly how dangerous \n     the world is today. What's troubling is how little U.S. \n     involvement has done to reduce the dangers that we\n\n[[Page S15076]]\n\n     face. Despite billions in U.S. assistance, Russia's \n     government and economy teeter on the verge of collapse under \n     the weight of rampant crime and rampant corruption. North \n     Korea has become the single largest recipient of U.S. aid in \n     East Asia, but continues to develop nuclear technology and \n     missiles capable of reaching most of the Western United \n     States, and, I might add, also continues to starve its own \n     people. Despite our stern warnings, China and Russia continue \n     to assist rogue nations like Iran and Iraq in their obsessive \n     quests to acquire weapons of mass destruction. All these \n     issues, together, present challenges that require strategic \n     thinking and bi-partisan U.S. leadership.\n       We, as a nation, must take a lead in exporting our \n     democratic values to our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere \n     and to other areas of the world. When the world looks for \n     leadership, it can look to only one place--and that place is \n     the United States. History has put us where we are. If the \n     United States does not lead, there is no one else who can \n     lead--and frankly, no one else who will lead.\n\n\n                            principle no. 2\n\n       The second key principle that I believe should guide our \n     foreign policy in the next century is this: The peace and \n     stability of our own hemisphere must be one of our top \n     priorities. You see, the problems of our hemispheric \n     neighbors are our problems, as well. We, as a nation, stand \n     to lose or gain, depending on the economic health and \n     security of our own neighbors. In other words, a strong, and \n     free, and prosperous hemisphere means a strong, and free, and \n     prosperous United States.\n       Let's look at the example of our neighbors to the south in \n     Latin America. When I was first elected to the U.S. House of \n     Representatives in 1982, Soviet and Cuban influence in Latin \n     America was the dominant issue. Today, the communists have \n     been replaced as a power by the drug dealers. The perverse \n     presence of drug trafficking throughout the region represents \n     a very significant and very real concern--one that puts at \n     risk the stability of our hemisphere.\n       The disintegraing situation in democractic Colombia really \n     illustrates this.\n       No democracy in our hemisphere today faces a greater threat \n     to its own survival than does Colombia. That democratically \n     elected government is embroiled in a bloody, complex, three \n     decade-long civil war against two well-financed, heavily-\n     armed guerrilla insurgency groups--the Revolutionary Armed \n     Forces of Colombia (otherwise known as the FARC) and the \n     National Liberation Army (or ELN). Also involved is a \n     competing band of about 5,000 rutheless paramilitary \n     operatives.\n       The real source of violence and instability in Colombia, \n     though, is the drug traffickers. According to the Colombian \n     Finance Ministry, the Colombian drug trade brings in to \n     Colombia up to $5 billion a year, making it Colombia's top \n     export. To maintain a profitable industry, a significant sum \n     of these drug revenues goes to hire the guerrillas and, \n     increasingly, the paramilitary groups.\n       Just to give you an idea about how the lives of people in \n     Cincinnati, Ohio, and Bogota, Colombia, are closely linked, \n     consider this: When a drug user buys cocaine on a street \n     corner in Cincinnati, or Cleveland, or Chicago, that person \n     is funding violent anti-democratic activity that threatens \n     the lives of innocent Colombians. I have walked through the \n     poppy fields in Colombia with the President of Colombia and \n     have seen--first-hand--how the drug trade is fueling \n     the violence and instability in that country and in the \n     region.\n       The United States has a clear economic interest in the \n     future stability of Colombia. Last year's two-way legal trade \n     between the United States and Colombia was more than $11 \n     billion. In fact, the United States is Colombia's number-one \n     trading partner, and Colombia is the fifth largest market for \n     U.S. exports in the region.\n       I have met with Colombian President Pastrana both in \n     Washington and in Bogota to discuss how our two countries can \n     work together to resolve this deteriorating situation. One \n     way is to invest more in Colombia's drug fighting capability \n     and improve economic opportunities. I have introduced \n     legislation to provide that additional investment. But, this \n     legislation also strengthens the capability of the Colombian \n     government to enforce the law--the rule of law--and provides \n     assistance for human rights training and alternative crop and \n     economic development--two things that are absolutely \n     essential. With this bill, we are investing in making \n     Colombia a stronger, more stable democracy, and a stronger, \n     capable partner in building a hemisphere free from the \n     violence and the decaying influence of drug traffickers and \n     human rights abusers.\n       Stopping the drug trade, though, in Colombia and Latin \n     America is only one way that we can preserve democracy. We \n     must move forward to integrate the entire hemisphere \n     economically. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) \n     is the first and most significant step we've taken in that \n     direction. Recently, the Senate took a positive step toward \n     hemispheric trade liberalization by passing legislation that \n     would extend the benefits of NAFTA to the countries in \n     Central American and the Caribbean.\n       We have to do even more to pursue a hemispheric free trade \n     initiative. Trade integration will occur in this hemisphere, \n     whether or not we are a part of it. It is in our national \n     interest to bring more Latin American countries into \n     bilateral and multilateral trade agreements with the United \n     States. If we fail, others will fill the void. Right now, \n     Europe, Asia, and Canada are consolidating their economic \n     base throughout Latin America. They certainly are not waiting \n     for the United States. They'd prefer us standing on the \n     sidelines. We must not let this happen. The longer we wait, \n     the more we stand to lose.\n\n\n                            principle no. 3\n\n       The third principle that I will offer for discussion \n     tonight is this: Our foreign policy must reinforce and \n     promote our own core values of democracy, free markets, human \n     rights, and the rule of law. I am not at all ashamed to say \n     that our most important export to the international community \n     is our ideals and our ideas. In this country, we are \n     committed to democracy and human rights. We cherish open \n     elections, and we cherish our freedom of speech. We strive to \n     promote free trade and fair trade, so that everyone in our \n     nation has a chance to prosper. We fiercely protect our \n     freedoms, as we should.\n       I believe passionately that every person in the world \n     should have the same opportunity to enjoy these basic \n     democratic values. We have, over the last twenty years, made \n     significant progress in promoting our democratic values \n     abroad. Let's again look at the example of Latin America.\n       In 1981, 16 of the 33 countries in our hemisphere were \n     ruled by authoritarian regimes--either of the left or of the \n     right. Today, all but one of those nations--Cuba--have \n     democratically elected heads of government. They're not \n     perfect. Maybe they don't comply exactly with how we see \n     democracy, but they're all moving in the right direction.\n       The hard, day-to-day work of democracy, however, comes \n     after the elections. It is by no means an easy task to create \n     a democratic society that fosters freedom or expression, \n     where votes matter and human rights are respected. Democracy-\n     building is a slow, often cumbersome process that evolves \n     over time.\n       Key to sustaining democracy and nurturing prosperity in \n     Latin America, or in any developing democracy, requires a \n     commitment to the rule of law. That means providing effective \n     responses to current threats, including corruption, criminal \n     activity, drug trafficking and violence. Police and impartial \n     judiciaries must be in place to fight such threats.\n       If no one enforces the law, no one will uphold the law. \n     And, if that is the case, there will be no jobs, and there \n     will be no economic growth, because there will be no foreign \n     or domestic investment.\n       I have traveled to a number of these countries and what you \n     see in country after country is a struggle for democracy, as \n     the people move from the election process to the tough work \n     of democracy. This is the daunting challenge they face.\n       The daunting challenge, quite candidly, is that, many \n     times, there is not rule of law after election day. People \n     and companies won't investment in these countries. They are \n     afraid to invest--they are afraid to invest, because they \n     don't know if their assets will be protected or if they will \n     be stolen. And, if they are stolen, they don't know if there \n     will be any redress. That kind of uncertainty does not \n     encourage investment.\n       People need to be able to look to the courts, and to the \n     prosecutors, and to the judicial system. When you help that \n     judicial system, you help investment, and you ultimately help \n     create jobs and help people come out of poverty.\n       The same thing is true for farmers--campesinos--in \n     Guatemala, or Honduras, or Nicaragua, or throughout this \n     hemisphere. If they do not believe that they own land--that \n     they can control their land--they won't invest in their land. \n     They won't put anything back into the soil, as farmers must, \n     if they are to prosper.\n       So, again, it goes back to the judicial system--to the rule \n     of law--and to the courts. One of the greatest things our \n     country has the ability to do is send abroad our judicial and \n     rule of law expertise. We've been doing that. And, while I \n     think we have been doing a pretty good job, there is still \n     more we can do.\n       Economies cannot expand and democracies cannot thrive \n     without law enforcement officers and judges committed to law \n     and order. The challenge we face today is that a number of \n     Latin American countries do not have the kind of judiciaries \n     needed to make the rule of law work.\n       Citizens should not fear the police. Law enforcement should \n     be trained to protect the people and to provide stability and \n     tranquility. Many of the emerging democracies have a long, \n     long history of police abusing human rights and of the \n     military abusing human rights. That has to change. And, it \n     can change through our assistance and through our expertise.\n       We already are investing time and money to export our \n     principles of law enforcement to train police in Central \n     America through the International Criminal Investigative \n     Training Assistance Program, known as ICITAP. This is an \n     important program, but it's only half of the law enforcement \n     equation. A well-trained police force means little or nothing \n     if corrupt and incompetent prosecutors and judges cannot \n     prosecute and sentence criminals.\n       It means nothing if a certain elite class of the \n     population--economic, political, ethnic--is above the rule of \n     law and operates in the country with impunity. That has to \n     change in these countries, as well. And, that we can \n     accomplish.\n\n[[Page S15077]]\n\n       The U.S. government already has worked to help strengthen \n     some aspects of the judiciary systems in Latin America and in \n     other places in the world such as Bosnia, but we have a great \n     deal farther to go. If we fail to focus on this matter, we \n     will miss a great opportunity to build on the foundation we \n     worked so hard to establish. Even worse, we put the very \n     foundation, itself, at risk of collapse. One of the great \n     wonders of a free society is that all of its core values--\n     democracy, free markets, rule of law, and human rights--\n     really reinforce the others. To strengthen one strengthens \n     them all.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       As we enter the 21st Century and contemplate our nation's \n     role in the world, we must think about past mistakes, learn \n     from them, and move forward toward a more balanced, \n     principled, bi-partisan foreign policy. In doing so, we \n     should consider these principles, which I have outlined \n     tonight:\n       1. The United States must lead in foreign affairs;\n       2. The peace and stability of our own hemisphere must be \n     one of our top priorities; and\n       3. Our foreign policy must reinforce and promote our own \n     core values of democracy, free markets, human rights, and \n     rule of law.\n       In the global struggle for peace and stability, there is no \n     substitute for strong, effective U.S. leadership. Leadership \n     means foresight. It means thinking ahead. It also means \n     credibility.\n       This week, ten years ago, the Berlin Wall fell, marking the \n     beginning of the end of the Cold War. During this time of \n     remembrance for this anniversary and as we pause, as Dr. \n     Shriver so appropriately pointed out, to pay honor to our \n     veterans, the following words. I think, have significance:\n       ``Ladies and gentleman, the United States stands at this \n     time at the pinnacle of world power. It is a solemn moment \n     for the American democracy. For with this primacy in power is \n     also joined an awe-inspiring accountability to the future. As \n     you look around you, you must feel not only the sense of duty \n     done, but also you must feel anxiety lest you fall below the \n     level of achievement.''\n       Now these words, while they would be a fitting tribute to \n     the resilience of our nation during the Cold War, actually \n     were spoken by Winston Churchill more than fifty years ago at \n     Westminister College in Fulton, Missouri. Although known for \n     its reference to ``the iron curtain,'' Mr. Churchill's now \n     famous speech was actually titled, ``The Sinews of Peace.'' \n     In his typically less than subtle manner, Mr. Churchill was \n     suggesting that times of peace require the same strength of \n     purpose as times of war. He certainly was right.\n       Winston Churchill saw, before many did, what lay ahead for \n     the world. He saw a difficult, uncertain, and volatile peace. \n     He did advise his American allies to pursue an overall \n     strategic concept and outline the methods and resources \n     needed to enforce this strategy. He was calling on America to \n     define its role in a post-World War II world. President Harry \n     Truman, fortunately for us, had the vision and the resolve to \n     accept this challenge and to redefine America's role in \n     foreign affairs.\n       No doubt, Mr. Churchill would offer similar advice today. \n     All of us here do have an ``awe-inspiring accountability to \n     the future.'' The challenges are many, but I believe they can \n     be met. Doing so requires one significant first step: We must \n     develop, as a country, a doctrine that will guide and define \n     our role in the world. If our next President does that--if \n     our next President follows the example of John Kennedy, \n     Dwight Eisenhower, or Harry Truman, we will have a doctrine \n     that will take us into the next century. And, we will have a \n     doctrine that will be consistent with our principles, with \n     our values, and with our vision of the types of world in \n     which we want our children, our grandchildren, and our great-\n     grandchildren to grow up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15077-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15077-S15078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FLORIDA'S ANTI-TOBACCO YOUTH MOVEMENT: THE SWAT TEAM\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have been to the floor many times in the \npast to speak about the expense smoking has cost this great country--\nboth in terms of dollars that the federal and state governments have \npaid for the care of those afflicted with tobacco-related illnesses and \nin terms of lives lost from this dreadful addiction.\n  I have supported state and federal efforts to recoup a portion of \nthese lost dollars from the tobacco industry, as well as their efforts \nto begin education campaigns that would teach all Americans about \ntobacco's harmful effects.\n  And, most importantly, I have worked with my colleagues to ensure \nthat tobacco companies are no longer targeting our youth.\n  Tobacco companies must stop marketing their wares to our most \nvulnerable population, be it through magazine ads that depict smoking \nas the ``cool'' thing to do or through the strategic placement of \nbillboard advertisements near their schools and play areas.\n  Mr. President, I am here today to let this distinguished body know \nthat in Florida our message is being heard.\n  Florida's children are learning about the health hazards that tobacco \nposes, and they are deciding not to smoke.\n  This great news is due, in large part, to the successes of our \ninnovative anti-tobacco pilot program--the ``Truth'' campaign.\n  Funded with the monies awarded in Florida's 1997 tobacco settlement, \nthe ``Truth'' campaign has a very simple mission--to counter the \nmisinformation that our youth hear about smoking.\n  Funded with the monies awarded in Florida's 1997 tobacco settlement, \nthe ``Truth'' campaign has a very simple mission--to counter the \nmisinformation that our youth hear about smoking.\n  Much of this truth-telling is done by students working in what are \nknown as SWAT teams.\n  The Students Working Against Tobacco concept was created in February \n1998.\n  Today, SWAT teams are operating in all 67 counties of Florida, with \nmore than 10,000 members throughout the state.\n  With a goal of reducing teen smoking through youth empowerment, the \nSWAT teams have formed partnerships with their communities and \ndeveloped both marketing and education campaigns to impart the truth \nabout tobacco.\n  Although SWAT teams have been operational for less than two years, \nthey are already making progress in the war against tobacco.\n  Statewide studies are showing that over 95 percent of Florida's youth \nrecognize the ``Truth'' Campaign and know its message to be anti-\ntobacco.\n  Additonally, surveys are showing that teenage smoking has decreased \nsince SWAT's 1998 inception.\n  Tobacco use among high school students has dropped by 8.5 percent, \nand middle schools have seen a dramatic 21 percent decline in student \ntobacco use.\n  This reduction is particularly significant when compared to national \nstatistics showing that states without an anti-tobacco campaign have \nseen an approximately eleven percent rise in tobacco use.\n  Florida's success may be due to SWAT's willingness to employ both \neducation and mass media as means of spreading their message.\n  Ads that are designed by students are played on local television \nstations, informing teens of the perils of tobacco use.\n  Similarly, billboards that the SWAT teams have designed are displayed \nwithin the communities.\n  These are complemented by an education component that is adaptable \nfor all school grades.\n  Health classes provide an opportunity to discuss the impact smoking \nhas upon the body, from halitosis to lung cancer.\n  In reading classes, young children learn to read using books that are \nabout how to stay healthy and smoke-free.\n  Science courses have moved the anti-tobacco campaign into the \ntechnology age, employing CD-Rom programs such as ``Science, Tobacco \nand You,'' an innovative computer program that demonstrates tobacco's \neffects on the body--from first puff to final drag.\n  Students scan their photo into the computer, becoming a virtual \nreality smoker.\n  As the program progresses, students watch their teeth, skin, bones \nand lungs begin to deteriorate.\n  Currently, SWAT teams are strengthening their community outreach and \ngrassroots work.\n  In their current effort, students are working to get tobacco ads \nremoved from magazines that have either one million youth readers or \nover ten percent of total readership under age 18.\n  They are collecting these ads and returning them in bulk to the \ntobacco companies, with a cover letter stating that Big Tobacco needs \nto strengthen their commitment to reducing teen smoking.\n  SWAT teams have offered to meet with industry representatives to \nshare ideas about how this mutual goal might be met.\n  Once again, the SWAT program has achieved success.\n  At their next board meeting, they will be joined by representatives \nfrom Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company to discuss how to better target \ntobacco ad campaigns to adults, not youth.\n\n[[Page S15078]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am very proud of these young people.\n  I am here today to commend them publicly, and to share their \naccomplishments with all of you because they are truly making a \ndifference in the battle against teenage smoking.\n  Florida has encouraged its youth to creatively combat one of the \nforemost problems facing today's teenagers, entrusting them with the \ntools and means to successfully meet their goals.\n  As other areas work towards the development of a youth-based anti-\ntobacco initiative, SWAT will be the model upon which their programs \nwill be based.\n  To the over 10,000 members of SWAT, thank you for your efforts to \neducate Floridians about the dangers of tobacco.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

Mr. President, as it appears unlikely the House and \nSenate conferees will come to agreement this year on a bill to \nreauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, I have sought \nrecognition today to introduce legislation which will provide equitable \ntreatment for families of passengers involved in international aviation \ndisasters. This measure is identical to legislation I introduced in the \n105th Congress, and similar to provisions contained in both the House \nand Senate FAA bills.\n  As my colleagues know, the devastating crash of Trans World Airlines \nFlight 800 on July 17, 1996 took the lives of 230 individuals. Perhaps \nthe community hardest hit by this tragedy was Montoursville, PA, which \nlost 16 students and 5 adult chaperones from Montoursville High School \nwho were participating in a long-awaited French Club trip to France.\n  Last Congress it was brought to my attention by constituents, who \ninclude parents of the Montoursville children lost on TWA 800, that \ntheir ability to seek redress in court is hampered by a 1920 shipping \nlaw known as the Death on the High Seas Act, which was originally \nintended to cover the widows of seafarers, not the relatives of jumbo-\njet passengers embarking on international air travel.\n  Under the Warsaw Convention of 1929, airlines are limited in the \namount they must pay to families of passengers who died on an \ninternational flight. However, domestic air crashes are covered by U.S. \nlaw, which allow for greater damages if negligent conduct is proven in \ncourt.\n  The Warsaw Convention limit on liability can be waived if the \npassengers' families show that there was intentional misconduct which \nled to the crash. This is where the Death on the High Seas Act comes \ninto play. This law states that where the death of a person is caused \nby wrongful act, neglect, or default occurring on the high seas more \nthan 1 marine league which is 3 miles from U.S. shores, a personal \nrepresentative of a decedent can sue for pecuniary loss sustained by \nthe decedent's wife, child, husband, parent, or dependent relative. The \nAct, however, does not allow families of the victims of TWA 800 or \nother aviation incidents such as the Swissair Flight 111 crash and the \nrecent EgyptAir 990 tragedy to obtain other types of damages, such as \nrecovery for loss of society or punitive damages, no matter how great \nthe wrongful act or neglect by an airline or airplane manufacturer.\n  My legislation would amend Federal law to provide that the Death on \nthe High Seas Act shall not affect any remedy existing at common law or \nunder State law with respect to any injury or death arising out of an \naviation incident occurring after January 1, 1995. In effect, it would \nclarify that federal aviation law does not limit remedies in the same \nmanner as maritime law, and permits international flights to be \ngoverned by the same laws as domestic flights.\n  My legislation is not about blaming an airline or airplane \nmanufacturer. It is not about miltimillion dollar damage awards. It is \nabout ensuring access to justice and clarifying the rights of families \nof victims of plane crashes.\n  The need for this legislation is suggested by the Supreme Court \ndecision Zicherman v. Korean Airlines, 116 S. Ct. 629 (1996), in which \na unanimous Court held that the Death on the High Seas Act of 1920 \napplies to determine damages in airline accidents that occur more than \n3 miles from shore. By contrast, the Court has ruled that State tort \nlaw applies to determine damages in accidents that occur in waters 3 \nmiles or less from our shores. Yamaha v. Calhoun, (1996 WL 5518)\n\n  I believe it is inequitable to make such a distinction at the 3 mile \nlimit in civil aviation cases where the underlying statute predates \ninternational air travel. I would note that the Gore Commission on \nAviation Safety and Security noted in its final report that ``certain \nstatutes and international treaties, established over 50 years ago, \nhistorically have not provided equitable treatment for families of \npassengers involved in international aviation disasters. Specifically, \nthe Death on the High Seas Act of 1920 and the Warsaw Convention of \n1929, although designed to aid families of victims of maritime and \naviation disasters, have inhibited the ability of family members of \ninternational aviation disasters from obtaining fair compensation.''\n  I would further note that in an October, 1996 brief filed at the \nDepartment of Transportation by the Air Transport Association, the \ntrade association of U.S. airlines, there is an acknowledgment that the \nSupreme Court in Zicherman did not apparently consider 49 U.S.C. \nSec. 40120(a) and (c), which preserve the application of State and \ncommon law remedies in tort cases and also prohibit the application of \nFederal shipping laws to aviation. My legislation amends 49 U.S.C. \nSec. 40120(c) to clarify that nothing in the Death on the High Seas Act \nrestricts the availability of remedies in suits arising out of aviation \ndisasters.\n  In September, 1998, during consideration of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration authorization bill, I offered a compromise amendment \nwith a limit on damages in order to move ahead to obtain some possible \ncompensation for victims' families beyond pecuniary damages. I did so \nbecause had an amendment to the Death on the High Seas Act been enacted \nwhich would have had unlimited damages, there was the announced intent \nto filibuster the bill. While my amendment was accepted by a voice vote \nin the Senate, the underlying FAA bill was not enacted into law.\n  This year the Senate passed a new FAA reauthorization bill which \nincluded the compromise provision agreed to last year. As the bill \nconferees appear unlikely to reach agreement with the House this year, \nI am re-introducing the original version of my bill because I \nfundamentally oppose any cap on damages and am hopeful that this \nlegislation can be enacted independently of the FAA bill to provide the \nfullest amount of relief to the families of aviation disaster victims.\n  At a time when so many Americans live, work, and travel abroad, \ntaking part in the global economy or seeing the cultural riches of \nforeign lands, they and their families should know that the American \ncivil justice system will be accessible to the fullest extent if the \nunthinkable occurs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and look forward to \nworking with them to ensure its ultimate enactment during the second \nsession of the 106th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. --\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DEATH ON THE HIGH SEAS ACT.\n\n       Section 40120(c) of title 49, United States Code, is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(c) Additional Remedies.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Nothing in this part or the Act entitled \n     `An Act relating to the maintenance of actions for death on \n     the high seas and other navigable waters' approved March 30, \n     1920 (46 U.S.C. App. 761 et seq.), popularly known as the \n     `Death on the High Seas Act,' shall, with respect to any \n     injury or death arising out of any covered aviation incident, \n     affect any remedy--\n       ``(A) under common law; or\n       ``(B) under State law.\n       ``(2) Additional remedies.--Any remedy provided for under \n     this part or the Act referred to in paragraph (1) for an \n     injury or death arising out of any covered aviation incident \n     shall be in addition to any of the remedies described in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1).\n       ``(3) Covered aviation incident defined.--In this \n     subsection, the term `covered aviation incident' means an \n     aviation disaster occurring on or after January 1, 1995.''.\n\n[[Page S15079]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15078-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15078-S15079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DEATH ON THE HIGH SEAS ACT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

In effect, it would \nclarify that federal aviation law does not limit remedies in the same \nmanner as maritime law, and permits international flights to be \ngoverned by the same laws as domestic flights.\n  My legislation is not about blaming an airline or airplane \nmanufacturer. It is not about miltimillion dollar damage awards. It is \nabout ensuring access to justice and clarifying the rights of families \nof victims of plane crashes.\n  The need for this legislation is suggested by the Supreme Court \ndecision Zicherman v. Korean Airlines, 116 S. Ct. 629 (1996), in which \na unanimous Court held that the Death on the High Seas Act of 1920 \napplies to determine damages in airline accidents that occur more than \n3 miles from shore. By contrast, the Court has ruled that State tort \nlaw applies to determine damages in accidents that occur in waters 3 \nmiles or less from our shores. Yamaha v. Calhoun, (1996 WL 5518)\n\n  I believe it is inequitable to make such a distinction at the 3 mile \nlimit in civil aviation cases where the underlying statute predates \ninternational air travel. I would note that the Gore Commission on \nAviation Safety and Security noted in its final report that ``certain \nstatutes and international treaties, established over 50 years ago, \nhistorically have not provided equitable treatment for families of \npassengers involved in international aviation disasters. Specifically, \nthe Death on the High Seas Act of 1920 and the Warsaw Convention of \n1929, although designed to aid families of victims of maritime and \naviation disasters, have inhibited the ability of family members of \ninternational aviation disasters from obtaining fair compensation.''\n  I would further note that in an October, 1996 brief filed at the \nDepartment of Transportation by the Air Transport Association, the \ntrade association of U.S. airlines, there is an acknowledgment that the \nSupreme Court in Zicherman did not apparently consider 49 U.S.C. \nSec. 40120(a) and (c), which preserve the application of State and \ncommon law remedies in tort cases and also prohibit the application of \nFederal shipping laws to aviation. My legislation amends 49 U.S.C. \nSec. 40120(c) to clarify that nothing in the Death on the High Seas Act \nrestricts the availability of remedies in suits arising out of aviation \ndisasters.\n  In September, 1998, during consideration of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration authorization bill, I offered a compromise amendment \nwith a limit on damages in order to move ahead to obtain some possible \ncompensation for victims' families beyond pecuniary damages. I did so \nbecause had an amendment to the Death on the High Seas Act been enacted \nwhich would have had unlimited damages, there was the announced intent \nto filibuster the bill. While my amendment was accepted by a voice vote \nin the Senate, the underlying FAA bill was not enacted into law.\n  This year the Senate passed a new FAA reauthorization bill which \nincluded the compromise provision agreed to last year. As the bill \nconferees appear unlikely to reach agreement with the House this year, \nI am re-introducing the original version of my bill because I \nfundamentally oppose any cap on damages and am hopeful that this \nlegislation can be enacted independently of the FAA bill to provide the \nfullest amount of relief to the families of aviation disaster victims.\n  At a time when so many Americans live, work, and travel abroad, \ntaking part in the global economy or seeing the cultural riches of \nforeign lands, they and their families should know that the American \ncivil justice system will be accessible to the fullest extent if the \nunthinkable occurs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and look forward to \nworking with them to ensure its ultimate enactment during the second \nsession of the 106th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. --\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Abraham, Kyl, \nand Gramm, I am proud to introduce Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 74, \nhonoring the 75th anniversary of the United States Border Patrol.\n  Mr. President, the men and women of the Border Patrol are our \nNation's first line of defense in the war on drugs and illegal \nimmigration. Since 1924, the Border Patrol has guarded some 8,000 miles \nof international boundaries, and has maintained a reputation for \ngetting the job done. The Border Patrol story is one of long hours and \nhard work in defense of our country.\n  The Department of Labor Appropriations Act of 1924 created a Border \nPatrol within the Bureau of Immigration, with an initial force of 450 \nPatrol Inspectors, a yearly budget of $1 million, and a yearly salary \nof $1,300 for each Patrol Inspector, with each patrolman furnishing \ntheir own house.\n  The Border Patrol has grown from that initial force of 450 to more \nthan 8,000 today, located in 146 stations under 21 sectors. The Border \nPatrol's officers have assisted in controlling civil disturbances, \nperforming National security details, aided in foreign training and \nassessments, and responded with security and humanitarian assistance in \nthe aftermath of numerous natural disasters. 86 agents and pilots have \nlost their lives in the line of duty--six in 1998 alone.\n  By far, the Border Patrol's greatest challenge has come along our \nnation's Southwest Border, which is a sieve for illegal drugs and \naliens. Last year, there were 6,359 drug seizures along the Southwest \nBorder by the Border Patrol. These drugs had an estimated street value \nof $2 billion. There were also nearly 5 million illegal crossings.\n  The Border Patrol and the Congress are responding to this challenge, \nproviding funding to hire 1,000 new agents in fiscal year 2000, just as \nwe have for the past two years. I hope that the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service will put these funds to good use, hiring these \ncritical agents, and using other resources Congress has provided to \nimprove the equipment and technology available to the Border Patrol.\n  The United States Border Patrol has the difficult dual mission of \nprotecting our borders and enforcing our immigration laws in a fair and \nhumane manner. They do both very well under difficult conditions.\n  I want to congratulate all who serve with the U.S. Border Patrol on \nthis 75th anniversary and express to them to thanks of a grateful \nnation.\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a \nresolution that commends and remembers events that transpired in Remy, \nFrance as its citizens honored the fallen World War II Army Air Corps \npilot, Lieutenant Houston Braly. This inspiring story happened over \nfifty years ago, but its example of compassion and brotherhood remains \nin our hearts and minds.\n  On August 2, 1944, Lt. Braly's squadron of P-51 fighters on patrol in \nnorthern France encountered a German munitions train. After three \nunsuccessful attack runs at the camouflaged train, Lt. Braly's fire hit \na car carrying explosives, causing a tremendous explosion.\n  Airplanes circling 13,000 feet over the battle were hit by shrapnel \nfrom the train, haystacks in fields some distance away burned, and \nnearly all buildings in the small French town were demolished. A 13th \ncentury church in the town of Remy barely escaped destruction, but its \nhistoric stained-glass windows were shattered.\n  It was this explosion that tragically claimed the life of Lt. Braly \nat only twenty-two years of age.\n  Despite the near total destruction of the small town, the residents \nof Remy regarded that young American as a hero. A young woman pulled \nBraly's body from the burning wreck of the plane, wrapped him in the \nnylon of his parachute, and placed him in the town's courtyard. \nHundreds of villagers left flowers around his body, stunning German \nauthorities.\n  The next morning, German authorities discovered that villagers \ncontinued to pay tribute to the young pilot despite threats of \npunishment. The placement of flowers on Lt. Braly's grave continued \nuntil American forces liberated Remy to the cheers of the townspeople.\n  Almost 50 years later, Steven Lea Vell of Danville, California, \ndiscovered this story in his research. Mr. Lea Vell was so moved by the \nstory that he visited Remy, France, only to find that the stained glass \nwindows of the magnificent 13th century church which were destroyed in \nthe explosion had never been replaced. He contacted members of the \n364th Fighter Group, under which Lt. Braly had served. After hearing \nhow the residents of Remy had honored their fallen friend, veterans \njoined together to form Windows for Remy, a non-profit organization \nthat would raise $200,000 to replace the stained glass windows as a \ngesture of thanks to Remy for its deeds.\n  On Armistice Day, November 11, 1995, fifty years after the war ended, \nthe town of Remy paid tribute once more to Lt. Braly. On that day they \nrenamed the crossroads where he perished to ``Rue de Houston L. Braly, \nJr.''\n  I know that my fellow senators will want to join me in commending the \npeople of Remy for their kindness and recognize the comrades of Lt. \nBraly for their good will.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nresolution be printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            S. CON. RES. --\n\n       Whereas on August 2, 1944, a squadron of P-51s from the \n     United States 364th Fighter Group strafed a German munitions \n     train in Remy, France;\n       Whereas the resulting explosion killed Lieutenant Houston \n     Braly, one of the attacking pilots, and destroyed much of the \n     village of Remy, including 7 stained glass windows in the \n     13th century church;\n       Whereas despite threats of reprisals from the occupying \n     German authorities, the citizens of Remy recovered Lieutenant \n     Braly's body from the wreckage, buried his body with dignity \n     and honor in the church's cemetery, and decorated the grave \n     site daily with fresh flowers;\n       Whereas on Armistice Day, 1995, the village of Remy renamed \n     the crossroads near the site of Lieutenant Braly's death in \n     his honor;\n       Whereas the surviving members of the 364th Fighter Group \n     desire to express their gratitude to the brave citizens of \n     Remy; and\n       Whereas to express their gratitude, the surviving members \n     of the 364th Fighter Group have organized a nonprofit \n     corporation to raise funds through its project ``Windows for \n     Remy'' to restore the church's stained glass windows: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commends the bravery and honor of the citizens of Remy, \n     France, for their actions with respect to the American \n     fighter pilot Lieutenant Houston Braly, during and after \n     August 1944; and\n       (2) recognizes the efforts of the surviving members of the \n     United States 364th Fighter Group to raise funds to restore \n     the stained glass windows of Remy's 13th century church.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15079-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15079-S15080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE WAKPA SICA RECONCILIATION PLACE ACT\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom South Dakota, Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, as a cosponsor \nof the Wakpa Sica Reconciliation Place Act, which will establish the \nWakpa Sica Reconciliation Place in Ft. Pierre, South Dakota. The Wakpa \nSica Reconciliation Place would be an important cultural and \ninterpretive center, in part to compliment the National Lewis and Clark \nTrail, but with the unique perspective of the Sioux tribes and the \nimpact of the Lewis and Clark encounter on tribal culture and \neconomics.\n  During the Lewis and Clark expedition, Captains Merriweather Lewis \nand William Clark anchored their river boats where the Wakpa Sica, or \nBad River, flows into the Missouri. After four months of travel from \nSt. Louis, history was made on September 24, 1804. The next day 44 men \nlanded on the west bank of the Missouri and paraded under the United \nStates flag.\n  These men then joined Chief Black Buffalo and braves from the Teton \nSioux for council in the chief's buffalo skin lodge. This was a key and \npivotal meeting between representatives of the great Sioux tribes and \nthose of the United States of America. This meeting was less than \namicable.\n  Throughout the rest of South Dakotas history the relationship between \nnative peoples and non-natives has not been a peaceful one. Today we \nare still facing the challenging experience of working and living \ntogether side by side. I am proud of the South Dakotans\n\n[[Page S15080]]\n\nwho set their differences aside and came together and created the Mni \nWiconi water project. There is a growing need for a Reconciliation \nPlace.\n  The Reconciliation Place would occupy the site in which Captains \nLewis and Clark, and the members of the tribes came together to meet \nfor the first time--which is a fitting site to bring Indian and non-\nIndian peoples together. It is my hope that this center will bring \npeople together to learn about the culture and the rich history this \narea of the United States holds. Through this understanding, it is my \nhope that we may be able to achieve better relations between Tribal and \nnon-Tribal peoples.\n  This project is a cultural center which will serve as a home for \nSioux law, history, culture and arts for the Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota \npeoples. It will also serve as a repository for Sioux historical \ndocuments, which are currently scattered throughout the West. Many \nnative people do not have access to these documents. With the \nconstruction of this facility the native people will be able to house \nthese documents close to home. This will allow interested parties to \nresearch their rich past.\n  The Reconciliation Place will also be the home of the Sioux Nation \nSupreme Court. This will serve to be a stable legal setting to assist \nin achieving greater social and economic welfare in Indian Country. \nIncreased legal stability will help promote business investment in the \nvast human resources that are situated on the reservations in my state. \nThis will bring about more self sufficiency, and less reliance by \ntribes on the federal government. Similarly, the Native American \nEconomic Development Council will be located in this same facility. \nThis council will assist tribes and tribal members to provide \nopportunities for economic development. The council will assist in \nopening the doors to private investment and other resources that are \ndesigned to promote development and job creation.\n  Mr. President, this focal point for Native American culture, law, and \neconomic development assistance is desperately needed. It is apparent \nthat there is a need to strengthen current, and build future \nunderstanding between Indian and non-Indian peoples, as well as promote \nthe government-to-government relationship between the tribes and the \nUnited States. I urge my colleagues to join myself and Senator Daschle \nto support this legislation, and recognize the need for such an \nimportant center. I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a \ncosponsor of the Wakpa Sica Reconciliation Place Act, and that my \nstatement be included in the Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15080-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND ENFORCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has approved \nthe Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act, which Senator DeWine \nand I recently introduced in the Senate. Our bipartisan legislation \nbuilds on the successful passage into law of the Crime Identification \nTechnology Act of 1998, which Senator DeWine and I sponsored in the \nlast Congress. Our bill also complements S. 249, the Missing, Exploited \nand Runaway Children Protection Act, which Senator Hatch and I worked \ntogether to steer to final passage just last month.\n  Unfortunately, the number of abused or neglected children in this \ncountry nearly doubled between 1986 and 1993. Each day there are 9,000 \nreports of child abuse in America and more than three million cases \nannually of abused or neglected children. In my home state of Vermont, \n2,309 children were reported to child protective services for child \nabuse or neglect investigations in 1997, the last year data is \navailable. After investigation, 1,041 of these reports found \nsubstantiated cases of child maltreatment in Vermont.\n  Each child behind these statistics is an American tragedy.\n  But we can help. The Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act \nprovides these abused or neglected children with the Federal assistance \nthat they deserve. And our legislation can make a real difference in \nthe lives of our nation's children without any additional cost to \ntaxpayers.\n  Our bipartisan legislation will make a difference by giving State and \nlocal officials the flexibility to use existing Department of Justice \ngrant programs to prevent child abuse and neglect, investigate child \nabuse and neglect crimes and protect children who have suffered from \nabuse and neglect. The bill does this by making three changes to \ncurrent law.\n  First, the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act amends the \nCrime Identification Technology Act of 1998 to make grant dollars \navailable specifically to enhance the capability of criminal history \ninformation to agencies and workers for child welfare, child abuse and \nadoption purposes. Congress has authorized $250 million annually for \ngrants under the Crime Identification Technology Act.\n  Second, the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act amends the \nByrne Grant Program to permit funds to be used for enforcing child \nabuse and neglect laws, including laws protecting against child sexual \nabuse, and promoting programs designed to prevent child abuse and \nneglect. Congress has traditionally funded the Byrne Grant Program at \nabout $500 million a year.\n  Third, the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act doubles the \navailable funds, from $10 million to $20 million, for grants to each \nState for child abuse treatment and prevention from the Crime Victims \nFund. This fund is financed through the collection of criminal fines, \npenalties and other assessments against persons convicted of crimes \nagainst the United States. In the 1998 fiscal year, the Crime Victims \nFund held $363 million. To ensure that other crime victim programs \nsupport by the Fund are not reduced, the expansion of the child abuse \ntreatment and prevention earmark applies only when the Fund exceeds \n$363 million in a fiscal year. This year, the Crime Victims Fund is \nexpected to collect more than $1 billion due in part to large anti-\ntrust penalties.\n  Despite the tireless efforts of concerned Vermonters, including the \nmany dedicated workers and volunteers at Prevent Child Abuse in Vermont \nand the Vermont Department of Social and Rehabilitative Services, \nVermont is below the national average for its ability to provide \nservices to abused or neglected children. In 1997, 411 children found \nto be abused or neglected received no services, about 40 percent of \ninvestigated cases. Nationally, about 25 percent of all abused or \nneglected children received no services. Our legislation provides more \nresources to help Vermonters and other Americans provide services to \nall abused or neglected children.\n  I want to thank the many advocates who support our bill and the \ncompanion legislation introduced by Representatives Pryce and Tubbs \nJones, H.R. 764, which passed the House of Representatives by a vote of \n425-2 on October 5, 1999. These advocates include the diverse National \nChild Abuse Coalition: ACTION for Child Protection; Alliance for \nChildren and Families; American Academy of Pediatrics; American Bar \nAssociation; American Dental Association; American Professional Society \non the Abuse of Children; American Prosecutors Research Institute; \nAmerican Psychological Association; Association of Junior Leagues \nInternational; Boy Scouts of America; Child Welfare League of America; \nChildhelp USA; Children's Defense Fund; General Federation of Women's \nClub; National Alliance of Children's Trust and Prevention Funds; \nNational Association of Child Advocates; National Association of \nCounsel for Children; National Association of Social Workers; National \nChildren's Alliance; National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse; \nNational Council of Jewish Women; National Court Appointed Special \nAdvocates Association; National Education Association; National \nExchange Club Foundation for Prevention of Child Abuse; National \nNetwork for Youth; National PTA; Parents Anonymous; and Parents United. \nIn addition, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and \nPrevent Child Abuse America have endorsed our bill and its House \ncounterpart.\n  I look forward to the House of Representatives passing the Child \nAbuse Prevention and Enforcement Act for the sake of our nation's \nchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15080-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15080-S15081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATOR BYRD'S 82ND BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today on a personal note. I had\n\n[[Page S15081]]\n\nplanned to make these remarks as we passed the midnight milestone on \nour way to cloture on the appropriations bill, because, as the clock \nstrikes twelve, and November 20 begins, my Committee colleague, our \nRanking Member, Robert C. Byrd will celebrate a birthday. I wish my \ncolleague a happy and productive 82nd year.\n  Senator Byrd has a wonderful and widely quoted sign up on his office \nwall: ``There are four things people in West Virginia believe: God \nAlmighty, Sears Roebuck, Carter's Little Liver Pills, and Robert C. \nByrd.'' I'd like to take a little literary license to suggest that \nthere are four things that Robert C. Byrd believes in: God Almighty, \nhis 62 year long love affair with his wife, Erma, his constituents and \nthe Senate.\n  And, Senator Byrd is not just your run of the mill believer. I have \nlistened many times to the wisdom and intensity of his words, words \nwhich flow from a faith that runs as deep as his West Virginia roots, \nas deep as the coal mines which seam the earth of Appalachia. His words \nare what have led many to see Senator Byrd as the faithful historian \nand effective guardian of the precedents and privileges, of the rules \nand Constitutional role of the United States Senate. But, Senator Byrd \nis more than an institutional advocate, he is a living history of the \nSenate and democracy. The Senator from West Virginia gives a clear \nvoice both to our finest traditions and what he sees as his life long \npurpose, serving what he so nobly refers to as ``my people.'' His \nreverence and respect for the Senate are surpassed by the deep regard \nand abiding passion he has for the needs of his constituents.\n  He speaks of those needs virtually every week. Senator Byrd breathes \nlife into images of each West Virginian he introduces to us in remarks \non the floor--even those who have passed from the scene. When he \ndescribes a man who dies in a slate fall while mining West Virginia's \ncoal, he speaks softly of a man, alone, who died in the dark. The \nilluminating power of this image flows from the passion of his \ncommitment.\n  It is his commitment which crosses partisan lines and has earned \nSenator Byrd legendary respect. In the last week, I have been \nprivileged to experience this commitment while working with him to \nprotect our coal miner's from the predatory reach of an overbearing \njudge.\n  As Senator Byrd begins another year and the Senate another session, I \nwill look forward to continuing our work together, succeeding in \nreversing the devastating consequences of a bad decision, and serving \nwell our constituents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15081-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HONORING NOTAH BEGAY III AN INSPIRATION FOR ALL AMERICANS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in celebration of American Indian \nHeritage Month I rise today to celebrate the accomplishments of one \nremarkable young man Notah Begay III. You may have heard of Mr. Begay \nas he was a two-time PGA tour winner this season with victories at the \nReno-Tahoe Open and the Michelob Championship. This is a true \naccomplishment by any standard, but even more significant when you \nconsider that he is only 27. I rise today to honor Mr. Begay because of \nthe fact that he is the first full-blooded Native American to play on \nthe Professional Golf Association Tour.\n  Notah's path to success is uncommon among his peers in the PGA. He \ndidn't grow up in a privileged environment. While the Begay family was \nnot poor, they did not have the resources to pay for costly private \ngolf lessons for young Notah. In exchange for golf balls and practice \ntime, Notah often woke up at 5:00 AM to move carts, wash range balls \nand serve as an all-around gopher at the city-owned course in \nAlbuquerque. And when Notah visited his grandparents on the Navajo \nReservation, the determined young golfer would hit golf balls off of \nthe hard clay dirt of the reservation. Still today, the Navajo Nation \ndoes not have one golf course on its 25,000 square miles.\n  Despite his uncommon beginnings, Notah has been truly successful at \nevery level of competition. During high school, Notah led his high \nschool basketball team to back-to-back state championships. But more \nimpressive, he was the No. 2 junior golfer in the nation.\n  After high school, Notah traveled west to Stanford University. \nAlthough Notah's teammate, Tiger Woods, is often spotlighted by the \nmedia, it was Notah and his Stanford teammates who won the 1994 NCAA \nChampionship trophy, one year before Mr. Woods joined the team. Notah \nplayed an integral role by shooting a 62 in the second round of the \nChampionship tournament, a tournament record that remains today. And \nwhile many great college athletes do not finish their studies, I am \nvery proud to say that Notah is a fellow graduate of Stanford, earning \na degree in economics.\n  Notah turned pro after college and has been quickly rising in the PGA \nranks. At the Nike Dominion Open this year he became only the third \nplayer in history to shoot a 59 on a U.S. pro tour. He joins Al \nGeiberger and Chip Beck as the only players to score such a feat. \nBecause of his outstanding success this year, Notah is a candidate for \ntop rookie honors.\n  Notah has dedicated himself to providing new opportunities for young \nNative Americans. By working to raise money to establish golf programs \nat reservation schools and seeking donations of golf equipment for kids \nwho could never afford the costly clubs, Notah is providing the tools \nthat may lead to more great golfers with Native American roots.\n  In some ways, Notah Begay's success is not surprising. He is half \nNavajo and half Pueblo Indian and he follows a tradition of courage and \nstrength, exemplified by his grandfather. Notah's grandfather, Notah \nBegay I, was one of the famous Code Talkers during World War II. The \nCode Talkers relayed sensitive information for the United States \nmilitary through a code based on the Navajo language. They proved to be \na critical component of the military intelligence during World War II.\n  Notah's unprecedented success has shown a generation of young \nAmericans that with hard work and dedication, any dream is achievable. \nThe success Notah has earned is equal only to the inspiration he \nprovides for Native American youth in my home state of New Mexico and \nacross the country. I commend him not only for his golf success, but \nalso for his commitment to the youth of New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15081-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15081-S15082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EAST TIMOR\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about a piece \nof legislation that is not moving this year. I want to speak about it \nbecause it deals with an extremely important topic, one that has not \nreceived the attention and commitment that it deserves from this body.\n  That topic is the appropriate state of U.S.-Indonesian relations \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I introduced S. 1568, the East Timor Self-\nDetermination Act of 1999, on September 8--well over two months ago. \nThat legislation, which passed the Foreign Relations Committee on \nSeptember 27 by an overwhelming vote of 17-1, was cosponsored by the \nChairman of that Committee as well as many other Members of the Senate.\n  I took that action, in cooperation with my colleagues, because events \nin East and West Timor demanded it.\n  On August 30, well over 99% of registered voters in East Timor \ncourageously came to the polls to express their will regarding the \npolitical status of that territory.\n  More than 78% of those voters marked their ballot in favor of \nindependence.\n  But weeks of violence immediately followed the vote, as the \nIndonesian military--a military that our country has long supported--\ncolluded with militia groups in waging a scorched earth campaign \nagainst the East Timorese people and their democratic aspirations \nthroughout the territory.\n  Hundreds of thousands of people were forced to flee, and many were \nkilled.\n  But for the East Timorese run out of their homes in the fray, the \nnightmare did not end there.\n  There seems to be a perception out there that all is well in \nIndonesia today, and that the East Timor crisis is over. Unfortunately, \nthat is simply not true.\n  Last week, the Associated Press reported on the public comments of \nthe spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. \nThe\n\n[[Page S15082]]\n\nspokesman said that many East Timorese are being forced at gunpoint to \nremain in camps that lack food, sanitation and medical care. He said, \nand this is a direct quote, that ``the moment an East Timorese \nexpresses a desire to leave the camps and go home their life is in \ndanger.'' And the UNHCR spokesperson noted, in last week's AP report, \nthat many relief organizations have received reports of refugees being \nraped and beaten by militiamen.\n  Mr. President, to this day, militia members harass and intimidate \nEast Timorese in West Timor's refugee camps. Only about 56,000 refugees \nhave returned home to East Timor. Approximately two hundred thousand \nremain, in many cases against their will, in the refugee camps of West \nTimor.\n  To this day, humanitarian organizations do not have the access that \nthey need to all of the refugee camps to which East Timorese fled.\n  Throughout all of this pain, throughout the destruction of lives and \nproperty, throughout this brutal retaliation for courageous acts of \ndemocratic expression, this Senate has been silent. We have had no \nfloor debate and no vote. My original bill, despite being voted out of \ncommittee with only one dissenting vote, has languished on the calendar \nfor weeks.\n  In response to that silence, Mr. President, I negotiated an \narrangement to introduce an amendment to the bankruptcy bill addressing \nthis issue. Squeezing this important topic into the middle of a debate \non an unrelated bill was certainly not the most desirable approach, but \nI was determined to pursue this legislation.\n  The amendment I had planned to offer was considerably different from \nmy original bill. I made significant alterations to it in order to \nrespond to changing events and the concerns of other Senators and the \nAdministration.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to pursue this legislation to encourage \ndemocracy and accountability in Indonesia, and to hold out clear \nincentives for a policy of accountability and cooperation. And I wanted \nto hold this Administration to its word, ensuring that passing \npolitical whims do not soften America's rejection of the kind of \nmethods that the Indonesian military used in East Timor.\n  The amendment would have reached out to the Indonesian government, \ncelebrating its democratic transition and recognizing its economic \nneeds, while keeping the pressure on elements in Indonesia that are \nmoving in the opposite direction--elements moving away from democracy, \nreform, and accountability and moving toward repression, violence, and \nimpunity.\n  With its clear message and incentives, this amendment would have set \nthe stage for a responsible and strong partnership between the U.S. and \nIndonesia.\n  Mr. President, it concerns me that the Administration has behaved as \nthough they wish this legislation would just go away, although it is a \ncodification of their own policy.\n  The Administration has told me that they desire more flexibility--\nparticularly with regard to licensing defense related articles for \nexport to Indonesia--than this amendment would allow.\n  Despite the fact that I worked closely and carefully with the State \nDepartment to develop a reasonable list of conditions that must be met \nin order to re-establish miliary and security relations, in the end, \nthe Administration did not want to be pinned down to any standards at \nall.\n  Mr. President, I will speak frankly. The Administration's \nunwillingness to commit to a responsible policy and to a solid series \nof prerequisites for resuming military and security ties concerns me, \nand convinces me that vigilance will be necessary in the months ahead.\n  And so Mr. President, while I foresee no opportunity to move this \nlegislation this year, I want to remind this Senate and this \nAdministration that my amendment will remain in order when we return to \nthe bankruptcy bill, and I am prepared to take up this issue again in \nJanuary, or at any other time the circumstances warrant it.\n  I will continue to be certain that this Senate has a voice in the \nfuture of U.S.-Indonesian relations. I will continue to push for \naccountability for the abuses perpetrated by the Indonesian military \nand militia groups. And I will continue to insist that U.S. engagement \nwith the Indonesian miliary is contingent upon an end to the harassment \nand intimidation of East Timorese refugees with impunity.\n  I pledge to my colleagues and to this Administration that I will \nmonitor this matter, and monitor it closely in the weeks and months \nahead. I will stand by, ready with several versions of my legislation, \nshould the Indonesian military fail to take the steps toward reform and \naccountability that are absolutely essential prerequisites to a \nmilitary and security relationship with the United States.\n  And make no mistake, I will come to the floor again and again should \nthis Administration appear ready to engage with and support an \nIndonesian military that has not seriously lived up to its own \ncommitment to respect the rights of ordinary East Timorese civilians \nwho seek only to live their lives in peace and security.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15082-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15082-S15084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BIENNIAL BUDGETING\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yesterday (November 18), House Rules Committee Chairman \nDavid Dreier introduced H. Res. 396, a resolution expressing the sense \nof the House that biennial budgeting legislation should be enacted in \nthe second session of the 106th Congress.\n  Notably, this resolution has 245 cosponsors, significantly more than \na majority of that body. Those sponsors include the entire House \nRepublican leadership, 25 members of the House Appropriations \nCommittee, including the Chairman, and 45 Democrats.\n  Critics of biennial budgeting often point to lack of support in the \nHouse as a reason why the proposal will never be adopted. That hurdle \nseems now to have been swept away, as significantly more than a \nmajority of the House has been convinced by the inescapable logic and \nnumerous advantages of a biennial budget process.\n  This year, we have yet again been faced with a numbing repetition of \nthe all-too-familiar appropriations end game. Annual appropriations \nhave been stalled because of a handful of controversial policy and \nfunding issues.\n  While the vast bulk of appropriations are routine and are funded from \nyear to year with only incremental change, they nonetheless are held \nhostage to these controversial and often unrelated budget and policy \ndebates. This is unnecessary and counterproductive.\n  A biennial budget process would restore the integrity and \neffectiveness of the appropriations process, would reinvigorate the \ntradition of separate Congressional authorization and oversight, and \nwould give Federal departments and agencies badly needed time to carry \nout and evaluate Federal programs more effectively.\n  Many Senators of both parties have long acknowledged the need for a \nbiennial budget process. A majority of House members now concurs. Both \nPresident Clinton and Vice-President Gore support biennial budgeting, \nand recently Governor George W. Bush voice strong support for the idea.\n  All sides now agree that biennial budgeting is the right thing to do. \nNow is time to go forward. We have studied, talked, and debated enough. \nLet's now resolve to act on this important bill as soon as possible \nwhen we return from the congressional adjournment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take just a few minutes in \nthese final hours of the First Session of the 106th Congress to comment \non several legislative initiatives I authored this year, and which I am \npleased to say have either passed or were substantially incorporated \ninto other bills that were approved and will be sent to the President.\n  One of the most important issues for my state of Utah is the \nRadiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) Amendments of 1999, S. 1515, \nwhich I introduced earlier. I am delighted that the Senate passed this \nimportant legislation earlier today.\n  This bill will guarantee that our government provides fair \ncompensation to the thousands of individuals adversely affected by the \nmining of uranium and from fallout during the testing of nuclear \nweapons in the early post-war years.\n  Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell; the distinguished Senate Minority \nLeader, Senator Tom Daschle; Senator Jeff Bingaman; and Senator Pete\n\n[[Page S15083]]\n\nDomenici all joined me in introducing this legislation, and I \nappreciate their support.\n  In 1990, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (42 U.S.C. 2210) was \nenacted in law. RECA, which I was proud to sponsor, required the \nfederal government to compensate those who were harmed by the \nradioactive fallout from atomic testing. Administered through the \nDepartment of Justice, RECA has been responsible for compensating \napproximately 6,000 individuals for their injuries. Since the passage \nof the 1990 law, I have been continuously monitoring the implementation \nof the RECA program.\n  Quite candidly, I have been disturbed over numerous reports from my \nUtah constituents about the difficulty they have encountered when they \nhave attempted to file claims with the Department of Justice. I \nintroduced S. 1515 in response to their concerns.\n  This bill honors our nation's commitment to the thousands of \nindividuals who were victims of radiation exposure while supporting our \ncountry's national defense. I believe we have an obligation to care for \nthose who were injured, especially since, at the time, they were not \nadequately warned about the potential health hazards involved with \ntheir work.\n  Another issue which many of my constituents contacted me about over \nthe past year was the Medicare provisions contained in the 1997 \nBalanced Budget Act (BBA) and the impact of these provisions on health \ncare providers and Medicare beneficiaries.\n  I am pleased that the House has given its approval to the Medicare, \nMedicaid, and CHIP Adjustment Act of 1999 which is now ready for Senate \nconsideration and passage today.\n  This important measure will help to ensure that Medicare \nbeneficiaries can continue to receive high-quality, accessible health \ncare.\n  Overall, the bill increases payments for nursing homes, hospitals, \nhome health agencies, managed care plans, and other Medicare providers. \nIt will also increase payments for rehabilitative therapy services, and \nlonger coverage of immunosuppresive drugs.\n  Over $27 billion in legislative restorations are contained in this \npackage for the next 10 years.\n  Clearly we now know that there were unintended consequences as a \nresult of the reimbursement provisions contained in the BBA. Many of \nthe changes provided for in the BBA resulted in far more severe \nreductions in spending tham we projected in 1997. As a result, skilled \nnursing facilities, home health agencies and hospitals have been \nparticularly hard hit from these changes in the Medicare law.\n  In 1997, Medicare was in a serious financial condition and was \nprojected to go bankrupt in the year 2001. The changes we made in 1997 \nsaved Medicare from financial insolvency and have resulted in extending \nthe program's solvency until 2015.\n  Nevertheless, the reductions we enacted in 1997 created a serious \nsituation for many health care providers who simply are not being \nadequately reimbursed for the level and quality of care they were \nproviding.\n  This situation is particularly evident in the nursing home industry. \nMany skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, are now facing bankruptcy \nbecause the current prospective payment system, which was enacted as \npart of the BBA, does not adequately compensate for the costs of care \nto medically complex patients.\n  As a result, I introduced the Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality \nNursing Home Care Act of 1999, S. 1500, which was designed to provide \nimmediate financial relief to nursing homes who care for medically \ncomplex patients.\n  The Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, was the \nprincipal cosponsor of this important legislation. And I would like to \ntake this opportunity now to thank him for the extraordinary effort he \nmade in helping to have major provisions of our bill incorporated into \nthe final conference agreement on the BBA Restorations bill.\n  Moreover, I want to thank the other 44 Senators who cosponsored S. \n1500 and who lent their support in helping to move this issue to \nconference.\n  This is an important victory for Medicare beneficiaries who depend on \nnursing home care. As we have seen over the past several years, those \nbeneficiaries with medically complex conditions were having difficulty \nin gaining access to nursing home facilities, or SNFs, because many \nSNFs simply did not want to accept these patients due to the low \nreimbursement levels paid by Medicare.\n  The current prospective payment system is flawed. It does not \naccurately account for the costs of these patients with complex \nconditions. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has \nacknowledged that the system needs to be corrected.\n  Under the provisions of the BBA Restoration bill we are passing \ntoday, reimbursement rates are increased by 20% for 15 payment \ncategories, or the Resource Utilization Groups--RUGs--beginning in \nApril 2000. These increases are temporary until HCFA has fine-tuned the \nPPS and made adjustments to reflect a more accurate cost for these \npayment categories.\n  Moreover, after the temporary increases have expired, all payment \ncategories will be increased by 4% in fiscal year 2001 and 2002.\n  These provisions will provide immediate increases of $1.4 billion to \nnursing home facilities to care for these high-cost patients.\n  In addition, the bill also gives nursing homes the option to elect to \nbe paid at the full federal rate for SNF PPS which will provide an \nadditional $700 million to the nursing community.\n  I would also add that I am pleased the conference report includes a \nprovision to provide a two-year moratorium on the physical/speech \ntherapy and occupational therapy caps that were enacted as part of the \nBBA. As we all well know, these arbitrary caps have resulted in \nconsiderable pain and difficulty for thousands of Medicare \nbeneficiaries who have met and exceeded the therapy caps.\n  I joined my colleague and good friend, Senator Grassley, as a \ncosponsor of this important legislation, and I want to commend him for \nhis leadership in getting this bill incorporated into the final BBA \nRestoration conference report.\n  There are many other important features of this bill that are \nincluded in the conference report agreement and, clearly, these \nprovisions will do a great deal to health restore needed Medicare \nfunding to providers. Overall, $2.7 billion is restored to SNFs under \nthis legislation.\n  The bottomline is all of this is ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries \nhave access to quality health care. We need to keep that promise and I \nbelieve we have done that through the passage of this legislation \ntoday.\n  With respect to other providers, I would briefly add that the bill \ncontains funding for home health agencies as well. The bill will ease \nthe administrative requirements on home health agencies as well as \ndelay the 15 percent reduction in reimbursement rate for one year. This \nreduction was to have taken effect on October 2000 but will now be \ndelayed for one year until October 1, 2001.\n  I have worked very closely with my home health agencies in my state \nwho were extremely concerned over the impact of the 15% reduction next \nyear. I am pleased to tell them that we have addressed their concerns \nby delaying this reduction for another year. I think this time will \ngive us an opportunity to focus on this provision to determine what \nother adjustments, if any, may be required in the future.\n  Overall, the bill adds $1.3 billion back into the home health care \ncomponent of Medicare.\n  So I believe we have taken some significant steps to ensure that home \nhealth care agencies will be able to operate without the threat of \nincreased Medicare reductions on their bottomline.\n  We have also taken steps to help hospitals and teaching hospitals \nwith over $7 billion in Medicare restorations. These increases will \nhelp to smooth the transition to the PPS for outpatient services--an \nissue that was brought to my attention by practically every hospital \nadministrator in my state.\n  On the separate, but equally important issue of children's graduate \nmedical education funding, I am especially pleased that the House has \npassed legislation that will authorize, for the first time, a new \nprogram to provide children's hospitals with direct and indirect \ngraduate medical education funding.\n\n[[Page S15084]]\n\n  Independent children's hospitals, including Primary Children's \nHospital in Salt Lake City, receive very little Medicare graduate \nmedical education funding (GME). This is because they treat very few \nMedicare patients, only children with end stage renal disease, and thus \ndo not benefit from federal GME support through Medicare.\n  I cosponsored this legislation in the Senate which passed earlier \nthis year. The measure has now cleared the House and will soon be sent \nto the President who is expected to sign the measure into law very \nsoon.\n  Moreover, $40 million is contained in the appropriation's bill that \nwill serve as an excellent foundation on which to provide assistance to \nchildren's hospitals.\n  I am also pleased that provisions from S. 1626, the Medicare Patient \nAccess to Technology Act, were included in the BBA Restoration measure.\n  These important provisions guarantee senior citizens access to the \nbest medical technology and pharmaceuticals. Currently, Medicare \nbeneficiaries do not always have access to the most innovative \ntreatments because Medicare reimbursement rates are inadequate. And I \njust don't think that it's fair to older Americans. My provisions \ncontained in the restoration bill change this by allowing more \nreasonable Medicare reimbursements for these therapies.\n  Take, John Rapp, my constituent from Salt Lake City, Utah. Mr. Rapp, \nwho is 71 years old, was diagnosed with prostate cancer last May. He \nwas presented with a series of treatment options and decided to have \nBRACHY therapy because it was minimally invasive, he could receive it \nas an outpatient and it had fewer complications than radical surgery.\n  This new innovative therapy implants radioactive seeds in the \nprostate gland in order to kill cancer cells. The success rate of this \ntherapy has been overwhelming.\n  So, what's the problem? Without my legislation, services such as \nBRACHY therapy would not be available in the hospital outpatient \nsetting to future Medicare patients due to the way the outpatient \nprospective payment system is being designed. Life saving services such \nas BRACHY therapy would be reimbursed at significantly lower-\nreimbursement rates, from approximately about $10,000 to $1500, and, \ntherefore, it would not be cost-effective for hospitals to offer this \nservice. Fortunately, the provisions included in the omnibus spending \nbill change all of that--innovative treatments, such as BRACHY therapy, \nwill now be available to future prostate cancer patients.\n  We must get the newest technology, to seniors as quickly as possible. \nGovernment bureaucracy should not stand in the way of seniors receiving \nthe best care available. We must put Medicare patients first, not \ngovernment bureaucracy. That is why my legislation is necessary and I \nam so pleased that it was included in the Medicare package.\n  Finally, I am pleased that this package also addressed the serious \nconcerns of the community health centers. The community health centers \ncommunity came to us because there were concerns about the financial \nhardship that the Balanced Budget Act would have imposed on these \nhealth centers and their patients. I worked hard with Finance Committee \nChairman Roth, Senator Grassley, and Senator Baucus to resolve this \nimportant issue. I believe that the conference committee came up with a \ngood solution, however, I intend to monitor this situation closely over \nthe next couple of years.\n  Mr. President, there are numerous other provisions in this \nrestoration package that I will not take the time to comment on now, \nbut they are equally important. I want to commend the leadership in the \nSenate and House for working to put together this important measure \nthat will clearly help millions of Medicare beneficiaries throughout \nthe country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15084-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE DAKOTA WATER RESOURCES ACT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important piece \nof legislation for my State of North Dakota. S. 623, the Dakota Water \nResources Act, is legislation I introduced in the last Congress and \nearly in this Congress to re-direct the existing Garrison Diversion \nproject. This bill is designed to meet the contemporary water needs of \nthe State of North Dakota, substantially reduce the cost of the \nproject, and require compliance with environmental laws and our \ninternational treaty obligations with Canada.\n  North Dakota has significant water quality and water quantity needs \nthat must be addressed. In many parts of my state, well water in rural \ncommunities resembles weak coffee or strong tea. It turns the laundry \ngray after the first wash, and in many places is unfit even for cattle \nto drink. This bill is designed to address those situations and help \nprovide clean, reliable water to families and businesses across North \nDakota.\n  This bill was favorably reported from the Senate Energy Committee \nearlier this year, after hearings were held in this Congress and in the \nprevious Congress. During consideration in the Energy Committee, \nseveral amendments were adopted that reduced the cost of the bill by \n$140 million and strengthened environmental protections in the bill. I \nshould also note that this bill reduces the cost of constructing the \ncurrently-authorized project by about $1 billion.\n  The bill is now pending on the Senate calendar, and was packaged with \na group of other bills reported by the Energy Committee to be \nconsidered by this body. Unfortunately, when the Senate attempted to \nconsider this legislation in recent days, objections to its \nconsideration were registered by other Senators from another state who \nhad concerns about the bill. In response, Senator Dorgan and I have \nworked with those Senators to address their concerns. We have engaged \nin those discussions in good faith, believing that if we continued to \nwork with other states we would be able to address their concerns.\n  Unfortunately, those discussions have not yielded the results we were \nhoping for that would have allowed the bill to pass the Senate. \nEnacting this legislation will help my state overcome the tremendous \nwater needs that are well documented, and I will continue to work in \ngood faith with other Senators to pass this important bill. I am \nwilling to address the concerns of other states, but it must be a two-\nway street. I look forward to our discussions under the auspices of the \nEnergy Committee in February to resolve those issues.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15084-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a very \nimportant issue that threatens to undermine the readiness of our Navy \nand Marine Corps units that are scheduled to deploy to the \nMediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf in February. That issue is the \ncurrent situation on the Puerto Rican Island of Vieques where the Navy \nis being prevented by unrestrained civil disobedience from conducting \ntraining critical to its preparations for deploying into a possible \ncombat environment.\n  Two weeks ago, I and four of my colleagues introduced Senate \nResolution 220, that would express the Sense of the\n\n[[Page S15085]]\n\nCongress that the Secretary of the Navy should initiate the required \ntraining for the Eisenhower Battle Group and the 24th Marine \nExpeditionary Unit on the island of Vieques, and that the President \nshould not deploy these forces unless the President determines that \nthey are free of serious deficiencies in their major warfare areas.\n  Over the past two weeks there have been discussions between the \nFederal government and the Government of Puerto Rico to try and reach \nan accommodation that would resolve the current impasse between the \nNavy and the people of Vieques. Unfortunately, these discussions have \nnot born fruit and there is no resolution in sight. The simple fact is \nthe President needs to act to resolve this impasse.\n  Today, the Armed Forces are at risk of reaching unacceptably low \nlevels of preparedness. Last week we learned that two Army Divisions \nare not ready to execute the National Military Strategy without \nunacceptable risk to the personnel in those units.\n  If the required training for the Eisenhower Battle Group and the 24th \nMarine Expeditionary Unit is not conducted in December, in February \nthese two units will be unable to deploy without serious deficiencies \nin their warfighting capabilities. We cannot allow this degradation in \nthe readiness of our Armed Forces to occur if we intend to maintain our \nposition as a world leader, and honor our commitment to our military \npersonnel to reduce the risk they incur when they sail into harm's way. \nAs Vice Admiral Murphy, Commander of the Sixth Fleet of the Navy, \nrecently testified before the Armed Services Committee, the loss of \ntraining on Vieques would ``cost American lives.'' Over the past \nseveral weeks, the Armed Services Committee has held a series of \nhearings on the important issue of Vieques. Over the course of these \nhearings, I have become increasingly convinced that it would be \nirresponsible to deploy our naval forces without the training that \ntakes place at the Vieques facilities.\n\n  On Tuesday, September 22, 1999, the Readiness and Management Support \nSubcommittee, under the leadership of Senator Inhofe, held a hearing to \nreview the need for Vieques as a training facility and explore \nalternative sites that might be utilized. At that hearing both Admiral \nFallon, commander of the Navy's Second Fleet, and General Pace, \ncommander of all Marine Forces in the Atlantic, testified that the \nArmed Forces of the United States need Vieques as a training ground to \nprepare our young men and women for the challenges of deployed military \noperations.\n  On October 13th, the Seapower Subcommittee, under the leadership of \nSenator Snowe, heard from Admiral Murphy, commander of the Navy's Sixth \nFleet and the commander who receives the naval forces trained at \nVieques, who stated that a loss of Vieques would ``cost American \nlives.''\n  Earlier this month, after the release of the report prepared by the \nSpecial Panel on Military Operations on Vieques, the so-called Rush \nPanel, I held a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee to \ndiscuss with Administration and Puerto Rican officials the \nrecommendations of that report, and to search for a compromise solution \nthat addresses the national security requirements and the interests of \nthe people of Vieques. In outlining the need for Vieques at that \nhearing, Secretary Danzig, the Secretary of the Navy, stated that only \nby providing the necessary training can we fairly ask our service \nmembers to put their lives at risk. Admiral Johnson, Chief of Naval \nOperations, stated that the Eisenhower Battle Group would not be able \nto deploy in February without a significant increase in the risk to the \nlives of the men and women of that battle group unless they are allowed \nto conduct required training on Vieques. Finally, General Jones, \nCommandant of the Marine Corps, testified that the loss of training \nprovided on Vieques  ``will result in degraded cohesion on the part of \nour battalions and our squadrons and our crews, decreased confidence in \ntheir ability to do their very dangerous jobs and missions, a decreased \nlevel of competence and the ability to fight and win on the \nbattlefield.''\n\n  At that hearing, I asked Admiral Johnson and General Jones ``Is there \nany training that can be substituted for Vieques live fire training \nbetween now and February that will constitute, in your professional \njudgment, a sufficient level of training to enable you to say to the \nChairman of the Joint chiefs of Staff, the Eisenhower Battle Group and \nthe 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit are ready to go.'' In response they \nstated ``no, sir, not without--not without greatly increasing the risk \nto those men and women who we ask to go in harm's way, no, sir.''\n  I remain convinced that the training requirement is real and will \ncontinue to directly effect the readiness of our Carrier Battle Groups \nand Marine Expeditionary Units. As General Shelton recently testified \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee, the training on Vieques is \n``critical'' to military readiness. He further stated that he \n``certainly would not want to see our troops sent into an area where \nthere was going to be combat, without having had this type of an \nexperience. We should not deploy them under those conditions.''\n  All of the military officers with whom we have spoken on this issue \nhave informed us that the loss of Vieques would increase the risk to \nour military personnel deploying to potential combat environments. The \nRush Panel, appointed at the request of the Resident Commissioner from \nPuerto Rico and the direction of the President, recognized the need for \nVieques and recommended its continued use for at least five years.\n  What we have learned in these hearings is that Vieques is a unique \ntraining asset, both in terms of its geography with deep open water and \nunrestricted airspace and its training support infrastructure. The last \ntwo East coast carrier battle groups which deployed to the Adriatic and \nPersian Gulf completed their final integrated live fire training at \nVieques. Both battle groups, led by the carriers U.S.S. Enterprise and \nU.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, subsequently saw combat in Operations Desert \nFox (Iraq) and Allied Force (Kosovo) within days of arriving in the \nrespective theater of operations. Their success in these operations, \nwith no loss of American life, was largely attributable to the \nrealistic and integrated live fire training completed at Vieques prior \nto their deployment.\n\n  According to Article II, section 2, of the Constitution of the United \nStates, the President is the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Armed \nForces. As such, he bears the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that \nthe men and women in uniform he orders into harm's way, receive the \ntraining necessary to perform their mission with the least risk to \ntheir lives.\n  I am encouraged that the President has tried to resolve this matter \nwith the Governor of Puerto Rico in such a way that would allow the \nNavy to conduct the necessary training. However, I am disappointed that \nthe President and the Governor have been unable to achieve such a \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, as long as we are committing our nation's youth to \nmilitary operations throughout the world; and as long as Vieques is \nnecessary to train these individuals so that they can perform their \nmissions safely and successfully; it would be unconscionable to deploy \nthese forces without first allowing them to train at this vital \nfacility.\n  Mr. President, the Eisenhower Battle Group and the 24th Marine \nExpeditionary Unit will soon deploy to the Mediterranean Sea and the \nPersian Gulf. In order to do so safely, they must begin preparations to \nconduct the necessary pre-deployment training on the island of Vieques \nin December.\n  The time has come for the President to make a decision to protect our \nnational security and the safety of our men and women in uniform. He \nmust decide to allow the Navy and the Marine Corps to conduct this \ntraining, and to notify the Secretary of the Navy and the Governor of \nPuerto Rico of his decision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15085-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15085-S15086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting two \nwithdrawals and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n\n[[Page S15086]]\n\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15086-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:00 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 34.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe tax on generation-skipping transfers to eliminate certain traps for \nthe unwary and otherwise improve the fairness of such tax; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n\n          The Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Amendments Act\n\n  Mr. MACK: Mr. President, today Senator Breaux and I join in \nintroducing legislation to correct serious problems in the allocation \nof generation-skipping transfer tax (GST) exemptions. This legislation \nwould provide relief to taxpayers for missed allocations of the GST \nexemption and would make the exemption allocation automatic, in place \nof the current law requirement that the taxpayers take an affirmative \nstep to claim the exemption. This proposed change was included in the \nTaxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999, but failed to become law due to \nthe President's veto of that bill.\n  Under this legislation, the GST exemption is automatically allocated \nto ``indirect skip'' transfers made while the donor is alive. An \nindirect skip is a transfer of property subject to the gift tax that is \nmade to a GST trust. Direct skips (generally, transfers solely for the \nbenefit of grandchildren) are already covered by an automatic \nallocation rule. An individual may elect not to have the automatic \nallocation rule apply to an indirect skip. Also, under this \nlegislation, the GST exemption may be allocated retroactively when \nthere is an unnatural order of death. If a lineal descendant of the \ntransferor predeceased the transferor, then the transferor may allocate \nthe unused GST exemption to any previous transfer or transfers to the \ntrust on a chronological basis.\n  This legislation also provides authorization and direction to the \nTreasury Secretary to grant extensions of time to make the election to \nallocate the GST exemption and to grant exceptions to the time \nrequirement. If such relief is granted, then the value on the date of \ntransfer to the trust would be used for determining GST exemption \nallocation.\n  Mr. President, this is important legislation which deserves enactment \nat the earliest possible date. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1975\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

No negative implication is intended with respect to \n     the availability of relief for late elections or the \n     application of a rule of substantial compliance prior to the \n     enactment of this amendment.\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nfrom the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Mack, in introducing \nlegislation designated to address past problems with\n\n[[Page S15092]]\n\nthe allocation of the generation-skipping transfer (GST) exemption, and \nto provide for automatic allocations going forward.\n  Under current law, taxpayers must make affirmative allocations of the \nGST exemption for transfers to a trust. As a result, many taxpayers \nhave not made timely allocations and face the prospect of losing a \nsignificant portion of the exemption's benefit. This legislation is \ndesigned to assure that taxpayers get the full benefit of the law by \nmaking GST exemption allocations automatic for transfers to a trust and \nto give taxpayers the opportunity to cure past allocations which were \nnot made on a timely basis.\n  This legislation was included in the tax bill that was sent to the \nPresident earlier this summer. It enjoys Republican and Democratic \nsupport on both sides of the hill. I urge its inclusion in the next tax \nbill sent to the White House.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. \n        Abraham):\n  S. 1977. A bill to review, reform, and terminate unnecessary and \ninequitable Federal subsidies; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n            corporate subsidy reform commission act of 1999\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to establish a process to eliminate and reform federal \nsubsidies and tax advantages received by corporations. This bill, ``The \nCorporate Subsidy Reform Commission Act'' is identical to a bill that \nwas reported out of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee in May, \n1997. I am pleased to have as cosponsors Senators Thompson, Lieberman, \nand Abraham.\n  I would like to briefly describe the major provisions of the \nCorporate Subsidy Reform Commission Act. It defines inequitable \nsubsidies as those provided to corporations without a reasonable \nexpectation that they will return a commensurate benefit to the public.\n  The Act excludes any subsidies that are primarily for research and \ndevelopment, education, public health, safety, or the environment. Also \nexcluded are subsidies or tax advantages necessary to comply with \ninternational trade or treaty obligations.\n  The Act would create a nine-member commission nominated by the \nPresident and the Congressional leadership. Federal agencies would be \nrequired to submit to the Commission, at the time of the \nAdministration's next budget, a list of subsidies and tax advantages \nthat it believes are inequitable. The Commission will provide \nrecommendations to either terminate or reduce the corporate subsidies. \nThe President has the authority under the Act to either terminate the \nprocess, or submit the Commission's recommendations to the Congress as \na legislative initiative.\n  The Congress would then have four months to review the Commission's \nrecommendations which have been endorsed by the President. At that \ntime, the actions of all involved committees in each respective body \nwould be sent to the floor for debate, under expedited procedures.\n  Many federal subsidies and special-interest tax breaks for \ncorporations are unnecessary, and do not provide a fair return to the \ntaxpayers who bear the heavy burden of their cost. If a corporation is \nreceiving taxpayer-funded subsidies or tax breaks that are unsupported \nby a compelling benefit to the public, the subsidy should be ended.\n  Our nation is just now beginning to pay down a national debt of over \n$5 trillion. Every American shoulders an unconscionable amount of \ndebt--somewhere in the range of $19,000 each--not due to any profligate \nspending of their own, but because of the fiscal irresponsibility of \ntheir elected officials in Congress. The citizens who expect leadership \nand accountability from their representatives have gotten special \ninterest pandering in return. This is devastating to our nation's \nfiscal stability, and crippling to the ability of the Congress to \nrespond to truly urgent social needs such as health care, education, \nand national security.\n\n  Let me note a couple of estimates of this scope of unjustified \nfederal subsidies to corporations that illustrates how expensive this \nburden is. When I first introduced this legislation, the CATO Institute \nhad identified 125 federal programs that provided over $85 billion in \nindustry subsidies. The Progressive Policy Institute identified an \nadditional $30 billion in tax loopholes for major industries.\n  Unfortunately, the pervasive system of pork-barreling and special \ninterest legislating is speeding along unabated in Washington. Instead \nof pursuing our nation's priorities in a bipartisan manner, both \nparties continue to legislate, posture, and spend for partisan \nadvantage. I have worked hard during my service in the Senate to \neliminate wasteful earmarks in appropriations bills. Yet this year \nalone, more than $13 billion in pork barrel spending was approved by \nthe Senate. I was also dismayed at the inclusion of numerous special-\ninterest tax breaks contained in the comprehensive tax bill passed by \nthe Congress this year, then vetoed.\n  Mr. President, I want to state openly that I would strongly prefer to \neliminate corporate subsidies and inequitable tax subsidies without \nresorting to a commission. I would rather have every committee in the \nHouse and Senate open the next session of Congress by expeditiously \nexamining their areas of jurisdiction for unwarranted corporate pork. \nThen, each respective body could engage in a full and thorough debate \non the merits of each subsidy, and vote on their termination or \nmodification. However, I regret that approach is unlikely to occur, \nbecause of the difficulty in resisting the requests of the special \ninterests. The bill I am introducing today represents a practical \napproach to establishing not only a credible process to identify \ncorporate pork, but to then take the important next step of achieving \nreal reductions on behalf of over-taxed constituents.\n  I look forward to this bill being brought before the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee early next year. To ensure that the \nSenate Committee on Finance has an opportunity to evaluate any tax \npolicy modifications contained in this Act, I have agreed to a \nsequential referral consent request with the leadership of those two \ncommittees. I am hopeful that this bill represents the beginning of a \nserious and productive process to alleviate the public burden of \nunnecessary corporate subsidies and tax breaks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 1978. A bill to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nestablish a national cemetery for veterans in the Albuquerque, New \nMexico, metropolitan area; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n               albuquerque national cemetery legislation\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure and honor that \nI rise today to introduce a bill to create a National Veterans Cemetery \nin Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n  The men and women who have served in the United States Armed Forces \nhave made immeasurable sacrifices for the principles of freedom and \nliberty that make this Nation unique throughout civilization. The \nservice of veterans has been vital to the history of the Nation, and \nthe sacrifices made by veterans and their families should not be \nforgotten.\n  These veterans at the very least deserve every opportunity to be \nburied at a National Cemetery with their fellow comrades. However, the \nSanta Fe National Cemetery, which serves the Northern two thirds of New \nMexico, is rapidly approaching maximum capacity.\n  Unfortunately, even though the Senate has already passed my \nlegislation to extend the useful life of the Santa Fe National Cemetery \nby authorizing the use of flat grave markers the life of the Cemetery \nwill only be extended to 2008. Consequently, I would submit that it is \nnot too soon to being planning or the day when Santa Fe will no longer \nbe available.\n  Before I continue, I would like to take a moment to talk about the \nSanta Fe National Cemetery. I believe all New Mexicans can be proud of \nthe Santa Fe National Cemetery that has grow from 39/100 of an acre to \nits current 77 acres.\n  The cemetery first opened in 1868 and within several years was \ndesignated a National Cemetery in April of 1875. Men and women who have \nfought in all of nation's wars hold an honored spot within the hallowed \nground of the cemetery.\n  With that said, I believe now is the right time to begin looking for \nanother\n\n[[Page S15093]]\n\nsuitable site to serve as the last resting place for those New Mexico \nveterans who gave of themselves to protect the American ideals of \nliberty and freedom. The need to begin planning becomes even more \npressing by virtue of the fact that more than half of New Mexico's \n180,000 veterans live in the Albuquerque/Santa Fe area and internments \nare expected to peak in 2008.\n  Consequently, I am introducing legislation today to create a National \nVeterans Cemetery in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I also want to compliment \nCongresswoman Heather Wilson who offered this far-sighted legislation \nin the House of Representatives last week with the knowledge that there \nis only a finite amount of space available over the long term at the \nexisting national cemetery in Santa Fe.\n  The Bill simply directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nestablish a national cemetery in the Albuquerque metropolitan area and \nto submit a report to Congress setting forth a schedule for \nestablishing the cemetery.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL CEMETERY.\n\n       (A) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     establish, in accordance with chapter 124 of title 38, United \n     States Code, a national cemetery in the Albuquerque, New \n     Mexico, metropolitan area to serve the needs of veterans and \n     their families.\n       (b) Report.--As soon as practicable after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act. The Secretary shall submit to Congress \n     a report that sets forth a schedule for the establishment of \n     the national cemetery under subsection (a) and an estimate of \n     the costs associated with the establishment of the national \n     cemetery.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 1979. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to provide that \nrestrictions on application of State laws to pension benefits shall not \napply to State laws prohibiting individuals from benefitting from \ncrimes involving the death of pension plan participants; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                         THE SLAYER STATUTE ACT\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to address an oversight in \nthe Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) brought to my \nattention by a constituent of mine in Grand Forks, North Dakota.\n  On October 14, 1997, Betty Rambel disappeared. Two days later, the \nburnt-out shell of her car was found. Inside the trunk was an \nunrecognizable body. On October 24, 1997, using dental records, the \nbody was identified as Betty. That day, her husband, Steve, was \narrested for her murder.\n  Steve Rambel's trial took place in November of 1998, roughly a year \nago. After a week-long trial the jury found him guilty of murder in the \nsecond degree, assault with a deadly weapon, and arson. Steve was \nsentenced to life in prison on March 5, 1999.\n  Even once is too often, yet this sort of situation occurs more \nfrequently than that: people are killed by people they trust. We read \nthe headlines, are bombarded with the lurid details, and our thoughts \nmove to other matters when the killer is convicted and sentenced. \nHowever, for the other victims of these crimes--the family and friends \nof the victim--the nightmare drags on. In the midst of the shock, the \nanger, the inconsolable sorrow of their loss, these victims have to \npick up the pieces of their lives and go through the business of \ngetting back on their feet. I rise today to speak about the \n``business'' of moving on.\n  With her sister gone and her brother-in-law in jail, Phyllis Marden \nassumed responsibility for the care of her minor niece and nephew. In \nthe midst of settling her deceased sister's estate, Phyllis was \nnotified that she was named as the second beneficiary to Betty's \npension benefits. When coming to agreement with her sister's employer \non the award of benefits, Ms. Marden was upset to find that, although \nit is prohibited by state law, under ERISA her sister's killer can lay \nfuture claim to her pension benefits. Justifiably disturbed by this \noversight in federal law, Phyllis contacted my office.\n  ERISA preempts state laws that govern the award of pension benefits, \neven clear-cut rulings like those made against Steven Ramble. To \ncorrect this situation and others like it, we have drafted a bill which \nwould waive the ERISA preemption in cases where a state's ``slayer \nstatute'' applies to the application of benefits. This bill simply \nprovides that individuals will not have access to ERISA benefits as a \nresult of crimes they commit causing the death of pension plan \nparticipants. While many insurance plans already have language to this \neffect, ERISA does not. The aim of the bill is to codify the direction \nof the court in recent decisions of this issue and the Internal Revenue \nService decision made on this matter in February 24, 1999, private \nletter ruling.\n  While no one thinks that killers should benefit from their victims' \npension plans, some suggest that waiving the ERISA preemption in these \ncases might start us down a ``slippery slope,'' where we begin waiving \nthe ERISA preemption to support and enforce social policy. They would \nprefer to deal with these matters on a case-by-case basis. I understand \nthis line of reasoning; however, I strenuously disagree. I side with \nthe Phyllis Mardens of America.\n  Individuals subjected to these tragic, uncommon circumstances have \nbeen through enough both emotionally and financially; they should not \nbe responsible for added legal costs on a clear-cut issue. At a time \nlike this, they should not be expected to realize that they need a \nlawyer familiar with the intricacies of ERISA.\n  I have alluded to the fact that not all lawyers are familiar with the \navailable legal remedies to these problems; ERISA is notoriously \ncomplex. A bright line should be drawn that--without affecting the \nERISA preemption on the whole--allows survivors of this specific sort \nof crime relief from further emotional and financial hardship at the \nhands of the perpetrator. I feel that this bill makes that sort of \nclear distinction.\n  A day does not pass that Betty is not on Phyllis's mind. Phyllis \nunderstands that this bill will not affect her situation--she is \nalready paying her legal bills. However, she knows that someone else \nwill have to go through the legal process she has been through. This \nbill will remove an obstacle from their path and get them on their way \nhome.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kerrey, \n        Mr. Durbin, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Reid, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Wyden, and \n        Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1980. A bill to amend the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to \nensure improved access to the signals of local television stations by \nmultichannel video providers to all households which desire such \nservice in unserved and underserved rural areas by December 31, 2006; \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n   21st century rural utility service rural development enhancement \n                     through local information act\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, along with Senators Harkin, \nDaschle, Kerrey, Durbin, Johnson, Wellstone, Conrad, Rockefeller, \nBryan, Reid, Leahy, Wyden, and Murray, I am pleased to introduce a bill \ntoday on behalf of our country's rural satellite consumers. This is a \nbill to amend the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, appropriately \nentitled, ``the 21st Century Rural Utility Service Rural Development \nEnhancement Through Local Information Act.''\n  We all know that modern technology has made it possible to broadcast \nTV programming directly from satellites. Nationwide, over 11 million \nhouseholds subscribe to satellite TV, and that number increases by over \n2 million households a year.\n  Rural areas have come to depend on the network coverage that \nsatellites provide. In Montana, where over 35 percent of homes depend \non satellite broadcasting for their TV reception, this development has \nbeen a real boon.\n  While satellite broadcasting has improved the quality of life for \nfolks in rural America, it hasn't been perfect. Satellite systems \nhaven't been able to carry local broadcast stations. So local viewers \nhaven't always been able to get local broadcasting.\n\n[[Page S15094]]\n\n  And this is not just a problem for satellite subscribers. It's a \nproblem for the local TV broadcasters and for the fabric of local \ncommunities. Local broadcasters play a key role in our communities.\n  They provide local news, local weather, and public service programs. \nViewers depend on these broadcasts to find out about what's going on in \ntheir community. When the school board, PTA, and city council are \nmeeting. Or when there's a parade or a fund-raiser for their church or \ncivic groups.\n  Local broadcasters are vital to our local economies. They provide \njobs, and they allow local businesses to grow through advertising. In \nshort, the importance of local broadcasting is evident in all parts of \ncommunity life.\n  And they also provide network programming: NBC, ABC, CBS, and FOX. \nNineteen of the twenty TV stations in Montana are affiliated with one \nof these networks, or with the Public Broadcasting System.\n  These stations air national news, sports and entertainment at times \nof the day when people with jobs and kids can watch.\n  Without these local broadcasts, you might miss the evening network \nnews because it comes on before you get home from work, or because it \nairs late at night. People want local network coverage because it works \nin their lives.\n  Until now, technology has not provided for rebroadcast of local \nsignals by satellites. Many rural residents haven't been able to get \ndecent reception over the air.\n  Of course, we in the Senate cannot change technology or geography. \nWhat we can do is change the law. We can make local into local \nbroadcasting a reality, and we should.\n  Last spring, we passed H.R. 1554. At the time, we neglected an \nimportant responsibility. The language we passed would have required \nthe turn-off of network programming to many rural satellite viewers.\n  It would have done nothing to help the many local broadcasts in \nsmaller cities and towns. A big oversight.\n  Following the vote, I wrote a letter to the conference asking that it \npay attention to the needs of the many viewers, communities, businesses \nand stations that had been ignored. Twenty-three of my colleagues, from \nboth sides of the aisle, signed the letter.\n  As you know, Mr. President, yesterday the House passed the omnibus \nappropriations bill, and the Senate is slated to take the same vote \nthis evening. Mr. President, I was very disheartened when I learned \nthat the ever important loan guarantee provision was pulled out of the \nConference Report on the Satellite bill at the last minute. That is why \nI'm introducing this bill today, because this loan guarantee will help \nAmerica's 11 million rural satellite consumers. It's time for us as \nlawmakers to say ``we care about those folks up in 2 Dot that simply \nwant to watch local news.'' This is our chance to expand rural access \nso that no matter how large or small your town is, you're going to be \nable to enjoy the benefits of Satellite TV.\n  This bill includes a loan guarantee that will make it possible for \nall local stations to be broadcast on satellite. Not just those in the \nvery largest cities and towns. Without this, the other ``local into \nlocal'' provisions of the Satellite Home Viewer Act are an empty \npromise to the rural and small town Americans who depend on satellites.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to holding hearings on this bill during \nour adjournment and coming back to see a swift resolution to this issue \nin January. It is time, no, it's overtime, for us to act on this \nimportant issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 1981. A bill to amend title XI of the Public Health Service Act to \nprovide for the use of new genetic technologies to meet the health care \nneeds of the public; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n                genetics and public health services act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, advances in biomedical science and \ntechnology in this century have given us many tools to improve our \nunderstanding of the causes of disease, and to develop better \nstrategies to prevent and treat human illness. The recent explosion of \nknowledge in genetics offers us the newest and most powerful weapons in \nthe war against disease and suffering.\n  The legislation I am introducing, the Genetics and Public Health \nServices Act, will increase the federal, state and local public health \nresources needed to translate genetic information and technology into \nstrategies to improve public health.\n  Our national investment in science, and in particular in the National \nInstitutes of Health, is reaping important dividends for the entire \ncountry. As a result of the Human Genome Project and other public and \nprivate sector research, we soon may have access to the entire human \ngenetic code. From work accomplished so far, scientists have begun to \ndevelop a greater understanding of how genes contribute to the \ndevelopment of common diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, \ndepression, heart disease and many other illnesses. Genetic information \nand technology have enormous potential for improving our efforts to \npromote health and combat disease.\n  Based on current understanding of genes and human disease, we know \nthat at least 65 percent of Americans have or will have a health \nproblem for which there is a clear genetic contribution. Some have \nrare, but serious, conditions--such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell \ndisease or phenylketonuria. Many more have common disorders--asthma, \ndiabetes, cancer, heart disease, stroke and depression--in which \ngenetic predisposition plays an important role.\n  Genetic information can help us to understand and identify those at \nrisk for serious diseases and conditions, and help doctors monitor \ntheir health in order to diagnose and treat the diseases before they \ncause irreversible injury or death.\n  Advancing our understand of genetics will revolutionize the treatment \nof disease. For example, understanding the genetic factors that \ncontribute to Alzheimer's disease will help us to understand why some \npatients seem to respond to a new treatment, while others do not. \nGenetic information may soon be able to predict the types of \nindividuals who have intolerable side effects from certain therapies. \nDoctors will be able to use genetic information to choose safer and \nmore effective treatments that are tailored to each individual.\n  Medical scientists are now beginning to think about genetic-based \nstrategies to prevent illness, too. Understanding how genes contribute \nto the development of disease will give us new ways to intervene before \ndisease develops. We will be able to use new therapies to prevent \nstroke, heart disease and many other conditions that cause disability \nand premature death.\n  We have an unprecedented opportunity to use the expanding knowledge \nin genetics to improve health care. Scientific discoveries based on \ngenetic information will change the face of health care in the future. \nBut we lack the resources and systems needed today to translate that \ninformation into effective steps to diagnose, treat, and ultimately \nprevented disease.\n  In order to realize the potential benefits of genetic information and \ntechnology, we must invest the resources needed to translate this \nknowledge into practical approaches to health care. We must do this \nquickly, to keep pace with the explosion of knowledge coming from \npublic and private sector scientists.\n  This legislation accomplishes these goals by creating two new grant \nprograms in the Department of Health and Human Services. The first \nprovides grants to states to develop and maintain ways to safely and \neffectively use genetic information in their state and local public \nhealth programs. The second grant program focuses on the translation of \nnew genetic information and technologies to practical public health \nstrategies that can be used in public and private health care.\n  The grant program for states will support methods to incorporate \ngenetics at every level of state and local public health systems. Each \nstate and territory has a unique population and a unique public health \nprogram. This proposal provides states with the support and flexibility \nto design approaches tailored to their specific needs and existing \nresources. States may use funds to establish and maintain essential \nresources, such as information systems, service programs, and other \nfundamental elements. States\n\n[[Page S15095]]\n\nwill be required to monitor, evaluate and report on the impact of \nprograms and systems funded by the Act.\n  Responsible use of genetic information must be based on scientific \ndata. The second grant program created by this legislation addresses \nthe need for ongoing development and evaluation of public health \nstrategies that use genetic information and technology. The bill \ncreates a demonstration program for public and private non-profit \norganizations to test innovative approaches for using genetic \ninformation to improve people's health, and to evaluate the suitability \nof such approaches for incorporation into state and local public health \nprograms.\n  Broad input from all parties is a key ingredient for successful and \nsafe use of genetic information to improve public health. Individuals \nmust not be coerced to participate in genetic testing. It is important \nto involve the public in local, state and federal decisions about how \nto use genetic information in developing public health policy.\n  Evidence suggests that many people are afraid to take advantage of \navailable genetic tests because they fear discrimination in the \nworkplace or in the health insurance market. Until we pass legislation \nto stop such discrimination, those fears are grounded in reality. We \nknow that steps can be taken to protect the confidentiality of genetic \ninformation and to better educate the public about the issues \nsurrounding genetic testing. This legislation requires each state to \nshow how it plans to involve the public in the design and \nimplementation of its proposal. The legislation also establishes a \nfederal advisory committee to assist the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices in the implementation and oversight of programs under this \nAct.\n\n  Public participation is essential. Our system has failed if we offer \npopulation-wide testing for predisposition to stroke, but fail to \neducate individuals who must decide whether to be tested. Our system \nhas failed if we implement population-wide testing for predisposition \nto breast cancer, but fail to provide access to the care that is needed \nto reduce the risk of developing disease.\n  Effective integration of genetics into public health systems must \nbuild on current efforts of the private and the public sector, \nincluding the work of many federal agencies. These include the \nachievements of the Human Genome Project at the National Institutes of \nHealth, the Food and Drug Administration's oversight of certain aspects \nof genetic testing, the ongoing work of the Secretary's Advisory \nCommittee on Genetic Testing, and the contributions of the project on \nthe Ethical Legal and Social Implications of the Human Genome Project \nat the Department of Energy. Our new Federal commitment to safe and \neffective use of new genetic information and technology in the public \nhealth system will also draw significantly upon the expertise of the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration. Translating genetic \ninformation and technology into practice will benefit as well from the \nexpertise of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in disease \nsurveillance and in developing and testing new public health \nstrategies.\n  This legislation emphasizes the need to educate both health care \nproviders and the general public. It also provides the structure and \nresources to include genetics in all aspects of public health--from the \ndevelopment of policy to the delivery of services. We must ensure that \nour entire public health system is ready and able to respond to the \nchallenge of using genetic information for improving health.\n  The Genetics and Public Health Services Act is supported by leading \npublic health and genetics organizations, including the American Public \nHealth Association, the American College of Medical Genetics, the \nNational, Society of Genetic Counselors, and the American Society of \nHuman Genetics. The Alliance of Genetic Support Groups--representing \nthose who live with genetic diseases--has written eloquently about the \nneed to improve the resources dedicated to integrating genetics into \npublic health. I am confident this support will grow in the coming \nmonths.\n  Genetics research has brought us to an era of limitless possibility. \nThe 21st century will be the century of life sciences. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in this effort to take advantage of this \nunprecedented opportunity to improve America's health. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a summary of the bill and letters of support be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              The Genetics and Public Health Services Act\n\n       Amends the Public Health Service Act to (1) establish, \n     expand and maintain resources and expertise needed for safe \n     and effective use of genetic information and technology in \n     state and local public health programs and (2) support \n     essential applied research and systems development to \n     translate new and emerging genetic information into practical \n     public health strategies.\n\n\n       block grants, applied research and demonstration projects\n\n       Creates a new federal-state matching block grant program to \n     (1) develop systems that promote access to quality genetic \n     services regardless of race, ethnicity, and ability to pay; \n     (2) establish, maintain, or supervise programs to reduce the \n     mortality and morbidity for heritable disorders in the \n     population of the state; (3) identify and develop a network \n     of experts within state and county health agencies to assess \n     the need for and assure the referral to or provision of \n     quality genetic services; (4) promote understanding among the \n     public and health care professionals of genetic disorders; \n     and (5) provide a mechanism for public input on state-\n     designed genetic policies and programs.\n       Establishes new authority to develop and evaluate \n     strategies to use emerging genetic information and technology \n     to improve the public health.\n     Application requirements and procedures\n       Block grants: In general, individual states will apply for \n     and receive the block grants; however, two or more states may \n     submit a joint multi-state application.\n       Applied research/demonstration projects: Eligible entities \n     are states and public or private non-profit organizations, \n     which may partner with other entities in the private sector.\n\n\n                   establishes an advisory committee\n\n       Members include representatives from other appropriate \n     federal agencies, the clinical genetics community, research \n     community, private sector, the public, and state health \n     agencies.

APHA strongly supports the safe \n     and effective integration of genetic information and \n     technology into public health practice.\n       Specifically, the legislation would provide funding to \n     states to develop and maintain resources needed to use \n     genetic information and technology at all levels of public \n     health systems. The bill would support the development of \n     expertise within state and county health agencies to evaluate \n     the potential impact of public health strategies based on \n     genetic information, to assess the need for genetic services, \n     to provide expert input for policy development, and to assure \n     appropriate referral to or provision of quality genetic \n     services regardless of race, ethnicity or ability to pay.\n       APHA looks forward to working with you in moving this \n     important legislation forward. Thank you again for your \n     leadership on this important public health matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Mohammad N.

The Alliance mission is to bring the ``people \n     perspective'' to the forefront of discussions about access to \n     quality healthcare, privacy, discrimination and research. \n     Representing 280 support groups of individuals and families \n     with genetic conditions and professional organizations, the \n     Alliance acts on behalf of over three million individuals and \n     families.\n       We know, through our membership network and callers to our \n     Genetics Helpline, that resources are desperately needed to \n     address the disparities across the state and federal public \n     health systems.\n       We want to emphasize that genetics, from a public health \n     perspective, is much more than simply genetic testing. Vastly \n     increased resources are needed to prepare public health \n     systems to deliver comprehensive and quality genetic \n     services. We need to train public health professionals, \n     educate the public, create family-centered public policies \n     and develop a comprehensive care system that links people to \n     all the services they need--before, after and as a result of \n     genetic testing.\n       We applaud your commitment to address these concerns, as \n     well as others close to our members' hearts, about genetic \n     discrimination, privacy and access to quality health care. \n     The Alliance of Genetic Support Groups deeply appreciates all \n     that you have done and are continuing to do to ensure the \n     translation of genetic knowledge into improved public health.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mary E.

Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: As President of the American College \n     of Medical Genetics (ACMG), I am writing to express our deep \n     appreciation and support for your efforts to address the need \n     for more extensive resources and services for public health \n     genetics at the state and federal levels.\n       The ACMG is a professional organization representing board-\n     certified clinical and laboratory geneticists. We are the \n     newest specialty to be recognized by the American Board of \n     Medical Specialties, and we have full representation in the \n     House of Delegates of the American Medical Association.\n       As I recently testified before the Secretary's Advisory \n     Committee on Genetic Testing, knowledge of genetics has \n     expanded rapidly thanks to the enormous international \n     investment in the Human Genome Project. However, little \n     attention has been paid to the crucial issue of integrating \n     it into health care delivery. Medical geneticists are \n     uniquely aware of the need for a thoughtful and organized \n     approach to the translation of achievements in research so \n     that all physicians can more effectively address the problems \n     of individuals who suffer from or have a predisposition \n     toward diseases caused by genetic defects. It is increasingly \n     clear that virtually every common (or rare) disease has a \n     genetic component, thereby making every American citizen a \n     potential beneficiary of medical genetic services. Thus the \n     tools to prevent and to effectively treat diabetes, cancer, \n     hypertension, heart disease, Alzheimer's, asthma, and so many \n     others, will depend not only on knowledge and technology, but \n     also on a systematic integration of these into our health \n     care system at all levels.\n       The bill you have introduced (Genetic and Public Health \n     Services Act) provides the resources and organization that \n     can unite the expertise of geneticists and public health \n     officials and help us enter the next century with tools to \n     dramatically improve the public health.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 R.

Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The National Society of Genetic \n     Counselors (NSGC) is pleased to write this letter of support \n     for a bill you are introducing to establish ``The Genetics \n     and Public Health Services Act.''\n       The National Society of Genetic Counselors is the leading \n     voice, authority and advocate for the genetic counseling \n     profession and represents over 1700 genetic counselors. \n     Genetic counselors are master's degree level trained \n     healthcare professionals. We work with patients to help them \n     understand the genetics of their condition and implications \n     for other family members, coordinate evaluations, testing and \n     care and link patients with supportive resources. In our work \n     with patients, we translate complex genetic information into \n     understandable terms and promote autonomous decision-making \n     about their healthcare. Additional information about the NSGC \n     can be found on our website (http://www.nsgc.org).\n       Advances are rapidly being made on the identification of \n     gene mutations that cause diseases and genetic conditions. \n     The Human Genome Project, which was initiated in 1990, is \n     mapping the location of all genes. The wealth of genetic \n     information generated by the Human Genome Project will \n     require wide dissemination. Strategies must be developed to \n     translate this genetic information into quality healthcare. \n     Clearly, there is a great need for the development of \n     programs that will ensure that patients are appropriately \n     referred and have access to quality genetic services \n     regardless of race, ethnicity and ability to pay. It will \n     also be important to develop programs that will ease the \n     physical burden associated with genetic conditions and \n     improve treatment.\n       We would like to express our appreciation for your past \n     efforts on healthcare issues, particularly your efforts with \n     the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill to address the risk of genetic \n     discrimination. With the introduction of ``The Genetics and \n     Public Health Services Act,'' you demonstrate foresight in \n     anticipating the greater need for genetic services, once \n     again showing your commitment to quality healthcare for all \n     of us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Wendy R.

It is increasingly clear \n     that genetic factors are important for virtually every common \n     condition that affects large segments of the population. \n     Thus, the capability to prevent and effectively treat \n     diabetes, cancer, hypertension, heart disease, Alzheimer's, \n     asthma, and many others, will depend not only on expanding \n     knowledge and technology, but also on a systematic \n     integration of these advances into our health care system at \n     all levels.\n       The bill you have introduced (Genetic and Public Health \n     Services Act) provides the resources and organization that \n     can unite the expertise of geneticists and public health \n     officials and provide the means to dramatically improve the \n     health of the people by the provision of quality genetic \n     services.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Uta Francke,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mrs. \n        Boxer, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1983. a bill to amend the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to \nincrease the amount of funds available for certain agricultural trade \nprograms; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n           THE AGRICULTURAL MARKET ACCESS AND DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Craig, Smith \nof Oregon, Boxer, and Feinstein to introduce the Agricultural Market \nAccess and Development Act.\n  Mr. President, farmers and ranchers in our nation are hurting. Rural \ncommunities in my home state of Washington have been severely impacted \nby the current crisis in agriculture. The causes are complex and \ndiverse, and have been discussed at great length on the floor of the \nUnited States Senate. Low prices, the loss of markets in Asia, foreign \ntrade barriers, dumping, and industry concentration are just a few of \nthe difficulties farmers and ranchers, the Administration, and Members \nof Congress are struggling to overcome.\n  I am pleased Congress acted to provide emergency assistance as part \nof the fiscal year 2000 agriculture appropriations act. However, while \nthis package was desperately needed, it left\n\n[[Page S15097]]\n\nour many so-called ``minor crop'' producers across the country. It \nfailed to reform our nation's plicy on unilateral sanctions. And it \ndidn't compel us to dedicate time to really resolve long-term issues \nthat will put American agriculture on a more solid foundation. One \nlong-term issue that deserves attention is federal support for market \naccess and development.\n  Today, I am introducing the Agricultural Market Access and \nDevelopment Act to ensure our producers have the resources they need to \nexpand their overseas markets. My bill would authorize the Secretary of \nAgriculture to spend up to $200 million--but not less than the current \n$90 million--for the Market Access Program. And it would set a floor of \n$35 million for spending on the foreign Market Development \n``Cooperator'' Program.\n  While many Members of Congress and producers have advocated increased \nfunding for MAP and the Cooperator Program, these efforts have been \ncomplicated by our work to balance the budget and meet other important \nnational commitments. At the same time, the agricultural community is \nfrustrated over the use--or lack of use--of the Export Enhancement \nProgram.\n  Debate will continue on the merits of using the Export Enhancement \nProgram. Nevertheless, I believe we cannot afford to continue wasting \nthe precious dollars we target toward agricultural trade. That is \nexactly what is happening now: hundreds of millions of dollars in the \nExport Enhancement Program remain unspent and unused while foreign \ngovernments heavily subsidize and protect their agricultural economies \nto the detriment of American producers.\n  My bill seeks to recover some of our lost trade resources and convert \nthem into new opportunities for our farmers and ranchers. My bill would \ngive the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to direct a percentage \nof unspent Export Enhancement Program dollars to market access and \ndevelopment programs within the Commodity Credit Corporation. If less \nthan 20 percent of funds authorized for the Export Enhancement Program \nare spent by July 1 of a given fiscal year, the Secretary could direct \nup to 50 percent of unspent EEP funds to other programs. If less than \n50 percent--but more than 20 percent--of funds authorized for EEP are \nspent by July 1 of a given fiscal year, the Secretary could direct up \nto 20 percent of unspent EEP funds to other programs.\n\n  Mr. President, I am introducing this legislation today to advance the \ndiscussion on using all of our trade resources. The numbers included in \nmy bill will be subject to further discussion and I welcome it. \nHowever, I believe this legislation represents a serious effort to use \nour scarce resources wisely.\n  Our current trade negotiations on agriculture show that we must be \nwilling and able to use federal resources to promote trade. If we do \nnot, our negotiations and our producers cannot succeed.\n  As we head into the Seattle Round of the World Trade Organization \nthis fall, we need to commit ourselves to promoting trade and expanding \nmarket access. Without this commitment, we will lose opportunities to \nmarket our products overseas. Without this commitment, the changes we \nmade to our farm policy in 1996 will not have a chance in the world of \nsucceeding.\n  As I said before, Mr. President, agricultural producers in my state \nof Washington are hurting. My state is home to more than 200 ``minor'' \ncrops. Washington state is known for its productive apple industry. \nUnfortunately, that industry is in the midst of a terrible economic \ncrisis. The loss of markets in Asia, non-frozen apple juice concentrate \ndumping by China, oversupply, poor weather conditions in 1998, and \ngenerally low prices are driving hundreds of family farms out of \nbusiness.\n  This Congress needs to do a better job of addressing the plight of \nall commodity producers, not just those who grow major commodities. My \nlegislation is a step in the right direction. It seeks to increase \nfunding for the Market Access Program, which is popular among fruit and \nvegetable growers. In fact, it is one of the few federal programs that \nbenefit fruit and vegetable producers. Since this Congress has shown \nits reluctance to target meaningful federal aid to minor crop \nproducers, the least we can do is strengthen the voluntary programs \nthat work for these producers. If we do not, we will be failing to \npromote economic stability in many rural communities.\n  However, my bill is not just intended to help fruit and vegetable \nproducers. It also encourages transferring unused trade dollars to the \nForeign Market Development Program, which is used by program \ncommodities. Both MAP and FMD represent the kind of federal-industry \npartnerships we should be encouraging at a time of limited government \nresources.\n  Mr. President, let me briefly address one criticism of the Market \nAccess Program: the issue of whether it is primarily a program that \nbenefits large corporations. Congress reformed MAP--known before the \n1996 farm bill as the Market Promotion Program--in 1996 to ensure that \nlarge corporations with no connections to producers could not access \nMAP funds. I strongly supported that change.\n  The new law did allow for the program's continued use by farmers' \ncooperatives, some of which are major industry players. However, it is \nclear to me, and to others who follow the farm economy, that \nencouraging the development of farmers' cooperatives is one of the few \nbright spots in our efforts to keep family farms on the land. \nTherefore, while opponents will continue to point to a few examples of \nentities they believe in no way should be involved in the program, I \nbelieve my colleagues should keep the broader picture in mind.

Mr. President, I rise before the Senate \ntoday to express my support for legislation, introduced by Senator \nMurray and others, that would allow the U.S. Department\n\n[[Page S15098]]\n\nof Agriculture to allocate to the Market Access Program unused Export \nEnhancement Program funds.\n  I have long been a supporter of the Market Access Program, which was \ndesigned to promote American agricultural products in foreign markets. \nSince its inception, it has proven to be a model program and has \nsuccessfully fostered the growth of American agriculture producers \nthrough the expansion of exports. For smaller states like Oregon, the \nMarket Access Program has played a critical role in getting the word \nout on an array of agricultural goods that otherwise have difficulty \npenetrating overseas markets. Many Oregon commodities, such as grass \nseed, tree fruits, and potatoes have benefitted greatly in recent years \nfrom the Market Access Program funding. For example, last year the \nMarket Access Program enabled a delegation of Oregon grass seed growers \nto travel to China to meet with government officials interested in \nfinding quality grass seed to stabilize river banks near the Three \nGorges Dam project on the Yangtze River. There are numerous other \nexamples where Oregon commodities have been able to make good use of \nthese federal dollars.\n  Despite the achievements of the Market Access Program in recent \nyears, funding for the program has been capped at $90 million. I am \npleased today to cosponsor this bill which authorizes the Secretary of \nAgriculture to increase the Market Access Program funding up to a total \nof $200 million using unapportioned Export Enhancement Program funds.\n  This proposal has widespread support in my state from farmers and the \nagricultural groups that represent them. they recognize, as I do, that \nexpanding markets overseas will be key to restoring the farm economy.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that the Senate will take up this issue \nearly in the next session. I urge my colleagues to join in support of \nthis legislation to enhance American agricultural export efforts and \nthe family farms that depend upon them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI:\n  S. 1985. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to lower \nthe adjusted gross income threshold for deductible disaster casualty \nlosses to 5 percent, to make such deduction an above-the-line \ndeduction, and to allow an election to take such deduction for the \npreceding or succeeding year; to the Committee on Finance.\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nDisaster Victims Tax Relief Act. This legislation will help mitigate \nthe losses that hundreds of thousands of Americans incur each year as a \nresult of natural disasters, and helps clear the path towards full \nrecovery.\n  My home state of New Jersey is not known as a place which suffers \ntropical storms or hurricanes with great frequency. However, this past \nSeptember, many of my constituent witnessed nature's fury first hand. \nHurricane Floyd, one of the largest storms in recent history, battered \nmuch of New Jersey, along with the several other Eastern states, with \nwinds in excess of 140 miles per hour and flash downpours which caused \nextensive flooding. To date, the flooding caused by this disaster has \ninflicted more than $500 million in damages in New Jersey alone, and it \nis estimated that this figure may exceed more than $1 billion when the \nfinal costs are calculated. In terms of economic damages, New Jersey \nwas the second most heavily damaged state as a result of Floyd.\n  Natural disasters, such as the one we recently witnessed, too often \ncause people to lose their homes and the businesses that were made \nsuccessful through a lifetime of hard work. This pain is exacerbated by \nthe fact that they are still required to meet a heavy tax burden for \nthat year. It is unreasonable to expect these unfortunate Americans to \nmeet their full tax responsibilities after suffering a cataclysmic \ndisaster such as a hurricane such as a hurricane or flood. While our \ncurrent tax code includes a provision that addresses this situation, \nqualification requirements ensure that the overwhelming majority of \nvictims cannot utilize the provision to their benefit.\n  Under current law, an individual may deduct uninsured damages or \n``casualty losses'' incurred from a natural disaster so long as those \nlosses exceed 10 percent of their adjusted gross income (AGI). \nUnfortunately, many victims of disasters have found that this threshold \nis too high for them to qualify. Compounding this situation is the fact \nthat only the small percentage of taxpayers who itemize their \ndeductions are effectively eligible to claim their disaster losses as a \ndeduction. This is troubling because 75 percent of taxpayers who do not \nitemize, comprised mostly of lower and middle class families who need \nthis benefit most, cannot participate.\n  The bill I introduce today is straight forward. First it would reduce \nthe current AGI threshold from 10 percent to 5 percent. Second, it \nwould make the deductions available an ``above the line'' deduction. \nThese two provisions would enable the majority of American taxpayers, \nwho do not itemize their returns, to benefit. Third, my bill would \ninstitute a 2-year ``carry back or forward'' provision which would \nallow people who incur casualty losses to claim the deductions on \neither the previous year's return, or they can defer and claim the \nlosses either the following year or the year after. Finally this bill \nis narrowly tailored to provide relief to those people who need it \nmost; those who live in a federally declared disaster area. This will \nhelp avoid abuse of the provision.\n  Mr. President, people who have emerged from earthquakes, tornadoes, \nhurricanes and floods are confronted with the daunting task of \nrebuilding their lives in the face of overwhelming economic loss and \nthe emotional trauma of losing everything they own. Their tax burden \nshould not be one of the obstacles that they must overcome in order to \nembark on the road to recovery. This bill will help ensure that this is \nnot the case. I would urge my colleagues in the Senate to fully support \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Harkin, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 1988.

A bill to ensure that employees of traveling sales crews are \nprotected under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and under other \nprovisions of law; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n                  traveling sales crew protection act\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I have introduced legislation to crack \ndown on abuses in the traveling sales crew industry. These companies \nemploy crews who travel from city to city selling products door to \ndoor. Often times, however, these companies mistreat their workers and \nviolate local, state, and federal labor law. Because they rapidly move \nfrom state to state, enforcement efforts are difficult if not \nimpossible for local authorities.\n  The plight of the workers in this business came home to me, and the \ncitizens of Wisconsin, as a result of a particularly tragic crash in \nMarch of this year. A van carrying 14 young people overturned due to \nreckless driving, killing seven and injuring the others, many \nseriously. The driver had a suspended license and a series of \nviolations. Unfortunately this is not an isolated incident. Since 1992, \nforty-two sales people have been killed or injured in similar crashes. \nThe company involved in the Wisconsin crash had 92 labor violations and \n105 violations for soliciting without a license.\n  Regrettably, there is more to these companies than just bad driving \nrecords. In 1987 Senator Roth, as part of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations looked into this industry, and was appalled at what he \nfound. Incidents of verbal and physical abuse of workers were \nwidespread. Young people were coerced into continuing to sell long \nafter they wanted to leave through threats and taunts from their \nemployees. When sellers were able to get free they were often unpaid or \ndenied the bus ticket home they were promised when they signed up.\n  The compensation system for the workers was also rigged to ensure \nthat workers could not leave. Prospective sellers were promised big \nbucks when they were recruited, but soon found that decent pay was \ndifficult to come by. Sellers were paid on a commission basis according \nto their sales, but they were also charged by the company for their \naccommodations and fined for small infractions like showing up late to \nmeetings or sleeping on the van. Salespeople were not paid in a timely \nmanner, but their earnings were kept on ``paper'' and the employees \nonly drew a daily allowance to pay for food. Employees were seldom \nallowed to see the paper work that tracked their earnings so they had \nlittle idea about how much they are entitled. Many found that they were \nnot able to keep up with the sales and fell in debt to the company. \nAfter working 12 hours days, six days a week for months, employees \nactually owed the company money! These young people became indentured \nservants, working long hours for only room and board.\n  In the twelve years since Senator Roth's investigation, nothing has \nchanged. These abuses continue, and Congress should act.\n  In the Wisconsin case the company's record of disregard for local and \nstate laws was a signal of their disdain for the safety of their \nworkers. This company should not have been allowed to continue to \noperate with this kind of record. Government needed to step in earlier, \nbefore this tragedy occurred, instead of picking up the pieces \nafterward.\n  I am not one to frivolously engage in regulating business, but in \nthis case the need for federal involvement is clear. Because of the \nmobility of these companies, states cannot crack down on these groups \nalone. They need federal help to eliminate the unscrupulous actors in \nthe industry.\n  The Traveling Sales Crew Protection Act would take important steps to \neliminate employers who abuse their workers. First, it would no longer \nallow minors to be employed in this line of work. Door to door sales \ncan be dangerous work and combined with the long hours and hazardous \ntravel, creates a job too dangerous for children. Second, the bill \nwould narrowly eliminate the exemption under the Fair Labor Standards \nAct for these specific kinds of operations. Covering these employees \nwith minimum wages laws and overtime requirements protects them from \nbecoming indentured servants to their employers through complex \ncompensation systems. This provision is carefully crafted to cover only \ntraveling sales crews, individuals who sell over the road, or at trade \nshows would be unaffected. Lastly the bill creates a licensing \nprocedure through the Department of Labor to monitor those engaged in \nsupervising and running these operations.\n  These measures are important steps forward in a nationwide effort to \neliminate this particularly abusive form of worker exploitation. I hope \nI will have my colleagues support as I try to make the painful crash in \nJanesville, the last chapter in this shameful story.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1989\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

\n     authority of this section shall be paid into the Treasury of \n     the United States.\n       (d) Private Right of Action.--\n       (1) in general.--Any traveling sales crew worker aggrieved \n     by a violation of this title, or any regulation promulgated \n     under this title, by an employer may file suit in any \n     district court of the United States having jurisdiction over \n     the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy and \n     without regard to exhaustion of any alternative \n     administrative remedies provided for in this title.\n       (2) Damages.--\n       (A) In general.--If the court in an action under paragraph \n     (1) finds that the defendant intentionally violated a \n     provision of this Act, or a regulation promulgated

\n     plaintiff per violation or, if such complaint is certified as \n     a class action, not more than $1,000,000 for all plaintiffs \n     in the class; or\n       (iii) other equitable relief.\n       (B) Determination of amount.--In determining the amount of \n     damages to be awarded under subparagraph (A), the court may \n     consider whether an attempt was made to resolve the issues in \n     dispute before the resort to litigation.\n       (C) Workers' compensation.--\n       (i) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this title, where a State workers' compensation law is \n     applicable and coverage is provided for a traveling sales \n     crew worker, the workers' compensation benefits shall be the \n     exclusive remedy for loss of such worker under this title in \n     the case of bodily injury or death in accordance with such \n     State's workers' compensation law.\n       (ii) Limitation.--The exclusive remedy provided for under \n     clause (i) precludes the recovery under subparagraph (A) of \n     actual damages for loss from an injury or death but does not \n     preclude recovery under such subparagraph for statutory \n     damages (as provided for in clause (iii)) or equitable \n     relief, except that such relief shall not include back or \n     front pay or in any manner, directly or indirectly, expand or \n

compensation law.\n       (II) The defendant was found by the court or was determined \n     in a previous administrative or judicial proceeding to have \n     violated a safety standard prescribed by the Secretary under \n     section 204 and such violation resulted in the injury or \n     death of the plaintiff or plaintiffs.\n       (III) The defendant willfully disabled or removed a safety \n     device prescribed by the Secretary under section 204, or the \n     defendant in conscious disregard of the requirements of such \n     section failed to provide a safety device required by the \n     Secretary, and such disablement, removal, or failure to \n     provide a safety device resulted in the injury or death of \n     the plaintiff or plaintiffs.\n       (IV) At the time of the

or related to this title, or has testified or is about to \n     testify in any such proceedings, or because of the exercise, \n     with just cause, by such worker on behalf of the worker or \n     others of any right or protection afforded by this title.\n       (2) Complaint.--\n       (A) In general.--A traveling sales crew worker who \n     believes, with just cause, that such worker has

A bill to designate the Federal building located at 501 I \nStreet in Sacramento, California, as the ``Joe\n\n[[Page S15106]]\n\nSerna, Jr. United States Courthouse and Federal Building''; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n      joe serna, jr. united states courthouse and federal building\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto honor one of the finest mayors to serve in California. My state, \nparticularly my constituents in Sacramento lost a great Californian \nthis fall with the passing of Sacramento Mayor Joe Serna.\n  My bill will name the new Federal Courthouse at 501 I Street the \n``Joe Serna, Jr. United States Courthouse and Federal Building'' in \nhonor of his contributions to Sacramento and the working men and women \nof California. Joe Serna was a man of great vision, courage, energy, \nwarmth, and humor.\n  He was also a living embodiment of the American Dream: a first-\ngeneration American who helped to reshape the capital of our nation's \nlargest state.\n  Mayor Serna was born in 1939, the son of Mexican immigrants. As the \noldest of four children, Joe grew up in a bunkhouse and worked with his \nfamily in the beet fields around Lodi.\n  Mayor Serna never forgot his roots. After attending Sacramento City \nCollege and graduating from California State University, Sacramento, he \nserved in the Peace Corps and went to work for the United Farm Workers, \nwhere Cesar Chavez became his mentor and role model.\n  After serving on the city's redevelopment agency in the 1970s, Mayor \nSerna was elected to the Council himself in 1981. He was elected mayor \nin 1992 and re-elected in 1996, winning both races by wide margins. \nThroughout his terms in office, he continued to work as a professor of \ngovernment and ethnic studies at his alma mater, Cal State Sacramento.\n  Mayor Serna virtually rebuilt the city of Sacramento. He forged \npublic-private partnerships to redevelop the downtown, revitalize the \nneighborhoods, and reform the public school system. He presided over an \nurban renaissance that transformed Sacramento into a dynamic modern \nmetropolis. The new Sacramento Federal Building is a visible reminder \nof the redevelopment of Sacramento. Naming this building after Mayor \nSerna would be a fitting tribute.\n  Mayor Serna died as he lived: with great strength and dignity. Last \nmonth, as he publicly discussed his impending death from cancer, he \nsaid, ``I was supposed to live and die as a farm worker, not as a mayor \nand a college professor. I have everything to be thankful for. I have \nthe people to thank for allowing me to be their mayor. I have society \nto thank for the opportunity it has given me.''\n  Mr. President, it is we who are thankful today for having had such a \nman serve the people of California, and I ask my colleagues to support \nthis legislation to honor the legacy of Joe Serna, Jr.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1990\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF JOE SERNA, JR. UNITED STATES \n                   COURTHOUSE AND FEDERAL BUILDING.\n\n       The Federal building located at 501 I Street in Sacramento, \n     California, shall be known and designated as the ``Joe Serna, \n     Jr. United States Courthouse and Federal Building''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the Federal building \n     referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to \n     the Joe Serna, Jr. United States Courthouse and Federal \n     Building.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 1992. A bill to provide States with loans to enable State entities \nor local governments within the States to make interest payments on \nqualified school construction bonds issued by the State entities or \nlocal governments, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n  building, renovating, improving, and constructing kids' schools act\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Building, \nRenovating, Improving, and Constructing Kids' Schools (BRICKS) Act''--\nlegislation that would address our nation's burgeoning need for K-12 \nschool construction, renovation, and repair. The legislation would \naccomplish this in a fiscally-responsible manner while seeking to find \nthe middle ground between those who support a very direct, active \nfederal role in school construction, and those who are concerned about \nan expanded federal role in what has been--and remains--a state and \nlocal responsibility.\n  Mr. President, the condition of many of our nation's existing public \nschools is abysmal even as the need for additional schools and \nclassroom space grows. Specifically, according to reports issued by the \nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) in 1995 and 1996, fully one-third of \nall public schools needing extensive repair or replacement.\n  As further evidence of this problem, an issue brief prepared by the \nNational Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in 1999 stated that the \naverage public school in America is 42 years old, with school buildings \nbeginning rapid deterioration after 40 years. In addition, the NCES \nbrief found that 29 percent of all public schools are in the ``oldest \ncondition,'' which means that they were built prior to 1970 and have \neither never been renovated or were renovated prior to 1980.\n  Not only are our nation's schools in need of repair and renovation, \nbut there is a growing demand for additional schools and classrooms due \nto an ongoing surge in student enrollment. Specifically, according to \nthe NCES, at least 2,400 new public schools will need to be built by \nthe year 2003 to accommodate our nation's burgeoning school rolls, \nwhich will grow from a record 52.7 million children today to 54.3 \nmillion by 2008.\n  Needless to say, the cost of addressing our nation's need for school \nrenovations and construction is enormous. In fact, according to the \nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO), it will cost $112 billion just to \nbring our nation's schools into good overall condition. Nowhere is this \ncost better understood than in my home state of Maine, where a \nrecently-completed study by the Maine Department of Education and the \nState Board of Education determined that the cost of addressing the \nstate's school building and construction needs stood at $637 million.\n  Mr. President, we simply cannot allow our nation's schools to fall \ninto utter disrepair and obsolescence with children sitting in \nclassrooms that have leaky ceilings or rotting walls. We cannot ignore \nthe need for new schools as the record number of children enrolled in \nK-12 schools continues to grow.\n  Accordingly, because the cost of repairing and building these \nfacilities may prove to be more than many state and local governments \ncan bear in a short period of time, I believe the federal government \ncan and should assist Maine and other state and local governments in \naddressing this growing national crisis.\n  Admittedly, not all members support strong federal intervention in \nwhat has been historically a state and local responsibility. In fact, \nmany argue with merit that the best form of federal assistance for \nschool construction or other local educational needs would be for the \nfederal government to fulfill its commitment to fund 40 percent of the \ncost of special education. This long-standing commitment was made when \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education (IDEA) Act was signed into \nlaw more than 20 years ago, but the federal government has fallen \nwoefully short in upholding its end of the bargain, only recently \nincreasing its share to approximately 10 percent.\n  Needless to say, I strongly agree with those who argue that the \nfederal government's failure to fulfill this mandate represents nothing \nless than a raid on the pocketbook of every state and local government. \nAccordingly, I am pleased that recent efforts in the Congress have \nincreased federal funding for IDEA by a full 85 percent over the past \nthree years, and I support ongoing efforts to achieve the 40 percent \nfederal commitment in the near future.\n  Yet, even as we work to fulfill this long-standing commitment and \nthereby free up local resources to address local needs, I believe the \nfederal government can do more to assist state and local governments in \naddressing their school construction needs without infringing on local \ncontrol.\n\n[[Page S15107]]\n\n   Mr. President, the legislation I am offering today--the ``BRICKS \nAct''--will do just that . Specifically, it addresses our nation's \nschool construction needs in a responsible fiscal manner while bridging \nthe gap between those who advocate a more activist federal role in \nschool construction and those who do not.\n  First, my legislation will provide $20 billion in federal loans to \nsupport school construction, renovation, and repair at the local level. \nBy designating that these loans may only be used to pay the interests \nowed to bondholders on new, 15-year school construction bonds that are \nissued by state and local governments through the year 2002, the \nfederal government will leverage the issuing of new bonds by states and \nlocalities that would not otherwise be made.\n  Of importance, these loan moneys--which will be distributed on an \nannual basis using the Title I distribution formula--will become \navailable to each state at the request of a Governor. While the federal \nloans can only be used to support bond issues that will supplement, and \nnot supplant, the amount of school construction that would have \noccurred in the absence of the loans, there will be no requirement that \nstates engage in a lengthy application process that does not even \nassure them of their rightful share of the $20 billion pot.\n  Second, my bill ensures that these loans are made by the federal \ngovernment in a fiscally responsible manner that does not cut into the \nSocial Security surplus or claim a portion of non-Social Security \nsurpluses that may prove ephemeral in the future.\n  Specifically, my bill would make these loans to states from the \nExchange Stabilization Fund (ESF)--a fund that was created through the \nGold Reserve Act of 1934 and has grown to hold more than $40 billion in \nassets. The principal activity of the fund--which is controlled solely \nby the Secretary of the Treasury--is foreign exchange intervention that \nis intended to limit fluctuations in exchange rates. However, the fund \nhas also been used to provide stabilization loans to foreign countries, \nincluding a $20 billion line of credit to Mexico in 1995 to support the \npeso.\n  In light of the controversial manner in which the ESF has been used, \nsome have argued that additional constraints should be placed on the \nfund. Still others--including former Federal Reserve Board Governor \nLawrence B. Lindsey--have stated that, for various reasons, the fund \nshould be liquidated.\n  Regardless of how one feels about exercising greater constraint over \nthe ESF or liquidating it, I believe that if this $40 billion fund can \nbe used to bailout foreign currencies, it certainly can be used to help \nAmerica's schools.\n  Accordingly, I believe it is appropriate that the $20 billion in \nloans provided by my legislation will be made from the ESF--an amount \nidentical to the line of credit that was extended to Mexico by the \nSecretary of the Treasury in 1995. Of importance, these loans will be \nmade from the ESF on a progressive, annual basis--not in a sudden or \nimmediate manner. Furthermore, these monies will be repaid to the fund \nwith interest, to ensure that the ESF is compensated for the loans it \nmakes.\n  Although the ESF will recoup all of the monies it lends plus \ninterest, it should also be noted that my proposal ensures that state \nand local governments will not be forced to pay excessive interest--or \nthat they will be forced to repay over an unreasonable time line. \nSpecifically, my bill sets the interest rate for the loans at the \naverage prime lending rate for the year in which the bonds are issued, \nwith a cap of 4.5 percent--an amount that is lower than the prime \nlending rate in any of the previous 15 years. Furthermore, no payments \nwill be owed--and no interest will accrue--until 2005, unless the \nfederal government fulfills its commitment to fund 40 percent of the \ncost of special education prior to that time.\n  Combined, these provisions will minimize the cost of these loans to \nthe states, and maximize the utilization of these loans for school \nconstruction, renovation, and repair.\n   Mr. President, by providing low-interest loans to states and local \ngovernments to support school construction, I believe that my bill \nrepresents a fiscally-responsible, centrist solution to a national \nproblem.\n  For those who support a direct, active federal role in school \nconstruction, my bill provides substantial federal assistance by \ndedicating $20 billion to leverage a significant amount of new school \nconstruction bonds. For those who are concerned about the federal \ngovernment becoming overly-engaged in an historically state and local \nresponsibility--and thereby stepping on local control--my bill directs \nthat the monies provided to states will be repaid with interest, and \nthat no onerous applications or demands are placed on states to receive \ntheir share of these monies.\n   Mr. President, I urge that my colleagues support the ``BRICKS \nAct''--legislation that is intended to bridge the gap between competing \nphilosophies on the federal role in school construction. Ultimately, if \nwe work together, we can make a tangible difference in the condition of \nAmerica's schools without turning it into a partisan or ideological \nbattle that is better suited to sound bites than actual solutions.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1992\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Building, Renovating, \n     Improving, and Constructing Kids' Schools Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress make the following findings:\n       (1) According to a 1999 issue brief prepared by the \n     National Center for Education Statistics, the average public \n     school in America is 42 years old, and school buildings begin \n     rapid deterioration after 40 years. In addition, 29 percent \n     of all public schools are in the oldest condition, meaning \n     that the schools were built before 1970 and have either never \n     been renovated or were renovated prior to 1980.\n       (2) According to reports issued by the General Accounting \n     Office (GAO) in 1995 and 1996, it would cost $112,000,000,000 \n     to bring the Nation's schools into good overall condition, \n     and one-third of all public schools need extensive repair or \n     replacement.\n       (3) Many schools do not have the appropriate infrastructure \n     to support computers and other technologies that are \n     necessary to prepare students for the jobs of the 21st \n     century.\n       (4) Without impeding on local control, the Federal \n     Government appropriately can assist State and local \n     governments in addressing school construction, renovation, \n     and repair needs by providing low-interest loans for purposes \n     of paying interest on related bonds.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to reform Government information security by \nstrengthening information security practices throughout the Federal \nGovernment; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n              government information security act of 1999\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill on \nbehalf of myself as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee and \nSenator Lieberman, the Committee's ranking minority member, on an issue \nof great importance to our committee and the nation--the security of \nFederal government computer systems.\n  Over the last decade, the Federal Government, like most private-\nsector organizations, has become enormously dependent on interconnected \ncomputer systems, including the Internet, to support its operations and \naccount for its assets. This explosion in interconnectivity has \nresulted in many benefits. In particular, it has increased \nproductivity, made enormous amounts of useful information instantly \navailable to millions of people, and contributed to the economic boom \nof the 1990s.\n  However, the factors that generate these benefits--widely accessible \ndata and instantaneous communication--also increase the risks that \ninformation will be misused, possibly to commit fraud or other crimes, \nor that sensitive information will be in appropriately disclosed. In \naddition, our government's, as well as our nation's, dependence on this \ncomputer support makes it susceptible to devastating disruptions in \ncritical services, as well as in computer-based safety and financial \ncontrols. Such disruptions could be caused by sabotage, natural \ndisasters, or widespread system faults, as illustrated by the Y2K date \nconversion concerns.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee spent considerable time during the \nlast Congress on this issue with a specific emphasis on information \nsecurity and cyberterrorism. We uncovered and identified failures of \ninformation security affecting our international security and \nvulnerability to domestic and international terrorism. We highlighted \nour nation's vulnerability to computer attacks--from international and \ndomestic terrorists to crime rings to everyday hackers. We directed GAO \nto prepare a ``best practices'' guide on computer security for Federal \nagencies to use, and we asked GAO to study computer security \nvulnerabilities at several Federal agencies including the Internal \nRevenue Service, the State Department, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, the Social Security Administration, and the Veterans' \nAdministration.\n  As a result of its work, GAO identified many specific weaknesses in \nagency controls and concluded that the underlying cause was inadequate \nsecurity program planning and management. In particular, agencies were \naddressing identified weaknesses on a piecemeal basis rather than \nproactively addressing systemic causes that diminished security \neffectiveness throughout the agency.\n  That is not to say that nothing is being done. Many in the executive \nbranch recognize that action is needed to improve Federal information \nsecurity, and several efforts have been initiated. For example, in May \n1998, Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 63 directed the National \nSecurity Council to lead a variety of efforts intended to improve \ncritical infrastructure protection, including protection of Federal \nagency information infrastructures, and required major agencies to \ndevelop plans to protect their own critical computer-based systems.\n  But despite a flurry of activity in this area and a number of \nstatutes already on the books which deal with the issues, we have \nconcluded that a more complete and meaningful statutory foundation for \nimprovement is needed. The primary objective of this legislation is to \nupdate existing information security statutory requirements to address \nthe management challenges associated with operating in the current \ninterconnected computing environment.\n  We begin where the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and the Clinger-\nCohen Act of 1996 left off. These laws, and the computer Security Act \nof 1987, provided the basic framework for managing information \nsecurity. This legislation which we introduce today will update and \nclarify existing requirements and responsibilities of Federal agencies \nin dealing with information security.\n  The Government Information Security Act:\n  Strengthens the Office of Management and Budget's information \nsecurity duties, consistent with its existing responsibilities under \nthe Paperwork Reduction Act;\n  Establishes Federal agency accountability for information security as \nneeded to cost-effectively protect the assets and operations of the \nagency by creating a set of management requirements derived from GAO \n``Best Practices'' audit work;\n  Requires agencies to have an annual independent evaluation of their \ninformation security programs and practices to assess compliance with \nauthorized requirements and to test effectiveness of information \nsecurity control techniques;\n  Provides for the application of a unified and logical set of \ngovernmentwide controls by including national security systems within \nthe application of the legislation; and\n  Focuses on the importance of training programs and governmentwide \nincident handling.\n  We recognize that these aren't the only things that need to be done. \nSome have suggested we provide specific standards in the legislation. \nOthers\n\n[[Page S15109]]\n\nhave recommended we establish a new position of a National Chief \nInformation Officer. These and, no doubt, many other proposals will be \nconsidered as we debate this important issue. But this legislation is \nintended as a good first step to better define roles among Federal \nagencies in order to develop a fully secure government.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill we are \nintroducing be printed in the Record.\n\n                                S. 1993\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take \n     effect 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with \nSenator Thompson in introducing the Government Information Security Act \nof 1999. This bill would put a management structure in place for the \nimplementation of risk-based computer security measures across the \ngovernment.\n  We are introducing this bill in the closing days of this session with \nthe hope that it will serve as the basis for launching a discussion \nabout the most effective ways to improve government's approach to \ncomputer security. We invite and look forward to comments from \ngovernment agencies, industry and academic experts, think tanks and \nothers who have been involved in this field.\n  Like the rest of the nation,the government is increasingly dependent \non computer and other electronic information systems to collect, \nanalyze and preserve important data and perform vital tasks. Government \ncomputer systems are rife with sensitive information pertaining to the \nfundamentals of our existence--our national security, the strength of \nour economy, transportation and communications systems, and the \npersonal lives of millions of individual citizens. The Department of \nDefense and other national security agencies control our weapons of \nmass destruction and track the offensive movements of enemy states \nthrough complex computer programs; the Internal Revenue Service \nmaintains an automated systems wage information on every working \nAmerican; the Federal Reserve calculates key economic indicators \nelectronically and the Center for Disease Control relies on computers \nto tracks threats to the nation's public health.\n  And yet, this computer-reliant infrastructure is frighteningly \nvulnerable to exploitation not only by trouble-makers and professional \nhackers but by organized crime and international terrorists. Indeed, a \ndisruption of our communications, transportation and energy sections \ncould prove as destructive as any conventional weapons attack to our \nability to defend our privacy, our safety, even our freedom.\n  Indeed, witnesses before the Governmental Affairs Committee last \nCongress testified that the government's reliance on computer systems \nis not matched by a concomitant growth in the security of those \nsystems. A series of Government Accounting Office studies found \ngovernment computer security so lax that it landed on the GAO's list of \n``high risk'' government programs. For example, this year, GAO reported \nthat one of its test teams gained access to mission critical computer \nsystems at NASA which would have allowed the team to control spacecraft \nor alter data returned from space. In May 1998, the GAO was able to \ngain unauthorized access to the State Department's networks which would \nhave enabled GAO to modify, delete or download important data and \nshutdown services. And the GAO reported in September 1998 that \ninadequate information system controls by the Veterans Administration \nthreatened the disruption or misuse of service delivery to the men and \nwomen who have fought our wars.\n  Less significant on a global scale, but of utmost concern to \nindividual citizens is the extent to which inadequate security leaves \npersonal information, and therefore people, vulnerable to exposure and \nexploitation. Our legislation will address personal information \nmaintained by the government such as benefits and tax data and \ndemographics culled from personal information we supply to the Census \nBureau.\n  While the GAO's work is compelling, I am convinced by two other \ndevelopments that legislation in this area needs to be addressed \nquickly. First, we have been intensely focused throughout the year on \nfixing the computer problems associated with Y2K. Ensuring that the \ninformation our government collects and produces is secure may seem \nsimilar to the Y2K issue because both reflect our dependency on \ncomputers and their vulnerability to programming failures and outside \ndisruptions. The need for secure government computer systems, however, \nwill not disappear in the first days and weeks of the year 2000. \nIndeed, it will be with us until we have a structure within the \ngovernment dedicated to fixing these problems.\n  Second,we have spent significant time this session digging into the \nLos Alamo National Laboratory espionage scandal and allegations that an \nemployee improperly downloaded classified material to an unclassified \ncomputer. The Energy and Justice Departments are still looking into \nthis breach of security, but it should focus everyone's attention on \nthe vulnerability associated with extensive reliance computers and the \nundeniable need for improvements in how we manage and secure these \nsystems.\n  Mr. President, the goal of the bill we are introducing today is to \nprotect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of information \nand ensure that critical improvements in the management of our computer \nsecurity system take place. Specifically, our bill would:\n  Require high-level accountability. The Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget will be accountable for overseeing policy while \nthe agency heads will be accountable for developing specific security \nplans.\n  Require agency heads to develop and implement security plans and \npolicies based on the appropriate level of risk for the different type \nof information the agency maintains. We need to ensure that each \nagency's plan reflects an understanding that computer security must be \nan integral part of the development process for any new system. \nAgencies now tend to develop a system and consider security issues only \nas an afterthought, if at all.\n  Establish an ongoing, periodic reporting, testing and evaluation \nprocess to gauge the effectiveness of the policies and procedures. This \nwould be accomplished through agency budgets, program performance and \nfinancial management.\n  Require an independent, annual audit of all information security \npractices and programs within an agency. The audit would be conducted \neither by the agency's Inspector General, GAO or an independent \nexternal auditor. GAO has told us that an audit requirement is \nessential to monitoring agencies' management of information security \nand to ensure that these systems are kept current.\n  Require that agencies report unauthorized intrusions into government \nsystems. GSA currently has a program where agencies can report and seek \nhelp to respond to intrusions into their information systems and share \ninformation concerning common vulnerabilities and threats. Our bill \nwould require agencies to use this reporting and monitoring system.\n  Mr. President, the provisions of this bill would apply to all \ninformation, including classified and unclassified information \nmaintained on civilian and national security systems. We are also \nconsidering whether the bill's provisions should apply to government \nowned, contractor operated facilities including laboratories engaged in \nnational defense research. We look forward to discussions with the \ndefense and intelligence communities on how best to address these \nissues.\n  There are a number of areas we have not addressed, and I welcome \ncomments on how best to handle these areas. For example:\n  We need to ensure that computer security systems will not interfere \nwith the ability of agencies to share data and communicate with each \nother and the rest of the world. The new era of ``e-business'' and ``e-\ngovernment'' holds untold opportunities for improving government \nefficiency, and that's something we want to encourage.\n  The government needs to rapidly and safely increase the number of \ntrained technical information security professionals. There are a range \nof approaches to addressing this need, including incentives to \nuniversities to train more people in this area; contracting out to the \nprivate sector; establishing a CyberCorps at universities based on the \nROTC model; or establishing special career designations for personnel \nspecializing in computer security.\n\n[[Page S15112]]\n\n  We should consider whether current technology will meet the \ngovernment's computer security needs or whether we need to develop \nincentives for technology development. A Presidential advisory \ncommittee is developing recommendations based on a national laboratory \nmodel to conduct research and development of security technology with a \npossible secondary focus on testing.\n  We are interested in exploring whether provisions in this bill \naddressing risk and technology standards, which are now voluntary, \nconsensus-based standards, should be issued as minimum mandatory \nrequirements for successive levels of risk.\n  And we will also consider issues relating to budgetary needs, privacy \nrequirements, performance measures and how best to coordinate \ninformation security and management within the federal government.\n  Mr. President, I expect what we have proposed will generate a hearty \ndebate. As I have said, I consider this bill a work in progress, so I \nlook forward to hearing from a wide range of interested parties and to \nworking with the Chairman to craft the best possible legislation to \nprotect the integrity and the confidentiality of the government's vast \nstorehouse of information.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 1994. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nassistance to first-time homebuyers; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               the first time homebuyer affordability act\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, earlier this week I laid out an agenda for \nrestoring the federal role in expanding the nation's stock of \naffordable housing. Today, I am making a small downpayment on that \npromise with the First Time Homebuyer Affordability Act. This \nlegislation, which I am introducing with Senator Bryan, will create new \nhomeownership opportunities for many Americans by allowing them to \nborrow from their Investment Retirement Accounts (IRAs), or their \nparents or grandparents IRAs, on a tax free basis for a downpayment on \na first home. The legislation would also allow IRA funds to be used \nunder an equity participation agreement. In both cases, the funds would \nhave to be repaid to the IRA.\n  We have all talked about the importance of homeownership. Indeed, \nhomeownership makes a very significant contribution to solving many \nsocial problems we face in America. Children of homeowners are less \nlikely to become involved in the criminal justice system; they are less \nlikely to drop out of school, or have children out of wedlock. \nHomeowners vote more often and participate more in community \norganizations and activities.\n  Yet, the single biggest barrier to homeownership is a downpayment. \nThis legislation will help hundreds of thousands of homeowners surmount \nthis barrier and realize the American dream.\n  Mr. President, it is ironic that IRAs today can be invested in almost \nany asset, including real estate investment trusts, except one's own \nhome. Yet, homeownership continues to be a winning investment, both for \nthe family and the community.\n  Under current law, individuals may borrow up to $10,000 from their \n401(k) retirement accounts to help buy a home without paying taxes. \nThis legislation would put IRAs on the same footing as 401(k) plans \nwhile unlocking $2 trillion in IRA saving to help families become \nhomeowners. It has a number of protections to ensure that the loan or \ninvestment will be repaid, with interest, or a taxes will be owed and a \npenalty assessed.\n  This is good legislation, which has been endorsed by the Mortgage \nBankers Association, the National Association of Realtors, and the \nNational Association of Homebuilders. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to add our support for your \n     efforts to enhance homeownership opportunities through \n     expanded use for first time homebuyers of their Individual \n     Retirement Accounts (IRAs). We will work closely with you and \n     your colleagues to include this important provision in the \n     Senate Tax Bill.\n       The United States has recently achieved a record \n     homeownership rate, rising home prices, combined with a \n     significant downpayment hurdle, continue to put homeownership \n     out of the reach of many families and individuals. Finding \n     ways to overcome the downpayment issue is critical to the \n     effort to make homeownership more affordable and obtainable \n     for these families and individuals. Your proposal provides \n     this bridge to enhance homeownership for millions of \n     Americans.\n       Your plan would build upon the penalty waiver provisions \n     enacted in the 105th Congress to improve access to the $2 \n     trillion held in IRAs for first time home purchase. Penalty \n     waiver provisions now permit people to withdraw up to $10,000 \n     from an IRA account for the purchase of a first time home \n     without incurring a 10 percent premature withdrawal penalty.\n       However, even with the penalty waiver, a prospective \n     homebuyer still owes federal and state taxes on the amount \n     withdrawn from the IRA. This reduces the amount available for \n     downpayment by thousands of dollars. The plan would eliminate \n     such tax consequences by allowing an individual to borrow up \n     to $10,000 from their IRA account or a parent's IRA account, \n     for a first time home purchase without a tax penalty. IRA \n     funds may also be used under an equity sharing arrangement.\n       At present, holders of 401(k) retirement accounts may \n     borrow up to 50 percent of account assets, with a floor of \n     $10,000 and a ceiling of $50,000, for any personal use. \n     However, borrowing from an IRA account is prohibited, even \n     for a first time home purchase.\n       We will work with you to move this key proposal forward to \n     enhance and expand homeownership for all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n       Mortgage Bankers Association of America.\n       National Association of Realtors.\n       National Association of Home Builders.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 1995. A bill to amend the National School Lunch Act to revise the \neligibility of private organizations under the child and adult care \nfood program; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n   legislation to amend the national school lunch act to revise the \n  eligibility of private organizations under the child and adult care \n                              food program\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will correct an unintended obstacle in current law and expand the \nnumber of low-income children in child care centers that receive \nnutritious meals through the Child and Adult Care Food Program.\n  The current CACFP law provides for subsidies to proprietary child \ncare centers for the nutritious meals they serve children, provided \nthat at least 25% of the participants receive Title XX subsidies. This \nprovision was included to encourage private child care providers to \nserve more low-income children, by providing funds to reimburse the \ncosts of providing meals. When the law was enacted in 1981, it made \nsense to tie CACFP funds to Title XX, because Title XX was the primary \nsource of Federal child care assistance at that time.\n  As we all know, however, the Child Care & Development Block Grant has \nsince become the States' primary funding source for child care \nassistance, while Title XX funds are being used primarily for other \nsocial service needs. This means that although many proprietary child \ncare centers have enrollments with over 25% low-income children, those \nwho no longer receive Title XX are no longer eligible for the CACFP \nmeal subsidy.\n  Thirty-eight States are currently using small amounts of their Title \nXX funds for child care subsidies so that at least some of the \notherwise eligible children will receive meals in proprietary centers. \nIn Wisconsin, for example, 65 proprietary centers are currently \nparticipating in the CACFP program, serving 3,294 children. However, if \nall eligible centers were able to participate, those numbers could \nincrease to 149 proprietary centers serving 8,195 children, an increase \nof 4,901 children. A simple change in the law to reflect the current \nnature of Federal child care assistance could lead to Wisconsin \nreceiving nearly $2,975,000 each year in Federal food subsidies for \nlow-income children in child care.\n  The bill I introduce today is simple. It would eliminate the outdated \nrequirement that eligible children receive Title XX funds in order to \ntrigger the CACFP meal subsidy. This would allow proprietary centers to \nparticipate in CACFP if at least 25% of the\n\n[[Page S15113]]\n\nchildren they serve are eligible for a food nutrition subsidy. This \nchange will ensure that proprietary centers will be able to continue to \nserve low-income children. It reduces pressure on proprietary centers \nto increase their rates for non-subsidized children to recover the \ncosts of unreimbursed meals for subsidized children. It preserves the \nright of parents, including low-income parents, to choose the quality \nchild care center that is most appropriate for their children. And most \nimportantly, this change reinforces the original intent of the law: to \nensure that eligible low-income children in proprietary child care \ncenters have the benefit of a nutritious meal. I hope that all of my \ncolleagues will join me in cosponsoring this legislation and I look \nforward to working for its swift passage when Congress reconvenes in \nJanuary.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 1997. A bill to simplify Federal oil and gas revenue \ndistributions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n           mineral revenue payments clarification act of 1999\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing \nlegislation which will end the practice of charging States for costs \nthe Federal Government incurs in managing Federal mineral leases.\n  The Mineral Revenue Payments Clarification Act of 1999 will eliminate \nnet receipts sharing, allowing Federal agencies to more rationally and \nfairly apportion to States their share of Federal mineral revenues.\n  Since enactment of the Mineral Leasing Act in 1920, Congress has \ndetermined that it was fair and appropriate to share with States a \nportion of the money received by the United States for Federal mineral \nleases located within the State. Under current law, for most mineral \nleases the State share is 50 percent, except for Alaska which receives \n90 percent.\n  In 1993, a permanent provision was added to the Omnibus \nAppropriations Act that requires the Department of the Interior to \ndeduct from a State's share 50 percent of the Federal Government's \ncosts of administering Federal mineral leases within that State. This \nnew requirement substantially lowers the amounts States receive, but \nwas added without either explanation or justification as to why such a \ndeduction is either fair or appropriate.\n  Furthermore, the statutory procedures for figuring these deductions \nare cumbersome to the point of being unworkable. The Federal agencies \ncharged with administering these requirements have found them \ndifficult, and sometimes impossible, to implement in any consistent \nfashion.\n  In November of 1997, the Inspector General of the Department of the \nInterior found that the Department had inaccurately calculated the \ncosts involved in administering the Federal onshore mineral leasing \nprogram, resulting in substantial overcharges to States. This issue has \nyet to be fully resolved by the Department of the Interior.\n  Needless to say, this complicated and unjustified provision has been \ncontroversial with the States and unpopular with the Federal agencies \ncharged with administering it. It penalizes States while creating \nadministrative nightmares for the Federal Government. It is time to do \naway with this unwieldy provision.\n  Therefore, I am introducing The Mineral Revenue Payments \nClarification Act of 1999, which will eliminate this provision and \nprovide that States' shares of payments under Federal mineral leases \nwill not be reduced by administrative or other costs incurred by the \nUnited States. I believe that this will return a system that is both \nfair, and capable of being administered in a reasonable \nfashion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"},

Mr. President, I'm submitting a resolution today \nexpressing a sense of the Senate regarding a heinous crime affecting a \nfamily in Virginia and a growing problem in this country. With this \nresolution, I seek to bring to your attention the plight of child \nabductions by noncustodial parents, and to encourage the United States \nand Saudi Arabia to immediately locate Nadia Dabbagh and return her \nsafely to her mother.\n  Ms. Maureen Dabbagh of Virginia Beach has not seen or heard from her \ndaughter, Nadia, in 6 years. When Nadia was just 3 years old, she was \nillegally abducted by her father, Mr. Mohamad Hisham Dabbagh, and the \nState Department believes they are currently in Saudia Arabia on \ntemporary visas. Throughout this ordeal, Maureen Dabbagh has been aided \nby many caring people, groups, and government agencies, but despite \nFBI, State Department, and Interpol efforts, Nadia is still separated \nfrom her mother.\n  According to the Department of Justice, 983 children are abducted by \nnoncustodial parents every day. I greatly sympathize with Maureen \nDabbagh and with all parents facing similar situations. I believe that \nwe, as Members of Congress and as parents, ought to use all available \nresources to locate missing and abducted children. I ask that we \nredouble our efforts to bring Nadia home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15116-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTON 240--COMMENDING STEPHEN G.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Millennium Digital Commerce \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The growth of electronic commerce and electronic \n     government transactions represent a powerful force for \n     economic growth, consumer choice, improved civic \n     participation and wealth creation.\n       (2) The promotion of growth in private sector electronic \n     commerce through Federal legislation is in the national \n     interest because that market is globally important to the \n     United States.\n       (3) A consistent legal foundation, across multiple \n     jurisdictions, for electronic commerce will promote the \n     growth of such transactions, and that such a foundation \n     should be based upon a simple, technology neutral, non-\n     regulatory, and market-based approach.\n       (4) The Nation and the world stand at the beginning of a \n     large scale transition to an information society which will \n     require innovative legal and policy approaches, and \n     therefore, States can serve the national interest by \n     continuing their proven role as laboratories of innovation \n     for quickly evolving areas of public policy, provided that \n     States also adopt a consistent, reasonable national baseline \n     to eliminate obsolete barriers to electronic commerce such as \n     undue paper and pen requirements, and further, that any such \n     innovation should not unduly burden inter-jurisdictional \n     commerce.\n       (5) To the extent State laws or regulations do not provide \n     a consistent, reasonable national baseline or in fact create \n     an undue burden to interstate commerce in the important \n     burgeoning area of electronic commerce, the national interest \n     is best served by Federal preemption to the extent necessary \n     to provide such consistent, reasonable national baseline or \n     eliminate said burden, but that absent such lack of \n     consistent, reasonable national baseline or such undue \n     burdens, the best legal system for electronic commerce will \n     result from continuing experimentation by individual \n     jurisdictions.\n       (6) With due regard to the fundamental need for a \n     consistent national baseline, each jurisdiction that enacts \n     such laws should have the right to determine the need for any \n     exceptions to protect consumers and maintain consistency with \n     existing related bodies of law within a particular \n     jurisdiction.\n       (7) Industry has developed several electronic signature \n     technologies for use in electronic transactions, and the \n     public policies of the United States should serve to promote \n     a dynamic marketplace within which these technologies can \n     compete. Consistent with this Act, States should permit the \n     use and development of any authentication technologies that \n     are appropriate as practicable as between private parties and \n     in the use with State agencies.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to permit and encourage the continued expansion of \n     electronic commerce through the operation of free market \n     forces rather than proscriptive governmental mandates and \n     regulations;\n       (2) to promote public confidence in the validity, integrity \n     and reliability of electronic commerce and online government \n     under Federal law;\n       (3) to facilitate and promote electronic commerce by \n     clarifying the legal status of electronic records and \n     electronic signatures in the context of contract formation;\n       (4) to facilitate the ability of private parties engaged in \n     interstate transactions to agree among themselves on the \n     appropriate electronic signature technologies for their \n     transactions; and\n       (5) to promote the development of a consistent national \n     legal infrastructure necessary to support of electronic \n     commerce at the Federal and state levels within existing \n     areas of jurisdiction.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Electronic.--The term ``electronic'' means relating to \n     technology having electrical, digital, magnetic, wireless, \n     optical, electromagnetic, or similar capabilities.\n       (2) Electronic agent.--The term ``electronic agent'' means \n     a computer program or an electronic or other automated means \n     used to initiate an action or respond to electronic records \n     or performances in whole or in part without review by an \n     individual at the time of the action or response.\n       (3) Electronic record.--The term ``electronic record'' \n     means a record created, generated, sent, communicated, \n     received, or stored by electronic means.\n       (4) Electronic signature.--The term ``electronic \n     signature'' means an electronic sound, symbol, or process \n     attached to or logically associated with a record and \n     executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the \n     record.\n       (5) Governmental agency.--The term ``governmental agency'' \n     means an executive, legislative, or judicial agency, \n     department, board, commission, authority, or institution of \n     the Federal Government or of a State or of any county, \n     municipality, or other political subdivision of a State.\n       (6) Record.--The term ``record'' means information that is \n     inscribed on a tangible medium or that is stored in an \n     electronic or other medium and is retrievable in perceivable \n     form.\n       (7) Transaction.--The term ``transaction'' means an action \n     or set of actions relating to the conduct of commerce, \n     between 2 or more persons, neither of which is the United \n     States Government, a State, or an agency, department, board, \n     commission, authority, or institution of the United States \n     Government or of a State.\n       (8) Uniform electronic transactions act.--The term \n     ``Uniform Electronic Transactions Act'' means the Uniform \n     Electronic Transactions Act as provided to State legislatures \n     by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State \n     Law in that form of any substantially similar variation \n     thereof.\n\n     SEC. 5.

PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is only to clarify the application \n     to a church plan that is a welfare plan of State insurance \n     laws that require or solely relate to licensing, solvency, \n     insolvency, or the status of such plan as a single employer \n     plan.\n\n     SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF CHURCH WELFARE PLAN STATUS UNDER \n                   STATE INSURANCE LAW.\n\n       (a) In General.--For purposes of determining the status of \n     a church plan that is a welfare plan under provisions of a \n     State insurance law described in subsection (b), such a \n     church plan (and any trust under such plan) shall be deemed \n     to be a plan sponsored by a single employer that reimburses \n     costs from general church assets, or purchases insurance \n     coverage with general church assets, or both.\n       (b) State Insurance Law.--A State insurance law described \n     in this subsection is a law that--\n       (1) requires a church plan, or an organization described in \n     section 414(e)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and \n     section 3(33)(C)(i) of the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1002(33)(C)(i)) to the extent \n     that it is administering or funding such a plan, to be \n     licensed; or\n       (2) relates solely to the solvency or insolvency of a \n     church plan (including participation in State guaranty funds \n     and associations).\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n       (1) Church plan.--The term ``church plan'' has the meaning \n     given such term by section 414(e) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 and section 3(33) of the Employee Retirement \n     Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1002(33)).\n       (2) Reimburses costs from general church assets.--The term \n     ``reimburses costs from general church assets'' means \n     engaging in an activity that is not the spreading of risk \n     solely for the purposes of the provisions of State insurance \n     laws described in subsection (b).\n       (3) Welfare plan.--The term ``welfare plan''--\n       (A) means any church plan to the extent that such plan \n     provides medical, surgical, or hospital care or benefits, or \n     benefits in the event of sickness, accident, disability, \n     death or unemployment, or vacation benefits, apprenticeship \n     or other training programs, or day care centers, scholarship \n     funds, or prepaid legal services; and\n       (B) does not include any entity, such as a health insurance \n     issuer described in section 9832(b)(2) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 or a health maintenance organization \n     described in section 9832(b)(3) of such Code, or any other \n     organization that does business with the church plan or \n     organization sponsoring or maintaining such a plan.\n       (d) Enforcement Authority.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section, for purposes of enforcing \n     provisions of State insurance laws that apply to a church \n     plan that is a welfare plan, the church plan shall be subject \n     to State enforcement as if the church plan were an insurer \n     licensed by the State.\n       (e) Application of Section.--Except as provided in \n     subsection (d), the application of this section is limited to \n     determining the status of a church plan that is a welfare \n     plan under the provisions of State insurance laws described \n     in subsection (b).

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, was one of the \n     Nation's most prominent leaders, demonstrating true courage \n     during the Civil War, one of the greatest crises in the \n     Nation's history.\n       (2) Born of humble roots in Hardin County, Kentucky, on \n     February 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln rose to the Presidency \n     through a legacy of honesty, integrity, intelligence, and \n     commitment to the United States.\n       (3) With the belief that all men were created equal, \n     Abraham Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the \n     United States.\n       (4) Abraham Lincoln had a generous heart, with malice \n     toward none and with charity for all.\n       (5) Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for the \n     country Lincoln loved, dying from an assassin's bullet on \n     April 15, 1865.\n       (6) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of \n     Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln's life is a model for \n     accomplishing the ``American Dream'' through honesty, \n     integrity, loyalty, and a lifetime of education.\n       (7) The year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary of \n     the birth of Abraham Lincoln, and a commission should be \n     established to study and recommend to Congress activities \n     that are fitting and proper to celebrate that anniversary in \n     a manner that appropriately honors Abraham Lincoln.\n\n     SEC. 3.

IMPROVED INDEPENDENT LIVING PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) States are required to make reasonable efforts to find \n     adoptive families for all children, including older children, \n     for whom reunification with their biological family is not in \n     the best interests of the child. However, some older children \n     will continue to live in foster care. These children should \n     be enrolled in an Independent Living program designed and \n     conducted by State and local government to help prepare them \n     for employment, postsecondary education, and successful \n     management of adult responsibilities.\n       (2) Older children who continue to be in foster care as \n     adolescents may become eligible for Independent Living \n     programs. These Independent Living programs are not an \n     alternative to adoption for these children. Enrollment in \n     Independent Living programs can occur concurrent with \n     continued efforts to locate and achieve placement in adoptive \n     families for older children in foster care.\n       (3) About 20,000 adolescents leave the Nation's foster care \n     system each year because they have reached 18 years of age \n     and are expected to support themselves.\n       (4) Congress has received extensive information that \n     adolescents leaving foster care have significant difficulty \n     making a successful transition to adulthood; this information \n     shows that children aging out of foster care show high rates \n     of homelessness, non-marital childbearing, poverty, and \n     delinquent or criminal behavior; they are also frequently the \n     target of crime and physical assaults.\n       (5) The Nation's State and local governments, with \n     financial support from the Federal Government, should offer \n     an extensive program of education, training, employment, and \n     financial support for young adults leaving foster care, with \n     participation in such program beginning several years before \n     high school graduation and continuing, as needed, until the \n     young adults emancipated from foster care establish \n     independence or reach 21 years of age.\n       (b) Improved Independent Living Program.--Section 477 of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 677) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 477. JOHN H. CHAFEE FOSTER CARE INDEPENDENCE PROGRAM.\n\n       ``(a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to provide \n     States with flexible funding that will enable programs to be \n     designed and conducted--\n       ``(1) to identify children who are likely to remain in \n     foster care until 18 years of age and to help these children \n     make the transition to self-sufficiency by providing services \n     such as assistance in obtaining a high school diploma, career \n     exploration, vocational training, job placement and \n     retention, training in daily living skills, training in \n     budgeting and financial management skills, substance abuse \n     prevention, and preventive health activities (including \n     smoking avoidance, nutrition education, and pregnancy \n     prevention);\n       ``(2) to help children who are likely to remain in foster \n     care until 18 years of age receive the education, training, \n     and services necessary to obtain employment;\n       ``(3) to help children who are likely to remain in foster \n     care until 18 years of age prepare for and enter \n     postsecondary training and education institutions;\n       ``(4) to provide personal and emotional support to children \n     aging out of foster care, through mentors and the promotion \n     of interactions with dedicated adults;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cardiac Arrest Survival Act \n     of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Each year more than 250,000 adults suffer cardiac \n     arrest, usually away from a hospital. More than 95 percent of \n     them will die, in many cases because cardiopulmonary \n     resuscitation (``CPR''), defibrillation, and advanced life \n     support are provided too late to reverse the cardiac arrest. \n     These cardiac arrests occur primarily from occult underlying \n     heart disease and from drowning, allergic or sensitivity \n     reactions, or electrical shocks.\n       (2) Every minute that passes before returning the heart to \n     a normal rhythm after a cardiac arrest causes the chance of \n     survival to fall by 10 percent.\n       (3) In communities where strong public access to \n     defibrillation programs have been implemented, survival from \n     cardiac arrest has improved by as much as 20 percent.\n       (4) Survival from cardiac arrest requires successful early \n     implementation of a chain of events, known as the chain of \n     survival, which must be initiated as soon as the person \n     sustains a cardiac arrest and must continue until the person \n     arrives at the hospital.\n       (5) The chain of survival is the medical standard of care \n     for treatment of cardiac arrest.\n       (6) A successful chain of survival requires the first \n     person on the scene to take rapid and simple initial steps to \n     care for the patient and to assure that the patient promptly \n     enters the emergency medical services system. These steps \n     include--\n       (A) recognizing an emergency and activating the emergency \n     medical services system;\n       (B) beginning CPR; and\n       (C) using an automated external defibrillator (``AED'') if \n     one is available at the scene.\n       (7) The first persons at the scene of an arrest are \n     typically lay persons who are friends or family of the \n     victim, fire services, public safety personnel, basic life \n     support emergency medical services providers, teachers,\n\n[[Page S15144]]\n\n     coaches and supervisors of sports or other extracurricular \n     activities, providers of day care, school bus drivers, \n     lifeguards, attendants at public gatherings, coworkers, and \n     other leaders within the community.\n       (8) The Federal Government should facilitate programs for \n     the placement of AEDs in public buildings, including \n     provisions regarding the training of personnel in CPR and AED \n     use, integration with the emergency medical services system, \n     and maintenance of the devices.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 134) expressing the sense of the Senate that Joseph \nJefferson ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson should be appropriately honored for \nhis outstanding baseball accomplishments; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the Resolved clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT ``SHOELESS JOE'' JACKSON \n                   SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED FOR HIS BASEBALL \n                   ACCOMPLISHMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) In 1919, the infamous ``Black Sox'' scandal erupted \n     when an employee of a New York gambler allegedly bribed 8 \n     players of the Chicago White Sox, including Joseph Jefferson \n     ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson, to throw the 1919 World Series \n     against the Cincinnati Reds.\n       (2) In 1921, a criminal court acquitted ``Shoeless Joe'' \n     Jackson of charges brought against him as a consequence of \n     his participation in the 1919 World Series.\n       (3) Despite the acquittal, Commissioner Landis banned \n     ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson from playing Major League Baseball \n     for life without conducting a hearing, receiving evidence of \n     Jackson's alleged activities, or giving Mr. Jackson a forum \n     to rebut the allegations, issuing a summary punishment that \n     fell far short of due process standards.\n       (4) During the 1919 World Series, Jackson's play was \n     outstanding--his batting average was .375, the highest of any \n     player from either team; he had 12 hits, setting a World \n     Series record; he did not commit any errors; and he hit the \n     only home run of the Series.\n       (5) Not only was Jackson's performance during the 1919 \n     World Series unmatched, but his accomplishments throughout \n     his 13-year career in professional baseball were outstanding \n     as well--he was 1 of only 7 Major League Baseball players to \n     ever top the coveted mark of a .400 batting average for a \n     season, and he earned a lifetime batting average of .356, the \n     third highest of all time.\n       (6) ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson's career record clearly makes \n     him one of our Nation's top baseball players of all time.\n       (7) Because of his lifetime ban from Major League Baseball, \n     ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson has been excluded from consideration \n     for admission to the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame.\n       (8) ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson passed away in 1951, and 80 \n     years have elapsed since the 1919 World Series scandal \n     erupted.\n       (9) Recently, Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig \n     took an important step by agreeing to investigate whether \n     ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson was involved in a conspiracy to \n     alter the outcome of the 1919 World Series and whether he \n     should be eligible for inclusion in the Major League Baseball \n     Hall of Fame.\n       (10) Courts have exonerated ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson, the \n     1919 World Series box score stands as a witness of his record \n     setting play, and 80 years have passed since the scandal \n     erupted; therefore, Major League Baseball should \n     appropriately honor the outstanding baseball accomplishments \n     of Joseph Jefferson ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Joseph Jefferson ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson should be \n     appropriately honored for his outstanding baseball \n     accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15145-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GLACIER BAY FISHERIES ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      BINGAMAN AMENDMENT NO. 2801\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for Mr. Bingaman) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. \n501) to address resource management issues in Glacier Bay National \nPark, Alaska; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, for the past twelve and one-half \nyears, I have served as the Democratic co-chairman of the Northeast-\nMidwest Senate Coalition. John Heinz was the Republican co-chairman \nuntil his tragic death in 1991; since then, I have been pleased to work \nwith the junior Senator from Vermont, Jim Jeffords. We and other \nCoalition Members have worked closely with the Northeast-Midwest \nInstitute, the premier non-partisan, not-for-profit regional policy \nresearch center. A superb board of directors guides the Institute. I \nrise this afternoon to commend three New Yorkers who are ending their \nterms on the Northeast-Midwest Institute's Board of Directors. They \nhave provided distinguished service and have helped to advance the \nregion's economic vitality and environmental quality.\n  Former Representative Frank Horton has been involved with the \nNortheast-Midwest organizations for almost 25 years. Indeed, he was one \nof the founders of the Northeast-Midwest Congressional Coalition, our \nHouse counterpart, and served as its Republican co-chairman until he \nretired from the House in 1992. Frank had a distinguished career \nspanning 30 years, representing Rochester and serving for many years as \nranking member on the Government Operations Committee. We--I speak now \non behalf of the New York Congressional delegation--revered Frank and \nwere grateful for his counsel. He was our dean. Frank recently has been \nwith the DC-based law firm of Venable, Baetjer, Howard & Civiletti.\n  Gerald Benjamin, another Northeast-Midwest Institute Board Member \nwhose six-year term is ending, is dean of Liberal Arts & Sciences at \nthe State University of New York at New Paltz. Jerry is a respected \nscholar, who has focused on Federalism--a subject near and dear to my \nheart--and public policy development. He has been active in New York \npolitics, having served as county legislator and chairman in Ulster \nCounty. Jerry also was appointed as a member of the New York State \nEqualization and Assessment Panel and the Lower Hudson Study Commission \non School District Reorganization and Sharing.\n  Thomas Mooney is president of the Greater Rochester Metro Chamber of \nCommerce. Tom has pulled together the business community and expanded \nthat organization substantially. He has been a leader in numerous civic \naffairs, helping to coordinate public-private partnerships that have \nenhanced Rochester's industrial infrastructure. Tom also served as city \nmanager of Rochester and deputy county manager of the County of Monroe. \nHe also serves on the Genesee Hospital Board of Trustees and the \nRochester Philharmonic Board of Overseers.\n  Mr. President, these gentlemen have served on the Institute's Board \nof Directors six years or more without fanfare or remuneration. They \nare busy men, with plenty of other responsibilities. But they have \nserved, and served with distinction. House and Senate Coalition Members \nand people from across the Northeast-Midwest region owe them a debt of \ngratitude for a job well done.

She made her mark in the business \nworld by designing the first sports bra and becoming the CEO of the \ncompany that successfully marketed the ``Jogbra'' until its sale in \n1990 to a major corporation.\n  Ms. Lindahl is also know as a long-time advocate of people with \nepilepsy. Lisa is deeply committed to bringing to the forefront medical \nissues which are unique to women living with epilepsy. Her unwavering \ncommitment toward improving the health status of such individuals \nserves as a testament to us all. She is a stunning example of how one \nperson can positively affect so many.\n  There are now over one million American women who have epilepsy. Lisa \nhas brought national attention to the inequities that exist in the \nfield of research regarding men and women with epilepsy. She launched \nthe National Epilepsy Foundation's Women's Health Campaign and chaired \nthe Women and Epilepsy Task Force. Today, the Women's Health Campaign \nis a major program for the Epilepsy Foundation in cities and states \nacross the nation.\n  Lisa's efforts have played a significant role on the local level as \nwell. She is a long-standing board member of the Epilepsy Foundation of \nVermont and the Epilepsy Foundation of America, where she has served as \nChair of the Public Relations Committee, the Resource Development \nCommittee, and as Executive Vice President.\n  Vermont has much to be grateful for when it comes to Lisa's steadfast \ncommitment to improving the quality of life for people living with \nepilepsy, not only in Vermont, but throughout the country. For that, we \nowe her our deepest gratitude. Thank you, Lisa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15148-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15148-S15149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE PASSING OF PAULINE ISRAELITE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with profound sadness to \ndiscuss the passing from this life of a remarkable and beloved woman, \nPauline Israelite of Norwich, Connecticut.\n  On the day of Pauline's funeral at the Beth Jacob Synagogue in \nNorwich, some 1000 people arrived to pay their respects. Hundreds of \nthem were required to stand throughout the service because there was \nnot enough seating to accommodate all those in attendance. Rabbis, \nclergy, and other attendees all agreed that they could not recall a \nfuneral service held in that particular house of worship that was ever \nattended by more individuals.\n  Those of us privileged to know Pauline can well understand the \noutpouring of affection shown for her on that day. She was an \nextraordinary individual in so many ways: a devoted wife, a loving \nmother, a successful business owner, and not least, an extraordinarily \ngenerous and energetic community servant.\n  For many years, Pauline owned and operated the Norwichtown Mall \nBookstore. The true business of her life, however, was not running a \nbusiness, but serving others. She was an active member of Beth Jacob \nSynagogue. She served as President of Beth Jacob Sisterhood, and as an \nactive member of Hadassah and a Hands of Healing honoree. She was a \nvolunteer for Hospice; a member of and volunteer for the William W. \nBackus Hospital Auxiliary; a volunteer for the Adult Probation \nDepartment; and an ombudsman for the Area Agency on Aging. She served \nas a member of the board of the Jewish Federation of Eastern \nConnecticut, and of the Norwich Chamber of Commerce. In addition, she \nvolunteered for We Care in Delray Beach, Florida, and for the Literacy \nVolunteers of America.\n  I first met Pauline more than a quarter of a century ago. Her \nhusband,\n\n[[Page S15149]]\n\nStanley, had just left a successful business career to become a member \nof my congressional staff. At Pauline's funeral, I was introduced as \nsomeone for whom Stanley worked. I hastened to correct that mis-\nimpression. It is I who work for Stanley, I said. And it was Stanley, I \nadded, who worked for Pauline. Therefore, in a very real sense, I \nworked for Pauline.\n  Indeed, so many of us worked, in a manner of speaking, for Pauline. I \nrecall numerous times over the years when Stanley and I would wrestle \nwith a tough problem about how to best help someone in need, or how to \nbring about some positive result for our community or our state. On \nthose occasions, we would invariably arrive at the same conclusion: \n``Ask Pauline.'' Countless others no doubt uttered those same words \nover the years. And just as invariably, Pauline knew how to help. And \nthose of us who worked with her--or, I should say again, for her--came \nto rely on her sound judgment, her instincts for doing the right thing, \nand her understanding of how to help others--concretely, discreetly, \nand in a spirit of generosity and understanding.\n  Over the course of her rich and vibrant life, Pauline developed a \ndeep love of books. She didn't just sell them. She read them, and read \nthem with the same passion she brought to the other facets of her life. \nIt is appropriate, therefore, that I close these remarks by referencing \ntwo passages that I believe capture much about Pauline, her family, and \nall those who mourn her unexpected passing, and who wish to celebrate \nthe blessed achievement of her life.\n  The first passage comes from Seamus Heaney's ``Clearances'', a poem \nabout the death of a mother that evokes how her spirit survives in \nthose left behind:\n\n       In the last minutes he said more to her\n       Almost than in all their life together.\n       `You'll be in New Row on Monday night\n       And I'll come up for you and you'll be glad\n       When I walk in the door . . . Isn't that right?\n       His head was bent down to her propped-up head.\n       She could not hear but we were overjoyed.\n       He called her good and girl. Then she was dead,\n       The searching for a pulsebeat was abandoned\n       And we all knew one thing by being there.\n       The space we stood around had been emptied\n       Into us to keep, it penetrated\n       Clearances that suddenly stood open.\n       High cries were felled and a pure change happened.\n\n  The second passage is from ``Tuesdays with Morrie,'' a touching \naccount of a beloved teacher's last months. It serves as a reminder \nthat our death, like our lives, is part of a larger scheme composed by \nthe hand of a Creator whose purposes may not always be apparent to us, \nespecially in times of sorrow:\n\n       ``I heard a nice little story the other day,'' Morrie says. \n     He closes his eyes for a moment and I wait.\n       ``Okay. The story is about a little wave, bobbing along in \n     the ocean, having a grand old time. He's enjoying the wind \n     and the fresh air--until he notices the other waves in front \n     of him, crashing against the shore.\n       `` `My God, this is terrible,' the wave says. `Look what's \n     going to happen to me!'\n       ``Then along comes another wave. It sees the first wave, \n     looking grim, and it says to him, `Why do you look so sad?'\n       ``The first wave says, `You don't understand! We're all \n     going to crash! All of us waves are going to be nothing! \n     Isn't it terrible?'\n       ``The second wave says, `No, you don't understand. You're \n     not a wave, you're part of the ocean.' ''\n       I smile. Morrie closes his eyes again.\n       ``Part of the ocean,'' he says, ``part of the ocean.'' I \n     watch him breathe, in and out, in and out.\n\n  Mr. President, Pauline Israelite is survived by a large and loving \nfamily: Stanley, her husband of 53 years; her son Michael and his wife \nDonna; her son Jon; her daughter Abby and her husband Bill Dolliver; \nher daughter Mindy and her husband Bill Wilkie; several siblings; and \nsix wonderful grandchildren. I extend to them all my deepest \nsympathies, and my profound gratitude for granting me and so many \nothers the opportunity to know and love Pauline Israelite.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15149-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATIONS TO DR.

Ball of Columbus, Georgia, \nto the Parents Advisory Council on Youth Drug Abuse. This group of 16 \nindividuals serve as advisors to the Director of National Drug Control \nPolicy on issues including drug prevention, education and treatment.\n  Not only does Dr. Ball bring to the group her knowledge as a parent \nof three sons, but also over 27 years experience as an educator and \ncoach. In addition, she is very active in her community through her \nlocal church and anti-drug organizations. Dr. Ball has been nominated \nfor, and won, numerous awards for her work as a coach in the sports of \nbasketball, softball, tennis and cheerleading. This year, she has been \nnominated for the Channel One National Coach of the Year.\n  The youth drug problem in our nation has been an issue of major \nconcern to me for quite some time, and it is my hope that Dr. Ball and \nthe other members of the Parents Advisory Council will bring their \ninsight and innovation to the task of helping to end this epidemic.\n  I was proud to be a supporter of the legislation which established \nthis group, and am pleased that such an eminently qualified Georgian \nhas been selected to serve as a member. Mr. President, I offer my \ncongratulations to Dr. Ball for this honor, and am confident that she \nwill continue in her role of outstanding service and leadership to the \nyouth of Georgia, and our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15149-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN COMMEMORATION OF NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the week of Nov. 21-28 is an \nimportant time for houses of worship and individuals of all religions \nacross the country--National Bible Week.\n  As this year's National Bible Week co-chair, it is my privilege to \npay tribute to the Bible and its remarkable influence on American life. \nAs in past years, the National Bible Association is hosting the week-\nlong salute to the Good Book. This year, the tribute happens to fall \nduring the Thanksgiving holidays; this seems fitting, because we should \nbe eternally thankful that we have the teachings of the Bible to help \nguide our daily lives.\n  And old maxim states that ``A reformation happens every time you open \nthe Bible.'' Indeed, no book over the course of human history has had a \nmore profound effect on how we live and act. The Bible has influenced \nWestern culture in myriad ways, shaping areas as diverse as government \nand art.\n  John Wycliffe, the great religious reformer, once wrote, ``The Bible \nis for the government of the people, by the people, and for the \npeople.'' The writings found within it inspired many of our nation's \nfounders' most cherished ideals--ideals that remain cornerstones of \ndemocracy today. The Bible, for example, advocates faith in a greater \ngood, the glory of freedom, the importance of family, and the sanctity \nof every human life. The Bible is at the heart of America's civic \nreligion.\n  Far from archaic, the Bible is as important today as it has ever \nbeen, particularly as many Americans feel this country slipping into \nmoral decline. Our best hope of righting our national ship is to \ninstill in future generations the core values of love, truth, honor, \nand service enshrined in the Bible.\n  As an Orthodox Jew, my faith orders my life, gives me a sense of \npurpose and direction, and provides comfort in uncertain or difficult \ntimes. The Old Testament or Torah serves as a constant reminder of my \nobligations to God, country, and family.\n  So as Thanksgiving approaches, I encourage every believer in this \nland to open the Bible, read a favorite passage or two, and give thanks \nto God for this wonderful, sacred Book.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15149-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15149-S15150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A TRIBUTE TO ERIC HARNISCHFEGER\n\n Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, today I rise to note the passing \nof Akio Morita, the brilliant Japanese business leader who did so much \nto rebuild his country after World War II. I ask that his obituary that \nappeared in the October 4 New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  The obituary follows:\n                               __________\n                               \n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 4, 1999]\n\n Akio Morita, Co-Founder of Sony and Japanese Business Leader, Dies at \n                                   78\n\n                          (By Andrew Pollack)\n\n       Akio Morita, the co-founder of the Sony Corporation who \n     personified Japan's rise from postwar rubble to industrial \n     riches and became the unofficial ambassador of its business \n     community to the world, died on Sunday in Tokyo. He was 78.\n       Mr. Morita died of pneumonia, according to Sony. He had \n     been hospitalized in Tokyo since August, after returning from \n     Hawaii, where he had spent most of his time since suffering a \n     debilitating stroke in November 1993. More than anyone else, \n     it was Mr. Morita and his Sony colleagues who changed the \n     world's image of the term ``Made in Japan'' from one of paper \n     parasols and shoddy imitations to one of high technology and \n     high reliability in miniature packages.\n       Founded in bombed-out Tokyo department store after World \n     War II, Sony became indisputably one of the world's most \n     innovative companies, famous for products like the pocket-\n     sized transistor radio, the videocassette recorder, the \n     Walkman and the compact disk.\n       And Mr. Morita, whose contribution was greater in marketing \n     than in technology, made the Sony brand into one of the best \n     known and most respected in the world. A Harris poll last \n     year showed Sony was the No. 1 brand name among American \n     consumers, ahead of American companies like General Electric \n     and Coca-Cola.\n       A tireless traveler who moved his family to New York in \n     1963 for a year to learn American ways, Mr. Morita also \n     spearheaded the internationalization of Japanese business. \n     Sony was the first Japanese company to offer its stock in the \n     United States, in 1961, one of the first to build a factory \n     in the United States, in 1972, and still one of the only ones \n     to have even a couple of Westerners on its board.\n       Sony also became a major force in the American \n     entertainment business, acquiring CBS Records in 1988 and \n     Columbia Pictures, the Hollywood studio, in 1989. The latter \n     purchase, however, turned into an embarrassing debacle as \n     Sony suffered big losses in Hollywood.\n\n\n               a Japanese executive Americans recognized\n\n       In the process, Mr. Morita, with his white mane and quick \n     tongue, became the unofficial representative of Japan's \n     business community, generally working to smooth trade \n     relations between his country and the United States, but \n     sometimes stirring resentment in both countries with his \n     pointed criticisms.\n       ``He was truly a statesman par excellence in a business \n     sense,'' Mike Mansfield, the former senator and United States \n     Ambassador to Japan. ``Internationally, he did more for Japan \n     in a business sense than anyone else in Japan.''\n       In Japan, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who was one of \n     several hundred people to visit Mr. Morita's Tokyo home \n     following his death, called Mr. Morita ``a leading figure who \n     played a pivotal role in developing Japan's postwar \n     economy,'' according to Kyodo News Service.\n       Sony's current president, Nobuyuki Idei, said in a \n     statement, ``It is not an exaggeration to say that he was the \n     face of Japan.''\n       To the day of his death, nearly six years after the stroke \n     that removed him from an active role in business, he was \n     still no doubt Japan's most famous business executive, and \n     the only one many Americans could name or recognize in a \n     photograph. Time magazine recently selected him as one of 20 \n     ``most influential business geniuses'' of the 20th century, \n     the only non-American on the list.\n       In his own country, where executives tend to be self-\n     effacing, Mr. Morita was viewed as a bit flamboyant and \n     arrogant. He was the first to fly around in a corporate \n     business jet and helicopter. He appeared in a television \n     commercial for the American Express card. He served on the \n     boards of three foreign companies. He took up sports like \n     skiing, scuba diving and wind surfing in his sixties. He \n     cavorted with the rock star Cyndi Lauper after Sony bought \n     CBS Records.\n       Shortly before he suffered his stroke, Mr. Morita made \n     waves in his home country by saying that Japan was like a \n     ``fortress'' and that its unique business practices were \n     alienating its trading partners.'' Although there is much to \n     commend in Japan's economic system, it is simply too far out \n     of sync with the West on certain essential points,'' he wrote \n     in The Atlantic Monthly in June 1993.\n       He advocated shorter working hours, more dividends for \n     stockholders of Japanese companies and a sharp cutback in \n     government regulation. Now, as Japan struggles through an \n     economic slump that has lasted most of the decade, some of \n     what Mr. Morita advocated is being adopted.\n       ``Japan was coming closer to him and seeing the need for \n     that kind of leadership,'' said Yoshihiro Tsurumi, professor \n     of international business at the Baruch Graduate School of \n     Business at the City University of New York.\n\n\n               Never Comfortable In West's Business World\n\n       Mr. Morita entertained frequently and counted many American \n     businessmen and politicians as his friends. ``He not only \n     made it Sony's business but his own personal business to \n     become intimately acquainted with American society at all \n     levels,'' said Peter Peterson, an investment banker who is on \n     Sony's board of directors. ``I can recall playing golf with \n     Akio, watching him greet and interact with every American \n     C.E.O. on the course, all of whom seemed to know him as a \n     personal friend.''\n       In his book ``Sony: The Private Life'' (Houghton Mifflin, \n     1999) John Nathan suggests that Mr. Morita, a Japanese \n     traditionalist at home, was never really comfortable in the \n     Western business world.\n       Mr. Nathan, a Japanese translator and University of \n     California professor of Japanese culture who was granted free \n     access to Sony executives, quotes Mr. Morita's eldest son, \n     Hideo, as saying of his father, ``He had to `act'--I'm sorry \n     to use that word but I can't help it--he had to act as the \n     most international-understanding businessman in Japan.'' But, \n     Hideo adds, ``It was never real.''\n       And Sony's current president, Mr. Idei, is quoted as \n     saying: ``Japanese of the generation before mine had an \n     inferiority complex about foreigners. Akio Morita himself was \n     a living inferiority complex.''\n       Despite being virtually synonymous with Sony, especially \n     outside Japan, Mr. Morita did not actually become the \n     company's president until 1971 and its chairman and chief \n     executive until 1976. Before that, he was the junior partner \n     to Masaru Ibuka, an engineering genius who, while not as \n     widely known in the West, is considered in Japan to be the \n     main founder of Sony. Mr. Ibuka died in December 1997 at the \n     age of 89.\n\n\n              an early fascination leads to a career shift\n\n       Akio Morita was born on Jan. 26, 1921, into a wealthy \n     family in Nagoya, an industrial city in central Japan. As the \n     eldest son, he was groomed from elementary school age to \n     succeed his father as president of the sake brewery that had \n     been in the family for 14 generations.\n       But in junior high school, Akio became fascinated by his \n     family's phonograph, an appliance rare in Japan at that time. \n     He became an avid electronics hobbyist, building his own \n     crude phonograph and radio receiver. He studied physics at \n     Osaka Imperial University as World War II was starting. Mr. \n     Morita enlisted in the Navy under a program that would allow \n     him to do research instead of serving in combat.\n       It was while developing heat-seeking weapons that Mr. \n     Morita first worked with Mr. Ibuka, 13 years his senior, who \n     before the war had started an electronic instrument company.\n       After the war, Mr. Ibuka set up a new company in a bombed-\n     out department store in Tokyo, making kits that converted AM \n     radios into short-wave receivers. Mr. Morita happened to read \n     a newspaper article about this and contacted his old friend. \n     The next year, when Mr. Ibuka wanted to incorporate the \n     company, he asked Mr. Morita to join.\n       Mr. Morita, Mr. Ibuka and another executive traveled to the \n     Nagoya area to implore Mr. Morita's father to release his son \n     from the family business. The elder Mr. Morita not only \n     agreed, he also later became a financial backer of the new \n     company, Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo, or the Tokyo Telecommunications \n     Engineering Corporation, which was inaugurated on May 7, \n     1946, with an investment of about $500.\n       The company produced Japan's first reel-to-reel magnetic \n     tape recorder. A few years later it licensed the rights to \n     the transistor from Bell Laboratories, after overcoming \n     resistance from the Ministry of International Trade and \n     Industry. Bell Labs officials warned that the only consumer \n     use would be for hearing aids.\n       But Sony used them to produce Japan's first transistor \n     radio in 1955. (An American company, Regency, produced the \n     world's first a few months earlier but did not succeed in \n     selling it.) In 1957, Sony came out with what it termed a \n     pocket-sized transistor radio. But the radio was actually a \n     bit too big for most pockets, so Mr. Morita had Sony salesmen \n     wear special shirts with extra-large pockets.\n       There followed the Trinitron television in 1968; the first \n     successful home VCR, the Betamax, in 1975; the Walkman \n     personal stereo in 1979, and the compact disk, developed with \n     Philips N.V. of the Netherlands, in 1982.\n       Not all products were successful. Sony has stumbled several \n     times trying to sell personal computers. And in 1981, Mr. \n     Morita announced the Mavica, a digital camera that\n\n[[Page S15151]]\n\n     recorded pictures on a floppy disk instead of on film. But \n     the camera did not come to market and critics accused Mr. \n     Morita of making a premature announcement to burnish Sony's \n     image as an innovator.\n\n\n                steering consumers to products they want\n\n       Mr. Morita did not believe in market research. ``Our plan \n     is to lead the public with new products rather than ask them \n     what kind of products they want,'' he declared in his \n     autobiography, ``Made in Japan.'' (E. P. Dutton, 1986), \n     written with the journalists Edwin M. Reingold and Mitsuko \n     Shimomura. ``The public does not know what is possible, but \n     we do.''\n       Mr. Morita prided himself in particular on the Walkman, the \n     portable stereo cassette player with headphones. Actually, \n     according to the company's official corporate history, it was \n     Mr. Ibuka who came up with the idea for the portable product. \n     But Mr. Morita pressed hard for the project, \n     overcoming resistance within Sony to a tape player that, \n     in its early versions, could not record. Mr. Morita, \n     despite initial reservations about the awkward name, \n     eventually ordered all Sony subsidiaries around the world \n     to begin using it.\n       From the start of the company, however, Mr. Morita was much \n     more involved in marketing, while Mr. Ibuka handled \n     technology development. And from the start, he had an \n     international orientation, traveling to New York and Europe \n     in the 1950's to sell the company wares.\n       Such international focus was needed because as a new \n     company, Sony had some trouble breaking into its home market, \n     where more established manufacturers had close relationships \n     with retailers. Indeed, Japan's other big postwar success, \n     the Honda Motor Company, also succeeded first in the United \n     States and to this day sells more cars in American than in \n     Japan.\n       Mr. Morita soon realized that the company needed a name \n     that foreigners could pronouce and remember. So in 1958 the \n     company name was changed to Sony, derived from the Latin \n     sonus, meaning sound, and from the American vernacular \n     ``sonny boy,'' which Mr. Morita hoped would purvey a young \n     image.\n       One of Mr. Morita's cardinal tenets was to foster and \n     protect the company's brand name. Early on, Bulova, the watch \n     company, said it would order 100,000 radios but would sell \n     them under its own name. Mr. Morita turned down the huge \n     order. His colleagues back in Tokyo thought he was crazy. \n     But, Mr. Morita wrote in his autobiography, ``I said then and \n     I have said it often since: It was the best decision I ever \n     made.''\n       Mr. Morita's worst decision might have been with the \n     Betamax, the first successful consumer VCR. Sony did not \n     readily license its technology to other electronics \n     companies. So most of its Japanese rivals banded together \n     behind the VHS system, which offered longer recording time. \n     Eventually, the Betamax was run out of the market.\n       Sony evolved into a company that, by Japanese standards at \n     least, was very Westernized, though in many ways it was \n     traditionally Japanese. All company employees, from the \n     president on down, wore company jackets, a common practice in \n     Japan. But Sony's uniforms were created by the designer Issey \n     Miyake.\n       Mr. Morita first criticized some of his own country's \n     business practices in 1966, when he wrote a book published in \n     Japanese, with a title that might loosely translate as ``An \n     Essay on the Useless School Career.'' He criticized Japanese \n     companies for hiring and promoting people based only on what \n     college they had attended. Sony stopped even asking \n     applicants the name of their college, and it was one of the \n     first Japanese companies to base salaries partly on merit \n     instead of solely on seniority.\n\n\n                  tried to reduce U.S. trade tensions\n\n       Perhaps because of Sony's dependence on exports, Mr. Morita \n     tried to reduce trade tensions with the United States. In the \n     late 1960's, Sony forged a temporary joint venture with Texas \n     Instruments Inc., then the world's leading semiconductor \n     company, allowing it to set up operations in Japan.\n       In 1972, Mr. Morita set up a subsidiary to export American \n     products, like Regal cookware and Whilrpool refrigerators, to \n     Japan.\n       ``Selling pans and cookware and refrigerators was not our \n     bag, but Akio believed in doing something for the U.S.-Japan \n     relationship,'' said Sadami (Chris) Wada, who ran that effort \n     and then handled government relations for the Sony \n     Corporation of America for many years. The operation was \n     abandoned some years later as unsuccessful.\n       In 1988, Mr. Morita founded the Council for Better \n     Corporate Citizenship, made up of Japanese companies. At a \n     time when Japanese politicians were angering African-\n     Americans with insensitive remarks, one of the council's \n     first projects was to make thousands of copies of an \n     abridged version of ``Eyes on the Prize,'' the American \n     television documentary about the struggle of blacks for \n     equal rights, and distribute it to high schools in Japan.\n       Mr. Morita was not adverse to using his influence among \n     American politicians and business executives to lobby for \n     Sony. He barnstormed the United States in 1984, meeting with \n     governors and with President Reagan, threatening to build \n     Sony factories only in states that did not have the ``unitary \n     tax,'' which was levied against a multinational corporation's \n     global earnings, not just those in the state. Eventually \n     California and other states scrapped the tax.\n       But while Mr. Morita was often perceived as a friend of the \n     United States, he was often critical of it and proud of being \n     Japanese, flying his country's flag over Sony's New York \n     showroom when it opened in 1962. He often told a story of how \n     ashamed he was on his first trip to Germany in 1953. At a \n     restaurant, he ordered ice cream, and it was served with a \n     small paper parasol stuck in it. ``This is from your \n     country,'' the waiter said.\n\n\n                hailing the success of the japanese way\n\n       In the 1980's, when Japan seemed on top of the world, Mr. \n     Morita was among the most vocal of the Japanese executives in \n     criticizing American business and hailing the success of the \n     Japanese model.\n       He said American managers were financial paper shufflers \n     who ``can see only 10 minutes ahead'' and were not interested \n     in building for the long term. And he said that because \n     American companies were losing interest in manufacturing, the \n     United States was ``abandoning its status as an industrial \n     power.'' Those factors, he said, and not trade barriers, were \n     the reason for America's trade deficit with Japan.\n       ``There are few things in the United States that Japanese \n     want to buy, but there are a lot of things in Japan that \n     Americans want to buy,'' he wrote in 1989. ``This is at the \n     root of the trade imbalance. The problem arises in that \n     American politicians fail to understand this simple fact.''\n       In 1989, Mr. Morita was the co-author, along with a \n     nationalist politician, Shintaro Ishihara, of ``The Japan \n     That Can Say No,'' a book that urged Japan to stand up to \n     American trade demands, which it said were motivated partly \n     by racism. The book also said Japan had the power to change \n     the world balance of power by selling its advanced computer \n     chips to the Soviet Union instead of the United States.\n       Even though those strident remarks were generally in the \n     chapters Mr. Ishihara wrote, the book created a stir when an \n     unauthorized translation made its way around Washington. Mr. \n     Morita frantically backpedaled, saying the book had not been \n     intended for an American audience. And he refused to \n     authorize an English translation.\n\n\n                 $3.2 billion lost in hollywood venture\n\n       It was later that year that Sony paid $3.4 billion to buy \n     Columbia Pictures, a purchase driven largely by Mr. Morita, \n     who thought that if Sony had owned a studio issuing movies in \n     the Beta format, it would not have lost the VCR wars.\n       Although Sony prided itself on being more Americanized than \n     its Japanese rivals, the purchase became a lightning rod for \n     American concern about a wave of Japanese acquisitions of \n     American companies and real estate. ``Japan Invades \n     Hollywood'' read the cover of Newsweek. In Japan as well, \n     Sony came in for criticism for stirring up anti-Japanese \n     feeling in the United States.\n       Mr. Morita had a simple answer. ``If you don't want Japan \n     to buy it, don't sell it,'' he told New York Times reporter \n     shortly after the purchase. Nevertheless, sensitive to \n     concerns, he promised that the studio would be run by \n     Americans and would be free even to make a movie critical of \n     Japan's emperor. Worse than misjudging the political \n     reaction, however, the seemingly sophisticated Sony proved \n     to be a babe in the woods in Hollywood.\n       Sony is generally considered to have overpaid for the \n     studio, and it paid several hundred million dollars more to \n     hire managers away from Warner Brothers--provoking a costly \n     fight with that studio. Those managers, in turn, spent money \n     extravagantly and produced a sting of box office bombs. Mr. \n     Morita and his successor as Sony chief executive, Norio Ohga, \n     perhaps because they were worried about stirring up anti-\n     Japanese sentiment, exercised little oversight.\n       In late 1994, in one of the most embarrassing moments in \n     its history, Sony announced that it would suffer a loss of \n     $3.2 billion from its investment in Hollywood. But it has \n     stuck with the studio, now called Sony Pictures \n     Entertainment, and appears to be turning it around.\n       The Morita name will live on at Sony because many members \n     of Mr. Morita's family are involved in the company.\n       Besides his wife, Mr. Morita is survived by his wife, \n     Yoshiko; his eldest son, Hideo, who now runs the sake brewery \n     and other family businesses; a younger son, Masao, an \n     executive with Sony Music Entertainment in Japan; and a \n     daughter, Naoko Okada, who also lives in Japan. He is also \n     survived by his brother Kazuaki, who volunteered to take over \n     the family sake brewery in Mr. Morita's stead; another \n     brother, Masaaki, a long-time Sony executive, and a sister, \n     Kikuko Iwama, who was married to the late Kazuo Iwama, a \n     former president of Sony.\n\n\n                a longtime outsider is embraced at last\n\n       In the 1990's, corporate Japan, worried about escalating \n     trade tensions, turned to Mr. Morita, whom it once considered \n     an arrogant maverick, to be its official leader. Mr. Morita \n     was slated to become chairman of Keidanren, Japan's most \n     powerful business lobbying organization, a post that had \n     always gone to the head of a company in an old-line heavy \n     industry like steel.\n       But on Nov. 30, 1993, while playing his usual 7 A.M. \n     Tuesday tennis game, Mr. Morita suffered a cerebral \n     hemorrhage. A year later, just days after Sony announced its \n     huge Hollywood loss, Mr. Morita, in a wheelchair, attended a \n     Sony board meeting in Tokyo and resigned as chairman.\n       He had spent much of his time since then undergoing \n     rehabilitation at his beachfront\n\n[[Page S15152]]\n\n     home near Diamond Head on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. At \n     first, Mr. Morita was able to speak a little, shake hands and \n     hit back tennis balls spit out by a machine, according to Mr. \n     Wada, the retired Sony government relations manager.\n       But more recently, Mr. Wada said, Mr. Morita had lost the \n     ability to speak and communicated mainly through eye contact \n     with his wife. The couple's Christmas greeting card last year \n     had a message from Mrs. Morita saying her husband rose at 6 \n     A.M., retired at 9 P.M. and spent much of the day in \n     rehabilitation. ``He may be overeating,'' she said, \n     mentioning his fondness for eel.\n       Until he was taken to the hospital in Tokyo in August, Mr. \n     Morita had not returned to Japan for more than two years \n     because of concerns that flying would further damage his \n     health. He did not attend the 1997 funeral of Mr. Ibuka.\n       But Sony officials still visited him in Hawaii to keep him \n     up to date on the business and show him new products. In \n     January 1998, some 200 executives, friends and dignitaries \n     came to Hawaii to attend a party for Mr. Morita's 77th \n     birthday, considered a lucky age in Japan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15152-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SISTER ELIZABETH CANDON\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise today in honor of an extraordinary Vermont woman, Sister Elizabeth \nCandon. On January 1, 2000, Sister Elizabeth will retire from her post \nas Professor of English at Trinity College, and from a long career in \npublic service. Whether in the role of teacher, college President, or \npublic official, Sister Elizabeth has been a steadfast leader for women \nand a true advocate for those in need. She is and will remain a \nstunning example of how one person can positively affect so many.\n  In 1939, Sister Elizabeth Candon began her life of public service \nwhen she became a Religious Sister of Mercy. Educated at Trinity \nCollege and Fordham University, Sister Elizabeth started her career in \n1954, when she returned to her alma mater as an Associate Professor of \nEnglish and Director of Admissions. In 1966, she became a full \nProfessor of English and Trinity College's President, a post she would \nhold until 1976.\n  In 1977, Sister Elizabeth left the world of academia to try her hand \nat state government. At the request of Vermont's Governor, Richard \nSnelling, Sister Elizabeth took the helm of Vermont's largest agency as \nSecretary of Human Services. As the first woman in Vermont history to \nserve as Secretary and the only woman in the Governor's cabinet, Sister \nElizabeth quickly became a role model for Vermont women. Her tenure as \nSecretary also provided her with an opportunity to effect change and \nhelp those in need. Under her leadership, community based programs were \ndeveloped and as a result, the Windsor State Prison and Vergennes' \nWeek's School were both closed. This restructuring allowed the \nbeneficial programs administered at these sites to be relocated \nthroughout the state.\n  Sister Elizabeth was and continues to be tireless in her efforts to \ninstitute programs on behalf of those in need of mental health and \ndevelopmental disabilities services. To this day she is remembered for \nher motto, ``anything is possible if it matters not who gets the \ncredit.'' Consequently, this legacy has woven its way into the mission \nof the Agency of Human Services.\n  Since returning to teaching at Trinity as Professor of English in \n1983, Sister Elizabeth has continued to bring the beauty and \ninspiration of Shakespeare and Chaucer to her students. During this \ntime, her steadfast leadership in community and public service has \ncontinued.\n  I should also acknowledge that throughout her career, Sister \nElizabeth has served on many boards and Councils, further extending her \ninfluence on the issues important to her and to Vermonters. She sat on \nthe Vermont Council on the Humanities and Public Issues, the Board of \nDirectors for the United Community Service of Chittenden County, and \nthe Board of Directors of Howard Mental Health Services. She also \nserved as Trustee of Middlebury College and as Chairperson of the State \nTask Force on Funding for Special Education. She remains a trustee at \nthe Richard A. Snelling Center for Government and a Director of the \nVermont Ethics Network.\n  As we celebrate Sister Elizabeth's 46 year career of service to the \npeople of Vermont, I know she will continue to contribute in the years \nto come. As a Sister of Mercy, she brings honor to her religious \ncommunity and touches the lives of those around her. While she is \nretiring at the end of this millennium, her legacy will live on well \ninto the next.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15152-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15152-S15153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ELECTRONIC BENEFIT TRANSFER INTEROPERABILITY AND PORTABILITY ACT OF \n                                  1999\n\n  S. 1733, passed during today's session, follows:\n\n                                S. 1733\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The growth of electronic commerce and electronic \n     government transactions represent a powerful force for \n     economic growth, consumer choice, improved civic \n     participation and wealth creation.\n       (2) The promotion of growth in private sector electronic \n     commerce through Federal legislation is in the national \n     interest because that market is globally important to the \n     United States.\n       (3) A consistent legal foundation, across multiple \n     jurisdictions, for electronic commerce will promote the \n     growth of such transactions, and that such a foundation \n     should be based upon a simple, technology neutral, \n     nonregulatory, and market-based approach.\n       (4) The Nation and the world stand at the beginning of a \n     large scale transition to an information society which will \n     require innovative legal and policy approaches, and \n     therefore, States can serve the national interest by \n     continuing their proven role as laboratories of innovation \n     for quickly evolving areas of public policy, provided that \n     States also adopt a consistent, reasonable national baseline \n     to eliminate obsolete barriers to electronic commerce such as \n     undue paper and pen requirements, and further, that any such \n     innovation should not unduly burden inter-jurisdictional \n     commerce.\n       (5) To the extent State laws or regulations do not provide \n     a consistent, reasonable national baseline or in fact create \n     an undue burden to interstate commerce in the important \n     burgeoning area of electronic commerce, the national interest \n     is best served by Federal preemption to the extent necessary \n     to provide such consistent, reasonable national baseline or \n     eliminate said burden, but that absent such lack of \n     consistent, reasonable national baseline or such undue \n     burdens, the best legal system for electronic commerce will \n     result from continuing experimentation by individual \n     jurisdictions.\n       (6) With due regard to the fundamental need for a \n     consistent national baseline, each jurisdiction that enacts \n     such laws should have the right to determine the need for any \n     exceptions to protect consumers and maintain consistency with \n     existing related bodies of law within a particular \n     jurisdiction.\n       (7) Industry has developed several electronic signature \n     technologies for use in electronic transactions, and the \n     public policies of the United States should serve to promote \n     a dynamic marketplace within which these technologies can \n     compete. Consistent with this Act, States should permit the \n     use and development of any authentication technologies that \n     are appropriate as practicable as between private parties and \n     in use with State agencies.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to permit and encourage the continued expansion of \n     electronic commerce through the operation of free market \n     forces rather than proscriptive governmental mandates and \n     regulations;\n       (2) to promote public confidence in the validity, integrity \n     and reliability of electronic commerce and online government \n     under Federal law;\n       (3) to facilitate and promote electronic commerce by \n     clarifying the legal status of electronic records and \n     electronic signatures in the context of contract formation;\n       (4) to facilitate the ability of private parties engaged in \n     interstate transactions to agree among themselves on the \n     appropriate electronic signature technologies for their \n     transactions; and\n       (5) to promote the development of a consistent national \n     legal infrastructure necessary to support electronic commerce \n     at the Federal and State levels within existing areas of \n     jurisdiction.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Daschle for his work on this \nnext group of bills. It involves a number of energy-related, water-\nrelated bills out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I also \nwant to recognize Senator Murkowski, the chairman of the committee.\n  These are quite often considered to be small bills, but to a number \nof areas or States or Senators, they are very big in importance. \nSenator Murkowski and Senator Bingaman have worked feverishly to try to \nget through a number of problems. It is one of those classic cases \nwhere you have one problem that develops with a bill; then it affects \nother bills. Senator Daschle took the time and the lead in working \nthrough some of these problems. I want to recognize the work he did.\n  I also commit publicly on the record to proceed to S. 1051, the \nNorthern Marianas bill, by February 15. We would have liked to have \nbeen able to go ahead and get a complete unanimous consent about the \ntotal arrangements for it being handled, but Senators who did have \nquestions are now probably on airplanes headed halfway across the \ncountry. We will work together. I will make a commitment to bring this \nup by the 15th.\n  Does Senator Daschle want to make any comment on that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the commitment made by the \nmajority leader. I know Senator Akaka is disappointed that it is not in \nthis package of bills. He has worked, along with senator Murkowski who, \nI think, may be a cosponsor of this legislation, to pass it tonight. \nThat is impossible. But I think Senator Akaka is certainly willing to \naccept the commitment made by the majority leader that by the 15th we \nwill take up this legislation and hopefully resolve it successfully in \nthe not-too-distant future. This is an important bill, the Marianas. It \nis an important bill for Senator Akaka, and I am appreciative of the \ncommitment that is now part of the record that we will come back to \nthis bill in a matter of months.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15154-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15154-S15155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 744\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``El Camino Real de Tierra \n     Adentro National Historic Trail Act.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro (the Royal Road of the \n     Interior), served as the primary route between the colonial \n     Spanish capital of Mexico City and the Spanish provincial \n     capitals at San Juan de Los Caballeros (1598-1600), San \n     Gabriel (1600-1609) and then Santa Fe (1610-1821).\n       (2) The portion of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro that \n     resided in what is now the United States extended between El \n     Paso, Texas and present San Juan Pueblo, New Mexico, a \n     distance of 404 miles;\n       (3) El Camino Real is a symbol of the cultural interaction \n     between nations and ethnic groups and of the commercial \n     exchange that made possible the development and growth of the \n     borderland;\n       (4) American Indian groups, especially the Pueblo Indians \n     of the Rio Grande, developed trails for trade long before \n     Europeans arrived;\n       (5) In 1598, Juan de Onate led a Spanish military \n     expedition along those trails to establish the northern \n     portion of El Camino Real;\n       (6) During the Mexican National Period and part of the U.S. \n     Territorial Period, El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro \n     facilitated the emigration of people to New Mexico and other \n     areas that would become the United States;\n       (7) The exploration, conquest, colonization, settlement, \n     religious conversion, and military occupation of a large area \n     of the borderlands was made possible by this route, whose \n     historical period extended from 1598 to 1882;\n       (8) American Indians, European emigrants, miners, ranchers, \n     soldiers, and missionaries used El Camino Real during the \n     historic development of the borderlands. These travelers \n     promoted cultural interaction among Spaniards, other \n     Europeans, American Indians, Mexicans, and Americans;\n       (9) El Camino Real fostered the spread of Catholicism, \n     mining, an extensive network of commerce, and ethnic and \n     cultural traditions including music, folklore, medicine, \n     foods, architecture, language, place names, irrigation \n     systems, and Spanish law.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I know there is additional business to be \nconducted.\n  Let me say briefly that we have just passed a number of very \nimportant pieces of legislation affecting many States, and it is \nunfortunate at this hour and given these circumstances that Senators \nwho have had so much to do with their passage are not on the floor to \nbe able to watch them as they have finally passed.\n  I commend Senator Johnson in particular for one bill that was part of \nthe package, the Lewis and Clark authorization project.\n  As a result of the passage of this legislation, there are tens of \nthousands of people in southeastern South Dakota, southwestern \nMinnesota, and northeastern Iowa who will benefit from good, clean, \nabundant sources of water, in some cases for the first time in a long \ntime.\n  This has been a work in progress for many years. It passed in large \nmeasure because there was such a collective effort in the southeastern \npart of our State, and the southwestern part of Minnesota, and, as I \nsaid, in the northeastern part of Iowa.\n  I commend them for their efforts and their diligence and their \npersistence. I congratulate them for the fact that it now has passed.\n  Let me also thank the distinguished Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, \nand the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, for all of their help and \neffort in getting us to this point.\n  It would not have happened without them as well.\n  This is a great day for my State. It is a great day for those in \nother States.\n  I, again, congratulate especially Senator Johnson for his leadership \nand his effort in getting us to this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15200-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15200-S15201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATOR HOLLINGS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on occasion I have noted the birthdays of \nsome of my colleagues by sharing a few observations about them. But, \nlike those poor schoolchildren whose birthdays fall in the middle of \nthe summer vacation, thus denying them the pleasure of a day of special \nrecognition at school, one of my colleague's birthday falls on a day \nwhen the Senate can be virtually guaranteed not to be in session. I do \nnot wish to let the whim of the calendar prevent me from honoring a man \nwhose many sterling qualities compare to his more natally auspicious \nbrethren.\n  Senator Ernest F. ``Fritz'' Hollings was born on January 1, 1922, \ndenying by just a few hours an extra year's tax deduction to his \nhardworking parents. That may have been the only disappointment caused \nby their over-achieving son, however. Young Ernest went on to do his \nparents proud by graduating as a member of the highest honor society at \nThe Citadel in 1942, then serving proudly for thirty-three months in \nWorld War II, attaining the rank of captain. Upon returning home, he \nagain took up the scholar's mantle, earning his law degree at the \nUniversity of South Carolina in 1947, followed by his doctorate of law \nfrom The Citadel in 1959. He excelled as a lawyer, being admitted to \npractice before the South Carolina Supreme Court, the U.S. District \nCourt, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, U.S. Tax Court, U.S. Customs \nCourt, and the U.S. Supreme Court. He was first elected to public \noffice at the tender age of 26, in 1948, to the South Carolina General \nAssembly, and subsequently served with distinction as lieutenant \ngovernor, South Carolina's youngest Governor in this century, and as \nSenator. I feel sure his parents must have been proud of him. I know \nthat I am proud to have served with him in the United States Senate for \nthe last thirty-two, almost thirty-three, years.\n  The rolling, sonorous cadences of this rich Carolina drawl soften the \nedges of Senator Hollings's sometimes acerbic observations and acid \nanalysis of bills and treaties. I know of few Members who can so \ndecisively carve up sloppy legislation with so few trenchant \nobservations, so mellifluously delivered, that one still feels that the \nafternoon is going smoothly and pleasantly. With his background in tax \nand customs law, Senator Hollings has long been a force on the Commerce \nCommittee, and his energy is felt on the Senate Floor any time trade \nlegislation or treaties are considered. As a member of the \nAppropriations and Budget Committees, he is well versed in the \nintricacies of fiscal policy-making. And on telecommunications matters \nfew would dare tangle with him without first arming themselves with \nunassailable arguments at one's trigger finger, for fear of being \ncompletely done in by his quick-draw ripostes!\n\n  We have been on opposite ends of main street legislative shoot-outs \nover the years regarding the Balanced Budget Amendment and the \nnefarious Line Item Veto, but never has courtesy or friendship fallen \nvictim to our philosophical disagreements. To the contrary, we have \nfound common ground in our opposition to unfair trade practices and \nunequal trade agreements that hurt Americans. On the whole, I must \nadmit I prefer to have Senator Hollings on my side, rather than \nagainst, as he is such a formidable foe.\n\n[[Page S15201]]\n\n  I have highlighted a few of my distinguished colleague's many honors, \nbut there is one that still eludes him. For though he continues to make \nhis parents proud in heaven, and his family and constituents proud here \non Earth, he remains the most senior junior Senator in our nation's \nhistory. At 32 years and 10 months, Senator Hollings has surpassed even \nthe legendary Senator John C. Stennis, who served 31 years and 2 months \nof his impressive 42 years of service as a Senator from Mississippi in \nthe shadow of the equally legendary Senator James O. Eastland. This \nrecord is a testament to both the performance and the endurance of \nSenator Hollings and his distinguished senior Senator, Strom Thurmond. \nI know that Senator Hollings wears his title with pride and good humor, \nand his home state of South Carolina is all the better for it.\n  As these last weeks of this congressional session come to a \nclattering and confusing end amid legislation, floor debates, and \nappropriations conferences, I am proud to keep a resolution I made last \nNew Year's day to remember and pay tribute to a good friend and a \nremarkable, well talented Senator. I hope during his next birthday, \ncome January 1, the year 2000, hidden among the hoopla and hyperbole \nsurrounding the year 2000, that Senator Hollings and his lovely wife, \nPeatsy, can celebrate his birthday knowing that it does not pass \nunnoticed or unacknowledged by his friends here in the Senate.\n  So, on behalf of my wife Erma, I say to Senator Hollings these words:\n\n     Count your garden by the flowers\n     Never by the leaves that fall;\n     Count your days by the sunny hours,\n     Not remembering clouds at all;\n     Count your nights by stars, not shadows,\n     Count your life by smiles, not tears,\n     And on that beautiful January day,\n     Count your age by friends, not years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15201-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SENATE FAMILY APPRECIATION\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I also want to thank the members of staffs \nof Senators, and the Members, the Senate family who sit here before us \nevery day, who work so assiduously and in such a dedicated fashion. \nThey make our lives easier than they would otherwise be, and they make \nit possible, whereas it would be otherwise impossible, for us to do the \nwork of serving our constituents. I hope that they will all have a very \nhappy Thanksgiving and very pleasant Christmas.\n  Let me also thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. The \nlovely lady from Maine sits in the majority leader's chair at this \nmoment; she does the work of the Senate in such a beautiful manner, and \nwho does so with such skill and dignity as rare as the day in June.\n  I want to thank everyone. I want to thank my own colleague, Jay \nRockefeller, for being my colleague, and I want to thank the official \nreporters for doing their difficult work and doing it so well and so \npromptly and always so courteously.\n  So I thank, in closing, the two leaders who make it possible for all \nof us to get our work done. They are courteous; they are very helpful. \nI particularly thank the distinguished majority leader for his \nassistance in regard to the amendment I offered yesterday and which was \ncosponsored by my senior colleague and by the senior Senator from \nKentucky and the junior Senator from Kentucky, Mitch McConnell, and Mr. \nBunning, and all of the other Senators on both sides of the aisle who \nworked with me on behalf of that amendment. I thank my own leader for \nalso helping to pave the way for us to have a vote, have the Senate \nvote on that amendment.\n  When Thanksgiving Day comes and the turkey is being carved and my \ndear wife of 62, almost 62\\1/2\\ years, and my lovely daughters, their \nhusbands, our grandchildren, and our great grandchildren are all around \nme, we will think of the blessings of the good Lord, and one of those \nblessings is that of being in the company of and associated with so \nmany wonderful people who are part of the Senate family every day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15201-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SENATOR BYRD\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Although practices vary from \nState to State, many foster children find themselves at risk of \nhomelessness and being uninsured when they reach their 18th birthday. \nThe families caring for them lose their financial assistance and the \nchildren themselves lose their health insurance coverage under the \nMedicaid program.\n  This can occur, even if the child is still in high school, even if \nthe child has not yet graduated but has turned 18. Each year about \n20,000 teenagers are forced to leave the foster care system simply \nbecause they have reached the age of 18. The legislation we are \nconsidering this evening will help remedy this very serious problem. It \nis similar to legislation that has already overwhelming passed the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Among other things, the legislation renames the independent living \nprograms for older foster children to be John H. Chafee Foster Care \nIndependence Program. The legislation doubles the funding for States to \nassist young people in making the transition from foster care to \nindependent living. It will double the funding from $70 million to $140 \nmillion a year.\n  The bill also provides access to needed health and mental health \nservices for the teenagers who are ``aging out'' of foster care by \nencouraging States to extend Medicaid coverage to these young people \nuntil they reach the age of 21. Moreover, the legislation recognizes \nour moral obligation to provide special help for young people, age 18 \nto 21, who have left the foster care program.\n  The last hearing that Senator Chafee chaired was on the issue of \nfoster care teenagers. I remember his discussing with me how deeply \nmoved he was by a teenage girl who had to finish high school while \nliving in a homeless shelter.\n\n  This legislation will help prevent these kinds of tragedies by \nrequiring States to use some portion of their funds under the new John \nChafee Independent Program for room and board for 18- to 21-year-olds \nwho have left foster care. At the same time, the legislation also gives \nStates greater flexibility in designing their independent living \nprograms.\n  Senator Chafee and Senator Rockefeller brought together a lot of \nthese older foster children to meet with a number of us who were \ninterested in hearing their stories. We heard incredible hardships of \nteenagers who were trying to finish high school while coping with \nmedical problems and the loss of their foster homes. One of them was \nliving in laundromats, was brushing her teeth at a McDonald's, was \ntrying to keep her life together under very difficult circumstances.\n  This simply should not occur. This bill will go a long way to prevent \nsuch awful situations by making sure we are helping these teenagers, \nthese young adults as they transition from foster care to independent \nliving.\n  The Foster Care Independence Act will provide much needed support to \nvulnerable teenagers as they make the critical and always difficult, \nunder the best circumstances, transition from adolescence to adulthood. \nIt will greatly improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of young \npeople who will move through the foster care system in future years. As \nsuch, it serves as a tremendous living tribute to the late Senator John \nChafee, who was so committed to their care.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this very important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill now before the \nSenate, the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999.\n  Before I describe this bill, let me point out that this measure is a \ntribute to the late Senator John Chafee. This legislation was Senator \nChafee's last child welfare initiative in the Finance Committee. As \nmembers know, the well being of the nation's youth, particularly the \nmost disadvantaged, was very important to John.\n  This legislation will provide important assistance to the nation's \nfoster care children. Each year about 20,000 teenagers must leave \nfoster care because they have reached the age of 18. They are then left \nto their own devices, to make a life for themselves, often with no one \nto rely on for emotional and financial support. Not surprisingly, these \nyoung people are more likely to quit school, be unemployed, have \nchildren out of wedlock, and end up on welfare or in jail.\n  With this bill, we show that this country has not forgotten these \nyoung people. As parents, we do certainly not cut off our children at \n18. Indeed, children in foster care have more need than most for a \nhelping hand if they are to succeed in adulthood. It is simply common \nsense and good policy to make a small investment to ensure that these \nyoung people become productive taxpaying citizens who can make \ncontributions to society.\n  The Foster Care Independence Act doubles the money available to the \nStates for the independent living program, from $70 million to $140 \nmillion per year. This program helps young people make the transition \nfrom foster care to self-sufficiency. The bill expands the program by \nproviding former foster children between 18 and 21 assistance in \npreparing for further education, planning a career, or training for a \njob. These programs also offer personal support through mentors, as \nwell as financial assistance and housing.\n  This bill encourages, but does not require, States to provide \nMedicaid to young adults who have left foster care. The bill also \nincreases the amount foster children may save and still be eligible for \nfoster care. Such savings will help prepare these young people for the \nday when they will be on their own.\n  Lastly, the bill includes a number of reforms that will reduce fraud \nin the Supplemental Security Income program. The SSI program is on \nGAO's list of high risk programs.\n  A childhood spent in foster care is a big enough challenge. Let us \nhelp these children find a brighter future. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation in the memory of John Chafee.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to join a bipartisan \ngroup of my colleagues in support of the John H. Chafee--Foster Care \nIndependence Act of 1999.\n  My friend and colleague John Chafee will be honored numerous times in \nthe coming years for his extraordinary public service to both the state \nand country that he so loved. He should be. There will be many fitting \nways to pay him tribute by advancing the many causes important to him.\n  Enacting the fundamental principles of his bill into law today will \nbe one small way that we can all honor a man who was an outstanding \nmember and statesman in a way that I think he would appreciate because \nit helps some of our citizens who are most in need.\n  Senator Chafee has been a tireless champion for children and young \npeople who need a voice, and occasionally some muscle, for many years. \nI had the privilege to work with him on just some of his efforts to \nhelp children, and in particular, to help repair and improve our \nadoption and foster care policies.\n  Senator Chafee's unflagging commitment to vulnerable young people was\n\n[[Page S15203]]\n\nexemplified by his work on the legislation now before the Senate. Just \na few days before his death, he approached me personally to talk about \nwhat we could do to ensure that this legislation would pass into law \nthis year.\n  I also believe that John himself would not agree with honoring him as \na motive--he would expect us to pass this legislation for the teens in \nfoster care who need and deserve more help. On October 13th, Senator \nChafee and I held a subcommittee hearing on this bill, and it was our \nlast hearing together. John was engaged in talking to the teens at the \nhearing and after listening to them, he knew that fighting to get this \nbill done was the right thing to do.\n  Since John cannot fulfill this vision, I am grateful to the \nRepublican leadership for carrying forward in his name. Senators \nNickles, Lott, and other members of the leadership have worked very \nhard to make this one of the final bills we will pass in 1999.\n  Our First Lady, Mrs. Clinton, has also been a special leader on \nbehalf of vulnerable children. In 1997, she helped focus the national \nspotlight on the need to promote adoption. This year, she has helped to \nfocus much needed attention on the challenges facing teenagers who age \nout of foster care, and has challenged us to improve the system for \nsuch teens by expanding the Independent Living program.\n  I am keenly aware of the child welfare work that remains. I have \nworked closely this year with Senator Grassley and understand the \nconcerns that he has about the need for greater accountability and \nindependent oversight for our nation's child welfare system. Senator \nGrassley believes that there must be independent review of the foster \ncare system, and he is advocating that every state establish \nIndependent Foster Care Review Boards composed of volunteers. I have \nagreed with Senator Grassley that this is a worthy strategy and I am \ncommitted to continue working with him next year as we seek innovative \nand effective ways to better serve all of our nation's abused and \nneglected children.\n  In addition to Senator Grassley's concerns, there are other issues in \nchild welfare that need continued work. That is why I have also worked \nwith Senators DeWine, Landrieu, and others on a bill that will \nstrengthen our child abuse and neglect courts, and another that will \nensure that all abused and neglected children with special needs are \neligible for adoption subsidy. These are just a few of the steps we \nneed to take in 2000 and beyond.\n  While we still have much to do, we have made some progress. We have \nbeen pleased to learn that one of the desired outcomes of the 1997 \nAdoption Act, moving children more swiftly from foster care into \npermanent homes, has begun to become a reality. Adoptions throughout \nthe country are up dramatically, far exceeding expectations. In \nSeptember, the President announced that 35 states had exceeded their \ngoals for adoption placements and received bonus payments as a result. \nThis is wonderful news for America's foster children.\n  Yet, at the same time, it's disturbing to know that approximately \n20,000 young people each year who turn 18 and ``age out'' of the foster \ncare system suddenly face the cold and often cruel consequence of no \nhome, no family, no medical coverage and no system of support in place. \nIn my own state of West Virginia, only 185 of the more than 1000 foster \nchildren over the age of 16 were able to get additional help through \nthe state's Independent Living program.\n  A Wisconsin study tells us that 18 months after leaving foster care, \nover one-third of the teens leaving foster care had not graduated from \nhigh school, half were unemployed, nearly half had no access to or \ncoverage for health care, and many were homeless or victims or \nperpetrators of crimes. These are not just numbers, each of these \nstatistics represents a real person, like the young people who \ntestified before the Finance Committee, Terry and Percy.\n  When Terry turned 18 she was still in high school. She quickly became \nhomeless, and shared with us the horrifying stories of sleeping in \nalleys, laundry-mats and hospital waiting rooms, brushing her teeth in \nMacDonald's restrooms so she could complete high school. She developed \nseveral medical problems including chicken pox and kidney problems for \nwhich she had no access to health care. Her problems worsened, and \ntoday, she has permanent kidney damage as a result of the lack of care.\n  Like Terry, Percy aged out of foster care while still in high school. \nHe did not become homeless, thanks to the support of a local \nIndependence Living program, he was assisted in obtaining an apartment \nand a job. Still, it was a big challenge to be totally on his own while \nstill finishing school. He graduated and was motivated to go to \ncollege, but soon had to drop out because of his lack of health care \ncoverage. Today, Percy is a successful and popular police officer, who \nstill has a dream of finishing college one day.\n  This legislation before the Senate will provide resources and \nincentives to states so that fewer of our young people will become \nstories as horrific as Terry's, and more will receive the types of \nsupport that Percy received.\n  One of the most significant provisions of the 1997 Adoption Act was \nthe assurance of ongoing health care coverage for all children with \nspecial needs who move from foster care to adoption. This bill will \nestablish, the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program, as the \nessential next step to expand vital access to health care for \nvulnerable youth. This important legislation will make it possible for \nhealth care coverage for our foster care youths not to end when they \nturn 18. Young people who have survived the many traumas that led to \ntheir placement in foster care, and their journey through the foster \ncare system often have special health care needs, especially in the \narea of mental health. Providing transitional health coverage at this \ncrucial juncture in their lives can make the difference between \nsuccessfully moving on to accomplish their goals, or becoming stuck in \nan unsatisfying and unhealthy way of life.\n  Another key focus of the 97 Adoption Act is on moving children from \nfoster care to permanent homes, and when possible adoption. Older teens \nin foster care have a great need for a permenant family. Although we \npropose to improve the Independent Living program and increase \neligibility for services to the age of 21, it does end at that time. \nAnd yet a youth's need for a family does not end at any particular age. \nEach of us can clearly recall times when we have had to turn to our own \nfamilies for advice, comfort or support long after our 18th or 21st \nbirthdays. Many of us are still in the role of providing such support \nto our own children who are in their late teens or 20s. Therefore, an \nimportant provision in this Foster Care Independence Act states that \nIndependent Living (IL), programs are not alternatives to permanency \nplanning--young people of all ages need and deserve every possible \neffort made towards permanence, including adoption. It would be \ncounterproductive to create any disincentive for adoption of teenagers. \nTherefore, our legislation would allow any enhanced independent living \nservices to be carried out concurrent with adoption services for older \nteens, and involves adoptive parents in assisting these teens in \nbecoming successfully independent.\n  Independent Living programs were designed to provide young people \nwith training, skill-development and support as they make the \ntransition from foster care to self-sufficiency. In some states, with \ncreativity and innovation, these programs have seen remarkable success \nin that effort. In other localities, the programs have provided minimal \nsupport, and young people have faced an array of challenging life \ndecisions and choices without the skills or support to make them \nsuccessfully. This bill will provide the resources to improve \nIndependent Programs so that they can achieve the basic goal. Funding \nis provided for national evaluation and for technical assistance to \nstates to promote quality, and reports back to Congress so we can \nfollow the progress of these efforts.\n  These will be valuable steps in our efforts to more effectively \naddress the needs of our Nation's most vulnerable young people, on the \nbrink of adulthood. I urge my colleagues to join us in passing this \nbill for foster teens and in memory of John Chafee's long career \ndedicated to the children and others in need of his immense dedication \nand caring heart.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, some 4 months ago I was proud to \ncosponsor\n\n[[Page S15204]]\n\nthis legislation when it was introduced by the late Senator John \nChafee. I am prouder today that we are passing it. I am saddened, \nthough, that he is not here with us to see it happen.\n  This legislation is typical of the work of Senator Chafee. It helps \ndisadvantaged, often forgotten, children--those who are victims of \nabuse and neglect and have to be taken into foster care. It is \npractical. The bill is targeted and will help expand small-scale \nefforts already on the ground. And it is bipartisan, representing a \nconsensus on how to move forward now.\n  In particular, this bill will help a group of our children in dire \ncircumstances--foster children who leave foster care because they ``age \nout,'' not because they are reunified with their birth families or are \nadopted. About 20,000 children a year ``age out'' of the foster care \nsystem. They reach 18 and we, in large part, abandon them to the world. \nMany make their way successfully. But far too many, alas, do not, and \nthese children are more likely to become homeless or end up on public \nassistance.\n  More than a decade ago, we recognized that these children needed \nadditional help in preparing for life on their own. I am proud to have \nhelped create the Independent Living program, which provided Federal \nsupport for efforts that prepare teenagers for the transition from \nfoster care to independence. The bill will double funding for the \nIndependent Living program and increase the use of the funds to assist \nformer foster care children until they reach 21, including, for the \nfirst time, help with room and board. As any parent knows, many 19- and \n20-year-olds remain in need of family support from time to time. For \nchildren who have ``aged out'' of foster care by turning 18, the \ngovernment is, in effect, their parent and we should do more to help \nthem become independent and self-sufficient, just as other parents do.\n  This legislation has widespread support, including from the \nadministration and key members of both parties. I would like to \nparticularly thank the First Lady for her leadership in working on \nbehalf of these children. Senator Rockefeller and Chairman Roth have \nbeen important as well. But, above all, I thank the late Senator \nChafee.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to join Senators Roth, Collins, \nLincoln, Chafee, Moynihan, and others in support of the Foster Care \nIndependence Act.\n  The Foster Care Independence Act, a top priority of the late Senator \nJohn Chafee, addresses the needs of children aging out of the foster \ncare system who are facing the loss of critical support and benefits at \na point when they most need them.\n  Nationally, an estimated 20,000 foster care children ``age out'' of \nthe system each year. In my home state of Rhode Island, approximately \n30 percent of all children currently in foster care are older and will \nsoon be leaving the system.\n  When these young people leave the foster care system, they often find \nthemselves on their own with few financial resources; limited \neducation, training and employment options; no place to live; and \nlittle or no support from their community.\n  The vulnerability of this population cannot be overstated. Studies \nshow that those leaving foster care experience higher rates of \nunemployment and illegitimate pregnancies and are more likely to fall \nvictim to crime. Indeed, twenty-five to forty percent of these young \nadults transitioning from foster care experience homelessness; only \nabout half have completed high school; and less than half find jobs.\n  Without the emotional, social, and financial support families \nprovide, many of these young adults are not adequately prepared for \nlife. If we do not arm them with the resources and skills they need as \nthey transition out of foster care, we are sentencing these kids to \nfailure and chronic dependency. We may see them again and again--on our \nwelfare rolls, in our prisons, living on our streets. We do not want \nthat legacy for any of our children, particularly when we know how to \nprevent such tragedies from happening in the first place.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Senate's Foster Care \nIndependence Act, which will help these young adults make a strong and \nsustainable transition to independent adulthood by expanding resources \navailable through the Independent Living Program; allowing states to \nuse Independent Living funds for basic living needs, including room and \nboard; and allowing states to provide health care, including coverage \nof mental health needs, through Medicaid.\n  It is fitting that this legislation also renames the Independent \nLiving Program after Senator John Chafee who worked so long on this \nissue and so hard on this legislation.\n  I am confident, however, that Senator Chafee would have said that we \nneed to do more for these young people. He advocated strongly for \nrequiring states to provide health care to those aging out of the \nfoster care system that need it. This requirement is not included in \nthe bill we are passing today, but I encourage my own Governor and \nothers to use the flexibility in this bill to provide health care to \nall those aging out of foster care. While I remain committed to \ncontinuing my work on this issue, I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation. It is an important step in helping young people leaving \nfoster care to live up to their fullest potential.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, although I have only recently joined \nthe Senate and did not have the privilege of working on this bill, I am \nhonored to rise as a cosponsor of the John H. Chafee Foster Care \nIndependence Act of 1999. I cannot think of a more fitting tribute to \nthe memory of my late father than approving this legislation renamed in \nhis honor.\n  I thank the leadership for bringing this bill to the floor so soon \nafter my father's passing. And I would also like to acknowledge the \nhard work of the others who led the effort: Senators Rockefeller, \nCollins, Snowe, Jeffords, Moynihan, Bond, and others. Along with my \nfather, your efforts will provide assistance to one of our nation's \nmost vulnerable groups: older children in the foster care program.\n  Currently, Independent Living Programs for older foster children end \nat their 18th birthday, abandoning these teens in the middle of a \ncritical transition period from adolescence to adulthood. Sadly, these \nyoung people are left to negotiate the rough waters of adulthood \nwithout vital health and mental health resources and critical life-\nskills.\n  However, this legislation will cushion a usually abrupt transition by \nfunding Independent Living Programs for foster children through their \n21st birthday. It also provides states the option to extend health and \nmental health care benefits to these youngsters until age 21 under the \nMedicaid Program and specifies a minimum grant of $500,000 for smaller \nstates like Rhode Island to provide such benefits.\n  Before he died, my father learned first-hand of the need for this \nlegislation when several older foster care children who had ``aged-\nout'' of the system testified before his Finance Subcommittee. These \nyoungsters told moving stories; sleeping outdoors, eating out of \ndumpsters, and accepting the charity of their teachers to pay for \nmedical bills became their harsh reality because they were too old to \nremain in an Independent Living Program or a foster family. As a \nresult, many of his Senate colleagues and First Lady Hillary Clinton \ncheered him on in his efforts to enact this legislation.\n  Indeed, ensuring that the most vulnerable members of our society \nretained basic human dignity guided my father's actions during his \nyears of public service. Bipartisanship was also a watchword he live \nby. This bill encompasses both of these noble qualities and I know he \nwould be honored by the passage of this legislation today. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this important measure.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the critical \nissue of foster care. Today, there are more than 500,000 children and \nteens in our nation's foster care system. These children represent one \nof the most vulnerable segments of our population: Children who have \nbeen taken from unsafe homes, and children who have suffered from abuse \nand neglect. This group of children deserves all the love and attention \nof a loving, caring and permanent family. Foster care is not \npermanency. I repeat, foster care is and should not be viewed as \npermanency for children.\n  Unfortunately, some youth in foster care--estimated at 20,000 each \nyear--\n\n[[Page S15205]]\n\nare not placed in a permanent, safe home before they are graduated from \nthe child welfare system. These youth are expected to be self-\nsufficient, in many States at the age of eighteen. Foster care \nindependent living programs, also known as ILPs, were initiated in 1985 \nin an attempt to provide this segment of the foster care population \nwith the skills necessary for self-sufficiency. States have flexibility \nin the type of services they provide to their older foster youth; some \noptions include assistance in locating employment, help in completing \nhigh school, or training in budgeting and other living skills.\n  The results of ILPs have been, at best, mixed. Two weeks ago, the \nGovernment Accounting Office released a report entitled ``Effectiveness \nof Independent Living Services Unknown.'' GAO conducted a study of ILPs \nat the request of House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources \nChairman Nancy Johnson. This report reveals that only one national \nstudy has been completed to date, and the study determined that ILPs \nhave the ``potential to improve outcomes for youths.'' The study went \non to say that ``while HHS is tasked with overseeing implementation of \nILP, it has done little to determine program effectiveness and has no \nestablished method to review the states' progress in helping youths in \nthe transition from foster care.'' The GAO report recommends that the \nSecretary of HHS develop ``a uniform set of data elements and a report \nformat for state reporting . . . and concrete measures of effectiveness \nof assessing state ILPs.''\n  I have, for a number of years, been concerned about the issue of \naccountability within the child welfare system. And, the GAO report \nsupports my belief that more explicit information is needed from the \nStates and HHS in order to ensure that Federal money is being spend in \na manner that truly benefits the lives of our nation's troubled youth.\n  Today, the Senate passed legislation that will double the amount of \nmoney provided to States to conduct independent living programs. And, I \nam highly disappointed in the lack of specificity and accountability \nmeasures within the bill. Yes, the Secretary of HHS will be required to \ndevelop outcome measures and identify data elements in an attempt to \ncollect uniform data from the States. However, there is great leeway \nprovided the Secretary in developing such measures and States are not \nrequired to improve upon their own past performance. The Foster Care \nIndependence Act, as passed by the Senate, does require the Secretary \nto report within 12 months her plans and timetable for collecting data \nand information from States. I am committed to following the progress \nof the Secretary in collecting data and developing standards for the \nStates. Rest assured, I will be watching. And, I will do whatever is \nrequired of me to ensure that our nation's foster youth are provided \nwith the most effective and worthwhile services their State agencies \ncan provide.\n  Accountability is critical in any human undertaking. It provides an \nenvironment for those doing well to be commended and recognized. And, \nit sheds light on those acting irresponsibly. We in Congress have the \nresponsibility to see that taxpayer money is spend wisely. I see a no \nmore critical responsibility than in ensuring States are responsibly \nspending money on vulnerable youth in foster care.\n  November is National Adoption Month. Earlier this month, I joined my \ncolleagues with the Congressional Coalition on Adoption in celebrating \nthose who have made a difference through adoption. I was able to honor \nthree worthy individuals from the great State of Iowa: Ruth Ann Gaines \nand Jeff and Earletta Morris. Ruth Ann adopted an autistic boy more \nthan 14 years ago, and the Morrises adopted a teenager just over a year \nago. I am grateful for their efforts and heart-felt belief in the value \nof family, and I am glad to announce them ``Angels in Adoption.''\n  In closing, I want to reaffirm my commitment to finding permanent, \nloving families for each boy and girl currently without a loving and \nsafe home. I am disappointed the Foster Care Independence Act did not \ncontain more provisions supporting permanency. However, I will continue \nmy efforts in support of permanency for children in foster care. Among \nothers, Congresswoman Nancy Johnson has given me her word that she will \nwork with me to improve accountability in the child welfare system. I \nlook forward to working with all my colleagues in the next session to \nthat end.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

BALE, KEEPER OF THE STATIONERY\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 240, submitted \nearlier today by Senators Lott and Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislation clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 240) commending Stephen G. Bale, \n     Keeper of the Stationery, United States Senate.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on December 31, 1999, Steve Bale will retire \nas Keeper of the Stationery for the United States Senate.\n  Steve began his Senate career in November 1969 as a clerk in the \nStationery Room. In July 1980, he was appointed Assistant Keeper of the \nStationery, and in September 1987, assumed the responsibilities as the \n16th Keeper of the Stationery.\n  In this capacity, Steve has directed a busy operation, successfully \nserving a client base that now spans over 240 offices and five \nbuildings. His leadership of the recent renovations to the Stationery \nRoom has ensured that the office will function efficiently, well into \nthe 21st century.\n  In his 30 years of public service. Steve has set a standard among his \nassociates for commitment to excellence and dedication to personal \nservice. According to his staff, one of Steve's favorite expressions \nis, ``In this business, one `oops' can wipe out fifteen `attaboys'!'' \nThe standard of excellence he set will benefit the Senate for years to \ncome, as the associates he leaves behind continue in the tradition of \nthe principles he espoused.\n  Steve Bale should enter his retirement with tremendous satisfaction \nfor all he has accomplished. I am pleased to join so many others in \nthanking him for his long and faithful service and in wishing him \nhealth and happiness in the years to come.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Steve Bale is one of those individuals \nwho serve faithfully and diligently over many years to ensure that the \nUnited States Senate runs efficiently and effectively. All Senators \nknow and appreciate the members of the Senate community who share their \npride in public service and commitment to the Senate. We know we could \nnot do our jobs without the dedication of people such as Steve Bale.\n  Steve began his career in the Senate in 1969 as an employee of the \nStationery Room under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Senate \nand ultimately became Keeper of the Stationery. Not many ascend to that \nunusual title; there have been only fourteen in the history of the \nSenate. The first person to hold that title was John Lewis Clubb who \nwas given the title in 1854, after some twenty years of actually doing \nthe job. Some may wonder what the Keeper of the Stationery does for the \nSenate and how that job and title came into being.\n  The Stationery Room can be traced back to the First Congress and the \nfirst Secretary of the Senate, Samuel A. Otis, who provided various \nwriting and other supplies for the Senate. Operated initially out of a \ncorner of the Secretary's office, the Stationery Room has occupied nine \ndifferent locations within the Senate. It has grown from this corner-\noffice operation into a multi-million dollar one serving about 240 \noffices in the Senate and expanded from its initial offerings of ``ink, \nquills, and parchment'' to a complex merchandise facility which meets \nthe hightech and traditional needs of these offices.\n  The Stationery Room used to be a simple, service desk facility. Steve \nled the transition to a full self-service store. Under Steve's \ndirection, the administrative and business functions of the Stationery \nRoom were automated for the first time. He oversaw the installation and \nGAO certification of an inventory control system and has supervised the \ninstallation and testing of the new Y2K compliant computer system. With \nSteve at the helm, we can all be absolutely certain that the Senate's \nStationery Room will NOT have Y2K problems!\n  Of particular note is the role Steve played in the development and \nprocurement of the Senate's official flag. S. Res. 369, agreed to on \nSeptember 7, 1984, directed ``the Secretary of the Senate to design and \nmake available to Members an official Senate flag.'' Working closely \nwith the staff of the Committee on Rules and Administration, Steve \nprovided the expertise to have a flag designed, find the appropriate \nmanufacturer and ensure that the Senate has official flags for all of \nits official functions. Few Senators know about the relatively brief \nhistory of the Senate flag and fewer still know about Steve's important \nrole in seeing that this resolution's direction was successfully \ncarried out and that the Senate has a suitable and dignified flag.\n  We are fortunate to share a wonderful sense of community among the \nmembers and staff who serve here. Steve is among the most respected and \nwell liked within this small community. Always helpful, always smiling, \nalways encouraging to the numerous staff who come into his office on a \ndaily basis, he has found no problem too trivial and no task too \ndifficult to handle.\n  As Steve leaves his many friends and admirers in the Senate, we wish \nhim a long retirement filled with many hours on the golf course.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to this \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 240) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 240\n\n       Whereas the Senate has been advised that its Keeper of the \n     Stationery, Stephen G. Bale, will retire on December 31, \n     1999;\n       Whereas Steve Bale became an employee of the Senate of the \n     United States on November 13, 1969, and since that date has \n     ably and faithfully upheld the high standards and traditions \n     of the Senate for a period that included sixteen Congresses;\n       Whereas Steve Bale has served with distinction as Keeper of \n     the Stationery, and at all times has discharged the important \n     duties and responsibilities of his office with dedication and \n     excellence; and\n       Whereas his exceptional service and his unfailing \n     dedication have earned him our esteem and affection: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate commends Stephen G. \n     Bale for his exemplary service to the Senate and the Nation; \n     wishes to express its deep appreciation for his long, \n     faithful and outstanding service; and extends its very best \n     wishes upon his retirement.\n       Sec. 2. That the Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a \n     copy of this resolution to Stephen G. Bale.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15206-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15206-S15213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 3419.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3419) to amend title 49, United States Code, \n     to establish the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider H.R. \n3419, the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999. H.R. 3419 \nreflects a negotiated compromise between the House and Senate on two \nbills (S. 1501 and H.R. 2679). I want to extend my appreciation to \nSenators Hutchison, Hollings, and Breaux, along with Congressmen \nShuster and Oberstar, for their bipartisan effort in developing this \ncomprehensive motor carrier safety legislation. I also want to \nacknowledge the recommendations by the Office of the Department of \nTransportation (DOT) Inspector General, Ken Mead and his staff, as well \nas the highway safety advocates, truck drivers, industry officials, and \nsafety enforcement officials for their suggestions on improving truck \nand bus safety.\n  During the past year, significant attention has been directed toward \ntruck safety issues in both chambers. Following a comprehensive \nanalysis on the federal motor carrier safety program by the DOT \nInspector General, the Commerce Committee held two hearings on truck \nsafety concerns. The\n\n[[Page S15207]]\n\nHouse Transportation and Infrastructure Committee also conducted a \nnumber of oversight hearings and DOT initiated its own programmatic \nreview. Based on these efforts, a consensus on the need to enact \nlegislation to improve truck safety developed leading to the bipartisan \nlegislation before the Senate today.\n  The Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act would establish a separate \nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration within the DOT to carry out \nmotor carrier safety responsibilities. I clearly do not desire to \nexpand the size of the federal government. I know my view is shared by \nmany of my colleagues. However, the near unanimous views voiced by all \nthe interested parties involved in motor carrier safety agree that a \nseparate agency is needed to remedy a severe lack of leadership over \nmotor carrier safety enforcement and regulatory responsibilities at \nDOT. This legislation addresses this serious safety lapse, but guards \nagainst increasing the already bloated Federal bureaucracy by capping \nemployment and funding for the new agency for Fiscal Year 2000.\n  This legislation provides additional motor carrier safety funding and \nwe fully expect those resources to be dedicated toward increased motor \ncarrier safety enforcement and inspection activities. The cost for \nunnecessary headquarters administrative or overhead positions, \nincluding public affairs officers, congressional liaison \nrepresentatives and other nonsafety related positions, is not a proper \nuse of the additional authorized funding. Therefore, the Administration \nis required to provided a detailed justification to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation and the House Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure before increasing any administrative \nor overhead positions beyond the current level.\n  Mr. President, this legislation includes numerous provisions to \nremedy truck and bus safety problems. I believe one of the most \nimportant items in the bill is the provision directing the Department \nto implement all of the safety recommendations issued by the IG's April \n1999 audit report. DOT has indicated it will act on some of the \nrecommendations, but it has been more than six months since the release \nof the IG's report and DOT has yet to articulate a definitive action \nplan to implement all of the IG's recommendations. I do not believe we \ncan risk the consequences of ignoring any of these recommendations and \naccordingly, H.R. 3419 would require concrete action to eliminate the \nidentified safety gaps at DOT. It also gives DOT authority to establish \nan advisory committee to assist the Secretary in the timely completion \nof rulemakings and other matters.\n\n  This legislation is also designed to improve the Commercial Driver's \nLicense program. It would ensure a commercial motor vehicle driver has \nonly one driver record. This uniform driving record would include all \ntraffic violation convictions, whether those violation are committed in \na passenger vehicle or a commercial vehicle. The legislation would also \nrequire DOT to initiate a rulemaking to combine driver medical records \nwith the commercial drivers license.\n  Mr. President, the legislation also initiates several actions to \nremedy inaccurate and incomplete safety data. We must have accurate \ndata if we are going to be able to target enforcement action against \nunsafe carriers and get them off our roads. Consequently, H.R. 3419 \ndirects the Secretary to carry out a program to improve the collection \nand analysis of commercial motor vehicle crash data, including accident \ncausation. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), \nin cooperation with the newly established Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration, would administer the data improvement program.\n  The legislation also addresses problems identified by the DOT \nInspector General concerning foreign truck companies. It reaffirms the \nexisting prohibition on foreign motor carriers from operating or \nleasing equipment anywhere within the United States outside the \nboundaries of a commercial zone along the U.S.-Mexico Border unless \nsuch foreign carriers have DOT authority to operate beyond the zones.\n  Mr. President, this comprehensive safety legislation includes many \nother important provisions. I urge my colleagues to support passage of \nthis important safety legislation. I ask unanimous consent a detailed \nJoint Explanatory Statement of the bill be printed in the Record \nimmediately following my remarks. This Joint Statement will provide \nlegislative history interpreting this important motor carrier safety \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Joint Explanatory Statement on H.R. 3419, Motor Carrier Safety \n                        Improvement Act of 1999\n\n\n               section 1. short title; table of contents\n\n       The provision provides that this Act may be cited as the \n     ``Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999.'' The section \n     also includes a table of contents for the bill.\n\n\n                       sec. 2. secretary defined\n\n       The provision defines the term ``Secretary'' to mean the \n     Secretary of Transportation.\n\n\n                            sec. 3. findings\n\n       The provision makes eight findings on motor carrier safety. \n     Among other findings, Congress finds that the current rate, \n     number, and severity of crashes involving motor carriers are \n     unacceptable; the number of Federal and State motor carrier \n     compliance reviews and commercial motor vehicle and operator \n     inspections is insufficient; civil penalties for violators \n     must be utilized to deter future violations; and meaningful \n     measures to improve safety must be implemented expeditiously \n     to prevent increases in motor carrier crashes, injuries, and \n     fatalities. Congress further finds that proper use of Federal \n     resources is essential to the Department of Transportation's \n     ability to improve its research, rulemaking, oversight, and \n     enforcement activities.\n\n\n                            sec. 4. purposes\n\n       The provision lists the purposes of this Act as improving \n     the administration of the Federal motor carrier safety \n     program by establishing a Federal Motor Carrier Safety \n     Administration in the Department of Transportation and by \n     enacting measures to reduce the number and severity of large \n     truck-involved crashes through increased inspections and \n     compliance reviews, stronger enforcement measures, expedited \n     rulemakings, scientifically sound research, and improvements \n     to the commercial driver's license program.\n\n          TITLE I--FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY ADMINISTRATION\n\n\n sec. 101. establishment of federal motor carrier safety administration\n\n       Subsection 101(a) adds a new section 113 to title 49, \n     United States Code, to establish, as a separate \n     administration within the Department of Transportation, the \n     Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). The \n     managers note that Section 101 provides that ``in carrying \n     out its duties, the Administrator shall consider the \n     assignment and maintenance of safety as the highest \n     priority.'' This subsection is modeled on provisions which \n     govern the activities of the Federal Aviation Administration \n     and the Secretary of Transportation's responsibilities for \n     the regulation of air transportation. See 49 U.S.C. \n     40101(a)(1) and (d) and 49 U.S.C. 47101(a)(1). The Managers \n     intend that new section 101 be interpreted and implemented in \n     the same manner as the above-listed provisions in the laws \n     governing aviation.\n       The Administration is headed by a Presidentially appointed, \n     Senate-confirmed Administrator with professional experience \n     in motor carrier safety; a Deputy Administrator appointed by \n     the Secretary with the approval of the President, and a Chief \n     Safety Officer appointed in the competitive service. In \n     addition to any duties and powers prescribed by the \n     Secretary, the Administrator shall carry out the duties and \n     powers related to motor carriers and motor carrier safety set \n     forth in chapters 5, 51, 55, 57, 59, 133 through 149, 311, \n     313, 315, and 317 of title 49, United States Code, and 42 \n     U.S.C. 4917.\n       Subsection (b) provides dedicated funding for the \n     administrative and research expenses of the FMCSA. This \n     subsection increases funding 70 percent (an average of $38 \n     million per year) above the level currently provided within \n     the Federal Highway Administration, to improve the motor \n     carrier safety research, rulemaking, oversight, and \n     enforcement activities transferred to the FMCSA.\n       Subsections (c) and (d) make conforming amendments to \n     titles 5 and 49, United States Code.\n       Subsection (e) caps the employment level currently at the \n     Office of Motor Carrier Safety at its headquarters location \n     in fiscal year 2000, except for staff transferred to the \n     Office from the Federal Highway Administration, for fiscal \n     year 2000. The cap includes Office of Motor Carrier Safety \n     staff and FHWA transferred employees (FTEs) who were \n     already dedicated to motor carrier safety matters when the \n     Office of Motor Carrier Safety was established in October \n     1999. It does not preclude further transfers from the FHWA \n     to the FMCSA during fiscal year 2000.\n       The Congress has provided additional motor carrier safety \n     funding and expects those resources to be dedicated toward \n     increased motor carrier safety enforcement and inspection \n     activities and to expedite\n\n[[Page S15208]]\n\n     rulemakings. The cost of unnecessary headquarters \n     administrative or overhead positions, including public \n     affairs officers, congressional liaison representatives and \n     other nonsafety-related positions, is not a proper use of the \n     additional authorized funding. These headquarters' officials \n     are not involved in carrying out safety responsibilities such \n     as developing policies and regulations to enforce motor \n     carrier safety laws.\n       Subsection (e) requires the Secretary to report to the \n     Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and \n     the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on \n     the specific FMSCA personnel requested for each of fiscal \n     years 2001, 2002, and 2003. The Secretary's justifications \n     for any additional FMSCA headquarters' administrative or \n     overhead positions shall include detailed descriptions of the \n     specific needs to be addressed by the additional personnel. \n     Such justifications must be submitted to allow sufficient \n     time for the Committees to review the Secretary's request.\n       Subsection (f) provides that the authority to promulgate \n     safety standards for commercial motor vehicles and equipment \n     subsequent to initial manufacture is vested in the Secretary \n     of Transportation and may be delegated.\n       Subsection (g) requires the Secretary to comply with the \n     requirements of a discretionary departmental regulation, at \n     48 C.F.R. 1252.209-70, concerning the disclosure of conflicts \n     of interest in research contracts, and to include the text of \n     such regulation in each such contract. This requirement is \n     Department wide. This subsection also calls for a study to \n     determine the effectiveness of this requirement. Eliminating \n     or mitigating conflicts of interest will increase the \n     likelihood that the research results will be more widely \n     accepted and therefore be a more acceptable basis for policy \n     decisions.\n       The managers note the bill does not establish any specific \n     offices of the FMCSA because the Secretary is best positioned \n     to determine the specific organizational structure of the \n     Administration. The Congress intends for the Secretary to \n     organize the new agency in a manner and structure that \n     adequately reflects the unique demands of passenger vehicle \n     safety, international affairs, and consumer affairs.\n\n\n               sec. 102. revenue aligned budget authority\n\n       Subsection 102(a) amends section 110 of title 23, United \n     States Code, concerning revenue aligned budget authority, to \n     include the motor carrier safety assistance program (MCSAP) \n     in the group of programs for which funding is annually \n     adjusted to correspond to Highway Trust Fund receipts.\n       Subsection (b) makes a number of technical and conforming \n     amendments, including the relocation of a second section 110, \n     concerning uniform transferability of Federal-aid highway \n     funds, to section 126 of title 23, United States Code.\n\n\n  sec. 103. additional funding for motor carrier safety grant program\n\n       Subsection 103(a) authorizes an additional $75 million from \n     the Highway Trust Fund for each of fiscal years 2001 through \n     2003 for the motor carrier safety assistance program.\n       Subsection (b) amends section 4003 of the Transportation \n     Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA 21) to increase the \n     amount of guaranteed funding provided in TEA 21 for the motor \n     carrier safety assistance program by the following amounts: \n     $65 million for each of fiscal years 2001 through 2003. This \n     subsection also amends section 1102 of TEA 21 to reduce the \n     obligation ceiling for federal-aid highways and highway \n     safety construction programs by $65 million for each of \n     fiscal years 2001 through 2003.\n       Subsection (c) establishes a maintenance of effort \n     requirement for States receiving MCSAP funds under this \n     section. Each State must maintain its spending for MCSAP-\n     eligible activities at a level equal to the average annual \n     level of expenditures for MCSAP activities for fiscal years \n     1997, 1998, and 1999.\n       Subsection (d) permits the Secretary to provide emergency \n     grants of up to $1 million to a State that is having \n     difficulties in meeting the requirements associated with the \n     commercial driver's license program and is in danger of \n     having its program suspended due to noncompliance.\n       Subsection (e) provides that if a State is not in \n     substantial compliance with each requirement of 49 U.S.C. \n     31311, concerning commercial driver's licensing, the \n     Secretary shall withhold any allocation of MCSAP funds \n     authorized under this section. This subsection also provides \n     that if, before June 30 of the fiscal year in which it was \n     found in noncompliance, a State is found by the Secretary to \n     be in substantial compliance with each requirement of section \n     31311 of such title, the Secretary shall allocate to the \n     State the funds withheld under this subsection.\n\n\n                sec. 104. motor carrier safety strategy\n\n       Subsection 104(a) requires the Secretary of Transportation, \n     as part of the Department's existing federally required \n     strategic planning efforts required under GPRA, to develop \n     and implement a long-term strategy, including an annual plan \n     and schedule for improving commercial motor vehicle, \n     operator, and carrier safety, and sets forth four goals to be \n     included in the strategy. The goals are: (1) reducing the \n     number and rates of crashes, injuries, and fatalities \n     involving commercial motor vehicles, (2) improving \n     enforcement and compliance programs, (3) identifying and \n     targeting enforcement at high-risk carriers, vehicles, and \n     drivers, and (4) improving research.\n       Subsection (b) requires that goals be established that are \n     designed to accomplish the safety strategy and that estimates \n     be developed concerning the funding and staffing resources \n     needed to accomplish the goals. By working toward the \n     measurable goals, the Administration will also be progressing \n     toward the strategic goals.\n       Subsection (c) requires the submission of the strategy and \n     annual plan with the President's annual budget submission, \n     starting with fiscal year 2001.\n       Subsection (d) establishes that for each of the fiscal \n     years 2001 through 2003, the following officials shall enter \n     into annual performance agreements between: (1) the Secretary \n     and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administrator; (2) the \n     Administrator and the Deputy Federal Motor Carrier Safety \n     Administrator; (3) the Administrator and the Chief Safety \n     Officer of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration; \n     and (4) the Administrator and the regulatory ombudsman \n     designated by the Administrator. Each of these officials \n     shall enter into a performance agreement that contains the \n     appropriate numeric or measurable goals of the \n     Administration's motor carrier safety strategy.\n       The provision requires that the Secretary assess the \n     progress of the officials toward achieving their respective \n     goals, and that the Secretary convey the assessments to the \n     officials, identifying possible future performance \n     improvements. An official's progress toward meeting the goals \n     of a performance agreement is to be given substantial weight \n     by the Secretary when bonuses or other achievement awards are \n     dispersed consistent with the Department's established \n     performance appraisal system.\n       Subsection (e) requires that the Secretary and the \n     Administrator of the FMCSA assess the progress of the \n     Administration toward achieving the goals set out in \n     subsection (a) no less frequently than semiannually. The \n     assessment should be conveyed to the employees of the FMCSA, \n     and deficiencies identified. The Secretary is required to \n     report to the Congress the results of the individual and \n     Administration progress assessments annually.\n       Subsection (f) requires the Administrator of the FMCSA to \n     designate a regulatory ombudsman to expedite rulemakings in \n     order to meet statutory and internal departmental deadlines.\n\n\n      sec. 105. commercial motor vehicle safety advisory committee\n\n       The provision permits the establishment of a commercial \n     motor vehicle safety advisory committee to provide advice and \n     recommendations on a range of commercial motor vehicle safety \n     issues. Members are appointed by the Secretary and include \n     representatives of industry, drivers, safety advocates, \n     manufacturers, safety enforcement officials, representatives \n     of late enforcement agencies from border States, and other \n     individuals affected by rulemakings. No one interest may \n     constitute a majority. If the Secretary establishes the \n     advisory committee, it should provide advice to the Secretary \n     on commercial motor vehicle safety regulations ad other \n     matters relating to activities and functions of the Federal \n     Motor Carrier Safety Administration. The committee will \n     remain in effect until September 30, 2003.\n\n\n                      sec. 106. savings provision\n\n       The savings provision is intended to provide for the \n     orderly transfer of personnel and property from the Office of \n     Motor Carrier Safety to the FMCSA. The provision is also \n     intended to ensure that legal documents and requirements that \n     had been in effect on the date of the transfer, and \n     proceedings in effect, will continue as if the Act had not \n     been enacted. The savings provision also provides that \n     lawsuits commenced against the Office of Motor Carrier Safety \n     or its employees, in their official function, continue as if \n     this Act had not been enacted. Further, the provision assures \n     the authority of officials of the FMCSA to continue the \n     functions and performances that had been previously performed \n     by officials of the Office of Motor Carrier Safety, and deems \n     any reference to the Office of Motor Carrier Safety, or its \n     predecessors, to apply to the FMCSA.\n\n\n                        sec. 107. effective date\n\n       Subsection 107(a) provides that this Act shall take effect \n     on the date of its enactment; except that the amendments made \n     by section 101 which establish the Federal Motor Carrier \n     Safety Administration, shall take effect on January 1, 2000.\n       Subsection (b) requires that the President's budget \n     submission for fiscal year 2001 and each fiscal year \n     thereafter reflect the establishment of the Federal Motor \n     Carrier Safety Administration in Accordance with this Act.\n\n          TITLE II--COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLE AND DRIVER SAFETY\n\n\n                      sec. 201. disqualifications\n\n       Subsection 201(a) amends section 31310 of title 49, United \n     States Code, to make a single violation of driving a \n     commercial motor vehicle with a revoked, suspended, or \n     canceled commercial driver's license, or driving while \n     disqualified, a one-year disqualifying offense, and to make a \n     conviction for causing a fatality through the negligent or \n     criminal operation of a commercial motor vehicle a one-year \n     disqualifying offense. This subsection also makes the \n     commission of more than one violation of driving a commercial \n     motor vehicle with a revoked, suspended, or canceled \n     commercial driver's license, or driving while disqualified, a \n     lifetime disqualifying offense,\n\n[[Page S15209]]\n\n     and to make a conviction of more than one offense of causing \n     a fatality through the negligent or criminal operation of a \n     commercial motor vehicle a lifetime disqualifying offense.\n       Subsection (b) amends section 31310 to give the Secretary \n     emergency disqualification authority to revoke the commercial \n     driving privileges of an individual upon a determination by \n     the Secretary that allowing the individual to continue to \n     operate a commercial motor vehicle would create an imminent \n     hazard. The Secretary can disqualify an individual under this \n     provision for no more than 30 days without providing notice \n     and an opportunity for a hearing.\n       Subsection (b) also amends section 31310 to require the \n     Secretary to issue regulations establishing criteria for \n     disqualifying from operating a commercial motor vehicle an \n     individual who holds a commercial driver's license and who \n     has been convicted of a serious offense involving a vehicle \n     other than a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) resulting in the \n     revocation, cancellation, or suspension of the individual's \n     license, or has been convicted of a drug or alcohol-related \n     offense involving a motor vehicle other than a commercial \n     motor vehicle. The behavior of a CDL holder in operating \n     vehicles other than CMVs is relevant to the CDL holder's \n     fitness to operate a commercial motor vehicle; therefore the \n     Secretary is directed to conduct a rulemaking to determine \n     the appropriate minimum time periods for which a CDL holder \n     should be disqualified, but in no case shall the time periods \n     for which CDL holders are disqualified for such offenses be \n     more stringent than the disqualification periods for offenses \n     involving a commercial motor vehicle.\n       Subsection (c) amends section 31301 of title 49, United \n     States Code, to add three offenses to the list of serious \n     traffic violations for which a CDL holder can be disqualified \n     under subsection 31310(e). The new offenses are: driving a \n     CMV without obtaining a CDL; driving a CMV without a CDL in \n     your possession; and driving without a required endorsement. \n     But it shall not be a serious traffic violation if a driver \n     cited for operating a CMV without a license in his or her \n     possession can produce proof, before the time to appear or \n     pay the fine for such citation, that he or she did have a \n     valid CDL at the time of the citation.\n       Subsection (d) makes clarifying amendments to section \n     31305(b)(1) of title 49, United States Code.\n\n\n             sec. 202. requirements for state participation\n\n       Subsection 202(a) amends section 31311(a)(6) of title 49, \n     United States Code, to require a State to request, before \n     renewing an individual's CDL, all information about the \n     driving record of such individual from any other State that \n     has issued a driver's license to the individual.\n       Subsection (b) amends section 31311(a)(8) of such title to \n     require a State, when notifying the Secretary, the operator \n     of CDLIS, and the issuing State of the disqualification, \n     revocation, suspension, or cancellation of a CDL holder's \n     commercial driver's license, to also notify such entities of \n     the underlying violation that resulted in such \n     disqualification, revocation, suspension, or cancellation.\n       Subsection (c) revises 31311(a)(9) of such title to require \n     a State to notify a CDL holder's home State of any violation \n     of traffic laws committed by the CDL holder, not just \n     violations involving a commercial motor vehicle. The \n     subsection also requires a State to notify any State that has \n     issued a driver's license (non-CDL) to an individual of any \n     violation committed while the individual is operating a CMV.\n       Subsection (d) amends section 31311(a)(10) of such title to \n     provide that a State may not issue any form of special \n     license or permit, including a provisional or temporary \n     license, to a CDL holder that would permit the CDL holder to \n     drive a CMV during a period in which the CDL holder's license \n     is revoked, suspended, or canceled, or the CDL holder is \n     disqualified from operating a CMV.\n       Subsection (e) revises 31311(a)(13) of title 49 to provide \n     that a State may establish penalties, with the Secretary's \n     approval, that are consistent with chapter 313, for \n     violations committed by an individual operating a commercial \n     motor vehicle.\n       Subsection (f) adds a new paragraph 31311(a)(18) to title \n     49 to require the State to maintain, as part of its driver \n     information system, a record of each violation of motor \n     vehicle traffic control laws committed by a CDL holder, and \n     to make such record available upon request to the individual \n     driver, the Secretary, employers, prospective employers, \n     State licensing and law enforcement agencies, and their \n     authorized agents.\n       Subsection (g) adds a new paragraph 31311(a)(19) to title \n     49 to prohibit both conviction masking and deferral programs \n     by requiring every State to keep a complete driving record of \n     all violations of traffic control laws (including CMV and \n     non-CMV violations) by any individual to whom it has issued a \n     CDL, and to make each such complete driving record available \n     to all authorized persons and governmental entities having \n     access to such record. This provision provides that a State \n     may not allow information regarding such violations to be \n     masked or withheld in any way from the record of a CDL \n     holder.\n       Subsection (g) also adds a new paragraph 31311(a)(20) to \n     title 49 to require each State to comply with the \n     requirements of the regulation issued under 31310(g) of such \n     title.\n\n\n                     SEC. 203. STATE NONCOMPLIANCE\n\n       Section 203 clarifies the Secretary's authority to shut \n     down a State's CDL program if a State is not substantially \n     complying with Federal CDL requirements. The section permits \n     a CDL holder or applicant to go to another State for \n     licensing or renewal if his/her home state program has been \n     shut down for noncompliance. This provision does not \n     invalidate or otherwise affect commercial driver's licenses \n     issued by a State before that State's CDL program was found \n     to be non-compliant and shut down.\n\n\n         SEC. 204. CHECKS BEFORE ISSUANCE OF DRIVER'S LICENSES\n\n       Section 204 amends section 30304 of title 49, United States \n     Code, to require a State, before issuing or renewing any \n     motor vehicle operator's license to an individual, to query \n     both the National Driver Register (NDR) and the commercial \n     driver's license information system (CDLIS). The intent of \n     this provision is to close a loophole in the CDL program \n     identified in the Department of Transportation's CDL \n     Effectiveness Study, whereby a driver currently holding a \n     valid CDL applies for a non-CDL without revealing or \n     surrendering the CDL. Without a check of both NDR and CDLIS, \n     the fact that the driver already holds a CDL at the time of \n     application for a non-CDL can go undetected, thus defeating \n     the fundamental ``one driver, one license'' principle behind \n     the CDL program that prevents drivers from spreading multiple \n     convictions over multiple licenses. The provision also amends \n     section 31311(a)(6) to require that before issuing or \n     renewing a commercial driver's license, the State shall \n     request from any other State that has issued a driver's \n     license to the individual all information about the driving \n     record of the individual.\n\n\n                   SEC. 205. REGISTRATION ENFORCEMENT\n\n       The provision adds new subsection 13902(e) to authorize the \n     Secretary to put a carrier out of service upon finding that \n     the carrier is operating without authority or beyond the \n     scope of its authority. Foreign motor carriers who operate \n     vehicles in the U.S. are not permitted to operate in \n     interstate commerce without evidence of registration in each \n     motor vehicle.\n\n\n               SEC. 206. DELINQUENT PAYMENT OF PENALTIES\n\n       Subsection (a) amends section 13905(c) of title 49, United \n     States Code, to provide that registration of a carrier, \n     broker, or freight forwarder may be suspended, amended, or \n     revoked for failure to pay civil penalty, or arrange and \n     abide by a payment plan, within 90 days of the time specified \n     by order of the Secretary for the payment of such penalty. \n     This provision does not apply to a person unable to pay \n     assessed penalties because a person is a debtor in a case \n     under chapter 11 of title 11, United States Code.\n       Subsection (b) amends section 521(b) of title 49, United \n     States Code, to provide that an owner or operator of a \n     commercial motor vehicle who fails to pay an assessed civil \n     penalty or fails to arrange and abide by an acceptable \n     payment plan for such civil penalty, within 90 days of the \n     time specified by order of the Secretary for the payment of \n     such penalty, may not operate in interstate commerce. This \n     provision does not apply to a person unable to pay assessed \n     penalties because the person is a debtor in a case under \n     chapter 11 of title 11, United States Code.\n\n\n        sec. 207. state cooperation in registration enforcement\n\n       The provision amends section 31102(b)(1) of title 49, \n     United States Code, to clarify that State motor carrier plans \n     shall ensure State cooperation in enforcement of registration \n     and financial responsibility requirements in sections 13902, \n     13906, 31138 and 31139 of such title.\n\n\n                       sec. 208. imminent hazard\n\n       The provision revises the definition of imminent hazard in \n     section 521(b)(5)(b) of title 49, United States Code, to \n     refer to a condition that ``substantially increases the \n     likelihood of'' serious injury or death.\n\n\n                  sec. 209. household goods amendments\n\n       Subsection 209(a) is a technical amendment to the \n     definition of household goods in section 13102(10)(A) of \n     title 49, United States Code, regarding certain property \n     moving from a store or factory.\n       Subsection (b) increases the limit for mandatory \n     arbitration under section 14708(b)(6) of such title from \n     $1,000 to $5,000.\n       Subsection (c) requires a General Accounting Office study \n     on the effectiveness of DOT enforcement of household goods \n     consumer protection rules and other potential methods of \n     enforcement, including State enforcement.\n\n\n            sec. 210. new motor carrier entrant requirements\n\n       This provision requires the Secretary to initiate a \n     rulemaking to establish minimum requirements for new motor \n     carriers to ensure applicant carriers are knowledgeable about \n     applicable Federal motor carrier safety standards. It \n     requires motor carrier owners and operators who are granted \n     new operating authority to be reviewed by a safety inspector \n     within eighteen months of commencing operations. The \n     provision requires the Secretary, in establishing the \n     elements of the safety review, to consider the impact on \n     small businesses and to consider establishing alternative \n     locations for conducting such reviews. It also allows the \n     new entrant review requirements to be phased in over time \n     to take into account the availability of\n\n[[Page S15210]]\n\n     certified motor carrier safety auditors and provides for \n     designating new motor carriers as ``new entrants'' until \n     the required review is completed.\n\n\n               sec. 211. certification of safety auditors\n\n       The provision requires the Secretary to complete a \n     rulemaking within one year of enactment to improve training \n     and provide for the certification of motor carrier safety \n     auditors, including private contractors, to conduct safety \n     inspection audits. The provision prohibits private \n     contractors from issuing safety ratings or operating \n     authority, and authorizes the Secretary to decertify any \n     motor carrier safety auditors.\n\n\n                   sec. 212 commercial van rulemaking\n\n       This provision requires the Secretary to complete in one \n     year an on-going rulemaking, Docket No. FHWA-5710, to \n     determine which small passenger vans should be covered by \n     Federal motor carrier safety regulations. At a minimum, the \n     rulemaking shall apply safety regulations to commercial vans \n     referred to as ``camionetas''--carriers providing \n     international transportation between points in Mexico and \n     points in the United States--and to commercial vans operating \n     in interstate commerce outside commercial zones that have \n     been determined to pose serious safety risks. In no case \n     should the rulemaking be concluded to exempt all small \n     commercial passenger carrying vans.\n       The managers note there have been a number of fatal \n     accidents involving small passenger vans known as camionetas \n     particularly in the Southern border States. In an effort to \n     address this safety problem, the Congress has acted on two \n     separate occasions directing the Secretary to apply Federal \n     motor carrier safety regulations to these passenger vans. \n     First, the definition of passenger vans was amended as part \n     of the ICC Termination Act of 1995 with the intent of \n     applying safety regulations to these carriers. However, the \n     Department took no action based on this statutory \n     requirement. Due to the lack of action by the Department to \n     regulate these vehicles, the Congress again directed the \n     Department to apply certain motor carrier safety regulations \n     to those vans in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \n     Century (TEA 21). The TEA 21 provision required that all \n     commercial vans carrying more than 8 passengers to be covered \n     by most Federal motor carrier safety rules by June 1999, \n     except to the extent DOT exempted operations as it determined \n     appropriate through rulemaking. The Department took no action \n     to even initiate the statutory rulemaking by the June \n     deadline. On September 3, 1999, the Department finally issued \n     a rule but it actually exempted the entire class of vehicles \n     from regulation until further notice. The managers find the \n     Department's blatant misinterpretaion of the statute \n     unacceptable. Therefore, a provision has been included in \n     this bill directing the Secretary to finally address this \n     identified safety problem.\n\n\n            sec. 213. 24-hour staffing of telephone hotline\n\n       The provision amends section 4017 of TEA 21 to require that \n     the Department's toll-free telephone hotline for reporting \n     safety violations be staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, \n     by individuals knowledgeable about Federal motor carrier \n     safety regulations and procedures. This section also \n     increases the funding authorization for the hotline to the \n     level of the Department of Transportation's estimate of the \n     cost of 24-hour coverage.\n\n\n                  sec. 214. cdl school bus endorsement\n\n       The provision requires the Secretary to conduct a \n     rulemaking to establish a special CDL endorsement for drivers \n     of school buses. The section requires, at a minimum, that the \n     endorsement (1) include a driving skills test in a school \n     bus, and (2) address proper safety procedures for loading and \n     unloading children, using emergency exits, and traversing \n     highway grade crossings.\n\n\n                     sec. 215. medical certificate\n\n       The provision requires the Secretary to initiate a \n     rulemaking to provide for the Federal medical qualification \n     certificate to be made part of the commercial driver's \n     license.\n\n\n     sec. 216. implementation of inspector general recommendations\n\n       The provision requires the Secretary to implement all the \n     DOT Inspector General's motor carrier safety improvement \n     recommendations contained in the IG's April 1999 report \n     assessing the effectiveness of DOT's motor carrier safety \n     program, except to the extent to which such recommendations \n     are specifically addressed in sections 206, 208, 217, and 222 \n     of this Act. These recommendations, found on pages 17, 18, \n     26, and 27 of the IG report, are as follows:\n       Recommendations to Improve the Effectiveness of Motor \n     Carrier Safety Enforcement:\n       1. Strengthen its enforcement policy by establishing \n     written policy and operating procedures to take strong action \n     against motor carriers with repeat violations of the same \n     acute or critical regulation. Strong enforcement actions \n     would include assessing fines at the statutory maximum \n     amount, the issuance of compliance orders, not negotiating \n     reduced assessments, and when necessary, placing motor \n     carriers out of service.\n       2. Remove all administrative restrictions on fines placed \n     in the Uniform Fine Assessment program and increase the \n     maximum fines to the level authorized by TEA-21.\n       3. Establish stiffer fines that cannot be considered a cost \n     of doing business and, if necessary, seek appropriate \n     legislation raising statutory penalty ceilings.\n       4. Implement a procedure that removes the operating \n     authority from motor carriers that fail to pay civil \n     penalties within 90 days after final orders are issued or \n     settlement agreements are completed.\n       5. Establish criteria for determining when a motor carrier \n     poses an imminent hazard.\n       6. Require follow-up visit and monitoring of those motor \n     carriers with a less-than-satisfactory safety rating, at \n     varying intervals, to ensure that safety improvements are \n     sustained, or if safety has deteriorated that appropriate \n     sanctions are invoked.\n       7. Establish a control mechanism that requires written \n     justification by the OMC State Director when compliance \n     reviews of high-risk carriers are not performed.\n       8. Establish a written policy and operating procedures that \n     identify criteria and time frames for closing enforcement \n     cases, including the current backlog.\n       Recommendations for Data Enhancement:\n       1. Require applicants requesting operating authority to \n     provide the number of commercial vehicles they operate and \n     the number of drivers they employ and require all motor \n     carriers to periodically update this information.\n       2. Revise the grant formula and provide incentives through \n     MSCAP grants for states to provide accurate, complete and \n     timely commercial vehicle crash reports, vehicle and driver \n     inspection reports and traffic violation data.\n       3. Withhold funds from MCSAP grants for those States that \n     continue to report inaccurate, incomplete and untimely \n     commercial vehicle crash data, vehicle and driver inspection \n     data and traffic violation data within a reasonable \n     notification period such as one year.\n       4.

Obtain and analyze crash causes and fault data as a \n     result of comprehensive crash evaluations to identify safety \n     improvements.\n       The provision requires that every 90 days, beginning 90 \n     days after enactment, the Secretary provide status reports on \n     the implementation of recommendations. The IG would also be \n     directed to provide the Committees with assessments of the \n     Secretary's progress. The IG report shall include an analysis \n     of the number of violations cited by safety inspectors, the \n     level of fines assessed and collected for such violations, \n     the number of cases in which there are findings of \n     extraordinary circumstances under section 222(c) of the Act, \n     and the circumstances in which such findings are made.\n\n\n  sec. 217. periodic refiling of motor carrier identification reports\n\n       The provision requires periodic updating, but not more \n     frequently than once every two years, of the Motor Carrier \n     Identification Report, Form MCS-150, filed by each motor \n     carrier conducting operations in interstate or foreign \n     commerce. An initial updating of the information is required \n     within 12 months from enactment of the Act.\n\n\n                  sec. 218. border staffing standards\n\n       Subsection 218(a) requires the Secretary to develop and \n     implement appropriate staffing standards for Federal and \n     State motor carrier safety inspectors in international border \n     areas.\n       Subsection (b) lists the factors to be considered in \n     developing the staffing standards. These include the volumes \n     of traffic, hours of operation of the border facilities, \n     types of commercial motor vehicles (including passenger \n     vehicles) and cargo in the border areas, and the \n     responsibilities of Federal and State inspectors.\n       Subsection (c) prohibits the United States and any State \n     from reducing its respective level of motor carrier safety \n     inspectors in an international border area below the level of \n     such inspectors in fiscal year 2000.\n       Subsection (d) provides that if, by October 1, 2001, and \n     each fiscal year thereafter, the Secretary has not ensured \n     that appropriate levels of staffing consistent with the \n     staffing standards are deployed in international border \n     areas, the Secretary should allocate five percent of motor \n     carrier safety assistance program funds for border commercial \n     motor vehicle and safety enforcement programs.\n\n\n    sec. 219. foreign motor carrier penalties and disqualifications\n\n       Subsection 219(a) provides for civil penalties and \n     disqualifications for foreign motor carriers that operate, \n     before implementation of the land transportation \n     provisions of NAFTA, without authority outside of a \n     commercial zone.\n       Subsection (b) provides that the civil penalty for an \n     intentional violation shall not be more than $10,000 and may \n     include disqualification from operating in U.S. for not more \n     than 6 months.\n       Subsection (c) provides that the civil penalty for a \n     pattern of intentional violations shall not be more than \n     $25,000; the carrier shall be disqualified from operating in \n     the U.S., and that such disqualification may be permanent.\n       Subsection (d) prohibits any foreign motor carrier from \n     leasing its motor vehicles to any other carrier to transport \n     property in the U.S. during any period in which a suspension, \n     condition, restriction, or limitation imposed under 49 U.S.C. \n     13902(c) applies to the foreign carrier.\n\n[[Page S15211]]\n\n       Subsection (e) provides that no provision may be enforced \n     if inconsistent with international agreements.\n       Subsection (f) provides that acts committed without \n     knowledge of the carrier or committed unintentionally are not \n     grounds for penalty or disqualification.\n\n\n                    sec. 220. traffic law initiative\n\n       The provision permits the Secretary to carry out a program \n     with one or more States to develop innovative methods of \n     improving motor carrier traffic law compliance, including the \n     use of photography and other imaging technologies.\n\n\n        sec, 221, state-to-state notification of violations data\n\n       The provision requires the Secretary to develop a uniform \n     system to support the electronic transmission of data State-\n     to-State on violations of all motor vehicle traffic control \n     laws by individuals possessing a commercial driver's license.\n\n\n               sec. 222. minimum and maximum assessments\n\n       Subsection 222(a) directs the Secretary to ensure that \n     motor carriers operate safely by imposing civil penalties at \n     a level calculated to ensure prompt and sustained compliance \n     with Federal motor carrier safety and commercial diver's \n     license (CDL) laws.\n       Subsection (b) recommends the Secretary establish and \n     assess minimum civil penalties for Federal motor carrier \n     safety and CDL violations and requires the Secretary to \n     assess the maximum civil penalty for repeat offenders or a \n     pattern of violations.\n       Subsection (c) recognizes that extraordinary circumstances \n     do arise that merit the assessment of civil penalties at a \n     level lower than any level established under subsection (b) \n     of this section. If the Secretary assesses such lower \n     penalties, the Secretary must document the justification for \n     them.\n       Subsection (d) requires the Secretary to conduct and submit \n     to Congress a study of the effectiveness of revised civil \n     penalties established in TEA 21 and this Act in ensuring \n     compliance with Federal motor carrier safety and commercial \n     driver's license laws.\n\n\n             sec. 223. motor carrier safety progress report\n\n       The provision directs the Secretary to submit a status \n     report on the Department's progress in achieving its goal of \n     reducing motor carrier fatalities by 50 percent by 2009.\n\n\n      sec. 224. study of commercial motor vehicle crash causation\n\n       Subsection 224(a) requires the Secretary to conduct a \n     comprehensive study to determine the causes of, and \n     contributing factors to, crashes involving commercial motor \n     vehicles, including vehicles defined in section 31132(1)(B) \n     of title 49, United States Code, and to identify the data \n     requirements needed to improve the Department's and the \n     States' ability to evaluate crashes and crash trends, \n     identify crash causes and contributing factors, and develop \n     safety measures to reduce such crashes.\n       Subsection (b) addresses the design of the study, requiring \n     that it yield information to help the Department and the \n     States identify activities likely to lead to significant \n     reductions in commercial motor vehicle-involved crashes \n     including crashes by commercial vans.\n       Subsection (c) lists the area of expertise of the people \n     with whom the Secretary is required to consult in conducting \n     the study.\n       Subsection (d) requires the Secretary to provide for public \n     comment on various aspects of the study.\n       Subsection (e) requires the Secretary to submit the results \n     of the study to Congress, review the study at least once \n     every five years, and update the study and report as \n     necessary.\n       Subsection (f) provides $5 million in contract authority to \n     carry out this section.\n\n\n                 sec. 225. data collection and analysis\n\n       This provision directs the Secretary to carry out a program \n     to improve the collection and analysis of data on commercial \n     motor vehicle crashes, including crash causation. NHTSA, in \n     cooperation with the new Federal Motor Carrier Safety \n     Administration, is required to administer the program. It \n     requires NHTSA to integrate driver citation and conviction \n     information and provide $5 million from the FMCSA's \n     administrative takedown to fund this program. This section \n     also provides $5 million in contract authority for \n     information systems under 49 U.S.C. 31106.\n\n\n                   sec. 226. drug test results study\n\n       Subsection 226(a) directs the Secretary to conduct a study \n     on the feasibility and merits of having medical review \n     officers or employers report positive drug tests of CDL \n     holders to the State that issued the CDL and requiring all \n     prospective employers, before hiring any driver, to query the \n     State that issued the driver's CDL on whether the State has \n     on record any verified positive controlled substances test on \n     such driver.\n       Subsection (b) lists factor to be considered in the study. \n     They are: safeguarding confidentiality of test results; \n     costs, benefits and safety impacts; and whether a process \n     should be established to allow drivers to correct errors and \n     expunge information from their records after a reasonable \n     time.\n       Subsection (c) requires the Secretary to issue a report to \n     Congress on the study within two years.\n\n\n                    sec. 227. approval of agreements\n\n       Section 227 amends section 13703 of title 49, United States \n     Code, by adding a new requirement to require the Surface \n     Transportation Board to review every five years any agreement \n     for any activities approved under section 13703. The \n     provision also provides for the continuation of any pending \n     cases before the Board, but prohibits certain nationwide \n     agreements.\n\n\n                        sec. 228. dot authority\n\n       This section clarifies Congressional intent with respect to \n     the criminal investigative authority of the Department of \n     Transportation Inspector General (IG).\n       When the Office of Motor Carrier Safety finds evidence of \n     egregious criminal violations of motor carrier safety \n     regulations through their regulatory compliance efforts, it \n     refers these cases to the IG's Office of Investigations. \n     Recently, a U.S. District Court concluded that an \n     investigation undertaken by the IG exceeded its jurisdiction, \n     see In the Matter of the Search of Northland Trucking Inc. \n     (D.C. Arizona), finding that the motor carrier involved was \n     not a grantee or contractor of the Department, nor was there \n     evidence of collusion with DOT employees. This narrow \n     construction of the IG's authority is not well grounded in \n     law, and the managers are concerned about the adverse impacts \n     the Order could have on IG operations. This provision, \n     therefore, clarifies Congressional intent with respect to the \n     authority of the IG, reaffirming the IG's ability and \n     authority to continue to conduct criminal investigations of \n     parties subject to DOT laws or regulations, whether or not \n     such parties receive Federal funds from the \n     Department.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 3419 the Motor \nCarrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999. This bill creates a separate \nmodal administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, \nto administer the commercial motor vehicle safety laws and make needed \nimprovements to our highway safety programs. To secure enactment of \nthis important legislation, Senator McCain and I worked with our \ncolleagues in the House to craft a compromise bill. I would like to \ncommend Chairman Shuster and Ranking Democrat Oberstar of the House \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee for their efforts on this \ncompromise proposal. The Administration supports this legislation and \nthe Secretary of Transportation has requested that the Senate complete \nconsideration of this legislation prior to the adjournment of the first \nsession of the 106th Congress.\n  As many of you may know, I introduced legislation in the 1980s to \nestablish a separate modal administration within the Department of \nTransportation for the motor carrier industry. Since safety oversight \nwas moved from the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1966, truck and \nbus safety oversight has been a part of the Federal Highway \nAdministration. H.R. 3419 continues the bifurcation of motor carrier \neconomic and safety regulation. The economic regulatory authority will \nstill be vested at the Surface Transportation Board, and the safety \nregulatory authority will be designated to the new Administration. \nUnder the current regulatory structure there is a separate regulatory \nagency for rail, transit, air, and maritime transportation, but no \nprimary agency for the largest mode of commercial transportation--the \ntrucking industry. Establishing a separate agency with the stated \nresponsibility for making the highways safer would be an important step \nforward in highlighting the importance of truck and bus safety as well \nas improving regulatory efficiency. I am pleased that members of the \nSenate and House have agreed to establish a new modal administration; \nwe have high expectations this change will lead to tougher standards, \nmore expeditious rule makings, and a greater degree of enforcement than \nhas been the norm in recent years.\n  The trucking industry generates over 80% of the revenues derived from \nthe domestic transportation of cargo. The industry has undergone \nfantastic growth in the past five years. The number of carriers \noperating in the trucking industry has close to doubled since 1994 \nalone. Overall, the volume of truck traffic on the highways in this \ncountry is astounding, and clearly has an impact on safety. As many of \nyou know, I was not a supporter of deregulating the trucking industry, \nand I question whether this policy has contributed to our present \nsafety concerns.\n\n  The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee has held \nseveral hearings on the subject of motor carrier safety in the last \nyear. These hearings have included testimony from a number of \norganizations, including the Department of Transportation's Inspector \nGeneral, the Chairman of the National Transportation Board and consumer \ngroups all expressing concern about the Office of Motor\n\n[[Page S15212]]\n\nCarriers and stating the need for reform. Chairman McCain and I have \nworked to incorporate many of the recommendations by these groups into \nthe legislation we are considering today.\n  I would like to briefly summarize some of the major provisions and \nimportant consequences of H.R. 3419. This legislation undoubtedly will \nincrease the overall number of safety inspections by requiring that all \nnew entrants to the truck and bus industry undergo a safety review. The \nbill also requires that carriers become familiar with motor carrier \nsafety regulations and undergo a safety review in order to obtain \noperating authority. Currently 25,000 to 40,000 new carriers enter into \ninterstate commerce annually. In order to obtain operating authority \nunder the present system, new operators must show proof of insurance \nand sign a form attesting that they are familiar with safety \nregulations. This new provision would require that new carriers be \ndesignated as ``new entrants'' until the completion of a successful \nsafety review. The intent of this provision is to make sure that new \noperators have basic safety management practices in place. During their \nfirst eighteen months of operation, they would need to show that they \nhave critical safety elements in place--for example, drug testing, \nmaintenance plans, and driving records such as logbooks. This safety \nreview is not intended to be a time consuming investigation of the \nproperty and drivers, nor is it intended to be a barrier to entry for \nnew operators; in fact we have stipulated that the Secretary should \ntake into consideration the needs of small businesses when conducting \nthe rulemaking on new entrant safety reviews. However, there is broad \nconsensus that an entry level safety review to ensure a minimum level \nof safety and compliance with federal safety regulations.\n  I am pleased that this bill increases the number of motor carrier \nsafety inspectors by requiring that DOT certify private contractors to \nperform safety audits. I would also like to commend Senator Breaux for \nhis leadership on the issue of third party inspectors. His introduction \nof S. 1524, the Motor Carrier Safety Specialist Certification Act, \nfollowing the Mother's Day bus accident in New Orleans was instrumental \nin demonstrating the need for additional qualified inspectors. These \nthird party auditors will be required to conduct the initial safety \nreviews of the new carriers and are likely to lead to an increasing \nnumber of inspections and audits overall. These auditors will be \ncertified by DOT to perform safety audits and inspections, however DOT \nwill retain the authority to grant operating authority and issue \nratings--we have no plans to delegate this vital enforcement authority \nto the private sector. The Secretary is directed to complete a \nrulemaking to establish how third party inspectors are to be certified. \nHowever, our expectation is that their role is to assist with the \ncollection of data, not supersede the existing authority of the DOT.\n\n  This legislation authorizes an additional $140 million a year for \nmotor carrier safety and data improvements over the levels established \nin TEA-21, the federal safety transportation bill that was passed in \nthe last year. Of that money $65 million is guaranteed under the \nbudgetary firewalls established in TEA-21. The bulk of this funding \nwill go directly to the states through the Motor Carrier Safety \nAssistance Program (MCSAP). This grant program to the states is the \nunderpinning for the enforcement of commercial motor vehicle safety \nlaws and I am pleased that we are more than doubling the funding \nauthorized for this important safety program. I look forward to working \nthe Department Transportation to ensure this new agency will have \nadequate personnel to achieve the important safety objectives set forth \nin this bill.\n  H.R. 3419 also requires many data improvements, including periodic \nrefilling of motor carrier information, which means that safety \nstatistics on trucks and buses are soon to be more up to date and that \nimprovement data will be available to the public. Currently, only \ntwenty percent of the carriers operating in interstate commerce have \nbeen inspected or audited in relation to safety ratings by the \nDepartment of Transportation--this number is insufficient. In order to \nincrease the number of safety rated carriers, accurate data is \nrequired. H.R. 3419 directs the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration (NHTSA), in cooperation with the new Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration, to carry out a program to improve the \ncollection and analysis of data on commercial motor vehicle crashes, \nincluding crash causation and requires NHTSA to integrate driver \ncitation and conviction information. In addition, the Secretary is \ndirected to conduct a crash causation study to determine the causes of, \nand contributing factors to, crashes involving commercial motor \nvehicles--all interested parties, including victims and safety groups, \nshould be consulted in designing the study. The legislation also \nrequires the Department of Transportation to disclose potential \nconflicts of interest, and requires DOT to study whether disclosure \nobligations are sufficient to avoid conflicts of interest. Proper \nsafety regulation is dependent on thorough and impartial research.\n  H.R. 3419 also toughens Commercial Drives License (CDL) requirements. \nIt will require that medical qualification certificates be part of all \nCDLs. It will prohibit the masking of convictions on CDL's, thereby \nending the practice of erasing convictions for increased fines and plea \nbargaining down convictions, and erasing convictions in exchange for \nattending bypass or educational programs. The legislation also will \nprovide access to driver records for safety enforcement and hiring \npurposes--driver records would be made available to employees, current \nemployers, future employers and law enforcement personnel on request. \nThis language will address concerns about inacurate driver records and \nensure that the practice of masking convictions or records is ended. \nThis provision lists parties which should have access to the driving \nrecords of commercial motor vehicle operators, however, the expection \nis that parties such as insurers which currently have access to this \ninformation will continue to do so.\n  I am pleased that this legislation now includes a separate school bus \nCDL endorsement. By requiring the Secretary to establish a rule making \nfor a CDL endorsement, which includes at a minimum, a driving skills \ntest in a school bus, as well as safety procedures for loading and \nunloading, using emergency exits and traversing highway rail grade \ncrossings, this bill places a greater emphasis on the safety of \ntransporting our children.\n  H.R. 3419 also includes recommendations from the DOT IG's report. \nThese recommendations call for the strengthening of enforcement policy \nby increasing fines, requiring greater monitoring of carriers and \nstandardizing data. The IG's report clearly indicates that we need to \ndo more in the way of compliance reviews and clearing up the back-log \nof regulatory initiatives that have not been completed. These \ninitiatives are overdue, and the public deserves an aggressive pro-\nactive safety policy.\n  Several of the IG's recommendations address the enforcement of civil \npenalties to ensure greater compliance with Federal motor carrier \nsafety and commercial drivers' license laws. Section 222 of H.R. 3419 \nincludes provisions establishing minimum, as well as maximum, penalties \nfor violations. Because situations arise when the Secretary may choose \nto exercise discretion in the assessment of maximum penalties, a \nprovision was included to allow assessment of penalties at a lower \nlevel than established by this provision in extraordinary \ncircumstances. The goal of this provision is to provide administrative \nflexibility while ensuring that the previous abuses in motor carrier \nsafety enforcement practices are not perpetuated by the new agency. In \nassessing penalties for violations, the Secretary's exercise of \ndiscretion under extraordinary circumstances to reduce or eliminate \nfines should only be used in rare and unusual conditions and this \nlegislation requires that the Secretary document the justification for \nsuch a situation. In addition, the bill will require the Secretary of \nTransportation and the IG to periodically report to the Congress on \ntheir progress implementing not only the application of civil penalties \nbut all of the IG's recommendations.\n  Additionally, the legislation addresses the issue concerning truck \ninspections at the US-Mexico border. Currently, far too few trucks are \nbeing inspected at the US-Mexico border and\n\n[[Page S15213]]\n\nfar too few inspected trucks comply with U.S. safety standards. I \nshould note that I do not support Mexican truckers operating in the \nUnited States, because this policy ultimately threatens public safety. \nFor example, according to the DOT Inspector General, at the border \ncrossing in El Paso, Texas, an average of 1,300 trucks enter daily, yet \nonly one inspector is on duty allowing for only 10 to 14 truck \ninspections daily. At other crossings, there are no inspectors. Of \nthose Mexican trucks inspected, about 44 percent were placed out of \nservice because of serious safety violations. This contrasts with a 25 \npercent out-of-service rate for US trucks and 17 percent for Canadian \ntrucks. This safety record is unacceptable.\n  The DOT's Inspector General confirmed last year that 68 Mexican \ntrucks were found operating beyond the border commercial zones, where \nthey are legally allowed to work and are probably involved in US \ncabotage reserved for US truckers. H.R. 3419 would reaffirm the \nprohibition on foreign motor carriers operating outside the boundaries \nof a commercial zone along the U.S.-Mexico border. Foreign trucks that \nare found to be operating outside the commercial zones without \nauthority will be subject to civil penalties.\n  In conclusion, I would like to ask my colleagues for their support in \nthe passage of this legislation. I would like to thank the following \nSenate staff for their work on this bill; Debbie Hersman, Carl Bentzel, \nKevin Kayes and Moses Boyd, Ann Begeman, Charlotte Casey, and Mark \nBuese. I would also like to thank House staffers, Clyde Woodle, Dave \nHeymsfeld, Ward McCarragher, Jess Sharp, Chris Bertram, Patty Doersch, \nJack Schenendorf and Roger Nober. These staffers all worked hard to \nhelp reach a bipartisan compromise.\n  H.R. 3419 is a good bill. I strongly support the passage of H.R. 3419 \nand look forward to its enactment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1996, introduced by \nSenators Jeffords, Kennedy, and Frist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1996) to amend the Public Health Service Act to \n     clarify provisions relating to the content of petitions for \n     compensation under the vaccine injury compensation program.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, in 1986, the Vaccine Injury Compensation \nAct was signed into law. The act created the National Vaccine Injury \nCompensation program which serves two important functions: it provides \ntimely and fair compensation to those few children who are injured from \nroutine immunization and it reduces the adverse effect of the tort \nsystem on vaccine supply and cost. Prior to enactment of this bill, the \nnumber of U.S.\n\n[[Page S15214]]\n\nmanufacturers of children's vaccines dropped from seven to two due to a \nflood of lawsuits filed in response to a network television broadcast \nclaiming that vaccine causes brain injuries. This program has been very \nsuccessful. However, it has come to our attention that the act requires \nan amendment which I, and the Senator from Massachusetts and the \nSenator from Tennessee offer today.\n  A vaccine becomes part of the compensation program if it is \nrecommended for routine use in children by the Centers for Disease \nControl. At such time, the Congress must also enact a Federal excise \ntax on the vaccine (currently at $.75 per antigen in the vaccine). The \nexcise tax revenues are housed in a Federal trust fund, the sole \npurpose of which is to pay claims and administer this program. The \nprogram and the fund is jointly administered by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Justice.\n  HHS publishes a table listing all covered vaccines and events that \nmay be associated with those vaccines as determined by valid scientific \nstudies. Events that are listed on the table, if they occur within the \nlisted time frame, are automatically compensated by the program unless \nthere is demonstration that some other circumstances created the \ninjury. For an event/injury not listed on the table, the claimant must \nprove causation.\n  If a vaccine is covered under the Vaccine Injury Compensation \nprogram, all claims against it must first be filed and processed \nthrough the program. Once a claim is adjudicated (and either an award \nis made or the claim denied), a claimant can reject the program's \ndetermination and opt to file a lawsuit.\n  Since the benefit of taking a vaccine accrues not only to the \nrecipient but to society as a whole, the Congress decided that it was \nalso society's responsibility to compensate those who are injured by \ncreating a no-fault program that removes the costliness and uncertainty \nof the tort system. At the time this law was enacted, parameters were \nestablished to permit claims for those serious adverse events that were \nknown to be associated with those vaccines that were then available. \nThe statutory proxy for a serious injury is that the residual effect \nfrom the injury must be of six months' duration or longer.\n  Recently, however, a new situation has developed that was not \nforeseeable at the time of enactment of this law. In October 1999, the \nCDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), after a \nreview of scientific data from several sources, concluded that \nintussusception occurs with significantly increased frequency in the \nfirst 1-2 weeks after vaccination for rotavirus, particularly after the \nfirst dose. Thus, the ACIP withdrew its recommendation for vaccination \nof infants for rotavirus in the United States.\n\n  While most cases of intussusception require only minimal treatment, a \nfew cases require hospitalization and surgery. Under the current law, \nthese cases would not be compensable by the United States Claims Court \nunder the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, since the statute grants \njurisdiction to resolve vaccine cases only in instances in which \nclaimants have suffered the residual effects or complications of a \nvaccine-related injury for at least six months, or died from the \nadministration of a vaccine.\n  For this reason, we are offering this bill to amend the law and grant \njurisdiction to the Claims Court to resolve compensation cases under \nthe Program in cases in which both hospitalization and surgical \nintervention were required to correct the ``illness, disability, injury \nor condition'' caused by the vaccine. Mr. President, this language has \nbeen shared with, and is supported by officials at HHS and the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics.\n  To our knowledge, the amendment would only apply to circumstances \nunder which a vaccine recipient suffered from intussusception as a \nresult of administration of the rotavirus vaccine. The amendment is not \nintended to expand jurisdiction to other vaccines listed in the \nProgram's Vaccine Injury Table.\n  We note that this amendment does not address the issue of whether the \ncondition is in fact caused by the vaccine; this is a matter for \nresolution under other provisions of the no-fault compensation law. \nAmong these are the requirement that the condition either be listed in \nthe Vaccine Injury Table or be established to have been caused in fact \nby the vaccine. Determinations of this type should only be made after \nthorough consideration of the scientific evidence by experts in the \nfield; the law commits this issue to the Secretary for consideration in \nthe context of changes to the Vaccine Injury Table through rulemaking, \nand to the Claims Court for determinations of causation in fact.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Vermont and the \nSenator from Tennessee in proposing legislation to amend the Vaccine \nInjury Compensation Program.\n  This program is an important part of the nation's public health \nstrategy. In order to encourage the development and use of effective \nvaccines, the program guarantees compensation to the few children who \nare injured by routine immunization.\n  Recent evidence suggests that some children may suffer vaccine-\nrelated injuries that are not covered under the current criteria used \nto determine eligibility for compensation. To continue the program's \nsuccess, Congress must assure that the system is responsive to new \ndevelopments in medical science. We need to be certain that any child \nwho suffers a severe injury as a result of routine vaccination is \neligible for compensation under the program.\n  My colleague from Vermont has concisely summarized the current status \nof the program and the importance of amending the statute. Families and \nphysicians need to know that public health procedures are capable of a \nrapid and appropriate response to scientific developments. It is a \nprivilege to join my colleagues in offering this legislation to improve \nthe Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clinical Research \n     Enhancement Act of 1999''.\n\n      SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Clinical research is critical to the advancement of \n     scientific knowledge and to the development of cures and \n     improved treatment for disease.\n\n[[Page S15215]]\n\n       (2) Tremendous advances in biology are opening doors to new \n     insights into human physiology, pathophysiology and disease, \n     creating extraordinary opportunities for clinical research.\n       (3) Clinical research includes translational research which \n     is an integral part of the research process leading to \n     general human applications. It is the bridge between the \n     laboratory and new methods of diagnosis, treatment, and \n     prevention and is thus essential to progress against cancer \n     and other diseases.\n       (4) The United States will spend more than \n     $1,200,000,000,000 on health care in 1999, but the Federal \n     budget for health research at the National Institutes of \n     Health was $15,600,000,000 only 1 percent of that total.\n       (5) Studies at the Institute of Medicine, the National \n     Research Council, and the National Academy of Sciences have \n     all addressed the current problems in clinical research.\n       (6) The Director of the National Institutes of Health has \n     recognized the current problems in clinical research and \n     appointed a special panel, which recommended expanded support \n     for existing National Institutes of Health clinical research \n     programs and the creation of new initiatives to recruit and \n     retain clinical investigators.\n       (7) The current level of training and support for health \n     professionals in clinical research is fragmented, \n     undervalued, and underfunded.\n       (8) Young investigators are not only apprentices for future \n     positions but a crucial source of energy, enthusiasm, and \n     ideas in the day-to-day research that constitutes the \n     scientific enterprise. Serious questions about the future of \n     life-science research are raised by the following:\n       (A) The number of young investigators applying for grants \n     dropped by 54 percent between 1985 and 1993.\n       (B) The number of physicians applying for first-time \n     National Institutes of Health research project grants fell \n     from 1226 in 1994 to 963 in 1998, a 21 percent reduction.\n       (C) Newly independent life-scientists are expected to raise \n     funds to support their new research programs and a \n     substantial proportion of their own salaries.\n       (9) The following have been cited as reasons for the \n     decline in the number of active clinical researchers, and \n     those choosing this career path:\n       (A) A medical school graduate incurs an average debt of \n     $85,619, as reported in the Medical School Graduation \n     Questionnaire by the Association of American Medical Colleges \n     (AAMC).\n       (B) The prolonged period of clinical training required \n     increases the accumulated debt burden.\n       (C) The decreasing number of mentors and role models.\n       (D) The perceived instability of funding from the National \n     Institutes of Health and other Federal agencies.\n       (E) The almost complete absence of clinical research \n     training in the curriculum of training grant awardees.\n       (F) Academic Medical Centers are experiencing difficulties \n     in maintaining a proper environment for research in a highly \n     competitive health care marketplace, which are compounded by \n     the decreased willingness of third party payers to cover \n     health care costs for patients engaged in research studies \n     and research procedures.\n       (10) In 1960, general clinical research centers were \n     established under the Office of the Director of the National \n     Institutes of Health with an initial appropriation of \n     $3,000,000.\n       (11) Appropriations for general clinical research centers \n     in fiscal year 1999 equaled $200,500,000.\n       Since the late 1960s, spending for general clinical \n     research centers has declined from approximately 3 percent to \n     1 percent of the National Institutes of Health budget.\n       (12) In fiscal year 1999, there were 77 general clinical \n     research centers in operation, supplying patients in the \n     areas in which such centers operate with access to the most \n     modern clinical research and clinical research facilities and \n     technologies.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide \n     additional support for and to expand clinical research \n     programs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, Senator Gorton has a substitute amendment \nat the best, and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] for Mr. Gorton, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2798.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. GORTON. I am pleased that the Senate will pass the Cardiac Arrest \nSurvival Act before the end of this session. Each year 250,000 \nAmericans suffer from sudden cardiac arrest. It can claim the life of a \npromising young athlete, a friend of family member regardless of age or \nhealth. Sudden Cardiac Arrest occurs when the heart's electrical \nimpulses become chaotic causing the heart to stop pumping blood. \nTragically, 95% of Americans who suffer from sudden cardiac arrest will \ndie.\n  This bill helps to fight this killer by asking the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to develop public access to defibrillation \nprograms for federal buildings. Public access to defibrillation \nprograms include improving access to automated external defibrillators \n(AEDs), training those likely to use the devices, ensuring proper \nmedical oversight of the program and maintaining the devices according \nto manufacturer's guidelines. An AED is a small, laptop-sized device \nthat is easy to use and can alalyze the heart rhythms of cardiac arrest \nvictims to determine if a shock is warranted and, if necessary, deliver \na life-saving shock to the heart. The devices are so important because \nfor every minute that passes before a cardiac arrest victim's heart is \nreturned to normal rhythm, his or her chance of survival falls by as \nmuch as 10 percent.\n  This bill also provides important gap-filling Good Samaritan immunity \nfor the few states that have yet to pass AED access laws. It will help \nensure that people who respond to an emergency and use an AED to help \ncardiac arrest victims needn't fear frivolous lawsuits. It also \nprovides reassurance to nonmedical facilities such as adult day care \ncenters, the first aid station in a shopping mall, casinos, fitness \nclubs, sports stadiums, a health clinic in a business, an airport, \nambulance, firetruck or other locations where AEDs may be beneficial \nthat they can make these lifesaving devices available.\n  I want to thank Senators Jeffords and Frist for their help in moving \nthis bill forward. I am also grateful to the American Heart \nAssociation, the American Red Cross and the thirty-three other health \norganizations that have worked so hard to ensure passage of this bill. \nThis is a good bill, it will help save lives and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the House to ensure that it is signed \ninto law.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Gorton and I have worked closely\n\n[[Page S15217]]\n\nwith Chairman Jeffords and Chairman Frist to prepare this substitute \namendment to S. 1488, the Cardiac Arrest Survival Act. I particularly \ncommend my colleague from Washington, Senator Gorton, for his \nleadership on this issue. Promoting the use of defibrillators is good \npublic policy. The substitute amendment is supported by the American \nHeart Association, the American Red Cross and the American Red Cross. I \nam hopeful that the recommendations to be developed by the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services will encourage decision makers at the \nfederal, state and local levels to make the most effective use of \nautomated external defibrillators. I believe that this legislation will \nsave lives. The ``Good Samaritan'' provisions contained in the \nlegislation are targeted, and there is no need for additional \ncategories. I urge the Senate to approve it now, and the House to pass \nit in the next session. It is a solid proposal, and it deserves prompt \nenactment.\n  Mr. GORDON. I couldn't agree more with my colleague from \nMassachusetts. We have worked together to find common ground on an \nissue that we all believe is important. The product of these \ndiscussions is a bill that I would like to see enacted into law as soon \nas possible. I hope we can work together with our colleagues in the \nHouse to pass this measure and send it to the President next year.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, exactly one year ago today, Mike Tighe \nof Barnard, Vermont boarded a commercial aircraft for a flight to Los \nAngeles, California. As the plane cruised at about 35,000 feet, Mr. \nTighe suffered a deadly heart attack. To make a long story short, Mike \nis alive and well today, because the aircraft in which he was a \npassenger had, only two days before that fateful flight, installed an \nAutomated External Defibrillator for use in such an emergency. Today, \nMr. President, I am proud to say that the Senate has passed a bill, the \nCardiac Arrest Survival Act of 1999, that will make it much easier for \nfederal, state and local government to place these lifesaving devices \nin public buildings and emergency response units.\n  Automated External Defibrillators, known as AEDs, are small, easy-to-\nuse, laptop size devices that can analyze heart rhythms to determine if \na shock is necessary and, if warranted, prompt the user to deliver a \nlife-saving shock to the heart. Research shows us that for every minute \nthat passes before a cardiac arrest victim is defibrillated, the chance \nof survival falls by as much as ten percent. Research also shows that \n250 lives can be saved each day from cardiac arrests by using the AED. \nThis legislation will help reduce unnecessary and life-threatening \nminutes of delay, ensuring that public access to defibrillation \nprograms are implemented in the hundreds of thousands of federal \nbuildings.\n  The Cardiac Arrest Survival Act of 1999, which was introduced by \nSenator Gorton and referred to the committee that I chair, the \nCommittee on Health Education, Labor and Pensions, has broad bipartisan \nsupport, as well as the strong support of the American Heart \nAssociation, American Red Cross, and representatives of thousands of \nfirst response units across America. I would like to congratulate and \nthank all my colleagues for passing this legislation today, and \nespecially Senator Gorton, who introduced this bill in August, and has \nworked tirelessly to get it completed before adjournment.\n  But most of all, Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Mike \nTighe as he celebrates the one year anniversary of the deadly heart \nattack that he survived because the airplane that he was traveling in \nwas equipped with an Automated External Defibrillator. I hope the bill \nwe passed today moves through the legislative process and is signed \ninto law just as soon as possible next year, so that the estimated 1000 \nAmericans who suffer from sudden cardiac arrests each day will have the \nsame chance that Mr. Tighe did.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I applaud the Senate passage of S. 1488, \nthe Cardiac Arrest Survival Act, a bill which I believe will save lives \nby examining the appropriate placement of automated external \ndefibrillators (AEDs) in federal buildings and extending protection for \nthose who supply and administer these life saving devices.\n  Each year, over 250,000 Americans suffer sudden cardiac arrest with \nonly 5% surviving. Sudden cardiac arrest is a common cause of death in \nwhich the heart suddenly lapses into a chaotic rhythm known as \nventricular fibrillation and stops pumping blood. As a result, the \nindividual collapses, stops breathing and has no pulse. Often the heart \ncan be shocked back into a normal rhythm with the aid of a \ndefibrillator. This is exactly what happened when I resuscitated a \npatient with cardioplumonary resuscitation (CPR) and electrical \ncardioversion in the Dirksen Senate Office Building in 1995. I am \npleased to report that he is doing well now four years later.\n  When a person goes into cardiac arrest time is of the essence and \nevery second counts. For every minute that passes without \ndefibrillation, a person's chance of survival decreases by about 10 \npercent. Thus, having an automated external defibrillator (AED) in an \naccessible place is important. AEDs are portable, lightweight, easy to \nuse and are becoming an essential part of administering first aid to a \nvictim of sudden cardiac arrest.\n  We have seen that in places where AEDs are readily available, \nsurvival rates in some areas increase to as much as 20-30% and in some \nsettings they have even reached 70%. During the 105th Congress, I \nauthored the ``Aviation Medical Assistance Act,'' which was ultimately \nsigned into law. This bill directed the Federal Aviation Administration \nto decide whether to require AEDs on aircraft and in airports. As a \nresult of this new law, many airplanes now carry AEDs on board, and \nsome airports have placed AEDs in their terminals. At Chicago O'Hare, \njust 4 months after AEDs were placed in that airport, 4 victims were \nresuscitated using the publicly available AEDs.\n  Currently, there is a movement in the States to expand the \navailability of AEDs by expressly extending Good Samaritan liability \nprotection to users and providers of the devices. However, in federal \njurisdictions such as court houses, federal agencies, and parks, there \nhas been no coordinated effort to determine where AEDs ought to be \nplaced and how an effective training program should occur. In addition, \nagencies that seek to obtain AEDs for high-risk populations report \ndeferring purchases due to concerns about litigation and liability.\n  To help address this problem, the Cardiac Arrest Survival Act \nrequests that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices make recommendations for public access to defibrillation \nprograms in federal buildings and extends Good Samaritan protection for \nautomated external defibrillator users and providers in States that \nhave not yet passed state legislation on this issue.\n  The bill does not require purchase of the devices, it simply asks for \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop recommendations \nas to how best to develop these programs. The Good Samaritan portion of \nthe bill is crafted so as not to pre-empt existing State laws, as well \nas to encourage States to continue to act on this issue in the future. \nIn a matter of two or three years, 43 states have passed some form of \nAED Good Samaritan protection, which this bill will not pre-empt.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has taken action on this \nimportant piece of legislation and I look forward to its ultimate \nenactment into law. I want to thank my colleague, Senator Gorton, for \ntaking the lead on this life saving proposal. I also would like to \nthank the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross for \ntheir help in drafting this legislation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nsubstitute amendment be agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2798) was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements related to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1488), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I note I am very pleased to be a \ncosponsor of the legislation that was just passed by the Senate.\n\n[[Page S15218]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15216-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15216-S15218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AMENDING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Twenty-First Century \n     Research Laboratories Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the National Institutes of Health is the principal \n     source of Federal funding for medical research at \n     universities and other research institutions in the United \n     States;\n       (2) the National Institutes of Health has received a \n     substantial increase in research funding from Congress for \n     the purpose of expanding the national investment of the \n     United States in behavioral and biomedical research;\n       (3) the infrastructure of our research institutions is \n     central to the continued leadership of the United States in \n     medical research;\n       (4) as Congress increases the investment in cutting-edge \n     basic and clinical research, it is critical that Congress \n     also examine the current quality of the laboratories and \n     buildings where research is being conducted, as well as the \n     quality of laboratory equipment used in research;\n       (5) many of the research facilities and laboratories in the \n     United States are outdated and inadequate;\n       (6) the National Science Foundation found, in a 1998 report \n     on the status of biomedical research facilities, that over 60 \n     percent of research-performing institutions indicated that \n     they had an inadequate amount of medical research space;\n       (7) the National Science Foundation reports that academic \n     institutions have deferred nearly $11,000,000,000 in \n     renovation and construction projects because of a lack of \n     funds; and\n       (8) future increases in Federal funding for the National \n     Institutes of Health must include increased support for the \n     renovation and construction of extramural research facilities \n     in the United States and the purchase of state-of-the-art \n     laboratory instrumentation.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 1887, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1887) to amend title 18, United States Code, \n     to punish the depiction of animal cruelty.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today, I rise in strong \nsupport of H.R. 1887, legislation that overwhelmingly passed the House \nto ban interstate commerce in videos depicting acts of cruelty against \nanimals. Specifically, this legislation would ban the interstate \nshipment of videos that record women, often wearing stiletto heeled \nshoes, slowly crushing live animals to death. Animal victims include \nhamsters, kittens, puppies, and even monkeys. Viewers purchase these \nvideos for $15 to $300 and apparently derive some sexual gratification \nfrom watching these horrifying act of animal cruelty.\n  The Humane Society of the United States, which brought this issue to \nthe attention of law enforcement agencies, has discovered that there \nare more than 2,000 video titles that include crushing. One such \nbusiness in California has labeled itself Steponit.\n  I really have never heard of more bizarre, more perverse, and more \nsickening acts that this. This goes way beyond the bounds of even of \nour most wild imaginations.\n  The people in this industry should face serious penalties for their \nsick acts of cruelty. Fines and jail time are appropriate societal \nresponses.\n  State anti-cruelty statues are not adequate in addressing this \nproblem. It has been difficult for enforcement agents to determine when \nthe practice occurred, where it occurred, and who has been involved, \nsince feet and the crushing of the animals are the only images on the \nvideo.\n  Here is a case where a restriction on interstate commerce in these \nproducts--in the age of the Internet, which facilitates this trade--is \nabsolutely necessary. We have to stop the purveyors of this filth, \nindecency and cruelty.\n  This is not the harmless act of few people out of the mainstream. \nThis is an extreme antisocial act, where innocent animals are harmed \nfor the profits of producers and the mere sexual gratification of \nviewers.\n  In additon to the harm that the animals endure, there is an \nadditional reason to crack down on this industry. There is a well-\nestablished link between acts of violence against animals and later \nacts of violence perpetrated against people. People sometimes rehearse \ntheir violence on animals before turning their violent intentions \nagainst people. The FBI and other law\n\n[[Page S15221]]\n\nenforcement agencies have long recognized this linkage.\n  What sort of message do we send to children to allow these videos to \nbe commercially traded and then viewed? It has to be desensitizing for \nchildren and adults to see these destructive images. There surely is a \nmajor impact on society when people lose their empathy and express \ntheir violent impulses on a larger social stage.\n  Mr. President, H.R. 1887 passed the House by an overwhelming vote of \n372 to 42. I understand that it is currently being held at the desk. It \nis my hope that Senate will stop this industry in its tracks by passing \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1887, a bill by \nRepresentative Gallegly which would prohibit, and set penalties for, \nknowingly creating, selling, or possessing a depiction of animal \ncruelty with the intention of placing that depiction in interstate or \nforeign commerce for commercial gain.\n  I would first like to thank the advocacy groups and individuals who \ntestified at the House Subcommittee on Crime hearing and helped \npublicize the need for legislation to combat this form of animal \ncruelty. I would also like to thank Senator Hatch, chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, for his help in the passage of H.R. 1887.\n  I recently was informed by Representative Gallegly of a growing \nproblem in California involving ``crush'' videos. Much of the material \ngraphically features women stepping on and killing a variety of small \nanimals. The animals are bound to the floor or other materials and are \nslowly tortured and crushed. When this deplorable practice came to \nlight, Representative Gallegly introduced H.R. 1887, which targets the \nmarket for these disturbing videos.\n  While the acts of animal cruelty featured in these videos may violate \nmany state animal cruelty laws, they can be difficult to prosecute. For \nexample, prosecutors often cannot prove the date when the acts were \nperformed or the identity of the individual committing the act of \ncruelty because the person's face is concealed or not filmed.\n  The purpose of H.R. 1887 is to prohibit individuals from profiting \nfrom videos depicting animal cruelty if the act depicted is illegal \nunder federal or state law. This bill provides federal law-enforcement \nofficials with a tool to prosecute the individuals making profits from \nthese videos, which can be sold via the Internet and through catalogs \nfor $30 to $100 a piece. Eliminating the videos' commercial incentive \nwill hopefully stem the creation of ``crush'' videos.\n  This bill is important because many studies have shown that abusing \nanimals is often a prosecutor for committing violence against other \npeople. H.R. 1887 may not solve that problem, but it will at least \neliminate the market for a truly reprehensible product.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1887) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/19/senate-section/article/S15221-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL AMERICAN INDIAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 134) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that Joseph Jefferson ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson should \n     be appropriately honored for his outstanding baseball \n     accomplishments.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has \ngiven its approval to Senate Resolution 134. With passage of this \nresolution, which I introduced earlier this year with Senators Thurmond \nand Hollings, the Senate has gone on record to right a wrong \nperpetrated against one of the greatest American baseball players of \nall time--Joseph Jefferson ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson. And I want to \ncommend Senators Thurmond and Hollings for their good work on this.\n  ``Shoeless Joe'' has been an inspiration to baseball players and fans \nfor decades. Even the legendary Babe Ruth was said to have copied \nJackson's swing. I was touched by Jacksons' story through the movie \n``Field of Dreams,'' which recounted his story. The movie was filmed in \nDyersville, Iowa. Thousands of Iowans, young and old alike, have come \nto embrace\n\n[[Page S15222]]\n\n``Shoeless Joe.'' In fact, there is an annual Shoeless Joe Jackson \ncelebration and celebrity baseball game in Dyersville. This year it was \nattended by a cast of baseball greats, including Bob Feller.\n  Jackson's career statistics and accomplishments throughout his \nthirteen years in professional baseball clearly earn him a place as one \nof baseball's all-time greats.\n  His career batting average of .356 is the third highest of all time. \nIn addition, Jackson was one of only seven Major League Baseball \nplayers to top the coveted mark of a .400 batting average for a season. \nDespite all this, in 1920 ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson was banned from the \ngame of baseball, the gamed he loved. He was banned from Major League \nbaseball for allegedly taking part in a conspiracy to throw the 1919 \nWorld Series, in what has become known as the ``Black Sox'' scandal.\n  While ``Shoeless Joe'' did admit that he received $5,000 from his \nroommate, Lefty Williams, to participate in the fix, evidence suggests \nthat Jackson did everything in his power to stop the fix from going \nthrough. He twice tried to give the money back. He offered to sit out \nthe World Series in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety. And, \nhe tried to inform White Sox owner Charles Comiskey of the fix. All of \nthese efforts fell on deaf ears.\n  Perhaps the most convincing evidence of Jackson's withdrawal from the \nconspiracy was his performance on the field during the series. During \nthe 1919 World Series--which he was accused of conspiring to fix--\n``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson's batting average was .375, the highest of any \nplayer from either team. He had twelve hits, a World Series record. He \nled his team in runs scored and runs batted in. And, he hit the only \nhome run of the series. On defense, Jackson committed no errors and had \nno questionable plays in thirty chances.\n  When criminal charges were brought against Jackson in trial, the jury \nfound him ``not guilty.'' White Sox owner Charles Comiskey and several \nsportswriters testified that they say no indication that Jackson did \nanything to indicate he was trying to throw the series. But, when the \nissue came before the newly-formed Major League Baseball Commissioner's \noffice, Commissioner Judge Kenesaw ``Mountain'' Landis found Jackson \nguilty of taking part in the fix, and he was banned for life from \nplaying baseball. The Commissioner's office never conducted an \ninvestigation and never held a hearing, thus denying ``Shoeless Joe'' \nJackson due process.\n  Major League Baseball now has the opportunity to correct a great \ninjustice. I have written to Commissioner Bud Selig urging him to take \na new look at this case. I was very pleased when the Commissioner \nresponded to my inquiry by saying he is giving the case a fair and \nobjective review.\n  Restoring ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson's eligibility for the Hall of Fame \nwould benefit Major League Baseball, baseball fans, and all Americans \nwho appreciate a sense of fair play.\n  The resolution we passed today states that Major League Baseball \nshould honor Jackson's accomplishments appropriately. I believe Jackson \nshould be inducted into the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame.\n  If that is to happen, Jackson must first be cleared for consideration \nby the Hall of Fame Veterans Committee, which will stand as the jury \nwhich decides whether Jackson's accomplishments during his playing \ncareer are worthy of recognition in the Hall of Fame.\n  Mr. President, we are involved in many important issues. Clearly, \nthis matter will not and should not take up the same amount of time \nthis body devotes to critical issues like health care, education, or \nnational defense. But, restoring the good name and reputation of a \nsingle American is important. This resolution has given us the \nopportunity to right an old wrong. It has given us the opportunity to \nhonor one of the all-time great players of America's pastime, \n``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting this resolution.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2800\n\n         (Purpose: To amend certain findings of the Resolution)\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Senator Thurmond has a substitute at the \ndesk, and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for Mr. Thurmond, \n     proposes an amendment number 2800.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT ``SHOELESS JOE'' JACKSON \n                   SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED FOR HIS BASEBALL \n                   ACCOMPLISHMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) In 1919, the infamous ``Black Sox'' scandal erupted \n     when an employee of a New York gambler allegedly bribed 8 \n     players of the Chicago White Sox, including Joseph Jefferson \n     ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson, to throw the 1919 World Series \n     against the Cincinnati Reds.\n       (2) In 1921, a criminal court acquitted ``Shoeless Joe'' \n     Jackaon of charges brought against him as a consequence of \n     his participation in the 1919 World Series.\n       (3) Despite the acquitta, Commissioner Landis banned \n     ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson from playing Major League Baseball \n     for life without conducting a hearing, receiving evidence of \n     Jackson's alleged activities, or giving Mr. Jackson a forum \n     to rebut the allegations, issuing a summary punishment that \n     fell far short of due process standards.\n       (4) During the 1919 World Series, Jackson's play was \n     outstanding--his batting average was .375, the highest of any \n     player from either team; he had 12 hits, setting a World \n     Series record; he did not commit any errors; and he hit the \n     only home run of the Series.\n       (5) Not only was Jackson's performance during the 1919 \n     World Series unmatched, but his accomplishments throughout \n     his 13-year career in professional baseball were outstanding \n     as well--he was 1 of only 7 Major League Baseball players to \n     ever top the coveted mark of a .400 batting average for a \n     season, and he earned a lifetime batting average of .356 the \n     third highest of all time.\n       (6) ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson's career record clearly makes \n     him one of our Nation's top baseball players of all time.\n       (7) Because of his lifetime ban from Major League Baseball, \n     ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson has been excluded from consideration \n     for admission to the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame.\n       (8) ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson passed away in 1951, and 80 \n     years have elapsed since the 1919 World Series scandal \n     erupted.\n       (9) Recently, Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig \n     took an important step by agreeing to investigate whether \n     ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson was involved in a conspiracy to \n     alter the outcome of the 1919 World Series and whether he \n     should be eligible for inclusion in the Major League Baseball \n     Hall of Fame.\n       (10) Courts have exonerated ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson, the \n     1919 World Series box score stands as a witness of his record \n     setting play, and 80 years have passed since the scandal \n     erupted; therefore, Major League Baseball should \n     appropriately honor the outstanding baseball accomplishments \n     of Joseph Jefferson ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Joseph Jefferson ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson should be \n     appropriately honored for his outstanding baseball \n     accomplishments.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

The \n     Commission shall not select a living individual.\n       (2) The Commission shall consider first those Senators who \n     are not already commemorated in the Capitol or Senate Office \n     Buildings, although such commemoration shall serve as an \n     absolute bar to consideration or selection only for those who \n     have served as President of the Senate, as the latter are \n     visibly and appropriately commemorated through the Vice \n     Presidential bust collection.\n       (3) The Commission also shall give primary consideration to \n     the service of the Senator while in the Senate, as opposed to \n     other service to the United States.\n       (c) The Commission is authorized to seek advice and \n     recommendations from historians and other sources in carrying \n     out this resolution.\n       Sec. 2.

As the United States prepares for \nthe World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, it is important that \nCongress send this message--that electronic commerce should be free of \ntariff and non-tariff barriers, and of multiple and discriminatory \ntaxation. At this time, I do want to make one clarification.\n  The resolution urges a permanent international ban on tariffs on \nelectronic commerce. It is my understanding that, in this context, this \nphrase really urges a permanent international ban on tariffs on \nelectronic transmissions. Electronic transmissions is a more exact \nphrase, which more clearly reflects the findings of this resolution and \nthe current negotiating position of the United States.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the city of Sisters, Oregon, faces a public health \n     threat from a major outbreak of infectious diseases due to \n     the lack of a sewer system;\n       (2) the lack of a sewer system also threatens groundwater \n     and surface water resources in the area;\n       (3) the city is surrounded by Forest Service land and has \n     no reasonable access to non-Federal parcels of land large \n     enough, and with the proper soil conditions, for the \n     development of a sewage treatment facility;\n       (4) the Forest Service currently must operate, maintain, \n     and replace 11 separate septic systems\n\n[[Page S15224]]\n\n     to serve existing Forest Service facilities in the city of \n     Sisters; and\n       (5) the Forest Service currently administers 77 acres of \n     land within the city limits that would increase in value as a \n     result of construction of a sewer system.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONVEYANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--As soon as practicable and upon completion \n     of any documents or analysis required by any environmental \n     law, but not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall \n     convey to the city of Sisters, Oregon, (hereinafter \n     referred to as the `city') an amount of land that is not \n     more than is reasonably necessary for a sewage treatment \n     facility and for the disposal of treated effluent \n     consistent with subsection (c).\n       (b) Land Description.--The amount of land conveyed under \n     subsection (a) shall be 160 acres or 240 acres from within--\n       (1) the SE quarter of section 09, township 15 south, range \n     10 west, W.M.
