Mr. President, proponents of the quota legislation to be \nconsidered later today have spoken with vigor and passion regarding the \n``injury'' that was suffered by domestic steel companies and the threat \nimports pose to the workers at those companies.\n\n[[Page S7380]]\n\n  However, I am compelled to rise today to respond to many of the \nassertions raised regarding the steel industry specifically, and more \ngenerally I think it is important to speak to several other factors \nrelated to the bill. First, there are economic benefits all Americans \nenjoy as a result of lowering trade barriers; second, the harmful \nmessage a quota bill would send to our trading partners; and, third, \nthe inappropriateness of Congress singling out a specific industry for \nspecial treatment.\n  The first point I would like to make is that the import surge is \nover. According to the Department of Commerce, imports have returned to \ntheir traditional levels. In fact, overall steel imports in the first 4 \nmonths of 1999 were below the ``pre-import'' surge level. Moreover, \neven with the import surge of 1998, U.S. steel producers reported \nprofits of over $1 billion.\n  Furthermore, in reviewing data provided by the Steel Manufacturers \nAssociation, I was surprised to find that U.S. steel production has \nincreased over the last 10 years. The 1998 steel output of 107.6 \nmillion tons was 10 percent greater than 1990 and the highest for any \nyear since 1981.\n  Additionally, I was interested to discover that since 1987, imports \nas a percentage of domestic consumption have remained constant at \naround 20 percent. Again, according to this data, no ground has been \nlost despite protestations to the contrary.\n  Some have argued that the financial ill health of several specific \ncompanies such as Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Weirton Steel \nCorporation, Laclede Steel Company, Acme Metals Incorporated, and \nGeneva Steel Company are the direct result of last year's import surge. \nHowever, the fact is that many of the integrated steel mills have a \nhistory of declining financial health evident well in advance of the \nAsian crisis and the 1998 import surge. This is reflected in their \nstock performance which, without exception, shows a pronounced decline \nin the value of the stock over the last 5 years. Again, it has nothing \nto do with the surge in imports.\n  Noting the declining employment figures in the steel industry, \nproponents of the quota bill suggest that the United States is losing \nmarket share, but the fact is imports have not led to a decrease in \nmarket share. U.S. steel production in traditional integrated mills has \nremained fairly flat. Import competition has merely forced U.S. steel \nto become more efficient. The growth in domestic production that has \nallowed U.S. steel to retain its domestic share has been almost \nexclusively a result of our Nation's mini-mills which now account for \nalmost 50 percent of domestic steel production. Mini-mills use an \ninnovative production technique to recycle scrapped steel. These highly \nefficient and environmentally friendly producers are transforming the \nsteel industry, and I think here it is worth noting that the \nassociation of mini-mills is neutral with regard to the proposed quota \nlegislation.\n  Finally in this area, some argue our foreign competitors are playing \nby a different set of rules. This is exactly what our current \nantidumping laws are intended to address. The steel industry has shown \nitself to be intimately familiar with and more than willing to take \nadvantage of these laws. Even though steel accounts for only 5 percent \nof our imports, the industry has generated 46 percent of the unfair-\ntrade complaints brought before the U.S. International Trade Commission \nduring the last 2 decades. Our current laws provide appropriate \nprotection for all industries. They should not be circumvented in order \nto provide extraordinary protection for a single industry.\n\n  All too often we hear complaints of lost jobs and invariably the \nblame is laid on trade. This allegation has gone unanswered for far too \nlong. Trade has given us far more jobs than would otherwise be \navailable. The fact is that the size of the trade sector has grown \nsteadily during the last 50 years. As a share of the economy, trade \ndoubled between 1950 and 1980, and it has doubled again between 1980 \nand 1998. Not surprisingly, employment has expanded from 99 million in \n1980 to 133 million today. And, the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.2 \npercent, the lowest level in 30 years.\n  Far from harming our economy, trade has been a major contributing \nfactor to our growth and our prosperity. Real GDP is now 64 percent \ngreater than it was in 1980 and we have experienced only 9 months of \nrecession during the last 16 years. Moreover, our growth rate is now \nthe highest and our unemployment rate the lowest among the G-7 nations.\n  Trade makes it possible for us to focus on the production of the \nthings we do best, and thereby produce a larger output and enjoy a \nhigher standard of living. For goods and services that we produce \ncheaply, we can expand our output and sell abroad at attractive prices. \nAnd for things we do poorly, we can acquire them more economically from \nforeign producers. Thus, trade promotes prosperity.\n  We have fought for open markets both through GATT and now the WTO. \nAnd we have been engaged in this fight, this battle for almost 50 \nyears. For some time, we have told the world that economic freedom and \na market economy are key ingredients of prosperity. The steel quota \nbill undermines this message.\n  Let me make four points with respect to the message.\n  A quota bill would send the wrong message to the European Union. A \nquota bill would send the wrong message to the former Communist \ncountries seeking to establish market economies. A quota bill would \nsend the wrong message to investors. And a quota bill would send the \nwrong message to our trading partners.\n  Let me just touch lightly on each of those.\n  With respect to the European Union, we are currently in the midst of \na trade dispute with the EU regarding their restrictions on both \nbananas and beef. The steel quota bill undercuts our position on these \nissues. How can we complain about the restrictions of others while we \nourselves are erecting trade barriers?\n\n  With respect to the leaders of the former communist countries, this \nbill says when we think it is convenient, it is all right to substitute \npolitical manipulation for markets. I can assure you, the leaders of \nthe former communist countries are watching. If a prosperous America \nwith a low unemployment rate is willing to bail out troubled firms, how \ncan we expect them to refrain from such action.\n  With respect to investors, while much of the world has been in \nrecession, investment flowed into the United States and the U.S. \neconomy remained strong. In no small degree, this confidence of \ninvestors was due to the openness of our economy and our reliance on \nmarkets rather than politics.\n  Again, with respect to our trading partners, our trading partners--\nmost of which have lower and slower rates of growth and higher \nunemployment--are unlikely to stand idly by while we impose trade \nbarriers. Retaliation and escalation of trade barriers are likely side-\neffects.\n  Finally, it bears mentioning that it is a serious mistake for \nCongress to play favorites. This is precisely what is involved here.\n  This bill imposes a tax on steel-users in order to subsidize steel-\nproducers. A substantial share of the U.S. steel industry refines raw \nsteel into finished and specialty goods. The U.S. steel industry is \ntherefore a major purchaser of imported steel. Higher steel prices \nwhich will surely accompany import quotas will increase the cost of \nrefined steel and make these products less competitive than would \notherwise be the case.\n  Moreover, this bill would treat the steel industry different than \nother industries. Steel is not the only industry that has been \nadversely affected by currency devaluations and weak demand due to the \nAsian crisis and recession in several parts of the world. The sales of \nmany firms were affected as the result of these factors. Why should \nthis industry be singled out for special treatment?\n  In conclusion, I want to stress that the legislation we will be \nconsidering later today proposes that the Congress intervene in the \nmarket, risk a trade war, and endanger the future health of our economy \nin order to insulate a segment of out steel industry from competition. \nI maintain there is already sufficient legislation on the books to \nprotect industries against unfair competitive practices. Quotas and \ntrade barriers are the wrong path. The world has already gone down this \n``trade\n\n[[Page S7381]]\n\nwar'' road once before with the Smoot-Hawley Law of 1930. Let's not \nmake that same mistake again.\n  Additionally, I should note that Chairman Greenspan recently has \nsounded the dangers of protectionism. He now believes that rising \nprotectionism is the single most dangerous threat to our future growth \nand prosperity. I share his concern.\n  Make no mistake about it--important principles are at stake here. We \nshould be reducing trade barriers rather than increasing them. We have \nno business playing favorites. As our recent High-Tech Summit \nindicated, trade in both goods and ideas has made an enormous \ncontribution to our prosperity. We must not allow this misguided effort \nto assist some at the expense of others and endanger American \nprosperity.\n  With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I congratulate our dear colleague from \nFlorida, the distinguished chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, \nfor his remarks. I identify myself with what he said.\n  The steel quota bill is a trade war starter and a job killer. It is \nimperative that this bill be defeated on the floor of the Senate today. \nLet me just try to outline a few reasons why I think that is absolutely \nessential.\n  First of all, America is the world's largest steel user. We have 40 \ntimes as many jobs in America using steel as we have jobs in making \nsteel, so if we decide we are going to effectively, through this quota, \nimpose a tax on steel, for every 1 worker we help we are going to hurt \n40 workers. In fact, it has been estimated that to save one job through \nprotectionism in steel it will cost Americans about $800,000.\n  How can it make sense to impose a cost of $800,000 to save a $50,000 \nor $60,000 job? It makes absolutely no sense. It would be an irrational \ndecision for an individual or a family to make such a decision. And \nwhat is wisdom for an individual or family cannot be folly for a great \nnation.\n  You might ask yourself, if, in fact, everybody knows we have 40 \nsteel-using jobs for every 1 steel-producing job--and we are debating \nimposing a quota on imports which will hopefully protect a few jobs \nwhile destroying many jobs--why are we doing it? We are doing it \nbecause the steel workers are very organized and are very tied in \npolitically. That is what this is about.\n  The important thing to remember, however, is it costs not only about \n$800,000 per worker to protect a steel job, but because the steel quota \nis World Trade Organization illegal, it means that our competitors \naround the world, who will find these quotas being imposed on their \nsteel, will be able to impose similar quotas and tariffs on American \nmanufactured products, American agricultural products, American \nservices that we sell around the world.\n  So the first point I want people to understand is that, by the most \nconservative estimate, when you take into account 40 jobs in steel \nusing for every 1 job in manufacturing, when you take into account that \nthis steel quota is illegal and therefore will produce countervailing \nquotas and tariffs against American products where we clearly are \ncompetitive on the world market, we are going to end up paying, as \nAmerican consumers, over $1 million for every job in steel we might \nprotect under this quota.\n  The next point I want to make is that the problem in steel is largely \nnot imports. In 1980, we had 459,000 people employed in the steel \nindustry. Today, we have 163,000 people employed in the steel industry.\n  You would think, in looking at these numbers, that steel production \nin America had fallen right through the floor; but, in fact, steel \nproduction since 1980 is up 56 percent. In fact, steel production in \nAmerica was at an all-time high in 1997, even though we had reduced the \nnumber of people working in steel production from 459,000 to 163,000.\n  How do you reduce the number of workers from 459,000 to 169,000 and \nhave production go up by 56 percent? You have that occur because of \nmodernization and because of the implementation of new technology. In \nfact, since 1980, on average, America has reduced the number of people \nworking in steel production by 9,000 a year, and they have done that \nnot because of foreign competition but because of the implementation of \nnew, modern technology.\n  Senator Mack mentioned it, but we have trade law section 201 that \nallows an industry that is suffering from foreign competition, where it \ncan prove that job loss is due to the foreign competition, to get \ngranted relief under current law. The steel industry, which has a \nrecord of filing more unfair trade practice suits and more complaints \nunder the trade laws than any other industry in America, has not \navailed itself of 201. Why? Because if you look back to 1980, the \nprimary reason they are losing jobs is not foreign competition.\n  In fact, in 1997 we had a record level of steel production in \nAmerica--105 million tons. We had a record level of demand; hence we \nhad a surge in imports and we had the demand because we are producing \nmore cars, more trucks, more heavy equipment, and we are producing more \nwashing machines, more dryers, more dishwashers than ever in history. \nAnd I can't think of a happier time, in terms of the economy, than we \nare looking at today.\n  In fact, in 1998--the last year we had data--steel production in \nAmerica was near the all-time record, at 102 million tons. So the \nsecond point is that there is not a lot of data to suggest that the \nproblem is with imports.\n  The third point I want to make is that the import crisis, if there \never was one, has passed. Steel imports are down from November 1998 to \nApril of 1999--the last month we have data--by 28 percent. So if this \never was a problem, it is a problem that has largely been eliminated.\n  Finally, where is the evidence that the steel industry is on its \nback? The steel industry earned $1.4 billion in 1998. Of the 13 largest \nsteel makers, 11 earned a profit in 1998. The bankruptcy of the three \nsteel companies that are largely discussed as part of this bill, most \nanalysts estimate, would have happened without regard to imports \nbecause of their high level of debt and because of the failure of \ninvestment that they made in new technology.\n  Now, no one is unconcerned when 10,000 Americans lose jobs in a year. \nThat is a very real human story, and to be opposed to the quota bill is \nnot to say that you don't care about the 10,000 people who lost their \njobs. But it is important to remember that 9,000 people a year have \nlost their jobs due to technological change since 1980, and nobody \nwants to stop that change because it has created more jobs; it has \nproduced better products; and it has produced products at lower prices, \nwhich have raised the real wages and living standards of every working \nfamily.\n  Finally, we are creating 7,500 jobs a day in America. We are the envy \nof the world. We are the world's most open market. We are the world's \nlargest importer and, as a result, every day in America we are creating \n7,500 new permanent, productive, taxpaying jobs for the future. We are \ncreating them in industries that are going to grow and prosper, where \nthese jobs represent jobs that will be there 20, 25, 30 years from \ntoday. Why in the world would we, the greatest beneficiary of \ninternational trade, want to start a trade war over 10,000 jobs when \n9,000 of them were probably lost due to technological change, and in \nthe process, jeopardize the creation of 7,500 jobs a day?\n  So the question we have to ask ourselves is: Do we want to risk 7,500 \njobs a day in job creation in America due to being the world's greatest \ntrading Nation? Do we want to put those jobs at risk for 10,000 jobs in \nthe steel industry that will cost us over a million dollars, in terms \nof consumer cost, individually to protect? And, finally, there is no \nguarantee that technological improvement will not end up eliminating \nthese jobs in any case.\n\n  I think our choice is clear. I think we have to reject this bill. \nThis bill will kill jobs. This bill will start a trade war, and since \nwe are the greatest trading Nation in the history of the world, we will \nlose more than anyone else. So I urge my colleagues to vote no on this \nbill, and to vote no because we are the richest, freest, and happiest \npeople in the history of the world because we are the one Nation in the \nworld that believes in trade and practices it every day.\n\n[[Page S7382]]\n\n  Why we would want to change our minds on trade in the midst of an \neconomic boom that is virtually unprecedented in the history of the \nworld is a great mystery to me. Why this bill is even on the floor of \nthe Senate is a testament to the level of economic illiteracy in \nAmerica. Why it would make any sense whatsoever to impose an effective \ntax on steel and destroy 40 jobs for every one job that you save is a \ngreat mystery, and only politics can explain it.\n  This is a bad bill. It could not come at a worse time. It is totally \nunjustified. It threatens the economic future of America, and I urge my \ncolleagues to reject it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7382-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7382-S7391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    FOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEARS 2000 AND 2001\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, what is the current situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is to be recognized on his \namendment at this point.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in order to save time, let me speak to \nthese amendments and then I will send up a modification.\n  For just one minute, I do want to respond to my colleague from Texas \nand say that I think this vote today around noon on cloture on the \nRockefeller amendment is a test of economic literacy. But I have a \ndifferent definition of that than my colleague from Texas. One more \ntime, I want to make about two or three points. The first point is that \nour administration has no problem when it comes to tariffs, or when it \ncomes to imposing tariffs on European imports in support of Chiquita \nBananas in Central America. But now when it comes to the steelworkers, \nthere is opposition.\n  My second point is that in many ways what happened with the Asian \ncrisis was you had hot capital going in and out of those countries with \nno kind of regulatory framework that made sense. George Soros, a \nfinancier who knows something about this, is saying we have to have a \ndifferent kind of framework for the global economy. Some of the \nfinancial interests that benefited most from financial liberalization \nand then were hurt the most from the Asian crisis were able to get some \npublic money and public assistance through IMF bailouts. But again, \nwhen our steelworkers ask for some support under existing trade \nstatutes, we don't get it.\n  Finally, let it be clear that this is not all about whether we have \nfree trade. This is about fair trade. That is what I think matters the \nmost. Our workers can compete with workers anywhere. But when you see \nthe dumping of steel below the cost of production in our markets and \nsaturating our markets and prices going down and people losing their \njobs, of course, working people stand up and fight back. That makes all \nthe sense in the world.\n  Finally, I want to argue a little bit of economics focusing on how we \ncan help countries going through these crises --countries such as \nThailand, Indonesia, Russia, and Mexico--how we can help those \ncountries help their working class people consume more. Right now we \nare emphasizing that those countries should try to export their way out \nof their crises instead of relying on domestic demand, which does not \nmake a lot of sense. We ought to be focused on how people in these \ncountries can earn a decent living so they can, in fact, buy some of \nwhat they produce in their countries--some of their own products.\n  I say to my colleague from Texas that economic analysis is a little \nbit different than his but one which I think makes more sense.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have two amendments that I want to \ntalk about today.\n  The first amendment deals with one of the most alarming human rights \nabuses in the world today. It is the growing use of child soldiers.\n  Today, in 25 countries there are a quarter of a million, or more, \nchildren being used in government armies and rebel groups. Some of \nthese children--if you are ready for this--are as young as 8 years old.\n  Children are recruited in a variety of different ways. Some are \nconscripted. Some are forcibly recruited or kidnapped and literally \ndragged from their homes, schools, and villages. In some instances, \nchildren are recruited based solely on whether or not they are big \nenough to hold a gun.\n  I think I need to repeat that.\n  In some cases these children are recruited, abducted, or kidnapped on \nthe basis of whether or not they are big enough to hold a gun.\n  These young combatants are not only subject to grave physical risk \nbut are all too often encouraged, or even forced themselves, to commit \nbarbaric acts. Children are forced to do this. They are considered \ndispensable. Child soldiers are often sent to the front lines of \ncombat, or sent into mine fields ahead of other troops. Children who \nprotest or who cannot keep up with the march or attempt to escape are \nkilled often by other child captives who are forced to participate in \nthe killings as a means of breaking their wills and their spirits.\n  Those who survive these experiences are frequently physically and \nemotionally scarred. In addition to dealing with severe emotional and \npsychological trauma, malnourishment, disease, and physical injury \nsuffered while in captivity, many children worry about their basic \nsurvival--how they will feed, clothe, and shelter themselves.\n  For example, in northern Uganda, the Lord's Resistance Army, an \nopposition group, has abducted some 10,000 children. Children as young \nas 8 years old have been taken from their schools and homes and forced \nto march to rebel-based camps in southern Sudan. They are made to carry \nheavy loads, without rest, and with very little food and water.\n  Accounts of the use of these children as soldiers by the Lord's \nResistance Army in Uganda and in the devastating Sierra Leone conflict \nmake clear that child combatants may suffer not only physical injury or \ndisability but also psychological damage or rejection by their home \ncommunities.\n  Last year, I met with Ms. Angelina Atyam, the mother of one such \nchild. Angelina's 14-year-old daughter, Charlotte--Charlotte is the \nfirst name of Charlotte Oldham-Moore, who is with me on human rights \nissues--was abducted from her school dormitory over a year and a half \nago by rebels from the Lord's Resistance Army. Angelina described to me \nthat fateful October morning when she arrived at her daughter's school \nto find all the windows broken, the girls' clothes scattered \neverywhere, and her daughter missing. The rebels had arrived at St. \nMary's girls school the previous night, tied up the girls, beat them if \nthey cried, and then took them away into unspeakable horrors. One \nhundred and thirty-nine students were abducted at gunpoint.\n  That is why this amendment is a very important amendment.\n  Thankfully, many of them have been rescued or escaped or their \nfreedom has been purchased. But many others, such as Charlotte, have \nnot returned. Charlotte turned 15 in the captivity of the Lord's \nResistance Army. In Angelina's own words:\n\n       Until peace comes, the kidnaping will continue. My daughter \n     Charlotte turned 15 in Sudan. Like other parents in the \n     Concerned Parents Association, my husband and I can only rely \n     on those few children who manage to escape from captivity for \n     news of our daughter. Two weeks ago, I spoke with a girl who \n     had just escaped. She said the rebels are now intentionally \n     impregnating the girls, to make them too ashamed to go back \n     to their parents. She mentioned that one of the pregnant \n     girls is a St. Mary's student named Charlotte.\n       I pray that one day my daughter will come home, and my \n     family can become whole again. Uganda's future depends on how \n     the government acts to end this tragedy and how quickly \n     society reintegrates the children. No nation can have a valid \n     strategic interest in prolonging the captivity and abuse of \n     children. President Clinton has a unique opportunity to help \n     start this healing process.\n\n  Important efforts are being made to address this moral outrage. Graca \nMachel, the former U.N. expert on the impact of armed conflict on \nchildren, has recommended that governments immediately demobilize all \nchild soldiers.\n  I believe the United States must do more to end this grave human \nrights\n\n[[Page S7383]]\n\nabuse and assist its victims. Rehabilitation and social reintegration \nprograms are essential to help former child soldiers regain a place in \ncivilian society and help prevent their re-recruitment into subsequent \nconflicts. I believe strongly that the need for demobilization, \nrehabilitation, and reintegration programs of former child soldiers in \nconflict areas must be incorporated into U.S. policy.\n  The United States must take a leadership role in demobilizing and \nreintegrating these children back into their communities.\n  That is why this is a resolution that directs the State Department to \nstudy the issue of rehabilitation of former child soldiers, the \npositive role the United States can play in this effort, and to submit \na report to the Congress on how we should address it.\n  Armed conflict has already taken the lives of 2 million children in \nthe last decade. Three times as many have been injured or disabled. \nWith the continued use of child soldiers, those numbers will only rise.\n  Our country must be a champion for children and their welfare. \nConsequently, the United States should be making the strongest possible \neffort to protect children of combat and to assist them in reentering \ntheir societies. It is the very least that we can do.\n  This amendment represents a continuation of some work that the \nSenator and I have been doing in this area. Today we focus on the need \nto provide the support services for these children.\n  Today we focus on the need to get a report from our State Department \nas to how we can play as positive a role as possible.\n  In the past, I have talked about these abuses on the floor. I \ncertainly hope that we will continue to be very active and play a \npositive role in efforts to have some kind of international protocol \nagreement to protect these children.\n  I can't think, quite frankly, of a more important issue.\n  I have talked with some parents. As a parent, I find it unbelievable \nthat this happens to so many children in so many countries. It would \nseem to me that we really ought to, as a country, as a government, take \nthe lead and play as positive a role as possible.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting this modification of this \namendment.\n  When Senator Helms comes to the floor, we will go ahead and do that.\n  Mr. President, also in order to move forward, let me go on and speak \nabout another amendment that I was going to introduce to this bill--the \nState Department authorization bill, which I will now hold off on for a \nlittle bit longer period of time as we continue to build support.\n  This amendment also deals with another horrendous human rights \nviolation in our time--the trafficking in human beings, particularly \nthe trafficking of women and children for the purposes of sexual \nexploitation and forced labor.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced a bill called the International \nTrafficking of Women and Children Victim Protection Act of 1999, which \naddresses this issue and is cosponsored by Senators Feinstein, Boxer, \nSnowe, Murray, and Torricelli.\n  If passed, this bill will put the Senate on record--or this \namendment, which we will be introducing shortly. We are going to \ncontinue to work with people and work with the State Department and \nwith other Senators and build the support. But we want to go on record \nin the Senate, the U.S. Congress, as opposing trafficking for forced \nprostitution and domestic servitude, and acting to check it before the \nlives of more women and more girls are shattered.\n\n  One of the fastest growing international trafficking businesses is \nthe trade in women. Women and girls seeking a better life, a good \nmarriage, or a lucrative job abroad, unexpectedly find themselves \nforced to work as prostitutes or in sweatshops. Seeking this better \nlife, they are lured by local advertisements for good jobs in foreign \ncountries--including our country--at wages they could never imagine at \nhome. Every year, the trafficking of human beings for the sex trade \naffects hundreds of thousands of women throughout the world.\n  The U.S. Government estimates that between 1 and 2 million women and \ngirls are trafficked annually around the world. According to experts, \nsomewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 women are trafficked each year \ninto the United States alone. They come from Thailand, they come from \nRussia, they come from the Ukraine, they come from other countries in \nAsia, and they come from other countries from the former Soviet Union.\n  Upon arrival in countries far from their homes, these women are often \nstripped of their passports, held against their will in slave-like \nconditions, and sexually abused. Rape, intimidation, and violence are \ncommonly employed by traffickers to control their victims and to \nprevent them from seeking help.\n  Through physical isolation and psychological trauma, traffickers and \nbrothel owners imprison women in a world of economic and sexual \nexploitation that imposes a constant fear of arrest and deportation, as \nwell as of violent reprisals by traffickers themselves, to whom the \nwomen must pay off ever-growing debts. Many brothel owners actually \nprefer foreign women--women who are far from home, far from help, don't \nspeak the language--because it is so easy to control them. Most of \nthese women never imagine the life in hell they would encounter, having \ntraveled abroad to find better jobs or to see the world. Many believe \nthat nothing would happen to them in rich countries like Switzerland, \nGermany or the United States. However, many of them now are put in a \nliving hell.\n  Last year, First Lady Hillary Clinton spoke powerfully of this human \ntragedy. She said,\n       I have spoken to young girls in northern Thailand whose \n     parents were persuaded to sell them as prostitutes, and they \n     received a great deal of money by their standards. You could \n     often tell the homes of where the girls had been sold because \n     they might even have a satellite dish or an addition built on \n     their house. But I met girls who had come home after they had \n     been used up, after they had contracted HIV or AIDS. If \n     you've ever held the hand of a 13-year-old girl dying of \n     AIDS, you can understand how critical it is that we take \n     every step possible to prevent this happening to any other \n     girl anywhere in the world. I also, in the Ukraine, heard of \n     women who told me with tears running down their faces that \n     young women in their communities were disappearing. They \n     answered ads that promised a much better future in another \n     place and they were never heard from again.\n\n  Lest you think this is just in other countries, and this only happens \nin far off lands, let me talk about the United States. Earlier this \nspring, six men admitted in a Florida court to forcing 17 women and \ngirls--some as young as 14--into a prostitution slavery ring. The \nvictims were smuggled into the United States from Mexico with a promise \nof steady work, but instead they were forced into prostitution. The \nring was uncovered when two 15-year-old girls escaped and went to the \nMexican consulate in Miami.\n  According to recent reports by the Justice Department, teenage \nMexican girls were also held in slavery in the Carolinas and forced to \nsubmit to prostitution. In addition, Russian and Latvian women were \nforced into nightclub work in Chicago. According to charges filed \nagainst the traffickers, the traffickers picked up the women upon their \narrival at the airport, seized their documents and return tickets, \nlocked them in hotels and beat them up. The women were told that if \nthey didn't dance nude in nightclubs, the Russian mafia would kill \ntheir families. Further, over 3 years, hundreds of women from the Czech \nRepublic who answered advertisements in Czech newspapers for modeling \nwere ensnared in an illegal prostitution ring.\n  These victims are unfamiliar with the laws, they are unfamiliar with \nthe language, they are unfamiliar with the customs, and quite often \nthey don't know what to do. They are completely helpless. They are \ncompletely hopeless.\n  Trafficking in women and girls is a human rights problem that \nrequires a human rights response. Trafficking is condemned by human \nrights treaties as a violation of basic human rights, and it is a \nslavery-like practice. Women who are trafficked are subjected to other \nabuses--rape, beatings, physical confinement--squarely prohibited by \nhuman rights law. The human abuses continue in the workplace, in the \nforms of physical and sexual abuse, debt bondage, and illegal \nconfinement, and all are prohibited.\n\n  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes the right to be \nfree from slavery and involuntary servitude, arbitrary detention, \ndegrading or inhuman treatment, as well as to\n\n[[Page S7384]]\n\nthe right to protection by law against these abuses.\n  The United Nations General Assembly has passed three resolutions \nduring the last three years recognizing that international traffic in \nwomen and girls is an issue of pressing international concern involving \nnumerous violations of fundamental human rights. The United Nations \nGeneral Assembly is calling upon all governments to criminalize \ntrafficking, to punish its offenders, while not penalizing it's \nvictims.\n  Fortunately, the global trade in women and children is receiving \ngreater attention by governments and NGOs following the U.N. World \nConference on Women in Beijing. The President's Interagency Council on \nWomen is working hard to mobilize a response to this problem. Churches, \nsynagogues, and NGOs are fighting this battle daily. But, much, much \nmore must be done.\n  My bill provides a human rights response to the problem. It has a \ncomprehensive and integrated approach focused on prevention, protection \nand assistance for victims, and prosecution of traffickers.\n  I will highlight a few of its provisions now:\n  It sets an international standard for governments to meet in their \nefforts to fight trafficking and assist victims of this human rights \nabuse. It calls on the State Department and Justice Department to \ninvestigate and take action against international trafficking. In \naddition, it creates an Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat \nTrafficking in the Office of the Secretary of State and directs the \nSecretary to submit an annual report to Congress on international \ntrafficking.\n  The annual report would, among other things, identify states engaged \nin trafficking, the efforts of these states to combat trafficking, and \nwhether their government officials are complicit in the practice. \nCorrupt government or law enforcement officials sometimes directly \nparticipate and benefit in the trade of women and girls. And, \ncorruption also prevents prosecution of traffickers. U.S. police \nassistance would be barred to countries found not to have taken \neffective action in ending the participation of their officials in \ntrafficking, and in investigating and prosecuting meaningfully their \nofficials involved in trafficking. A waiver is provided for the \nPresident if he finds that provision of such assistance is in the \nnational interest. This is a modest enforcement provision that will \nencourage governments to take seriously this extremely serious human \nrights violation.\n  On a national level, it ensures that our immigration laws do not \nencourage rapid deportation of trafficked women, a practice which \neffectively insulates traffickers from ever being prosecuted for their \ncrimes. Trafficking victims are eligible for a nonimmigrant status \nvalid for three months. If the victim pursues criminal or civil actions \nagainst her trafficker, or if she pursues an asylum claim, she is \nprovided with an extension of time. Further, it provides that \ntrafficked women should not be detained, but instead receive needed \nservices, safe shelter, and the opportunity to seek justice against \ntheir abusers. Finally, my bill provides much needed resources to \nprograms assisting trafficking victims here at home and abroad.\n  We must commit ourselves to ending the trafficking of women and girls \nand to building a world in which women and children are no longer \nsubjected to such horrendous abuses.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  I say to the chair of the committee, I will not introduce the \namendment to today's bill. What we want to do is have an amendment, and \nI hope to get the support of the chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, which will set an international standard for governments to \nmeet in their effort to fight trafficking and assist victims of human \nrights abuse. It will call on the State Department and Justice \nDepartment to investigate and take action against international \ntrafficking. It will create an interagency traffic force to monitor and \ncombat trafficking in the Office of the Secretary of State. It will \ndirect the Secretary of State to submit an annual report to Congress on \ninternational trafficking.\n  We will also take a look at what different governments are doing and \nwhich countries are involved in this illegal practice, what police \nforces are involved, and whether or not we ought to be taking action \nwith a clear message that we, as a government, will not tolerate that.\n  On a national level, it will ensure that our immigration laws don't \nencourage the rapid deportation of women, that insulates the \ntraffickers from being prosecuted. Women are terrified; they have no \nprotection, and therefore, they can't even testify against what is \nhappening to them. We want to make sure they are provided with some \nprotection.\n  We want to commit ourselves to ending the trafficking of women and \ngirls and to building a world in which women and children are no longer \nsubjected to this horrendous abuse.\n  We don't agree on all issues, I say to the chairman of the committee, \nbut I know him and I know he finds this practice abhorrent. Out of \nrespect for him, I will not introduce this amendment to this bill \nbecause I know he wants to move the bill forward. There are a couple of \nissues we are trying to resolve in terms of getting support. I had a \ncommitment from the chairman we will go forward with hearings. This \nwill not be delayed.\n  Perhaps even more importantly, I say to the chairman, because he has \nhad nothing to do with delaying this, I have been waiting for the State \nDepartment to come forward with their modifications. I have asked for \nquite some period of time. My hope is within the next week we will be \ndoing this work together. I will work with the chairman; I will work \nwith Senator Biden; I will work with the State Department. We will come \nto some agreement on our language, which surely we can do. When the \nforeign operations bill comes to the floor, my hope is we will be ready \nwith this amendment. If at that point in time I can't get the State \nDepartment to come forward and give me their suggestions and talk about \ntheir approach and have us work together, I will just bring the \namendment to that bill and we will have an all out debate and a vote up \nor down and see where people stand.\n  I am convinced with a little bit more time--not too much more time \nbut a little bit more time--I will get to work with the chairman and I \nwill be able to get the support of the chairman of the Senate Foreign \nAffairs Committee and Senator Biden and other Senators and we can move \nthis forward.\n  My goal is to get this passed. Members don't come to the floor to \ngive a speech for the sake of giving a speech. Quite often, we don't \neven get to see, Senator Helms, the results of our work in a concrete \nway. But we do know if we can pass something like this and get it in a \nbill, it can help a lot of people around the world, and we have done \nsomething good. I want to do something good, do something positive.\n  I will wait a little while longer. I do want the State Department to \nknow I will not wait much longer. Let's go forward in the spirit of \nworking together. This will not be something that we will delay and \ndelay. We will pass this. Some good work is being done in the State \nDepartment. There is no reason we can't do this together. There is no \nreason this can't be a bipartisan bill. There is no reason why our \ngovernment, our country, can't take the lead in trying to put an end to \nthis abhorrent, unconscionable, vicious practice. This is a huge civil \nrights issue. As a Senator, I intend to address this with some good \nlegislation.\n\n  I say to the Chair, I have already had a chance to speak on the \namendment dealing with child soldiers. We have a modification.\n  What I would like to do now is call up amendment No. 697 and ask \nunanimous consent it be in order for me to modify the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 697, As Modified\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of Congress that the global use of child \n soldiers is unacceptable and that the international community should \n                  find remedies to end this practice)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S7385]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 697, as modified.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 115, after line 18, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 730. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE USE OF CHILDREN AS \n                   SOLDIERS OR OTHER COMBATANTS IN FOREIGN ARMED \n                   FORCES.  \n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are at least 300,000 children who are involved in \n     armed conflict in at least 25 countries around the world. \n     This is an escalating international humanitarian crisis which \n     must be addressed promptly.\n       (2) Children are uniquely vulnerable to military \n     recruitment because of their emotional and physical \n     immaturity, are easily manipulated, and can be drawn into \n     violence that they are too young to resist or understand.\n       (3) Children are most likely to become child soldiers if \n     they are orphans, refugees, poor, separated from their \n     families, displaced from their homes, living in a combat \n     zone, or have limited access to education.\n       (4) Child soldiers, besides being exposed to the normal \n     hazards of combat, are also afflicted with other injuries due \n     to their lives in the military. Young children may have \n     sexually related illnesses, suffer from malnutrition, have \n     deformed backs and shoulders which are the result of carrying \n     loads too heavy for them, as well as respiratory and skin \n     infections.\n       (5) One of the most egregious examples of the use of child \n     soldiers is the abduction thousands of children, some as \n     young as 8 years of age, by the Lord's Resistance Army (in \n     this section referred to as the ``LRA\") in northern Uganda.\n       (6) The Department of State's Country Reports on Human \n     Rights Practices For 1999 reports that in Uganda the LRA \n     abducted children ``to be guerillas and tortured them by \n     beating them, raping them, forcing them to march until \n     collapse, and denying them adequate food, water, or \n     shelter''.\n       (7) Children who manage to escape from LRA captivity have \n     little access to trauma care and rehabilitation programs, and \n     many find their families displaced, missing, dead, or fearful \n     of having their children return home.\n       (8) A large number of children have participated and been \n     killed in the armed conflict in Sri Lanka, and the use of \n     children as soldiers has led to a breakdown in law and order \n     in Sierra Leone.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--\n       (1) Condemnation.--Congress hereby joins the international \n     community in condemning the use of children as soldiers and \n     other combatants by governmental and non-governmental armed \n     forces.\n       (2) Further sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress \n     that--\n       (A) the Secretary of State should--\n       (i) study the issue of the rehabilitation of former child \n     soldiers, the manner in which their suffering can be \n     alleviated, and the positive role that the United States can \n     play in such an effort; and\n       (ii) submit a report to Congress on the issue of \n     rehabilitation of child soldiers and their families.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, we certainly accept this amendment, \namendment No. 697, as modified. We have discussed it on both sides.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 697), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for his help and his \nsupport.\n  Mr. HELMS. To the contrary, I thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. I commend the Senator from Minnesota for working with us \non his amendments. The issues he raised are--``significant'' is not \nstrong enough. They are grave issues that ought to be considered, and I \ncommend him for it. I assure the Senator the committee will continue to \nwork with him to address his concerns.\n  Mr. President, we have made significant progress in the State \nDepartment authorization bill. We have now completed debate on the \nFeingold amendment, and we have just, obviously, accepted the modified \nWellstone amendment. We are making progress on the Sarbanes amendment, \nwhich is the only remaining amendment to be debated. I understand some \nSenators wish to come to the floor and speak on the bill in general, \nand I encourage them to do that now. This afternoon we will vote on the \nFeingold amendment and possibly the Sarbanes amendment, and then we \nwill move to final passage.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Kathleen \nO'Brien, a fellow, and Meagan Fitzsimmons, who is an intern, be granted \nthe privilege of the floor today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 695\n\n    (Purpose: To increase the authorizations of appropriations for \n ``Contributions for International Organizations'' and ``Contributions \n              for International Peacekeeping Activities'')\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I believe I have an amendment at the \ndesk. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 695.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 116, strike ``$940,000,000 for the fiscal year 2000 \n     and $940,000,000'' and insert ``$963,308,000 for the fiscal \n     year 2000 and $963,308,000''.\n       On page 121, line 6, strike ``$215,000,000 for the fiscal \n     year 2000 and $215,000,000'' and insert ``$235,000,000 for \n     the fiscal year 2000 and $235,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I have been in discussions with the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee. The committee is prepared to \ntake the latter part of this amendment. I am prepared to withdraw the \nfirst part of the amendment, therefore obviating the need for a vote, \nalthough I would then like to speak about the bill and my general \nattitude toward it.\n  I make a parliamentary inquiry. If I were to ask for a division of \nthe amendment and withdraw the first part of it, on page 116, would the \nnext order then be to go to the second part of the amendment on page \n121?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be the order.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask for a division on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so divided.\n  The amendment (No. 695), as divided, is as follows:\n\n                               Division I\n\n       On page 116, strike ``$940,000,000 for the fiscal year 2000 \n     and $940,000,000'' and insert ``$963,308,000 for the fiscal \n     year 2000 and $963,308,000''.\n\n                              Division II\n\n       On page 121, line 6, strike ``$215,000,000 for the fiscal \n     year 2000 and $215,000,000'' and insert ``$235,000,000 for \n     the fiscal year 2000 and $235,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I withdraw the first part of the \namendment, lines 1, 2, and 3, that read, ``on page 116'' down and \nthrough ``$963,308,000.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I understand that now before us is the \nsecond part of the amendment, lines 4 and 5 on page 1 and lines 1 and 2 \non page 2; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. There was originally a two-hour time agreement on the \namendment, equally divided. I will cut my time back to half an hour, \nbut I thought we would go ahead and adopt it, if that is acceptable to \nthe chairman.\n  Mr. HELMS. I think that is what we should do, and I hope we will.\n\n[[Page S7386]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask unanimous consent that following the adoption of \nthe amendment I have 30 minutes to speak on the bill, and that will be \nin lieu of the 1 hour that had been reserved for proponents of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I urge the adoption of the second part of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 695), as divided, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee.\n  I now will speak on the bill, which presents some difficult issues. \nDespite the chairman's accommodation--which is a step forward that I \nappreciate--I still plan to vote against the bill, as I did in the \ncommittee. I say to the chairman that this decision has been made more \ndifficult for me because this bill is now being named after Admiral \nNance.\n  I wish the substance of the bill were such that I could feel free to \nvote for it. Unfortunately, I do not. But I want to make it very clear \nthat if I could have improved the substance enough, the fact that \nAdmiral Nance's name is on this bill would have clearly moved me in the \ndirection of voting for it. Hopefully, it will come back from \nconference in a somewhat better state, and I might be able to vote for \nit then.\n  I wanted to say this at the outset because I, like so many Members of \nthis body, had enormous respect and affection for Admiral Bud Nance and \nfor his commitment to our Nation, both in war and in peace. I saw that \ncommitment every day after he joined the chairman in the workings of \nour committee. His contributions were widely recognized and he will be \ngreatly missed.\n  This amendment, which we have now adjusted, was an effort to keep us \nfrom going further into arrears to the United Nations in the current \nyear. Under the compromise, we will authorize the full amount this year \nfor peacekeeping, but we still fall behind on the contributions to \ninternational organizations.\n  The bigger problem connected with the legislation is the proposed \npackage to settle our past arrears to the United Nations, which \nunfortunately, has two major shortcomings. First of all, the total \nfigure does not reach the level which our Government admits we owe, \nmissing it by a little under $100 million if one includes debt relief. \nMy second objection is that the money we do authorize has been heavily \nconditioned.\n  Let me just say at the outset that I believe important U.S. national \ninterests are undermined by our continued failure to pay what we owe to \nthe United Nations and its affiliated agencies. I know the chairman and \nthe ranking member are trying to search for a solution to this problem. \nI respect their efforts. I just do not think they have gone far enough \nalong this important path.\n  By refusing to meet our legal obligations while continually issuing \nnew demands, we are wasting our own influence, damaging our credibility \nand international respect, engendering resistance to the reforms we \nseek, and complicating the U.N.'s ability to perform its duties in a \ntimely and effective manner. In my view, we should pay our arrears \npromptly, in full, and without additional conditions.\n  Unfortunately, this legislation does not accomplish that objective. \nThe United States acknowledges we owe $1.021 billion to the U.N. The \nU.N. says we owe $1.5 billion. This bill authorizes $819 million over 3 \nyears, plus an additional $107 million in credit. Even the $819 million \nwhich is authorized will not be paid promptly and at once; it will be \npaid over a 3-year period. So we will still be almost $100 million \nshort of our acknowledged obligations, far short of the U.N. figure, \nwith no promise of ever paying it back.\n  Unfortunately, that puts us in the position of a permanent default, \nparticularly when one realizes that the authorization for the current \nyear falls short. The amendment we just adopted helps to correct that \non the peacekeeping side, but it still leaves us $23 million short on \nregular dues to the United Nations.\n  Furthermore, the bill imposes a long list of arbitrary and burdensome \nconditions for paying even the reduced amount, to which I have just \nmade reference. These conditions have not been negotiated with or \nagreed to by the United Nations. They are, in effect, unilaterally \nimposed by the United States. They are being imposed on past \nobligations, on money we had agreed to provide without such \nstipulations.\n\n  The consequence of these arrears is that the U.N. has been unable to \nreimburse other countries for sending their troops on peacekeeping \nmissions that the United States encouraged and endorsed. Other \ncountries have put the lives of their own citizens on the line in order \nto accomplish mutually agreed objectives. The U.S. responsibility in \nmost of those instances was to provide money to cover the missions they \nwere performing for us and the entire world. Those missions have been \naccomplished. The bill has not been paid.\n  In addition, despite my amendment, this legislation creates new \narrearages to the U.N., so not only do we fail to pay all the money we \nowe in arrears, not only do we establish preconditions for this partial \npayment, but we begin to build up new debts by authorizing less than is \nneeded.\n  The agreement that was reached on the amendment addressed this in \npart. It provided the $235 million needed for assessed peacekeeping \noperations. The bill had $215 million. It still does not provide the \nfull amount needed for assessed U.N. dues, falling short by $23 \nmillion.\n  I must say, if any other country delinquent in its obligations showed \nup with the demands we have placed in this legislation, lacking the \nintention of paying its debts in full and short of its current dues, we \nwould be extremely upset at what we would regard as its audacity. \nSurely our friends and allies will have the same reaction to our \nconduct.\n  This approach runs counter to that reflected in the exercise of \nAmerican leadership at the end of World War II, an approach that I \nthink should characterize our policy toward the United Nations today.\n  It is my strongly held view that the interests of the United States \nhave been served by our Nation's active participation in the United \nNations and the U.N. system. Especially now, with the end of the cold \nwar, the U.N. has a genuine opportunity to function as it was intended \nat the end of World War II, without the constant Soviet veto in the \nSecurity Council that effectively neutralized it for so many years.\n  The task facing us today is to assist the United Nations to adapt to \nthe end of the cold war and the challenges of the new century. The need \nfor the United Nations remains clear, for as then-Ambassador to the \nU.N. Madeleine Albright commented:\n\n       The battle-hardened generation of Roosevelt, Churchill and \n     de Gaulle viewed the U.N. as a practical response to an \n     inherently contentious world; a necessity not because \n     relations among States could ever be brought into perfect \n     harmony, but because they cannot.\n\n  This sense of realism seems absent from many of the current \ndiscussions of the United Nations. There has been a misperception that \nthe U.N. can somehow dictate policies to the United States and force us \nto undertake actions that do not serve U.S. interests. This is simply \nnot the case. Those who labored in San Francisco and elsewhere to \ncreate the United Nations some half a century ago insisted that the \nUnited Nations organization recognize the reality of great powers by \ngranting significant authority to the Security Council.\n  In the Council, the United States and other major powers were given \nthe veto power, thereby ensuring that the U.N. could not undertake \noperations which the United States opposed. Every U.N. peacekeeping \noperation requires prior approval by the United States.\n  Actually, by failing to meet our financial obligations, we are \nabdicating the powers available to us within the U.N. system.\n  We are, for example, in danger of losing our vote in the General \nAssembly, a status generally reserved for the world's lawless and \npariah states. Since the General Assembly works on the basis of \nconsensus, we are depriving\n\n[[Page S7387]]\n\nourselves of the ability to press for needed reforms.\n  The influence we held in the past by our leadership, reflected in the \nlarge number of senior posts awarded to U.S. nationals, is being eroded \nand subjected to challenge.\n  As Ambassador Richardson explained in the course of his confirmation \nhearings to go to the U.N.--he, of course, is now Secretary of Energy--\nI quote him:\n\n       Growing resentment over our failure to pay our assessed \n     dues and arrears has put our continued leadership and \n     influence at risk. . . . [A]mong the members of the Geneva \n     Group, composed of the U.N.'s largest contributors and a \n     crucial source of support for U.N. reform, there is virtually \n     no willingness to consider reductions in our dues for \n     peacekeeping or the regular budget until we pay our arrears. \n     If the United States fails to meet its financial commitments \n     to the U.N. system, it will become increasingly difficult to \n     set the U.N. priorities for the future and to ensure that \n     qualified Americans serve in important U.N. posts.\n\n  Let me just talk a bit about how an effective U.N. serves U.S. \ninterests. I believe, of course, that U.S. leadership is essential to \nan effective U.N.\n  Over the years, the U.N. has negotiated over 170 peaceful settlements \nacross the globe--helping to end wars, uphold cease-fires, protect \ncivilians, reintegrate refugees, oversee the conduct of free and fair \nelections, monitor troop withdrawals, and deter intercommunal violence.\n  From Iraq to Bosnia and Kosovo, assembling coalitions to repel \naggression and keep peace would have been impossible without assistance \nand support from the United Nations.\n  In Haiti, the introduction of U.N. peacekeepers meant that U.S. \ntroops could be extracted without condemning the country to chaos, \nwhile in Cyprus, the U.N. prevents an outbreak of hostilities that \ncould lead to conflict between two NATO allies.\n  The U.N. has not been able to handle every situation. Unfortunately, \nit has attracted the most attention in those instances when it has not \nable to provide a resolution. People then conclude that it is totally \nineffective. I beg very strongly to disagree with that conclusion.\n  As I have indicated, there have been numerous instances in which the \nU.N. has negotiated peaceful settlements. As a matter of fact, the \nNobel Peace Prize has been awarded five times to the United Nations and \nits organizations.\n  U.N. operations further serve U.S. interests by leveraging our \nresources and influence in order to achieve a much greater impact at \nlesser cost than we could unilaterally.\n  I think those who constantly talk about the burdensharing theme--and \nI think it is an important theme; I have talked about it myself--need \nto recognize the U.N. has been, and can be, an even more important \nmechanism for burdensharing.\n  One of the things that needs to be understood is that by working \nthrough the United Nations, we can often gain international endorsement \nfor an American position. The U.S. position is then seen as \nrepresenting the judgment of the entire international community and not \nsolely the judgment of the United States. The mandate becomes a \nresponse by the entire international community and cannot be portrayed \nas the United States trying to impose its own point of view in the \nparticular situation.\n  There are many examples of how the U.N. serves U.S. interests at a \nreduced cost and with great effectiveness. The International Atomic \nEnergy Agency, with our small annual contribution, has helped prevent \nnuclear proliferation by inspecting and monitoring nuclear reactors in \nfacilities in 90 countries, many of which would not allow access to the \nUnited States alone. The World Health Organization, working in concert \nwith USAID and other bilateral agencies, led a 13-year effort resulting \nin the complete eradication of smallpox, saving an estimated $1 billion \na year in vaccination and monitoring, and helped to wipe out polio from \nthe Western Hemisphere.\n\n  Through its High Commissioner for Refugees, its Children's Fund, the \nDevelopment Programme, the International Fund for Agricultural \nDevelopment, and the World Food Programme, the U.N. has saved millions \nfrom famine and provided food, shelter, medical aid, education, and \nrepatriation assistance to refugees around the world.\n  The U.N. Environment Programme and the World Meteorological \nOrganization have brought countries together to begin to address \nimportant environmental matters, to develop regional efforts to clean \nup pollution, and to predict and respond effectively to natural and \nmanmade disasters.\n  Thanks to organizations such as the Universal Postal Union, the \nInternational Telecommunications Union, the International Civil \nAviation Organization, and the International Maritime Organization--all \nagencies of the United Nations--there are procedures to ensure the \nsafety and reliability of worldwide travel and communications.\n  By coordinating international sanctions against the apartheid regime \nin South Africa, the U.N. was instrumental in bringing an end to the \napartheid system.\n  Through the efforts of the United Nations, over 300 international \ntreaties have been enacted which set standards of conduct and enable \ncooperation in areas ranging from arms control to human rights and \ncivil liberties, protection of copyrights and trademarks, determining \nmaritime jurisdiction and navigation on the high seas, preventing \ndiscrimination against women, conserving biological diversity, and \ncombating desertification.\n  Because of U.N. agencies, such as the International Labor \nOrganization, and U.N.-brokered agreements, such as the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, the American ideals of freedom, democracy, \nequality before the law, and the dignity of the individual have become \ninternationally accepted, and the rights and protections that U.S. \nworkers enjoy are being aggressively pursued in other countries.\n  International trade and commerce would be hamstrung without the World \nBank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, \nand the regional development banks, not to mention the many agreements \nnegotiated under their auspices. All of these grew from the U.N. \nsystem.\n  I went on at some length about these matters because we do not often \nfocus on them. A lot of the very positive work done by the U.N. is \nsimply taken for granted, falling below the ``radar screen'' for most \npeople. Many do not appreciate that it is the U.N. that is conducting \nall of these important activities, and they fail to understand how \ndiscomforted they would be in their lives if these activities were not \ncarried out, which the United Nations has been doing, year in and year \nout.\n  The U.N. has been a favorite target of criticism. Certainly there are \nactivities and practices of the U.N. that have been wasteful or \nineffective and that require reform. But I think the strategy of \nunilaterally withholding funds until all our demands are met is \ncounterproductive, particularly in the current circumstance.\n  Since his election in 1997, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan--whose \ncandidacy, of course, was strongly supported by the United States--has \ninstituted a number of significant reforms, including a zero-growth \nbudget, the cutting of administrative costs, the elimination of almost \n1,000 positions, the creation of an independent inspector general, the \nconsolidation of overlapping agencies, the establishment of more budget \noversight, and tighter budget discipline.\n  I know some think he has not gone as far as he should go, that he has \nnot fully implemented all of these reforms, and there is some truth to \nthat. But the fact remains, he is trying to run an organization that \noperates by consensus. He has set out the proper direction and the \nproper goals. He is doing his very best to move the agency along the \nright path.\n  Frankly, I think the United States can be more helpful in the reform \neffort. We do this not by being the biggest delinquent in dues paying, \nwhich only brings resentment against our calls for change; we should \npay our obligations in full so we can regain the credibility and \nrespect needed to push for further reforms.\n  It is both ironic and unfortunate that a nation that holds itself and \nits citizens to the highest standards of law should find itself in \ndefault of its international obligations. Our democracy is founded on \nthe primacy of respect for the rule of law. We urge other nations to \nfollow our example.\n  It is often a tremendous challenge to get countries to respect the \nbasic\n\n[[Page S7388]]\n\nrights of their citizens and to act in accordance with international \nlaw. Yet we ourselves are not meeting those high standards as they \nrelate to the United Nations. We undertook commitments under the U.N. \nCharter. We have a responsibility to make good on them if we want other \ncountries to uphold their international agreements.\n  The United States is the great power in the world today, and with \nthat role come important responsibilities in how we exercise that \npower. I think we are failing here, with respect to our commitments to \nthe U.N., to exercise those responsibilities in a manner that will \nstrengthen our position and serve our Nation in the international \ncommunity. We have not only a legal and moral obligation to pay our \ndues, but a practical interest in doing so as well.\n  So while I respect the efforts that have been made in the committee, \nand while I recognize that I was a lonely voice for this position in \nthe committee, I think that offering only a partial and a heavily \nconditioned repayment of the U.S. debt to the United Nations will not \nmeet our obligations and will not enhance our interests.\n  Seven former Secretaries of State have written an open letter to the \nCongress urging the United States to honor its international \ncommitments and pay its debt to the United Nations. I think their \nletter is a powerful statement about the importance of U.S. leadership \nand the risk that nonpayment of our debt to the U.N. will pose for U.S. \nsecurity and international influence. That letter was signed by former \nSecretaries Kissinger, Haig, Baker, Christopher, Vance, Shultz, and \nEagleburger--Democrats and Republicans alike.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their letter, which was sent to the \nSpeaker of the House, the House minority leader, the Senate majority \nleader, and the Senate minority leader, be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the arrears package in this bill is a \nsignificant step toward meeting our international obligations. But I am \ndeeply troubled by its failure to authorize the full amount that United \nStates itself admits we owe, let alone what the U.N. claims we owe.\n  Secondly, even making that money available, or any part of it, is \nvery heavily conditioned in this legislation. In other words, we are \nsaying to the U.N.: Yes, we are willing to pay some of what we owe, but \nin order to get any of this money, you will have to comply with a long \nlist of conditions--several of which I think will be extremely \ndifficult for them to meet. In any event, it is sort of a ``take it or \nleave it'' approach. This was not part of a negotiated agreement. We \nare going to approve the package and then present it to them. I think \nwe may encounter a difficult reaction to this and see a continuing \nproblem.\n  Third, as I indicated, even with the accommodation made on the \namendment earlier, we still create new arrears. So it is not as though \nwe are able to say to the U.N. that this is the package we propose for \narrears and, in the future, we are not going to let this situation \narise again. In other words, we aren't really on board here to meet our \ncontinuing obligations to the organization, which in substantial \nmeasure has been responsive to American interests. Instead, we are \ngoing to continue to go into arrears, extending the problem which has \nbrought us to the impasse we now confront.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n   U.S. Secretaries of State to Congress: U.S. Leadership Is at Risk\n\n     Hon. Dennis J. Hastert,\n     Speaker of the House.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader.\n     Hon. Richard J. Gephardt,\n     House Minority Leader.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Senate Minority Leader.\n                                                   March 16, 1999.\n       Dear Congressional Leaders: As America's financial debt to \n     the United Nations persists, we are deeply concerned that our \n     great nation is squandering its moral authority, leadership, \n     and influence in the world. It's simply unacceptable that the \n     richest nation on earth is also the biggest debtor to the \n     United Nations.\n       We are writing to urge all Members of Congress to support \n     full funding of the outstanding and current U.S. legal \n     obligations to the United Nations and to alert Congress to \n     the serious consequences if we fail to do so. U.S. leadership \n     is at risk. Our ability to achieve vital foreign policy and \n     security objectives is compromised. Our priceless reputation \n     as the pre-eminent country committed to the rule of law is \n     compromised. And, the critical work of the United Nations is \n     threatened.\n       As former Secretaries of State, we know first hand the \n     importance of the United Nations and its agencies in securing \n     global peace, stability and prosperity. And we appreciate \n     that now more than ever, the U.S. must lead in the community \n     of nations to turn back threats to peace and freedom, whether \n     from war or hunger, terrorism or disease. We cannot lead if \n     we ignore our basic international responsibilities.\n       There are historic consequences to our continued failure to \n     meet our obligations. The United States, one of the founding \n     members of the United Nations could lose its vote in the UN \n     General Assembly.\n       Important reforms have occurred at the United Nations, many \n     at America's urging: a no-growth budget from 1994-98 and an \n     actual reduction of $123 million for 1998-99, creation of an \n     office of inspector general which has identified more than \n     $80 million in savings, more than 1,000 positions cut, and \n     other cost-saving measures. Payment of U.S. arrears is \n     critical to continuing this reform.\n       We urge you: honor our international commitments and pay \n     America's debt to the United Nations. Great nations pay their \n     bills.\n           Sincerely,\n     Henry A. Kissinger.\n     Alexander M. Haig, Jr.\n     James A. Baker, III.\n     Warren M. Christopher.\n     Cyrus R. Vance.\n     George P. Shultz.\n     Lawrence S. Eagleburger.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the pending bill fails to authorize the \nAdministration's full request for funding for U.S. contributions to \ninternational organizations and for U.S. contributions to international \npeacekeeping activities. I am pleased to cosponsor the amendment \noffered by my colleague, the Senator from Maryland, because it at least \npartially rectifies this situation by bringing the authorization for \none of these two accounts up to the Administration's full request for \nFiscal year 2000.\n  The bill before us today makes significant strides in the on-going \nefforts of the Congress and the Administration to pay U.S. arrears to \nthe United Nations and achieve much-needed reforms in that \norganization. I commend both the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Helms, and the ranking Democrat, Senator Biden, for \nthis important accomplishment. Working closely together and working \nclosely with the Administration, they have reached an agreement that \nwill allow the United States to begin restoring its status as a member-\nin-good standing of the UN.\n  I believe many of my colleagues share my profound relief that, with \nthis bill, the United States will take an important step toward paying \nwhat we owe to the United Nations. For the United States to fail to \nmeet its treaty obligations as a founding member of the United Nations \nis, in my opinion, conduct unworthy of this great nation.\n  In our increasingly interconnected world, even a great nation--even \nthe sole remaining superpower--can not protect and advance its national \ninterests alone. We need not look any further than the last few weeks, \nas the United States and our NATO allies have worked to bring an end to \nthe conflict in Kosovo, to see just how important the UN is to our \nability to exert positive international leadership. For every day we \nhave allowed U.S. dues to go unpaid and U.S. arrears to mount, our \nleadership in the UN has been subtly, but surely undermined. As we take \nthe important step today of authorizing the payment of most of what we \nowe to the UN, we just as surely take a step toward reinforcing U.S. \nleadership around the world.\n  This bill does not, unfortunately, authorize payment of the full \namount the State Department says we owe the UN. Of the $1.021 billion \nwe acknowledge that we owe, this bill only authorizes payment of $819 \nmillion in direct payments and $107 million in debt forgiveness. We \nstill fall $95 million short. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on the Committee to ensure that the full amount of U.S. \narrears to the UN are paid.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Sarbanes, by ensuring the \nauthorization of full-funding for what the U.S. currently owes for \npeacekeeping is\n\n[[Page S7389]]\n\ncritical to continuing the hard-fought effort to restore U.S. standing \nin the United Nations. By cutting the level of our current \ncontributions to the UN's regular budget and peacekeeping activities as \nthis bill does, we run the risk of increasing our arrears in the very \nsame bill where we are paying them down. The amendment offered by \nSenator Sarbanes would ensure that we do not take one step forward and \ntwo steps back on paying what we owe to the United Nations. I strongly \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for his \nstatement and cooperation. I thank the chairman for working out a \ncompromise with the Senator on his amendment.\n  I must say, I would be more comfortable if I could be pure on this, \nbecause I happen to agree with the Senator from Maryland. I think we \nowe a total amount of probably $1.021. The U.N. says we owe $1.509. We \ndo not, in my view. I would be more comfortable if we could have gotten \nall of that. Quite frankly, I would be more comfortable, as a matter of \nprinciple, if there were no conditions.\n  So I began this process 6 years ago exactly where the Senator is. The \narrearages began to mount in larger numbers, really with UNPROFOR in \nBosnia. I know the Senator knows that a significant amount of what the \nUnited States ``owes'' is for peacekeeping missions. It is owed to \nFrance, the U.K., Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Canada, India, Pakistan, \nRussia, and Germany. It is not dues in the sense that we belong to a \nclub, or a country club, and you have yearly dues. This is more like at \nthe end of the year when they say we ran over X amount of dollars and \nyou assess the members beyond their dues. That is what we owe, in large \npart.\n  I know the Senator knows this, and I thank him for his acknowledgment \nof our attempt to do the best we could. But I think, as I said, on \nprinciple, we should pay our obligations in full with no conditions.\n  We should negotiate conditions from this point on, if we want to, \nbecause I think the Senator would agree with me that the U.N. is a \nbadly run outfit in terms of its management skill.\n  It has been the employer of first resort for a significant number of \ncountries, understandably. It is a bloated bureaucracy, which has been \nworked upon positively by Kofi Annan, and there has been progress made. \nBut it is not an institution that we had in mind when we signed on in \nSan Francisco. We didn't expect it to turn out to be as inefficient as \nit has, understandably.\n  It has also done an incredible amount of very good work. I believe, \nas the President said with regard to the United States, the United \nStates is the ``essential nation.'' I believe it is the essential \ninternational organization. I am committed to it.\n  But, a friend of mine, when I used to serve on the county council in \nNew Castle County, DE, a Republican named Henry Folsom came down to \nWashington--by the way, in the Reagan administration. Henry used to \nsay, God bless his soul, ``Joe, remember. Politics is the art of the \npractical.''\n  Practically speaking, my pure stand of saying ``no conditions and all \nthe money'' was rhetorically very appealing. But it didn't do a thing.\n  It was only, quite frankly, when the Senator from North Carolina--who \nhas been a critic over the years of the United Nations--decided we had \nto fix this somehow; that we ended up over a period, I would say to the \nchairman, of probably 2 years of talk, negotiating, arguing, and \ncompromising that we ended up where we are today. Where we are today is \nfour-fifths or more of the way home.\n  Still, I for one do not like the conditions that precede us paying. I \nwould rather say that these are conditions that we hope would be met, \nnotwithstanding whether or not we would pay. But we are where we are.\n  So this is a process. This is a process.\n  I have spoken with all but two of the former Secretaries of State on \nthis matter. When I put the question to them, as I did to Kofi Annan--\nAll right, do you want this or do you want nothing? --every single \nperson involved with the United Nations to whom I have posed that \nquestion said: No. No we will take this. We will take this.\n  The truth of the matter is there are choices. Our choices are this or \nnothing. All of us who are devoted to the United Nations, in terms of \nthinking it an essential body, have been unable to get a penny--a \npenny--toward these arrears. We have been noble, myself included, in \nour efforts. But we haven't gotten a penny for those ``arrears.''\n  Where we are today is with a decision. That is, is it partial, more \nthan partial, is it the bulk of the arrearages to be paid, conditioned \nupon things which this Secretary of State says--by the way, the last \npiece of this was negotiated not by the Senator from Delaware and the \nSenator from North Carolina but by the Secretary of State speaking for \nthe President of the United States and the chairman of the committee.\n  The administration has been candid. They said they are not sure they \ncan get all of it done. They think they can. They are going to fight \nfor it. But they think it is worth the fight--that it is worth the \ncandlestick.\n  We are seized with a decision that I think is going to overwhelmingly \npass, which is, do we keep these conditions that have been altered in \nlight of the passage of 2 years of time to make them more likely to be \nable to be met, coupled with the $926 million paid out, as the bill \ncalls for, much of it front-end loaded, or do we step back and say no, \nwe are not going to?\n  I know the Senator from Maryland isn't suggesting this. But the other \nalternative is to step back and say unless we get it all, no \nconditions, all the arrears, we are not going to do anything, we will \nnot be creating new arrears with this deal.\n\n  By the way, even though we are authorizing less than the \nadministration requested for contributions to international \norganizations, we are about $43 million above what is needed in the \nfirst place.\n  I understand the State Department will soon announce a $28 million \nsurplus in the fiscal year 1999 international organizations account. \nThis would be applied to reduce the amount requested for fiscal 2000.\n  Also, because of exchange rate gains, the request is $20 million too \nhigh, as of April 30. $7 million is requested for war crimes \ncommissions in Iraq and Cambodia. As much as I would like to see the \ncommissions, neither looks likely in the very near future.\n  Finally, there is $8 million in the budget request to cover exchange \nrate fluctuations, but the committee bill already contains language \nthat guards against adverse exchange rate variations. Section 801(f)(1) \nstates:\n\n       . . .there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as \n     may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2000 and 2001 \n     to offset adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange \n     rates.\n\n  I am confident we have authorized enough funds to meet our current \nobligations to international organizations. I understand the Senator's \nconcern and fear. But I do not believe when we pass this authorization \nbill, if it were appropriated as we suggest, that we are going to be \nfurther and further behind in this process.\n  It is true that we have not fully funded the administration's request \nfor arrears payments to the United Nations and other international \norganizations. We are $95 million short of our request.\n  As I have said, in an ideal world I would like to pay our arrears to \nthe United Nations in full, immediately, and without condition. But I \nhave made a judgment, and I believe the correct one, a pragmatic \njudgment, because I know that such a proposal has no chance of \npassing--``no conditions, all the money.''\n  In the last Congress, I asked the administration to give me a bottom \nline figure for arrears to the United Nations with which they could \nlive. The administration responded with a memorandum to me which stated \nthey were willing not to pay $68 million in arrears to UNIDO, an \norganization that we withdrew our membership from earlier in this \ndecade.\n  Their judgment is that a total of $68 million in arrears is owed to \nan organization in which we are not a member, and to which we have no \nintention of paying membership dues.\n  They also told me they would apply an expected refund of $27 million \nfrom the U.N. to reduce our arrears. Unfortunately, that $27 million \nwas used to\n\n[[Page S7390]]\n\nreduce the fiscal year 1998 contributions because our bill got stalled \nin the House. Otherwise, we would have been in pretty good shape.\n  For those who are wondering how we came up with $926 million, if we \nadded $68 million to the $27 million and subtract that from the total \nof $1.021 billion we owed, then we would arrive at our figure.\n  What we did was essentially pay the entirety of the arrearages that \nwe thought were owed absent the $68 million they said they didn't want \nto pay to an organization we weren't a member of, and not contemplating \nthe fact they have to use the $27 million because this bill got slowed \nup. It is true that $27 million U.N. refund has already been used and, \nthus, is not available for arrears. But I would note that this sum can \nbe easily subtracted from arrears owed to the specialized U.N. \nagencies. Even with the $926 million provided in our plan, many of the \nspecialized agencies will have to create or expand programs to absorb \nthe arrears payments they are going to receive.\n  It sounds a bit counterintuitive that a plan which is supposed to \ncontrol the size of the U.N. could actually end up expanding it \ntemporarily. That will be the short-term effect for many of the \nspecialized agencies, if they decide to devise ways to spend the extra \nmoney that is going to be flowing in.\n  Again, I personally would like to fully fund the administration \nrequest. I think I have outlined a solid political and substantive \nrationalization for providing the lower figure.\n  Finally, I emphasize again that there is $8 million in the budget \nrequest to cover exchange rate fluctuations. The committee bill, as I \nsaid, already contains language to guard against an adverse exchange \nrate. It is section 801(F)1. It states:\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary in each fiscal year 2000 and 2001 to offset the \n     adverse fluctuations of foreign exchange currency rates.\n\n  I still agree with my friend from Maryland. That is, I believe the \nreal hangup is the conditions. The truth of the matter is, we have \nbasically paid all the arrears that we owe, that we say we owe. If you \naccept the administration's position that the $68 million owed to an \norganization we have been fighting with for 10 years, and we have been \nout of it for 3 or 4 years, that if we do not pay the $68 million \nowed--and had we not had the House stall with what Senator Helms and I \nput together 2 years ago, we would be at the $1.021 billion. Again, it \nwould be better if even that were done. I am not arguing that.\n  I almost hesitate to make the point, to be honest with my friend from \nMaryland, this is a fragile coalition we put together. I am not sure we \nwould get all the Republican votes we need if we thought we were paying \neverything we owed. I don't want to go around making a big deal of the \nfact we are paying everything we think we owe, short of those two \naccounts, to be very blunt. I guess I shouldn't be so blunt. That is \nthe truth of the matter, from my perspective, politically.\n  We have done a heck of a job. I don't know whether to praise my \nfriend or not, because my praise on this issue is probably not very \nhelpful to him, so I won't. But let me say there has been a very good-\nfaith effort on the part of my friend from North Carolina. This is not \nnearly as draconian as it sounds.\n  Again, the single most significant thing my friend from North \nCarolina extracted in return for essentially paying off our arrears \nwere the conditions that exist. The essence of the deal is, we \nbasically paid all the arrears we say we owe, if this becomes law, if \nthis is appropriated, in return for conditions to do things I don't \ndisagree with my friend on, but I don't think we should have done it \nthe way we did. I think we should have said, pay the arrears, and, by \nthe way, from this point on, we are not going to unless these \nconditions persist.\n  However, politics is the art of compromise. The Senator from North \nCarolina has made a significant compromise here to get us to this \npoint. Because of his standing on his side of the aisle and, quite \nfrankly, his standing nationally, as one who is not about to be viewed \nas easily taken over by the U.N., I think the mere fact that he has \ndone this adds a credibility to the process that exceeds by far and \naway the dollar value that would have been accomplished, had we gotten \nanother $95 million or thereabouts in the account.\n  This is only the beginning of the fight. The Senator put his \ncredibility on the line to get this done one time before. The House \nconcluded that for reasons I will not take the time to go into now, \nthat it would not do this.\n  The House committee, our comparable committee, has been good on this \nissue. But it is a different thing when it gets to the House floor. \nAlthough we are technically halfway there, if we pass this bill today, \nthe truth of the matter is, we are probably only about 30 percent of \nthe way there because there are other hurdles on the House side we have \nto overcome.\n  I truly appreciate the views of the Senator from Maryland, with whom \nI agree 100 percent. I also truly appreciate the statesmanship of my \nfriend from North Carolina who has brought us to this point. Without \nhim, quite frankly, this couldn't be done. That old expression we have \noverused, ``Only Nixon can go to China,'' only Helms could take us this \nfar.\n  That is literally true. That is not an exaggeration. I thank him for \nthat.\n  Hopefully, this is the beginning of a process that puts us in good \nstead, strengthens the United Nations, and makes it a more viable and \ntightly run organization.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, listening to my dear friend from Delaware, \nJoe Biden, I harken back to the days when there was very little working \nrelationship between the two parties on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. Today, I think the working relationship is very good. That \nis due to the efforts of Senator Biden and his desire to make things \nwork.\n  Let me be candid. I am not in the mood to give away the store, and I \nhaven't given it away regarding the United Nations yet. It remains to \nbe seen whether the reforms both of us have been demanding will be in \nplace early enough for this proposition, which I will discuss in just a \nminute, to take place. We will see.\n  I can't tell the Senate how many times my best friend--next to Dot \nHelms--Admiral Nance and I have talked about this very issue. Bud Nance \nis gone now, but I remember his counsel on this bill.\n  This measure is important to me because it bears the name of the \nAdmiral James Wilson ``Bud'' Nance State Department Authorization bill. \nBud is gone; he is at the Arlington National Cemetery, after a \ndistinguished career. I miss him.\n  However, both Senator Biden and I are blessed with excellent staffs. \nI thank staff on both sides. For the minority, the Democrats, I \nespecially thank the inimitable Ed Hall, Brian McKeon, Runeet Talwar, \nDiana Ohlbaum, Janice O'Connell, and Joan Woodward.\n  I am especially grateful to the Senate's legislative counsel, Art \nRynearson, and, of course, the best part for me, the majority staff of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The staff was put together by \nAdmiral Nance and me, but he became the chief of staff of the Foreign \nRelations Committee. Steve Biegun has succeeded Bud Nance. He has been \nvery artful in his contribution to this measure. Patti McNerney, \nGarrett Grigsby, Marshall Billingslea, Michael Westphal, Beth Stewart, \nRoger Noriega--this Noriega was born in Kansas, by the way--Kirsten \nMadison, Marc Thiessen, Sherry Grandjean, Dany Pletka, who has just \ngiven birth to her second little girl--Richard Fontaine, Jim Doran, \nNatasha Watson, Christa Muratore, Laura Parker, Christa Bailey, Andrew \nAnderson and Susan Oursler. All of these young people on both sides \nhave made a mighty contribution not only to the composition of the bill \nbut the fact we were able to compose it at all.\n  We are working together now. I want to say to my friend, Senator \nBiden, I appreciate his friendship and his cooperation. I extend my \ncongratulations to him.\n  Now then, this bill addresses several significant oversight and \nauthorization issues that ought to be at least mentioned before we go \nto a vote.\n  No. 1, it proposes to strengthen and preserve the arms control \nverification functions of the U.S. Government while\n\n[[Page S7391]]\n\naddressing other nonproliferation matters as well.\n  No. 2, the bill authorizes a 5-year construction blueprint for \nupgrading U.S. embassies around the world to provide secure \nenvironments for America's personnel overseas. Unlike the funds \nprovided more than a decade ago in the wake of a report by Admiral \nInman calling for improved security of U.S. embassies, this bill would \ncreate a firewall for funding of other State Department expenditures. \nThis, of course, would ensure that embassy funds are not raided again \nto pay for other State Department pet projects. I am just not going to \nstand for it, and this bill makes that very clear.\n  This bill makes some reforms to strengthen the Foreign Service and \nsignificantly, as Senator Biden has discussed at some length, the bill \nincludes the United Nations reform package. This is not something we \nare going to lay on the table and say we are going to do someday. It is \ngoing to be done now. The United Nations is going to be reformed now or \nthere is going to be trouble ahead. The reform agenda required by this \nbill, prior to payment of any U.S. taxpayers' dollars, has the full \nsupport of the Secretary of State and Senator Biden and me. These \nreforms were approved by the Senate during the 105th Congress by a vote \nof 90 to 5, with 5 Senators absent. But, of course, those reforms were \nvetoed by the President of the United States.\n  In conclusion, I want to pay my respects to all who have participated \nin the building of this legislation, those with whom I have disagreed \nas well as those with whom I have agreed. All in all, I think it is a \nvery fine bill and I am glad to have had a very small part in it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we are going to debate H.R. 975. I ask \nunanimous consent I be allowed to perhaps speak for 5 minutes on this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think I will come back to the floor, \nand depending on how many Senators are out here, I will speak more on \nthis. But in this short period of time I want to try to deal with some \nof the arguments on this very important cloture vote on H.R. 975. There \nare three arguments I want to address in 4 or 5 minutes.\n  The first argument is that the steel crisis is over. That is what I \nhear from the White House. I say to my colleagues, I spent the weekend \non the Iron Range in northeastern Minnesota, both in Duluth and on the \nIron Range in Minnesota. If you were to speak to some of the 108 \nworkers who have been laid off at EVTAC Mining, or talked to the \nworkers at Minntac who had to make all sorts of concessions last fall \nto avoid layoffs, or if you were to talk to workers at LTV in Hoyt \nLakes, you would find quite another reality. I think it would be hard \nfor the administration or any Senator, Republican or Democrat, to go to \nthe Iron Range in Minnesota, where we produce the iron ore for our \nsteel, and tell these workers or their families that this crisis is \nover. This crisis is far from over.\n  To go to the flip side of the coin, but it is the same coin, I ask \nunanimous consent a letter dated June 18 from the CEOs of the major \nsteel companies to Secretary Daley be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Hon. William M. Daley,\n     Secretary of Commerce, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: We regret that your schedule required \n     the cancellation of our meeting with you today. There are \n     issues that are vital to our industry and to the Department's \n     mission in trade law enforcement that require us to meet \n     together as soon as you can do so.\n       We feel compelled, however, since we could not meet with \n     you today, to convey to you immediately our emphatic \n     disagreement with the comment attributed to you in this \n     morning's Washington Post that ``the steel crisis is over''.\n       The steel crisis is still very much with us. Imports \n     volumes are down from the disastrous levels of 1998 but are \n     still very high by historic standards. While imports of hot-\n     rolled steel are down dramatically due to your enforcement \n     actions, the surge of imports in 1998 caused inventories to \n     balloon to extremely high levels. These inventories have \n     seriously depressed prices up until the present and will \n     continue to do so until these stocks have been worked down. \n     Moreover, cold-rolled imports are up dramatically through \n     April of this year, 24% above the level of the first four \n     months of last year. Imports of cut-to-length plate are up \n     dramatically--25% year-to-year for this period. (If full year \n     1999 imports decline, it will only be because of the \n     Department's prosecution of the cases against unfair trade \n     that our companies recently filed.)\n       Prices remain extremely depressed. The producer price index \n     for all steel mill products is down 9% (1999:Q2/1998/Q2). \n     This is the largest decline in nearly 20 years. Prices for \n     hot-rolled sheet, cold-rolled sheet and plate are down 11%, \n     9%, and 15%, respectively.\n       Operating rates have plunged from 93% to 80% between \n     January and December 1998 and have remained at the depressed \n     level through the first half of 1999. The decline in \n     operating rates equates to about $2 billion in lost revenue \n     in the second half of last year. On an annualized basis, a \n     10% change in operating rate equals about $5 billion in \n     revenue. (Please see the attached charts addressing the facts \n     set out above.)\n       The depressed prices and operating rates caused most \n     American steel companies to post losses in the most recent \n     quarter. Several steel companies have seen forced into \n     bankruptcy. Thousands of those who were laid off due to \n     unfairly traded imports are still out of work. Many thousands \n     have seen their workweeks shortened and are still not back to \n     full time.\n       For our industry, therefore, this crisis is far from over. \n     It is very real, and very much with us.\n       We look forward to meeting with you soon. Your role in \n     overseeing the Department's vigorous enforcement of the trade \n     laws last fall was vital in preventing what is a continuing \n     crisis from turning into an irreversible disaster. Your \n     prompt action taken in initiating and prosecuting cases \n     against dumping of hot-rolled steel from Japan, Russia and \n     Brazil was essential to curtail the surge in these unfairly \n     traded imports. The personal attention and energy which you \n     have devoted to enforcing U.S. trade laws at the height of \n     the import surge is deeply appreciated by all of us.\n       The Department is proceeding now to investigate other steel \n     cases in cut-to-length plate and is due to make public its \n     initiation decisions on the cold-rolled steel cases on \n     Tuesday. These actions and decisions are vital to the future \n     of the American steel industry.\n           Very truly yours,\n         Hank Barnette, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, \n           Bethlehem Steel Corporation; James DeClusin, Senior \n           Executive Vice President, California Steel Industries; \n           Don Daily, Vice President & General Manager, Gallatin \n           Steel; Joseph Cannon, Chief Executive Officer & \n           Chairman, Geneva Steel; Robert Schaal, Chairman and \n           Chief Executive Officer, Gulf States Steel, Inc.; Roger \n           Phillips, President and Chief Executive Officer, IPSCO \n           Inc.; Dale E.

Mr. President, they make it clear the crisis is far \nfrom over as well.\n  The global conditions at the root of the crisis have not gone away. \nImports from the major foreign producers have declined, but other \ncountries have taken their place and we see major producers shifting to \ndifferent steel products to get around the dumping orders. We need this \nRockefeller bill to plug the loopholes.\n  Dumping cases take time. In many cases the relief is too little too \nlate, or it gets negotiated away in suspension agreements. I am afraid \nsomeday we are going to wake up and we are not going to have any steel \nindustry at all.\n  In my State of Minnesota we were a part of what happened in the \n1980s, when we lost 350,000 steelworker jobs and 28,000 people left the \nIron Range for good. As a Senator, I do not want to let that happen \nagain.\n  The second argument that is made by the administration is that we \ncannot go forward with this bill because this is quota relief, and the \nquestion is whether or not quota relief is WTO-legal.\n  I see here a bit of a double standard. When Mr. Carl Lindner from \nChiquita\n\n[[Page S7392]]\n\nBananas had a trade complaint, the administration did not hesitate to \nslap a 100-percent tariff on imports from Europe. But when our workers \nand working families ask for some relief under Section 201, which \nprovides for quotas and is WTO-legal, then all of a sudden there is no \nrelief forthcoming.\n  Finally, I make a point that this crisis is not the fault of \nsteelworkers. They should not be the ones asked to pay the price. I am \nin complete agreement that we ought to care fiercely about what happens \nin Russia, Mexico, Thailand, Indonesia, Korea, and other countries as \nwell, but again I see another double standard. When our financial \ninterests, when a lot of our Wall Street interests, if you will, wanted \nto be able to invest capital in these countries and take capital out at \na second's notice, when they wanted to put hot capital in and take hot \ncapital out without any regulatory framework in place, they were \npleased to do so as long as they were making huge profits. Then when \nthey decided to pull their capital out, these countries were left in \nterrible trouble. When it came to whether or not there would be IMF \nbailouts and whether or not there would be any kind of public dollars \nto help these financial interests out, again we had an administration \nthat was all for these Wall Street interests.\n  I come to the floor of the Senate today to say this administration \nought to really put working families--steelworkers of the Iron Range, \nsteelworkers all across the country--as high on its list of priorities \nas Wall Street investors. And not just those steelworkers but the \ncommunities where they work and the communities where they live.\n  This bill, H.R. 975, is a good place to start. I thank Senator \nRockefeller for his leadership. I am proud to be out here on the floor \nspeaking on this legislation. I hope we not only get votes for cloture, \nbut we get more than enough votes to override any Presidential veto. \nThis is a critically important vote that is going to take place within \nthe next hour.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7392-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7392-S7393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    FOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEARS 2000 AND 2001\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

I suggest the Senator start, and if no one is here to \nspeak on the steel bill, while he is still speaking, we might be able \nto ask consent for him to continue. Otherwise, he can pick up \nafterward.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That makes sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member, \nthe managers of the bill, for including the amendment I had offered in \nthe managers' packet. I thank Senators Wellstone, Kohl, Lautenberg, \nKennedy, Dodd, Torricelli, Wyden, and Feingold for cosponsoring this \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution regarding the recent adoption in Geneva \nby the International Labor Organization of the Convention on the Worst \nForms of Child Labor.\n  June 17, 1999 marked a historic event in the battle to end the \nscourge of abusive and exploitative child labor. By a unanimous vote, \nthe International Labor Organization's member states approved a new \nConvention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor.\n  For the first time in history, the world spoke with one voice in \nopposition to abusive and exploitative child labor. Countries from \nacross the political, economic, and religious spectrum--from Jewish to \nMuslim, from Buddhists to Christians--came together to proclaim \nunequivocally that ``abusive and exploitative child labor is a practice \nwhich will not be tolerated and must be abolished.''\n  Gone is the argument that abusive and exploitative child labor is an \nacceptable practice because of a country's economic circumstance. Gone \nis the argument that abusive and exploitative child labor is acceptable \nbecause of cultural traditions. And gone is the argument that abusive \nand exploitative child labor is a necessary evil on the road to \neconomic development. The United States and the international community \nas a whole unanimously for the first time laid those arguments to rest \nand laid the groundwork to begin the process of ending the scourge of \nabusive and exploitative child labor.\n  Mr. President, for the better part of a decade, I have been in my own \ncapacity working to do what I can to end abusive and exploitative child \nlabor around the globe, including in the United States. The ILO \nestimates that there are about 250 million children worldwide, many as \nyoung as 6 or 7, who are working, economically active. These are not \njust part-time jobs. Many of them work in dangerous environments which \nare detrimental to their emotional, physical, and moral well-being.\n  Just last year, I traveled to Pakistan, India, Nepal, and Bangladesh \nwhere I witnessed the travesty of abusive and exploitative child labor \nfirsthand.\n  This chart is a picture I took myself. This is in a small plant, a \nfactory, to use the term loosely, hidden away on the outskirts of \nKatmandu. I was there on a Sunday, and Sunday evening I was accompanied \nby a young man who is a former child laborer. He took me to this place \non the outskirts of the city where, because of friends working there \nwho said the owner was gone and he knew the guard at the gate, we got \nin surreptitiously. In fact, the sign on the outside of the gate said \nno one under the age of 14 was permitted to work there. It was a big \nsign in both English and in Nepalese.\n\n  Once we got in, we saw kids as young as 6 and 7. This is just one of \nthe many pictures I took depicting these kids working full time, and \nthis was in the evening. This was probably about 7 or 8 o'clock in the \nevening on a Sunday.\n  In India, I met children who were liberated from hand-knotted carpet \nfactories where they were chained--chained, Mr. President--to looms and \nforced to work as many as 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. These children \nwere nothing more than slaves. They earned no money. They received no \neducation. They had no hope for a future until they were freed by the \nSouth Asian Coalition Against Child Servitude, headed by Kailash \nSatyarthi. I can tell you that I myself have only glimpsed into the \ndark world of exploitative child labor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has----\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, how much time does he \nneed?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I need probably 10, 15 minutes. I do not know if my \ncolleagues are here to speak under the previous order. I will have to \ncome back.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will ask that the Senator be able to \nproceed after we vote on the cloture motion to proceed to the steel \nbill during the party caucus recess.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I understand, there will be 40 minutes of debate and \nthen we will have a vote?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Are we going to come back to this bill right after that \nvote?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes. What we do not want to do is hold up the Holbrooke \nhearing. We will ask unanimous consent that Senator Dodd have 15 \nminutes and that the Senator from Iowa have possibly another 10, 15 \nminutes during the period of the party caucuses in order to meet the \ndeadline of the Holbrooke hearing at 2:30 p.m., which we have been \nfighting to get for a year and a half. That is the objective.\n  Obviously, the regular order is to move to steel. Unless my steel \ncolleagues are willing to yield the Senator\n\n[[Page S7393]]\n\nfrom Iowa 15 minutes now, which he can request, I know of no other \nalternative. The Senator might ask.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If my colleagues are not going to speak on the steel \nbill, then I will add the time to continue my remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7393-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7393-S7406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REDUCTION IN VOLUME STEEL IMPORTS--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the cloture \nmotion on the motion to proceed to the issue of steel quotas.\n  Senator Rockefeller, who is my counterpart on the Democratic side \nleading this debate, and I are not people who have come to the floor of \nthe Senate in favor of quotas. In fact, we think we are driven to this \npoint as people who believe in free and fair trade, to ask the Senate \nto consider imposing quotas on the dumping of steel in this country by \nforeign nations.\n  It is remarkable what has occurred. It is unprecedented what has \noccurred in the steel industry over the past 2\\1/2\\ years. We have seen \nthe level of steel rise, as far as imports into this country, two, \nthree, four, five times the amount from some countries in the past 2\\1/\n2\\ years--and it continues.\n  One of the mantras I hear from the administration, which is lobbying \nagainst this bill, is that the crisis is over. I can say that in the \ncase of China, for example, the world's largest producer, just in the \nfirst 4 months of this year their dumping was up 80 percent--their \nimports were up 80 percent.\n  So if the crisis is over, why then was the largest steel manufacturer \ndumping more steel into our market in the first 4 months of this year?\n  We have a continuing problem. What Senator Rockefeller and I, and \nothers who have joined us in this cause, are suggesting is something, \nfrankly, that is very modest. We are suggesting a quota for 3 years to \nstop this outrageous and, I might add, illegal dumping.\n  We have won or are winning every single dumping case in the \ninternational arena. Every single case we are winning because of the \nillegality of what is being done by our foreign competitors in the \nsteel industry.\n  What we are asking is not to go to a low rate of imports; what we are \nasking is to go to a rate of import into this country, a share of \nimports in the domestic market equal to a level that has only been \nreached four times in the past 30 years. So arguably we are setting the \nbar very high.\n  We are not going in to protect an industry that is inefficient or \nthat is uncompetitive. The steel industry today is the most productive, \ncompetitive, and efficient steel industry in the world. Yet they are \nbeing wiped out by subsidized, illegally dumped steel, costing us \nthousands of good-paying jobs and thousands of families not going home \nwith paychecks to support their children.\n  I am very hopeful that we can get a bipartisan vote today to at least \nmove to proceed to the bill. That is all this vote does. It says let's \nput this issue front and center in the Senate, let's point out to our \ncompetitors around the globe that the Senate is not going to step aside \nand allow this illegal dumping to continue, that we are going to debate \nit, that we take this issue very seriously, and that we are not going \nto allow this kind of illegal action to continue.\n  I know my 3 minutes are up. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nH.R. 975 and to urge my colleagues, in the strongest terms possible, to \nvote no on cloture. Let me explain why.\n  Our steel industry faces a serious challenge as a result of foreign \ncompetition. That challenge stems from the persistent overcapacity in \nthe global steel industry that is the legacy of decades of foreign \ngovernment interventionism.\n  The quota bill, however, does nothing to eliminate this overcapacity. \nWhat the quota bill does do is simply lock in a certain share of our \nmarket--the quota amount--for foreign imports at a vastly inflated \nprice.\n  According to a study by the Institute for International Economics, \nthis bill would raise steel import prices by about $29 a ton. This \nrepresents a windfall of $800 million to the lucky foreign producers \nwho get their goods into the United States under the quota, with the \nprice tag being paid by the American people.\n  While the bill does enrich certain foreign producers, it also poses a \ngrave threat to our economy. For every 1 job in the steel industry, \nthere are 40 jobs in the steel-using industries. These 40 workers \nmanufacture autos, industrial machinery, kitchen appliances, and other \nproducts. All these jobs will be at risk as a result of the quota bill, \nbecause this legislation seeks arbitrary limits on the amount of steel \ncoming\n\n[[Page S7394]]\n\ninto our country. And the quotas apply regardless of domestic demand \nand regardless of whether the type of steel is even produced in the \nUnited States.\n  To make matters worse, this measure would actually help foreign \ncompanies that compete against American steel-using industries both in \nthe United States and abroad. For instance, U.S. automakers would be \nforced to pay higher prices for steel than their foreign competitors. \nThis would disadvantage American companies in our market and in the \nforeign markets in which they compete. The impact on jobs and on the \neconomy could be severe.\n  This bill would also put us at risk of retaliation by our trading \npartners. Our farmers are well aware of this risk. That is why 21 \nleading agriculture groups signed a letter last week stating their \nstrong opposition to this legislation. These include the American Farm \nBureau Federation, the National Council of Farm Cooperatives, the \nNational Association of Wheat Growers, the National Cattlemen's Beef \nAssociation, and others. As these groups understand all too well, \npassage of this legislation will threaten our access to foreign markets \nat a time when these markets are most needed for our businesses and our \nfarmers.\n  If we decide to go down the path of quotas, we must also keep in mind \nthat the price will ultimately be paid by the American consumer.\n  I yield myself 1 more minute.\n  By raising the average price of products made with steel, the quota \nconstitutes an artificial tax on ordinary Americans regardless of \nwealth or income. Keep in mind that the tax will not be insignificant. \nAccording to the Institute of International Economics study, the bill \nwill, at most, save 1,700 jobs in the steel industry but will do so at \na cost to the economy of about $800,000 a job. For us to put such a \nburden on the American people is unconscionable.\n  With that said, let us not forget that the import surge the quotas \nare designed to address appears to be over. In fact, imports of all \nsteel products for the first 4 months of this year were below the \nimports for the same period in 1997, well before the surge began.\n  I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Let me address one last point.\n  For some of my colleagues, this may be seen as a free vote. I, like \nmany, hope the President will have the courage to veto this legislation \nif it does pass. But we have to remember that the American people sent \nus to Congress to further their national interests. Let's not \ndisappoint them.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \njunior Senator from West Virginia, who has been a tremendous leader on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, who equally \nhas been a distinguished leader on this issue.\n  Mr. President, the previous speaker, my esteemed chairman of the \nFinance Committee, talked about voting on a quota bill. We are not \nvoting on a quota bill today. We are voting on a motion to proceed. \nThis whole steel situation is very complex. Most States do not produce \nsteel, and a lot of people do not know about some of the complexities.\n  We deserve debate on this. Traditionally, in the Senate we do that. \nThat is what we are here for, to iron out issues in a rational way.\n  The steel crisis is not over. It is not over at all. You talk to any \nsteel CEO. They know it is not over. I will just give one statistic. \nThat is all I will give.\n  If you take the first 4 months of 1999, which brings us almost up to \ntoday, versus the first 4 months of 1998, which was the worst of the \nsteel crisis, yes, the steel import crisis has abated a little bit, but \nonly 5 percent from the all-time historic high in the dumping of \nsubsidized steel. It has decreased by a total of 5 percent across the \nsteel front.\n\n  So the crisis remains with us. It is a very serious matter. It \ndisrupts and undoes communities, sections of States across this \ncountry, not just West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Utah, but the rest \nof them. I do not think we have done what we could have done to enforce \nour trade laws. They are very clear. The administration has not done \nwhat it could have done. But that day is past. So we have to do what we \nhave to do, and that brings us to the quota bill. This is not the bill \nitself; this is the motion to proceed to discuss what we are going to \ndo as a result of that vote.\n  I think we have a moral obligation to our steelworkers and to \nourselves to honorably and fairly discuss something that is very \ncomplex and which needs our very closest attention.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with a measure of respect for all \nthe parties to this question before us but with one absolute \nconviction, which is that what is proposed with this legislation, what \nhas passed the House of Representatives, is illegal under international \nlaw. That, sir, is a law we created as the one party that emerged from \nWorld War II with its economy intact and the lesson of the \nprotectionism that began on this floor, sir, in 1930 with the Smoot-\nHawley Tariff Act. It spread throughout the world. If you want a short \nlist of the causes of the Second World War, that was one. The American \nleaders, during the 1930s, with Cordell Hull, began the trade \nagreements program; and then we had hoped to have an international \ntrade organization as part of a triad with the International Monetary \nFund and the World Bank. Again, it failed in the Finance Committee. But \nin Geneva, a temporary ad hoc arrangement was put together, the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade; it was temporary for about 45 years. \nBut we acquired great respect for the rules, and 51 years ago, sir, \narticle 11 of the General Agreement stated:\n\n       No prohibitions or restrictions, other than duties or other \n     charges, can be made through import quotas, export licenses, \n     or other measures. None shall be instituted or maintained by \n     any contracting party on the importation of any product.\n\n  Now, sir, if we were to do this, there would be immediate \nretaliation. And it would be illegal. It is uncalled for. The law says \nyou may not do what is being proposed, and other parties, as former \nSenator Baker would say, ``having no dog in this fight,'' would find \nthemselves retaliated against, as would the agricultural industry. I \nplead, let's abide by the laws we helped to create.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield to the senior Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania. I am \none of the original cosponsors of the quota bill. I urge my colleagues \nto support cloture. I compliment my very able colleague, Jay \nRockefeller, for his diligent work on this matter. I also compliment \nMr. Santorum, our colleague from Pennsylvania, for his equally good \nwork.\n  The quota bill is a critical measure in addressing the steel import \ncrisis that is confronting U.S. steel mills, and I am mystified by \nstatements suggesting that the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Bill is a \ncompeting interest against the quota bill.\n  I am here to set the record straight.\n  As a result of global financial chaos, in 1998, a record level of 40 \nmillion tons of cheap and illegally dumped imported steel flooded the \nU.S. market. That represents an 83 percent increase over the 23 million \ntons average for the previous eight years! The result has been the loss \nof 10,000 steel jobs, and the bankruptcy of several U.S. steel mills.\n  While both bills are before the Senate because of the steel import \ncrisis--one has been passed and the conferees thereon were appointed \nyesterday--the quota bill and the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Bill \nserve vastly different purposes, and both deserve support from every \nmember in the Senate.\n  The quota bill is a long-term solution to the steel import crisis. \nThe quota\n\n[[Page S7395]]\n\nbill would cap steel imports at a level that equals the average amount \nof steel that came into U.S. markets in 1995, 1996, and the first half \nof 1997. The measure would take effect immediately and prohibit any \ncountry from sending more steel to the United States than it did in \nJuly of 1997. The quotas would terminate in three years. The President \ncould achieve these import limits by imposing quotas, tariff \nsurcharges, negotiated enforceable voluntary export restraint \nagreements, or other means.\n  The Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program which passed the Senate \nlast week is a helping hand to U.S. steel mills that have been injured \nby the cheap and illegal imports. It is a short-term assistance program \nto aid U.S. steel mills during their hour of need. It does not address \nthe underlying critical problem of both cheap and illegally dumped \nimported steel that continues to adversely impact U.S. steel mills. \nWhile essential to aiding thousands of hardworking Americans, the steel \nloan guarantee program is no substitute, nor was it intended to be, for \nthe long-term solution that is offered by the quota bill.\n  The House of Representatives passed the quota bill by a vote of 289 \nyeas to 141 nays. Now it is the Senate's turn to send a vigorous \nmessage to our trading partners that this nation will not idly sit by \nwhile another American industry is shipped abroad.\n  Last week, I strongly urged my colleagues to support the Emergency \nSteel Loan Guarantee Program. It is a fair and important measure for \nthe U.S. steel industry and thousands of hardworking Americans. Let \nthere be no mistake: members can not hide behind one vote and claim to \nhave solved the crisis in our domestic steel industry. The Senate must \nact to help the U.S. steel industry on a long-term basis as well. This \nSenate acted wisely in passing the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee \nProgram. It provides a cash flow for financially damaged steel \ncompanies and it will enable them to invest in further modernization. \nIt will save jobs that are at risk from illegal imports. Likewise, this \nSenate should ensure that the need for the loan guarantee program is \nminimized by casting a vote that will stop the illegal dumping of \nforeign steel. The quota bill will stop the cheating and finally \nprovide U.S. steel mills with an international playing field that is \nfair.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, \nfor his courtesy and kindness. I thank my colleague from West Virginia, \nMr. Rockefeller, for his leadership in this matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are about to vote on a very major and \nvery dangerous revision of U.S. trade policy, and we are going to do it \nwithout the benefit of a hearing and, quite frankly, we are doing it \nunder great political pressure. That is not a very good environment.\n  If we give in to pressure to enact quota legislation, we will do \ngreat harm. I believe the proponents are all acting, of course, with \nthe best of intentions. Yet we must not allow our desire to help a \ntroubled industry in the short term do long-term damage to our economy.\n  Sixty-nine years ago, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, \nand they did it with the best of good intentions. Its aim was to help \nthe American farmer, with a limited upward revision of tariffs on \nforeign produce. But it had the opposite effect. It strangled foreign \ntrade. It deepened and widened the severity of the Great Depression.\n\n  Other countries faced with deficits and exports had to pay for their \nimports, and they responded by applying quotas and embargoes on \nAmerican goods.\n  I think the history of the depth and the severity of the retaliation \nagainst U.S. agricultural products from that period is shocking, \nbecause our foreign buyers stopped buying our agricultural products in \nretaliation.\n  In 1930, the United States exported just over $1 billion worth of \nagricultural goods. By 1932 that amount had been cut in half. Almost \nevery American export sector was hit by foreign retaliation but \nparticularly agriculture.\n  As the United States agricultural exports fell in the face of foreign \nretaliation, farm prices fell sharply, weakening the solvency of our \nrural banks. Their weakened condition undermined deposit confidence \nleading to the runs on the banks and bank failures, and ultimately the \ncontraction of money supply.\n  Farm prices for many agricultural products are already at rock bottom \nlevels. Can we in good conscience put so much of our economy at risk \nwith this legislation?\n  In 1998, the United States exported agricultural products worth $53 \nbillion, accounting for one-third of America's total agricultural \nproducts, and nearly 1 million jobs. Agriculture is perhaps the most \nvulnerable sector of our economy to foreign retaliation, and our \ntrading partners know it.\n  Retaliation is not a thing of the past. It is a hardball tactic that \nis frequently used as an instrument of national policy. Just look at \nthe recent history. Japan threatened to retaliate when we took some \naction against them. In 1983, China temporarily stopped buying U.S. \nwheat in retaliation of another President's protectionist policies.\n  We have to learn from the past, and we have to say if it is bad for \nagriculture, it is bad for America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania.\n  I would like to address a question to the chairman of the committee \nto see if he would be willing to consider this question. It has to do \nwith a bill which the good Senator from Delaware introduced to modify \nsection 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 in order to strengthen the utility \nof that section.\n  I am wondering whether or not on this bill, which was ordered \nreported, I understand, by the Finance Committee last Wednesday--it is \nthe chairman's intention to press for Senate consideration.\n  Mr. ROTH. I say to my distinguished colleague that is my intent. We \nthink it is a valuable change. We hope to have it on the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I say that the Senator from New York offered that \nlegislation, and it was welcomed by the chairman. It is a bipartisan \nmeasure.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, imposing quotas on the importation of \nforeign steel to protect some U.S. steel producers will have several \nnegative effects on the domestic and world economy.\n  The best way to combat illegal trade practices is to adopt trade laws \nthat are compatible with World Trade Organization rules. We already \nhave in place section 201, dealing with temporary import surges and \nsection 301, regarding anti-dumping. They have both proven effective in \nrecent months in altering the steel trade balance.\n  Steel imports are already subject to over 100 outstanding antidumping \nand countervailing duty orders. Congress should not judge the outcome \nof these investigations by imposing quotas on top of existing trade \nrules. Maintaining consistency in our trade policy is of utmost \nimportance, given that the U.S. is the world's largest trading country. \nFurthermore, The United States will host the WTO ministerial meeting in \nSeattle later this year. The success of these ongoing international \ntrade talks depends on our credibility and compliance with those rules.\n  We must recognize that imposing on steel imports may affect other \nimportant U.S. industries as well. In Mississippi there are wire \nproducers, shipbuilders and manufacturers who provide thousands of jobs \nand whose products contribute to our strong U.S. economy. And, when \nretaliations occur as a result of our implementation of quotas, they \nwill undoubtedly affect other sectors of our economy, including \nagriculture.\n  In Mississippi alone agriculture exports of cotton, soybeans, \npoultry, rice and meat account for $850 million and 13,900 jobs \naccording to the USDA and Census Bureau. The American Farm Bureau \nreports that exports constitute more than one-third of all U.S. \nagricultural sales. More than 1 million Americans today have jobs \ndependent on U.S.\n\n[[Page S7396]]\n\nagricultural exports, including farming, food processing and \ntransportation.\n  The Coalition to Promote U.S. Agricultural Exports reports that every \none billion dollars in exports helps create as many as 17,000 new jobs. \nIn light of the market crises abroad in Asia, Russia, and the New \nIndependent States of the former Soviet Union, it is more important \nthan ever to assist the agricultural community by maintaining its \naccess to the world's markets. This is the key to economic recovery of \nthe farm sector.\n  U.S. agricultural and manufacturing exports totaled more than $680 \nbillion last year. If Congress imposes quotas inconsistent with WTO \nrules, all U.S. industries may be targets for retaliation, putting at \nrisk the revenues and jobs these industries and their exports produce. \nIt is these very WTO agreements which enable our trading partners to \nretaliate against our exports.\n  This legislation's protection for the specialized steel industry will \nlead to protectionism. For the good of all U.S. industries--as well as \nagriculture--open markets, free, and fair trade, and a rules-based \ninternational trading system ought to be the principles on which we \nbase our trade laws.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition \nto the steel quota bill, H.R. 975. Simply put, steel quotas are wrong. \nThe protectionist measures proposed in this legislation represent a \nfailed trade policy that the United States abandoned long ago. For the \nlast 50 years, the United States has been the world's leading advocate \nof open markets. At the same time, we have grown to be the strongest \nand most productive economy on earth. Now is not the time for this \ngovernment to reverse an economic policy that has served it so well.\n  Steel quotas are wrong for the world's economy, and by definition \nAmerica's economy. In this era of global business, open markets are \nessential to international prosperity. In the midst of the Asian \neconomic crisis, American leadership in keeping markets open has \nprevented a global financial meltdown. The U.S. and its allies have \nspent years developing an international trading system. Treasury \nSecretary Robert Rubin was not exaggerating last week when he warned \nthat the steel quota bill could set off a wave of market access \nrestrictions that would undermine this system and threaten the world's \nfinancial health.\n  Steel quotas are also wrong for the American economy. There is no \nquestion that open markets present some difficult challenges for \nAmerican companies. They lead to stiffer competition and force greater \nefficiency. But open markets also mean greater opportunities. As a \nnation, we are succeeding. The United States is the strongest and most \nprosperous nation on earth. We have the most skilled workforce, the \nmost productive factories and the most innovative thinkers anywhere in \nthe world. Our commitment to open markets has played a key role in this \nsuccess.\n  In my home state of Alaska, for example, international trade is a \nvital part of the economy. Last year, Alaskan companies exported more \nthan 750 million dollars worth of merchandise to foreign countries. And \nthat was an off year in my state because of the Asian flue--in most \nyears, our merchandise exports total nearly 1 billion dollars.\n  For many reasons, the quota bill will do more harm to the American \neconomy than good. First, the steel quota bill will provoke foreign \ncountries to retaliate against our exports. And the United States will \nbe in no position to complain. The international trading system--the \none that we played a leading role in creating--authorizes countries to \nretaliate against those who erect trade barriers such as quotas. This \nretaliation will be devastating to our farmers and factory workers. It \nwill cost many more American jobs than it will save. As American \ncompanies lose sales abroad, they will be forced to cut jobs and close \ndoors at home.\n  Second, the quota bill will deny American manufacturers the steel \nthey need to make their products. Domestic steel companies are only \nable to meet about 75 percent of the demand for steel in this country. \nAs a result, steel quotas could create dangerous steel shortages--\nshortages that hurt the oil industry in Alaska. In addition, the quota \nbill is completely insensitive to the types of steel that American \ncompanies need. There are many special types of steel that simply are \nnot made in the U.S. Quotas could completely deny American companies \naccess to those special types of steel, forcing them to reduce the \nquality of their products or move their production overseas.\n  Finally, by making a critical raw material more expensive, steel \nquotas will put many of our products at a world market disadvantage. \nBecause American manufacturers will be forced to pay more for steel \nthan their foreign competitors, their products will be more expensive. \nAgain, the steel quota bill will result in lost sales abroad and lost \njobs at home.\n  For all of these reasons, we must not pass the steel quota bill. It \nis wrong for the United States and wrong for the world's economy. As \nFederal Reserve Chairman Greenspan recently warned, it will indeed be a \ngreat tragedy if we pass this legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote for cloture on the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 975 in order to bring this issue to the floor.\n  That is the best way, and perhaps the only way, to insure a debate on \nhow to address the steel import crisis in a timely manner.\n  The motion to proceed isn't the end point. It is not final passage. \nOnly if the motion to proceed is adopted can we debate how to act \neffectively and legally to avoid the kind of surges in steel imports \nwhich have illegally impacted our steel industry.\n  Ms. MUKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Stop Illegal \nSteel Trade Act. This legislation will enable us to stand up for steel. \nIt will create a level playing field for the American steel industry \nand our steel workers.\n  We must stand up for steel.\n  Today, our steel industry and steel workers are under attack by \nillegal and unfair trading practices. Brazil, Russia, and Japan have \ndumped cheap steel on the American market that has drastically impacted \nthe price of steel. Over the last year and a half steel imports have \nincreased by 47 percent. The producer price index for all steel mill \nproducts is down 9 percent. This is the largest decline in nearly 20 \nyears. If this continues, American steel mills will simply not survive.\n  I have always been for free trade as long as it's fair trade. There \nhas to be equal access and opportunity and a level playing field for \nAmerican industry. But I cannot sit by and allow an industry that is \nfundamental to the American economy to be destroyed by what amounts to \npredatory trade practices. Our steel industry is ready and willing to \ncompete--but they can't compete against unfair, illegal, predatory \ntrade practices.\n  Steel is a part of our everyday life--we drive steel cars, work in \nsteel buildings, and our national security is protected by steel \naircraft carriers. We must do everything we can to preserve our steel \nindustry.\n  That is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of the legislation we are \nconsidering today. This bill would place restrictions on steel imports \nfor three years. It also authorizes the President to take steps to \nensure that steel imports return to pre-crisis levels. The Secretaries \nof the Treasury and Commerce will enforce the regulations on steel \nimports. I think these are important steps to revitalize our steel \nindustry.\n  We owe it our hardworking, dedicated steel workers. The work week of \nmany at Bethlehem Steel has been shortened. This means less food on the \ntable. This means late mortgages, rents, and car payments. And all this \nbecause foreign countries are desperately trying to stabilize their own \neconomies on the backs of our steel workers.\n  These countries are not going to throw our steel industry a curve \nball. With this legislation we will force Japan, Brazil, and Russia to \nplay fair. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill and \nstand up in steel.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak \nrelatively briefly on the steel import limitation bill.\n  Similar legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of \n289-141. While this quota legislation is a very\n\n[[Page S7397]]\n\nstrong measure, it reflects the necessity that strong action be taken \nto enforce U.S. trade laws to stop an avalanche of dumping by foreign \ncountries.\n  We have seen the decimation and disintegration of the American steel \nindustry by unfair foreign imports. Twenty years ago, in 1979, \napproximately 453,000 steelworkers were employed. Today that figure is \nabout 160,000. Some $50 billion has been invested by the American steel \nindustry to modernize, but there is no way that the American steel \nindustry can compete with dumped goods, the sale of goods in the United \nStates at prices lower than the price at which such goods are being \nsold by the producing companies in their own country or in some other \ncountry. These goods come into the United States from a number of \ncountries--from Russia, from Brazil, from Ukraine, from South Africa \nand from China--at prices less than the cost of production. This is the \nantithesis of fair trade.\n  This situation requires a change. Twelve executives from American \nsteel companies sent a letter to the Secretary of Commerce Daley in \nresponse to his comment last week that the steel crisis is over--said \nSecretary Daley. This letter, dated June 18, 1999, says, in pertinent \npart, the following:\n\n       The steel industry started some seven actions for \n     antidumping, and six of those were subjected to suspension \n     agreements by the Department of Commerce, to the detriment of \n     the steel companies.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this chart on steel imports and \nsuspension agreement be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDENT OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Steel import limitations, or quotas, provide for a \ndrastic remedy. Along with the steel industry, other industries in the \nUnited States have been victimized by the failure to enforce U.S. trade \nlaws.\n  I have, for the past 15 years, proposed legislation which would \nauthorize equitable relief to provide for enforcement of the U.S. trade \nlaws. At the present time, if complaints are filed with the \nInternational Trade Commission, it takes up to a year--or more--to have \nthose matters resolved. An equitable action, a court of equity, would \nresult in having these matters resolved in the course of a few weeks.\n  Until that is done, it appears to be necessary for some very decisive \naction. This is why I cosponsored the steel import limitation bill.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                                                      STEEL IMPORTS AND SUSPENSION AGREEMENTS: SUMMARY OF FLAT-ROLLED SUSPENSION AGREEMENTS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                          Suspension       Estimated                                   Current\n                                                                                                             Final ad      agreement      volumes w/       Agreement     Estimated      import\n             Year of filing                          Product                          Country                margins        volumes     orders (metric   minimum price   fair price   value ($/\n                                                                                                            (percent)    (metric tons)       tons)          ($/MT)         ($/MT)        MT)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1996...................................

Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \ncloture motion to proceed to H.R. 975, the Steel Import bill. I do so \nfor three reasons. First, I think that this legislation is \nprotectionist and invites retaliation under the World Trade \nOrganization; second, I believe that it may endanger the health and \nstability of the international economy; and, third, I believe that it \nmay endanger the health and stability of the U.S. economy, including \nthe steel industry it is intended to protect.\n  I understand the appeal of this legislation for those who support it, \nand believe that they are well intentioned in wishing to see \nlegislation passed which protects the U.S. steel industry.\n  As supporters of this legislation have pointed out, there was an \nundeniable surge in steel imports into the United States last year. \nOver the past three years, economic instability in East Asia, Russia, \nand Latin America have resulted in a weakening of the world steel \nmarket. According to the Congressional Research Service, between August \n1997 and August 1998, imports surged almost 80%.\n  But today, it is important to note, steel imports have returned to \ntheir pre-crisis levels, down roughly 44% in April 1999 since last \nAugust's peak, according to the office of the United States Trade \nRepresentative.\n  Where I disagree with supporters of this legislation, then, is that \nalthough I too believe that some complaints about unfair competition \nand unfair trade practices are, of course, warranted, the solution to \nthose complaints found in this bill--the imposition of unyielding \nimport quotas--is an approach which I believe to be counterproductive \nand even potentially harmful to the health of the U.S. economy.\n  First, the protectionism sought by this bill would put the United \nStates in violation of world trade rules, and would invite retaliation \nagainst U.S. producers of a range of goods in overseas markets, \njeopardizing jobs at home.\n  The World Trade Organization permits the application of ``safeguard \nmeasures'' such as quotas only in very specific circumstances, and \nnever unilaterally. In the absence of a determination that the product \nin question is being imported in such increased quantities as to cause \nor threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry, \nunilateral measures such as those included in this bill are not \npermitted. And if a nation takes such a unilateral measure, the \ncountries affected are allowed to take retaliatory measures.\n  Thus, if this legislation is enacted, the United States would face \nthe real possibility of retaliation by the world's steel exporting \ncountries. Under the WTO rules, other countries will have the right to \nretaliate against our exports. They could put at risk our most \ncompetitive sectors--such as agriculture, high-tech, or \npharmaceuticals.\n  In fact, a June 18 letter signed by the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, the International Dairy Foods Association, and the National \nCattlemen's Beef Association, among others, states that:\n\n       At a time when U.S. farmers are facing severe financial \n     hardships, continued access to global markets Is critical to \n     preserve farm income . . . since growth for the U.S. \n     agricultural sector hinges on access to world markets, \n     passing legislation that violates the WTO threatens economic \n     growth in the farm sector.\n\n  In addition, there could also be retaliation against U.S. products \nthat use steel, such as automobiles, heavy machinery, or construction. \nFor example, according to a letter I received from Boeing:\n\n       In 1999 we expect to deliver approximately $18 billion in \n     airplanes to international customers, many of whom are \n     struggling to purchase these planes as a result of the Asian \n     financial crisis. A number of these airplane deliveries could \n     be at risk if new limits on imported steel are imposed.\n\n  The unilateral protectionism embodied in this bill would undermine \nthe international trading system and the institutions, rules, and \nregulations to safeguard the international economy that the United \nStates has worked so hard to put into place over the past fifty years. \nAs we have seen in numerous cases, these institutions and rules have \nhelped the U.S. gain market access when other nations sought to prevent \nit, and have helped the U.S. economy to grow and created numerous jobs \nhere in the United States.\n  As the world's largest trading nation, U.S. interests are best served \nby supporting--not undermining--the rules-based international economic \nand trading system.\n  This leads me to my second point, and the second reason I am opposed \nto this legislation: I believe that this legislation threatens to \nundermine the health and stability of the international economy, and \nwith it the base\n\n[[Page S7398]]\n\nfor much of America's current economic prosperity. Free trade has been \na prime ingredient in the eight year U.S. economic boom.\n  Moreover, in the past year we have begun to turn the corner on a \nglobal economic crisis. Maintaining open world markets is vital to \nglobal recovery in Asia, Russia, Brazil, and elsewhere. These countries \nhave not closed their markets to U.S. products despite the economic \npressures they have faced in the past several years. If the U.S. takes \na significant step towards protectionism, it will set off a global \nchain-reaction.\n  Indeed, according to a May 25 letter I received from Raymond \nChretien, the Canadian Ambassador to the United States, passage of this \nlegislation:\n\n       . . . would set a protectionist precedent that would \n     encourage other industries, in the U.S. and other countries, \n     to seek unilateral relief outside of legitimate, established, \n     trade remedies. The world economy, and workers in affected \n     countries, can ill afford the turmoil that could ensure in \n     international commerce.\n  According to Brookings Analyst Robert Crandall, HR 975 is ``one of \nthe most blatantly projectionist pieces of legislation since the \n1930s''. I do not believe that a single member of this body wants the \nUnited States, or the international economy, to risk a return to those \ndays of global depression.\n  Finally, although the quotas might have some marginal palliative \neffect for some of the old-line steel factories, they would have a far \nlarger effect on the overall health and well-being of the U.S. economy, \nand threaten to harm countless other U.S. workers and consumers.\n  This is the third reason I oppose this bill: I believe that it is bad \nfor the U.S. economy, including the steel industry.\n  To take one example, steel import quotas would increase the price of \nsteel used by the automobile industry, harming the auto industry and \nauto workers, and would in turn show up in higher auto sticker prices, \nharming U.S. consumers hoping to be able to purchase reasonably priced \ncars.\n  In short, steel import quotas will undermine U.S. manufacturing \ncompetitiveness in a range of industries and business that rely on \nsteel, from metal fabrication to transport to industrial machinery to \nconstruction; industries that in toto employ over 8 million workers.\n  For example, I received a letter from the Aggressive Engineering \nCorporation, a small California company that serves military and \ncommercial industry in their metal stamping needs. According to this \nletter:\n\n       Our company relies on steel from domestic producers. \n     However, U.S. steel producers are able to supply only about \n     75% of the demand for steel, leaving a yearly shortfall of 30 \n     million tons. In order to maintain our operations in the \n     United States, we depend on foreign steel. . .While we all \n     agree that it is important to maintain U.S. jobs and job \n     growth, steel is no less important than other sectors. Please \n     remember that steel-using industries employ more than 40 \n     American workers for every worker in the steel industry. \n     Quotas do not work. They will harm consumers and steel-\n     consuming industries to a much greater extent than they could \n     ever help steel producers or steelworkers.\n\n  It is also important to keep in mind that although many of the old-\nline steel mills face serious difficulties, that is not the same as \nsaying that overall the U.S. steel industry is in trouble. In fact, \nmany of the problems faced by old-line steel mills stem less from \nimport problems than from decades-old mills that are unable to compete \nwith the efficient new mini-mills located right here in the United \nStates. Even as the U.S. faced the ``import surge'' last year, U.S. \nmills rolled out 102 million tons of steel in 1998, the second highest \ntotal in the past two decades.\n  In addition, The Wall Street Journal has reported that 25% of the \nsteel entering the United States last year was bought by American \nsteelmakers, who otherwise could not have met the demands of their \ncustomers.\n  In other words, while seeking to protect the steel industry, this \nlegislation could in fact harm the industry by protecting the least \nefficient producers at the expense of the more efficient, and by \npreventing American steelmakers from getting access to the steel they \nneed to meet customer demand.\n  In response to this surge in imports last year, earlier this year the \nAdministration put in place an aggressive Steel Action Plan to strictly \nenforce the trade laws already on the books; enter into new bilateral \nagreements with Japan, Russia, and Korea regarding their steel imports \nto the United States; create new sources of early import data and an \nactive monitoring of safeguards; and lend support for the Section 201 \nsafeguard law.\n  In addition, the Department of Commerce determination on the import \nsurge this February, recently supported by a finding of the \nInternational Trade Commission, has paved the way for the \nAdministration to slap duties on Japanese and Brazilian steel and \nforced Russia to restrict its imports.\n  I believe that the Administration's response has been tough but fair. \nAnd I believe that the proof of the effectiveness of this response is \nin the pudding: By all accounts the steel import crisis is over, with \nimports having receded back to pre-crisis levels.\n  Under these circumstances--passing potentially harmful quota \nlegislation after the crisis has passed--is the wrong way to approach \nthis issue, and I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing the \ncloture motion to proceed to this bill.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today, the Senate will cast a very \nimportant vote on whether we will stand up and honor our commitments to \nUnited States trade policies, or enact protectionist trade measures on \nsteel imports that will have little or no favorable effect on the steel \nindustry, yet will ultimately harm many segments of our nation's \neconomy.\n  Let me first stipulate one point--I am now, and I always have been, a \nstrong supporter of Ohio's steel industry. In fact, I believe my \nactions prove that I have been ``standing up for steel'' for two \ndecades.\n  My support for Ohio's steel industry goes back to the days when I was \nMayor of Cleveland.\n  In the early 1980s, when steel imports peaked at nearly 27% and U.S. \nsteelmakers were losing billions of dollars in revenue, I lobbied \nPresident Reagan for Voluntary Restraint Agreements (VRAs) in order to \ngive the domestic industry five years of breathing room to modernize \nand restructure. I rallied with the steelworkers in Cleveland's Public \nSquare to tell America about how our steel industry was being dumped \non.\n  A year before the VRA program was set to expire, I began lobbying \nthen-Vice President Bush for a temporary extension, to give the steel \nindustry some protection while the Administration attempted to \nnegotiate a multilateral steel agreement aimed at eliminating unfair \nforeign practices.\n  All throughout 1988, I fought for the VRA extension. My efforts were \nsuccessful, because in 1989, President Bush agreed to extend the VRAs \ntwo and a half years.\n  And two years later, after I was elected Governor, I was back to \nlobby the Bush Administration to ensure that all of our trade laws \nwould be vigorously enforced after the extended VRAs finally expired in \n1992.\n  In 1991, I was the first Governor in the United States to set up a \nSteel Industry Advisory Commission--a public-private partnership \ndesigned to strengthen ties among the steel industry, the state of \nOhio, and its citizens.\n  I also worked to bring steel companies, such as North Star Steel, to \nOhio in order to create more, good-paying jobs. I have been there to \nlead the fight--to make sure that the federal government did not run \nroughshod over our steel industry.\n  In May 1992, I attended the opening of the U.S. Steel/Kobe Blast \nFurnace in Lorain, Ohio--a $100 million investment with 2,800 jobs that \nalmost didn't happen. The EPA was going to halt the project, but I went \nstraight to the White House and let them know that what the EPA was \nproposing in Ohio was ridiculous.\n  Ohio is now the largest steel-producing state in the country, a \ndevelopment I'm proud to say occurred during my tenure as Governor.\n  Last year, a building where state agencies were going to be located \nwas built, and foreign steel was used in place of domestic steel in \nviolation of state law. State law called for a fine of $3,000, but I \ninsisted that the entity responsible for building this facility pay \n$50,000. I doubt there are very few other public officials in the \ncountry who would enforce an existing law so vigorously.\n  When imports of steel shot up last year, and Ohio steel producers \nstarted\n\n[[Page S7399]]\n\nto suffer, I was one of the first elected officials to speak out. I \nwrote the President several times, twice on my own and once with other \ngovernors, urging him to take all appropriate action under our trade \nlaws to combat steel dumping. I also supported a resolution in the Ohio \nlegislature urging the President to take action.\n  My support for the steel industry has been long-standing, and I dare \nsay it is matched by few individuals. That's why I look seriously upon \nany proposal that purports to help this important industry.\n  The bill that is before the Senate today would impose a monthly limit \non steel imports for the next 3 years. The quotas would apply to all \nsteel mill products from all countries, regardless of whether they have \nengaged in dumping or not.\n  I have given this legislation much thought and careful consideration, \nand on its merits, I cannot vote in favor of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I have dedicated my entire 33-year public career to \nserving the people of Ohio. I am the last person who would want to see \nthe Ohio steel industry and good-paying jobs dry up and go away. I \nwould not vote against this Quota Bill if I believed it was a \nproductive solution that would save jobs in my state.\n  It is because I care about Ohio's workers that I must oppose the \nQuota Bill today. I wish I could tell Ohio's and our nation's \nsteelworkers that the Quota Bill would save steel jobs. I cannot. I \nwish I could tell them that the Quota Bill would give the industry a \nquick fix. It will not.\n  Not only is the Quota Bill bad policy, but voting for it today would \nbe an exercise in futility, because we already know that the President \nwill veto it.\n  In addition, I am concerned that too much emphasis has been placed on \nthis legislation as being some sort of panacea that will help address \nall of the steel industry's problems. The fact of the matter is, if \nthis legislation becomes law, it will only serve to compound the \nindustry's problems.\n  Passage of this bill will provide a false sense of relief, when what \nwe should really be doing is concentrating our efforts on a long-term \nsolution--one that will make a difference in addressing the viability \nof our nation's steel industry within the framework of existing law.\n  I have often said that in Ohio, we are no longer the ``Rust Belt'' we \nare the ``Jobs and Productivity Belt.'' We made this transition thanks \nin part to the efforts of the steel industry to modernize and become \nmore efficient and competitive.\n  And, it's easy to do when you have good labor-management relations \nwhich promotes empowerment, when you have businesses willing to invest \nin training and advanced manufacturing technology, and when you have \npartnerships with government and education. It's amazing what you can \nget. It's what has helped contribute to the importance and significance \nof steel in Ohio.\n  Overall, the American steel industry is succeeding. It produced \nrecord levels of steel in 1997 and 1998, and is now more efficient than \nit ever has been. It is strong. Its workers are strong. And it can \ncompete in the world marketplace, if the playing field is level.\n  That is why it is so important that we continue to work to get other \ncountries to follow the American example: to open their markets to \nAmerican goods, to stop subsidizing their national steel industries and \nto stop dumping steel on our market at unfair prices.\n  We need all of Ohio's 35,400 steelworkers fighting for this approach, \nand applying the appropriate pressure to get other nations to change \ntheir protectionist ways.\n  However, the minute we succumb to the sort of trade practices that we \nso vehemently oppose, we lose all credibility in the international \ncommunity.\n  Most every trade expert will attest that this Quota Bill violates \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) rules--rules that are treaty-based and \nto which the United States is bound. Even supporters of this \nlegislation must acknowledge that fact.\n  Since the bill does violate international trade rules, it would \ninvite our largest trading partners to launch major trade cases against \nus, cases that, based on our treaty obligations, we would most surely \nlose.\n  This would give our trading partners the right to take retaliatory \ntrade actions against us. They could slap high tariffs on all manner of \nAmerican-made products in order to limit our access to their markets or \nkick us out altogether. Such actions would result in job losses in \nAmerican industries that rely heavily on exports, such as agriculture, \ntechnology and telecommunications and a host of others.\n  One industry that would be particularly hard-hit by a trade war is \nagriculture. America's farmers grow and export more food than any other \nfarmers in the world. They would be dealt a devastating blow by \nretaliatory action taken against them--probably the most affected \nsegment regarding American jobs. In my state of Ohio that's crucial \nbecause we have some 80,000 farmers.\n  It's also important to farmers across the rest of the country. In \nfact, just yesterday, I received a letter from 20 major agriculture \nassociations, including American Farm Bureau, outlining their \nopposition to the Quota Bill.\n  Moreover, for nearly 60 years the United States has been the primary \nadvocate of a free--and, rules-based--system of international trade. \nThe United States is constantly urging other countries to respect \ninternational trade agreements and to comply with WTO decisions.\n  The United States has set the example of being the one nation that \nconsistently complies with the WTO. Indeed, the United States has won \n19 of the 21 trade cases it has brought to the WTO for dispute \nresolution, such as the recently settled banana case the U.S. brought \nagainst the European Union.\n  How can we expect other countries to abide by international trade \nrules if the United States, the main advocate of those rules, \nflagrantly disregards them itself? If we want a rules-based system of \ninternational trade to work, so that we can have a level playing field \nacross the board on all goods, America must continue to lead by \nexample.\n  Proponents have argued that even if the Quota Bill violates WTO \nrules, it would take years for any cases filed against us at the WTO to \nrun their full course. In the meantime, quotas on steel products would \ngive the domestic steel industry some temporary relief from imports in \norder to recover from last year's import surge.\n  There are two flaws in that logic. First, imports have dropped off \ndramatically, and are now below the levels that the proponents of the \nQuota Bill seek to establish.\n  Second, analysts are predicting that the U.S. will actually have \nsteel shortages this summer. This means that the industries that need \nsteel to make their products--like the automakers--will not have enough \nsteel to build new cars in order to meet consumer demand.\n  At the moment, the domestic steel industry can only make enough steel \nto meet 75% of the domestic demand. Not too many people realize that \nthe remaining 25% must now be imported from overseas, and of that \namount, the steel industry imports 25% for its own capacity.\n  In fact, there are steel products that many Ohio manufacturers need \nthat aren't even made in the United States.\n  In short, regardless of what is said, the United States must import \nsteel right now in order to meet domestic demand.\n  So, what happens under the Quota Bill, when there are steel shortages \nin the United States, while an oversupply of cheap steel remains in the \nrest of the world? It means that America's manufacturers will have to \npay a comparatively higher price for the steel they need to make their \nfinished products, such as cars, machine tools and dish washers.\n  As a result, the cost of American-made finished products will be \nhigher, while the prices for the same goods made overseas will remain \nlow.\n  So what will consumers in the United States and around the world do? \nThey will do the logical thing: buy cheap, foreign-made goods, and at \nthe end of the day, America's manufacturers and workers will lose out, \nand we will be right back at square one. Except this time, even more \nAmerican jobs in a variety of other job sectors will be on the line, \nespecially in Ohio.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 465,000 Ohio \nworkers in downstream industries that use\n\n[[Page S7400]]\n\nsteel. This means that for every Ohioan employed in the steel industry, \nthere are 12 other Ohioans who work in steel-using industries and whose \njobs would be directly jeopardized by the Quota Bill.\n  I cannot, in good conscience, vote in favor of a piece of legislation \nthat would have the effect of jeopardizing the jobs of more than half-\na-million Ohioans--including 80,000 farmers I previously mentioned--for \na Quota bill that will have no long-term positive benefits.\n  All in all, this bill could have extremely serious consequences for \njobs in Ohio.\n  When I was Governor of Ohio, one of my four economic development \ninitiatives was exports. Because of our actions in the state, Ohio's \nexports increased by more than 62% during the time that I was Governor. \nAnd as most Americans know, as exports increase, so do jobs.\n  Our economy is intertwined with the international marketplace, and it \nbecomes even more so on a daily basis.\n  As one who has argued vigorously to have others take down their trade \nbarriers so we could get our goods into their countries, how can I talk \nabout closing down our borders and keeping other products out?\n  We have also increased investment in Ohio by foreign companies. \nAccording to Site Selection magazine, from 1991-1997, Ohio had more \ngrowth in non-U.S. owned firms than any other state--some 300 new \nmanufacturing facilities and plant expansions.\n  For me to come out in favor of quotas and trade barriers in today's \nmarketplace would be detrimental to the economic well-being and growth \nof Ohio as well as jeopardize jobs in my state.\n  What we ought to do is improve the situation that we already have \nwithin the framework of current law and WTO rules.\n  I don't think anyone will deny the fact that the steel industry was \naffected by last year's surge in imports, and this surge was partly the \nresult of a series of financial crises in Asia and Russia that \nprecipitated a collapse in global demand for steel.\n  Naturally, imports were drawn to the United States, where the economy \nand demand for steel remained strong in comparison to the rest of the \nworld. Unfortunately, the collapse in global demand was exacerbated \nlast summer by the 54-day strike at General Motors, the largest \nconsumer of American-made steel.\n  However, the oversupply of steel on world markets is not a new \nproblem facing the U.S. steel industry. It has been a persistent \nproblem that has plagued American steel producers for decades, and it \nis the legacy of 60 years of foreign government intervention in \ndomestic steel industries.\n  Since the 1930s, other countries have undertaken policies to expand \ntheir domestic steel-making capacity and employment, regardless of \nmarket conditions. These policies have included tariffs, quotas, heavy \ngovernment subsidies, state ownership, and government toleration of \ncartel-like behavior.\n  The end result has been that foreign steel manufacturers are able to \nproduce and sell steel under circumstances that would drive a U.S. \nsteel manufacturer out of business.\n  Quotas will do nothing to address this fundamental problem. We \nlearned from our experience with voluntary restraint agreements (VRAs) \nin the 1980s that restricting steel imports--be it through VRAs or \nquotas--will do little to discourage other countries from subsidizing \ntheir industries or engaging in other market-distorting practices.\n  That's why we ended the VRA's. After trying to match our competitors \nstep for step, the United States determined that only through sound \neconomic and trade policies would we ever overcome the protectionist \ntendencies of other steel producing nations. That's why we continue to \npress for fair competition before the WTO and why we continue to win \nour cases.\n  A good majority of our American steel industry has modernized, \nrestructured, and become more efficient in order to compete in the \nglobal marketplace. They are to be commended for making the decisions \nthat make them the best steel industry and the most productive workers \nin the world. As I have said earlier, smart business decisions have \nmade Ohio the number one steel state in the nation.\n  What we need to do now is level the playing field by going after the \nunfair, market-distorting practices that have insulated foreign steel \nproducers from the same market pressures our American steel producers \nface. We need to win our fights in the proper venues and with the facts \non our side.\n  If it is our intention to pass legislation in the Senate, we should \nlook at solutions that will truly address problems that exist and that \nwill not provoke an all-out ``trade war.''\n  To that end, I have been working with the Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, to develop a legislative solution to deal with \nthe global overcapacity of steel that we believe will more reasonably \naddress the concerns of America's steel industry.\n  I believe the legislation will get to the root of the steel import \nproblem, and is the type of solution we should be pursuing, not this \nQuota Bill.\n  The Roth bill, the Steel Trade Enforcement Act, would direct the U.S. \nTrade Representative to start an investigation of the unfair practices \nthat have protected foreign steel manufacturers from the capital market \npressures that the American steel industry faces and have protected \nthem from true competition.\n  Once we identify those countries and practices, the proposal would \nthen require the Administration to develop a comprehensive, government-\nwide strategy to eliminate those practices. There is a follow-up \nmechanism to make sure that action is taken.\n  The Roth bill would also establish a monitoring program to facilitate \nthe timely release of data on steel imports. This monitoring program \ncould serve as an early warning system for future steel import surges, \ngiving industry and the Administration more time to respond. It will \nalso put our competitors on notice that the United States is watching.\n  The Roth bill also would require the U.S. representatives to the \ninternational financial institutions--such as the World Bank and the \nInternational Monetary Fund--to oppose any financing to steel \nindustries abroad. It's not fair to use U.S. taxpayer dollars to \nsubsidize the steel industries of our foreign competitors.\n  Finally, the Roth bill has a provision dealing with so-called \n``suspension agreements.''\n  Under current law, when an antidumping or countervailing duty case is \nunder way, the Administration has the authority to go out and negotiate \na ``suspension agreement'' with the offending country. If the \nAdministration is able to reach such an agreement, the pending \nantidumping or countervailing duty case is suspended.\n  Many steel companies and workers feel like they have been undercut by \nthe recent suspension agreements that the Administration has negotiated \nwith Brazil and Russia on hot-rolled steel imports. The industry would \nhave much preferred that the pending antidumping cases be taken to \ntheir full conclusion so that the full antidumping duties could be \nimposed.\n  The suspension agreement provision would require that the \nAdministration get the support of at least 50% of the industry before \nfinalizing any future suspension agreements. I am particularly pleased \nthat this provision was added to the bill.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Senator Roth's legislation is a \nrational approach to the dumping that the United States has been \nsubjected to over the years and is our best bet to effectively deal \nwith those nations that subsidize their steel industries.\n  However, passage of this quota bill before us today will do nothing \nto assist our domestic steel industry--it will be ruled GATT illegal, \nwhich will draw retaliatory actions from other nations. In addition, it \nwill not prevent future job losses in the steel industry and, in fact, \ncould cause job losses in other employment sectors--some with no ties \nto steel whatsoever such as agriculture.\n  We must do all that we can to ensure continued economic growth in our \nnation. This legislation does not. Therefore, I cannot support this \nbill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in the midst of the best economy our \ncountry has ever seen, while we have understandably focused on the good \nnews, there has been another story that has only recently begun to get \nthe attention it deserves.\n\n[[Page S7401]]\n\n  Thanks to the leadership of Senator Rockefeller, Senator Byrd, and \nmany of our other colleagues from our country's leading steel producing \nstates, the story of American steel workers has been heard. Like so \nmany other workers in America's core manufacturing industries, steel \nworkers have been struggling with restructuring and modernization that \nhas made them among the most productive in the world. But on top of the \nsacrifices--in jobs and job security, in pay, in benefits--they have \nbeen hit by the one-two punch of the international financial crisis \nover the last couple of years.\n  On top of the lost sales overseas, where once booming developing \nnations are no longer able to purchase steel from the U.S., our steel \nworkers have watched as those same developing countries have dumped \ntheir own steel products here, often below the cost of production, \nliterally stealing American markets out from under them. So, with lost \nsales at home and abroad, steel workers are losing their jobs as our \nmills cut production and even shut down.\n  For the tens of thousands of American workers whose jobs have been \nlost, whose families have been strained to the breaking point, whose \ncommunities have crumbled, this is not some abstract economic question \nabout free trade and open markets. The question is what shall we do to \nhelp the people who, despite their hard work and sacrifice, are paying \nthe ultimate price as the rest of us enjoy the many benefits of the new \neconomy.\n  The question before us today, is how to deal with the kind of \neconomic disruption that has come from a global economy with wide-open \ncapital markets and instantaneous communication. The current crisis in \nour domestic steel industry is, at its roots, a crisis of overcapacity \nin the steel industry on a global scale. Too many developing countries \nbuilt too many new steel mills, with less concern about the long term \neconomic sense and more interest in the kickbacks and quick bucks to be \nmade in the short run.\n  I believe that we have been right to respond to the recent \ninternational financial crisis by providing the IMF and the World Bank \nand other entities with the funds they need to put the international \nfinancial system back on its feet. But one unfortunate aspect of that \nprocess, in my mind, is that too many investors who were throwing money \nat ill-prepared and even corrupt developing economies will benefit from \nour attempts to prevent a collapse in the world economy.\n  Today, instead of high-rolling international investors, we are asked \nto consider help for those American workers and their families who are \nvictims of that international economic crisis, for which they are \ncompletely blameless. We will be adding insult to that injury if we \nfail to act to help them.\n  But while I will vote for the motion to proceed to this bill, Mr. \nPresident, I could not vote for passage in its current form.\n  We already have many anti-dumping actions underway, a time-consuming \nand sometimes frustrating process to be sure, but a process designed to \nguarantee that we hit what we are shooting at--it requires evidence of \nwho is dumping what kind of steel, and what the real economic damage \nis. We should continue to pursue those actions as quickly and as \nrelentlessly as the law allows.\n  Just last week, the Senate passed legislation, brought before us by \nSenator Byrd, that provides $1 billion for the steel industry in loan \nguarantees to help them deal with the current crisis.\n  These actions are significant steps in the right direction, and they \ndon't have the unintended consequences that the bill before us brings \nwith it. Quotas on imported steel violate one of our oldest and most \nbasic commitments to the international trading system we have worked so \nlong to create. That system, for the most part, has been a key part of \nour current economic success.\n  If we impose unilateral quotas on other countries' steel exports--\nwithout showing any specific illegal practices or any direct economic \ndamages--we will seriously weaken our leadership in international trade \nwhen we are fighting so hard to open other markets to our products. \nChief among those products are our agricultural products, Mr. \nPresident, but virtually all of our exports are exposed to a trade war \nwith other countries if we respond to the very real problems of our \ndomestic steel industry by unilaterally imposing quotas.\n  That does not mean we cannot and should not do more to protect \nAmerican steel mills and steel workers from the unfair and illegal \ntrade practices of other countries. But I hope if we can proceed to a \nreal debate on this issue that we can formulate a more effective way to \nright the wrong that has been done to them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired. Who yield's time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on \nleader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           order of procedure\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding \nrule XXII, that immediately following the 12:15 vote, Senator Dodd be \nrecognized to speak relative to the State Department authorization for \nup to 15 minutes. I further ask unanimous consent that following his \nremarks the Senate stand in recess until 2:15 for the policy \nconferences. I also ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 today there be 5 \nminutes equally divided for debate on the Feingold amendment, and \nfollowing that debate, the Senate proceed to a vote on the Feingold \namendment, No. 692. I ask unanimous consent that following that vote, \nSenator Helms be recognized in order to offer the managers' amendment \nand it be considered and agreed to.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that there be 5 minutes equally \ndivided between the chairman and the ranking member for closing \nremarks, the bill be read a third time, the Senate proceed to vote on \npassage of the bill, with no intervening action or debate; further, \nthat Senator Harkin be recognized after the vote to speak for 20 \nminutes regarding the State Department reauthorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered..\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I now ask the manager of the bill for 3 \nminutes to speak on the steel quota bill.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote no on the \nso-called steel quota bill. I think it would be a mistake. I think the \nbill would do more harm than good; I mean more harm than good to our \nentire economy, and I believe also to the steel industry and to the \nsteelworkers. I think it would be a serious mistake.\n  One would have to figure what happens if we enacted these arbitrary \nquota restraints. Senator Moynihan just mentioned it would be a \nviolation of our trading laws. If we do that, that will hurt the steel \nindustry indirectly, because we export a lot of steel products. We \nexport a lot of tractors, we export a lot of heavy equipment, and we \nexport a lot of cars, all of which use steel.\n  If we establish arbitrary quotas on what we are going to import, many \nother countries are going to retaliate, and they have the right to do \nso under the WTO. We are going to be violating the trade laws that we \nhave agreed to, and there is going to be a response.\n  Senator Grassley just mentioned that the biggest response is going to \nbe against agriculture. It is kind of the easiest thing to hit. \nAgriculture is very competitive in the export market.\n  Farmers all across the country are going to be faced with a loss of \nexports, and they are going to say: Wait a minute. Congress just \nimposed a restriction on steel imports, and, therefore, they are going \nto put restrictions on the amount of wheat, or the amount of grain they \nwill import. It would be a serious mistake.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article in today's Washington Times by William Daley, Secretary of \nCommerce.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 22, 1999]\n\n                      Why Trade Quotas Don't Work\n\n                         (By William M. Daley)\n\n       The steel quota legislation now being considered in \n     Congress is a misguided attempt\n\n[[Page S7402]]\n\n     to deal with a problem that is already beginning to go away. \n     Last year, when steel imports, particularly from Japan, \n     Russia, and Brazil, surged by 33 percent over 1997, layoffs \n     mounted and plant closings loomed, the demand for quota \n     legislation to protect businesses and workers was \n     understandable. Today, however, we are beginning to turn the \n     corner on steel imports. And while calls for quota \n     legislation continue, it is clear that this bill is not in \n     the nation's economic interest--nor in the long-term interest \n     of the U.S. steel industry or American steelworkers.\n       Make no mistake about it: last year's steel crisis was real \n     and demanded a strong response. The administration acted, \n     adopting a two-prong strategy combining swift and vigorous \n     enforcement of our trade laws with bilateral pressure on our \n     trading partners to reduce their steel exports to the United \n     States. Forty-two antidumping and countervailing duty steel \n     investigations are currently being conducted or have been \n     completed since January. These include investigations on hot-\n     rolled steel, carbon steel plate, and three types of \n     stainless steel. In a number of these cases, the Commerce \n     Department provided swifter relief by making early \n     determinations or conducting the case on an expedited \n     schedule. At the same time, senior government officials, \n     including the president himself, have exerted strong \n     bilateral pressure on our trading partners to reduce their \n     steel exports to the United States.\n       This strategy is working. Since it was put in place last \n     November, steel imports have fallen dramatically. Total steel \n     imports in April were down 39 percent from last year, with \n     imports of hot-rolled steel, the product covered by cases \n     brought against Japan, Russia and Brazil, down 73 percent. \n     Imports overall are returning to pre-crisis levels. April \n     1999 imports of all steel were 22 percent below April 1998 \n     levels, and six percent below April 1997.\n       Steel imports during the first four months of 1999 were \n     down 5 percent compared to the first four months of 1998 and \n     4 percent compared to the first four months of 1997. Despite \n     this significant progress, there is a strong effort under way \n     that ignores the success we've seen to date and seeks to \n     impose across-the-board quotas on steel imports.\n       Steel quotas, however, will backfire; in the end they will \n     not ensure long-term job security for American steel workers. \n     As a nation, we have a great deal to lose from quotas. The \n     United States is the world's largest exporter--and steel is a \n     significant part of many of these exports. Approximately 20 \n     percent of the steel consumed in the United States last year \n     went into products that were later exported, such as heavy \n     machinery, trucks, food processing equipment and so on. The \n     quota bill, however, would violate our international \n     obligations under the World Trade Organization (WTO) and give \n     other steel exporting countries the right to retaliate, \n     perhaps by barring those U.S. exports that use American steel \n     as a way of striking back.\n       That would put our domestic steel industry in the middle of \n     a trade war. Many industries depend on both domestic steel \n     and steel imports to stay competitive. In fact, a number of \n     U.S. steel producers themselves import substantial quantities \n     of semifinished steel products. Imposing quotas at \n     legislatively mandated levels could cause layoffs and idled \n     production in a number of steel consuming industries due to \n     shortages of specific steel inputs. Other U.S. industries may \n     also pay a price from a steel quota bill, especially sectors \n     that depend on exports, such as technology, pharmaceuticals \n     and above all, agriculture.\n       No one has more to lose from quotas than America's farmers, \n     who grow more and export more than any farmers in the world. \n     More broadly, the repercussions could be serious, for both \n     our economy as a whole and the economies of other countries \n     just now beginning to recover from last year's financial \n     crisis. In fact, by weakening rather than strengthening the \n     international economy, the quota bill will make future import \n     surges, in steel and other industry, more, not less, likely. \n     An international economic recovery, on the other hand, will \n     not only help avoid import surges in other industries, it \n     will also help revive worldwide demand for steel.\n       The quota bill is not in our nation's economic interest, \n     and it is not even in the interest of our steel industry and \n     its workers. We have laws that permit us to protect ourselves \n     from unfair competition. We have the will to use them. And we \n     have a strong and effective policy that is working. We should \n     not consider trading all that for an approach that will hurt \n     us in so many different ways.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will read a couple of lines from his \narticle. He says:\n\n       No one has more to lose from quotas than America's farmers \n     who grow more and export more than any farmers in the world.\n\n  He also says:\n\n       The quota bill is not in our Nation's economic interest, \n     and it is not even in the interest of our steel industry and \n     its workers.\n\n  He is exactly right. This bill would be a serious mistake.\n  The Commerce Department has already taken action against Russia, \nagainst Brazil, and against Japan. They can impose tariffs up to 28 \npercent on Japan for dumping, up to 86 percent on Brazil for dumping, \nand up to 200 percent on Russia for dumping. Already there are \nremedies.\n  Incidentally, I might mention that the problem is not near as grave \nas some people have indicated. Steel imports have gone down 72 percent \nfrom last November, which was an all-time high.\n  Again, I don't think the facts warrant passage of this bill. I \nclearly think if people look at the long-term ramifications of passing \nit, agriculture will lose, the American economy will lose, and I really \nthink, frankly, the steel industry will lose as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Ohio, a \ngreat champion of this legislation, 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this bill has great significance to my \nhome State of Ohio. Ohio produces and processes more steel than any \nother State in the Nation. Ohio steel companies--115 of them at last \ncount--produced and processed steel valued at $5.3 billion in 1996. \nOhio is second only to Pennsylvania in the number of employed \nsteelworkers. At last count we had 35,400 steelworkers in the State of \nOhio.\n  We are here today because foreign steel producers have illegally \ndumped millions and millions of tons of steel into the United States. \nIn 1998, 41 million tons were dumped. That represents on average an 83-\npercent increase.\n  Ohio steel production from the first quarter of 1999 was down \nsignificantly. Ohio steel shipments during the first quarter of 1999 \nwere also down nearly 16 percent from the same period in the previous \nyear.\n  Members of the Senate, all of this is no accident. All of this was \nthe result of illegal dumping of steel into the United States.\n  Our steel industry, despite being a highly efficient and globally \ncompetitive industry, is in trouble. I have heard from and I have \ntalked directly to steelworkers and their families about this issue. It \nis estimated that 10,000 steelworkers have already lost their jobs. The \nIndependent Steelworkers predict job losses of as many as 165,000 if \nsteel dumping is not stopped.\n  It is time for the Senate to take action. All eyes are on us.\n  The question is, Will we respond to this crisis?\n  Adopting this bill tells our steel industry, our steelworkers, and \nthe world that we support our industry, we support trade laws, and we \nwill simply not tolerate dumping or subsidization.\n  The bill is tough. It directs the President to impose quotas, tariff \nsurcharges, or negotiate enforceable voluntary export restraint \nagreements in order to ensure that the volume of imported steel \nproducts during any month does not exceed the average volume imported \nfrom the 3-month period preceding July 1997.\n  I am a free trader. I believe free trade, though, does not exist \nwithout fair trade. Free trade does not mean free to dump, free to \nsubsidize, free to distort the market. However, that is exactly what is \nhappening today.\n  A strong and healthy domestic steel industry is vital to our Nation \nand vital to our national defense. Let us resolve today to debate and \nthen pass H.R. 975. The House has already done so. I believe it is in \nour interest and the interest of the country to do so.\n  I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, for his \nleadership, as well as Senator Rockefeller and the other Members who \nhave worked so hard on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, over the past 18 months there has been a \nsurge of steel imports. That surge has severely and adversely impacted \nthe U.S. steel industry.\n  This crisis needs to be addressed and the effects of illegal dumping \ndealt with in a fair and equitable way.\n  I think the administration deserves credit for the series of steps, \nincluding bilateral agreements and vigorous enforcement of existing \ntrade laws, that have greatly improved the steel situation in this \ncountry. Imports, as a result, are now down to below precrisis levels.\n\n[[Page S7403]]\n\n  I support strong action to enforce our trade laws. I believe that \ntrade policy should be by rule of law, not by anarchy, and that with \nsuch strong rule of law enforcement we will be able to assure U.S. \nworkers that they are not hurt by illegal import surges.\n  However, I oppose this legislation because it has the potential of \ndoing great damage to our economy and to the international trading \nsystem. It would violate our WTO commitments, thereby putting at risk \nmany of the gains we have made in our economy in recent years. It would \nfocus on a specific problem of the past but do nothing to deal with the \nnext challenge to the rule of law in our trade policy.\n  I believe that the most at-risk sector of our economy would be \nagriculture. Agriculture today enjoys the biggest trade surplus of any \nsector of our economy. Other countries will see this as an opportunity \nto retaliate against U.S. industry, wiping out export markets that our \nagriculture producers have achieved.\n  We must address the problems of the steel industry in a way that does \nnot violate our international agreements. I believe this can best be \naccomplished by making adjustments to section 201 of the Trade Act of \n1974, which is designed to deal with import surges.\n  Last week, the Senate Finance Committee passed out legislation which \nmodifies section 201 so that it is more responsive to import surges. \nThis legislation is a good first step, but more can be done.\n  The specific problems of perishable agriculture should be addressed \nso that seasonality can be taken into account when determining injury \nto a domestic industry.\n  We must ensure that U.S. industry has recourse to affective and \ntimely relief when they are injured due to illegal import surges. If we \ncannot do this, our entire system of international trade, and the \nhealth of our domestic economy will be at risk.\n  For this reason, I will oppose cloture at this time and ask my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I urge we deal with this problem by making our trade enforcement laws \nmore effective, more able to respond to the challenges of the future, \nand not succumb to a violation of our trade agreements.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to vote for this bill but I \ncan't. I want to because I think part of the steel industry has a \nlegitimate case. But I can't because voting for this bill would make it \nworse than the relief they seek.\n  We have GATT. We have WTO. We have NAFTA. We have access to \naccountability. However, the administration is not allowing that to go \nforward. We have to stay within the system. We have to play by the \nrules.\n  The reason we are debating this is because we haven't had the \nadministration firmly coming forward and saying the steel industry has \na legitimate gripe. They do.\n  I support the Finance Committee approach to it which says we are \ngoing to stick by the rules, and we need to enforce them vigorously.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, my understanding is we have 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 57 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I ask unanimous consent 3 minutes be added to each \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished senior Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in the last 12 months, America has created \n1,950,000 new permanent, productive, tax-paying jobs for the future. We \nhave created 7,500 jobs in every working day for the last 12 months.\n  If we want to continue to benefit from being the world's greatest \ntrading nation, we have to have politicians that are willing to stand \nup and fight for those principles by saying no on bills such as the \nbill before the Senate.\n  Though the bill before the Senate may be well intended, the bill \nbefore the Senate is a job killer, a trade war starter, and it is a \nbill that will destroy 40 jobs in steel-using industries for every one \njob it saves in steel producing.\n  Last year, we exported $222 billion worth of products that used \nsteel; 40 jobs were created in those industries for every one job in \nsteel. It is estimated that the passage of this bill would save about \n1,700 steel jobs at a cost of about $800,000 a job for the American \nconsumer. But that is not counting the jobs we would lose in steel-\nusing industries. It is not counting the jobs we would lose because of \nretaliation from our unfair trade practice.\n  If we want to create 7,500 jobs a day, we have to have the courage to \nstand up and defend the system that creates those jobs.\n  I urge my colleagues to resist the siren song of well-organized \ngroups that have their special interests and look at the general \ninterest of America. When we are creating more jobs than the rest of \nthe world combined, more jobs than in all of Europe, Japan, China, and \nevery developing country in the world combined, why should we be \nattacking the very system that created those jobs?\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this bill.\n  Mr. ROTH. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 46 seconds.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to Senator Bond.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I point out that over the last 6 years prior \nto 1998, the steel industry experienced 6 straight years of growth in \ndomestic steel shipments.\n  In 1998, there is a downturn. There is a downturn because of the \ncollapse in the Asian economy, because of the General Motors strike. \nThat is unfortunate. We don't want to see those jobs lost.\n  When you talk about illegal dumping, there are laws against illegal \ndumping. They are being enforced and they are being enforced \neffectively.\n  What we are being asked to do in this bill is to put at risk the 20 \nproduction jobs for every one steel job; 20 production jobs depending \non using steel for the one job in the steel industry.\n  That could be a disaster for our economy.\n  The chairman has already pointed out the cost to the taxpayers, to \nthe consumers. In my State of Missouri, workers in agriculture, in the \nairplane industry, and small businesses would suffer a loss of jobs and \na loss of opportunity if we adopted this measure.\n  I join with the chairman and the ranking member in urging we oppose \nthis measure.\n  Mr. President, I offer a few other points on top of the excellent \narguments laid out by my colleagues as to why this bill is a bad idea.\n  The reasons for the surge in steel imports and the decrease in \nemployment in the steel industry are the result of numerous factors and \ncomplex conditions. There are a number of forces at work, but the \ndifficult times faced by the steel industry are largely due to economic \ncycles and conditions. I believe that the industry is asking Congress \nto take action on its behalf to rectify a status caused by unfavorable \nconditions. We have a large and diverse economy, with many factors \ndependent on one another. Taking legislative action on behalf of one \nindustry could have wide and profound ripple affects on may industries \nthat are not for the better and would be a very unwise precedent. The \nreaction to this legislation could destroy jobs in Missouri industries \nfrom agriculture to airplanes and many others.\n  These conditions have not been receiving the level of attention that \nthey deserve in the discussion as to whether erecting trade barriers is \nthe proper approach, if there is an approach, to reducing the increase \nin steel imports.\n  The largest consumers of steel are automobile manufacturers and \nconstruction--two industries whose health is directly related to the \nhealth of the economy. We all are aware of the economic conditions \nfacing the Asian nations, particularly facing Japan and the Southeast \nAsian Nations. This was a very sudden and dramtatic turn of economic \nfortunes. Previously, those economies had a voracious appetite for \nsteel in the years proceeding their economic problems. The skylines of \nthe Asian business capitals have been transformed from those of small \ntowns into cosmopolitan metropolises rivaling many American cities. But \ntoday, the streets of Bangkok are littered with dozens of highrise \nconstruction\n\n[[Page S7404]]\n\nprojects that have ground to a halt. Demand for steel overseas has \ncollapsed.\n  Prior to that collapse, U.S. steel manufactures were enjoying good \ntimes. Indeed, a decline in domestic steel shipments was witnesses in \n1998, but the decline, which was slight, came on the heels of six \nstraight years of growth. The industry enjoyed good times, they \nbenefited from the growth in demand, from the construction boom here \nand abroad. But economic upheaval abroad has had a major affect on \ndemand, prices, productivity and profit. Capacity was moving along only \nto face an almost instanteous drop in demand. Those factors as having \ncontributed to the drop in demand have been minimized. Another factor, \nthe labor stoppage at General Motors last summer, has barely been \nmentioned.\n  Businesses endure business cycles. I have all the confidence that the \nindustry will take the steps necessary to remain competitive, but \ntaking this legislative action to address the conditions of one \nindustry is unwise. Those factors have been minimized as contributing \nto the decline in demand around the world. Another factor, the labor \nstoppage at General Motors last summer, cannot be underestimated for \nits impact on demand and prices.\n  We are being asked to take legislative action to protect a single \nindustry from conditions that are largely the result of the economy and \ntheir business decisions and planning. An act such as this cannot be \ntaken without having severe and far reaching consequences for many \nother industries. As we have heard on the floor of the Senate, and \ntheir own business decisions taking legislative action that will \nbenefit a single industry is a purely protectionist act.\n  Mr. President, we have made a commitment in this country to advancing \nfreer trade and open borders. I believe it is in the best interest of \nour country and in the best interests of future generations. Trade has \nmany benefits. The competition has led to dramatic improvement in the \nefficiency and the profitability of the domestic auto industry. It has \nled to improvements in the efficient and profitability of the domestic \nsteel industry. Prior to the year 1998, shipments of steel increased \nfor six straight years. I believe that growth will return. The benefits \nare seen all around us in the form of more efficient industries, \ncheaper products and better made products.\n  Trade also advances our standard of living. As we enjoy the benefits \nof this communications revolution, open markets will permit it to be \nprolonged. If other countries close down their markets, the avenues to \ncontinue to sell these products will begin to evaporate. There is no \ndispute the types of jobs that have been created because of this \nrevolutions--they are high paying and highly skilled jobs, the type of \njobs that have contributed to the continuing escalating standard of \nliving in the United States.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield me 15 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The pain is real, the need is real, but the answer is \nwrong. We are not voting up and down on this bill. We are voting to \nproceed. I am going to vote to proceed in the hope that between now and \nthe time we vote on this bill, the administration and others understand \nthere is a need for an answer. This is not the answer. I would vote \nagainst the bill, but I will vote to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, has all time been consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No; 4 minutes 25 seconds remain.\n  Mr. LOTT. At the appropriate time, I will use leader time to wrap up \ndebate on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the junior Senator \nfrom West Virginia for his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I will not even take that amount of \ntime. Senator Gramm and Senator Nickles and others, have said vote \nagainst this bill. You will have a chance to vote against this bill. \nThat is not what we are about today. We are voting on the motion to \nproceed to discuss an extraordinarily complex issue, the ramifications \nof which a lot of people do not know. It has been pointed out we are in \nviolation of WTO. It has not been pointed out we are trying to follow \nour Trade Act, which we ourselves passed in the Congress and which was \nsigned by a previous President.\n  Please, this is the motion to proceed. We traditionally are fair \nabout these things. This is a complex subject. Steel is only produced \nin 16 States in a major way. A lot of people have a lot to learn.\n  We are not voting on the quota bill. We are voting on the motion to \nproceed to simply talk about it. We have had a very high barrier to \nreach.\n  Finally, I say the crisis is not over. I repeat that. The first 4 \nmonths of this year compared to the first 4 months of last year--last \nyear being the worst year in history in terms of imports--steel imports \nwere only down by 5 percent. The crisis lives. The time to vote for an \nhonest discussion of the issue is now. We can do that by voting yes on \nthe motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to pick up where the Senator from \nWest Virginia left off, and that is to make very clear what we are \nvoting on today. We are not voting on a steel quota bill. We are voting \nsimply to bring the issue to the floor of the Senate for open debate \nand discussion and amendment. I do not think anyone in this Chamber can \nsay what has gone on in the steel industry has been good for America. I \nhave heard from some of the speakers--incredibly so--that somehow or \nanother this was good for American jobs; we create American jobs when \npeople illegally, against our trade laws, being subsidized by foreign \ngovernments, dump product into this country--that somehow that is good \nfor America.\n  I do not think it is good for America. We have laws that are in place \nto stop that because we think it is unfair. We think that is illegal. \nSo when I hear these arguments that we have to let the marketplace \nwork, the fact is the marketplace is not working. The administration is \nnot working in enforcing our laws. So what we are saying is, the \nCongress needs to get to work. Congress needs to get to work, to talk \nabout how we can put this together.\n  The Senator from Michigan talked about the bill that came out of the \nFinance Committee. That could be an amendment to this bill. It could be \na substitute to this bill. If you want a vehicle to have a fair and \nhonest debate about what our steel policy should be, what our trade \npolicy should be, this is the vehicle to do it. Let's vote on the \nmotion to proceed. Let's bring up this matter. It is an important \nmatter, as the Senator from West Virginia said, to at least 16 States. \nIt has impacted tens of thousands of workers across this country. It is \na very serious, desperate situation for many major companies in the \nUnited States. All we are asking for out of this vote is to let us be \nheard on the floor of the Senate. If you do not like the solution, as \nthe Senator from Delaware said--the junior Senator from Delaware said \nhe does not like the solution--fine. Bring up another measure. Bring up \nan alternative. We will have a debate on that. We will have a vote on \nthat, and we will work our will in the Senate to address an issue that \nneeds to be addressed. That is all we are saying.\n\n  Please, let the folks back in Akron, OH, in Pittsburgh, PA, and \nWeirton, WV, the people in the Senate care about what is going on in \ntheir lives. Let them know we are not deaf to the pain they are going \nthrough in losing their jobs. Let them know by just giving us a chance \nto debate this bill and do something about the crisis in the steel \nindustry in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to use some of my leader time \nnow to close debate on this issue. First, I yield a minute to the \nSenator from Idaho to comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n\n[[Page S7405]]\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the leader for yielding.\n  This is not an issue about steel. This is an issue about trade. The \nUnited States will be hosting the World Trade Organization's \nministerial meeting in Seattle later this year. If this Senate voted \nout a quota bill at a time when we were expecting to engage the rest of \nthe world in further discussion about knocking down trade barriers to \ngive agriculture and other trade entities greater opportunity in the \nworld market, this Senate and this Government would be sending the \nwrong message.\n  I am not going to argue with the Senator from Pennsylvania. There is \nno question the steel industry has been hurt. Agriculture is being hurt \nas we speak, but we do not close our borders and turn our lights out. \nWe work to build a stronger and more fair trade organization around the \nworld.\n  Furthermore, this act would violate our international obligations \nunder the World Trade Organization and General Agreement on Trade and \nTariffs. By closing the U.S. Steel market, we would encourage other \ncountries to follow our lead and undermine the system that the United \nStates has worked so hard to establish. If we are to expect other \ncountries to honor their obligations under these agreements, we must do \nthe same.\n  Mr. President, raising barriers against steel imports will only \nprovide the steel industry temporary benefits while the American \nconsumers suffer long-term consequences. Products that are made from \nsteel, such as cars, homes, and appliances, will cost more to produce \nand will become more expensive to consumers. For example, large U.S. \ncompanies, such as Cargill and Hewlett Packard, that have substantial \nbusiness in Idaho would be adversely affected. This situation will \ncause American consumers to purchase less and put millions of American \njobs at risk. These consequences far exceed the risks the steel \nindustry is facing.\n  I yield the time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, at the request of the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, and others, we are going to have this vote \ntoday. They made the point this was an important issue to them. They \nthought there should be some discussion about it and asked for an \nopportunity to have some debate and a vote. Little did I know at the \ntime it was going to be a weekly event.\n  Last week it was the revolving fund loan for steel. This week it is \nthe quota bill. Next week it will be something else. In fact, the \nFinance Committee has reported out something, and it is probably, of \nthe three options, the only one we should be considering. But do not \nfool yourselves; this is not an inconsequential vote. Don't be saying \nwe can vote for this on the motion to proceed and then we can vote \nagainst it later on. In order to go forward, the proponents have to get \n60 votes today but only 51 tomorrow.\n  So I urge my colleagues, do not say, I'll give them a procedural \nvote. What you may be giving them is something that would be very \ndangerous, because we then could be voting on the substance itself. I \nthink the consequences of such a vote that would befall America's \neconomy and our trade policy would be dire, indeed. Not only would it \nincrease the burden on our consumers, it would also run counter to our \ninternational trade agreements, and it would adversely affect our \nbusinesses and farmers that depend upon access to these international \nmarkets. There is no question this bill would undercut the economic \ngrowth we enjoy today. It would be starting down an extremely dangerous \npath.\n  We all struggle with similar issues in our own States in one area or \nanother--perhaps agriculture here, textiles there, something else \nelsewhere. But free trade has been proven, time and time again, to \nbenefit America, to benefit American consumers. It is the right thing \nto do, and we should not start down the trail of passing quotas here, \nthere, or somewhere else.\n  I urge my colleagues, vote against cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the cloture motion \nhaving been presented under rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to \nread the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 66, H.R. 975, The Steel Import \n     Limitation Bill.\n         Trent Lott, Rick Santorum, Mike DeWine, Jesse Helms, Ted \n           Stevens, Harry Reid, Byron Dorgan, Orin Hatch, Jay \n           Rockefeller, Robert C.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n\n\n                                  Vote\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate \nthat debate on the motion to proceed to the consideration of H.R. 975, \nan act to provide for a reduction of the volume of steel imports, and \nto establish a steel import notification and monitoring program, shall \nbe brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are required under the rule. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 42, nays 57, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 178 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--42\n\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--57\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bunning\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Smith (OR)\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     McCain\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 42, the nays are \n57.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee just made this remark to me. He is too modest, \nperhaps, to say it himself. He suggested that we have just taken what \nwill likely be the most important vote of this session of the Congress. \nIt was the first such vote we have had, I know, in my 23 years on the \nCommittee on Finance--a solid affirmation of a half century, and more, \nof American trade policy.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, first of all, I want to just thank my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Moynihan, for his\n\n[[Page S7406]]\n\ninvaluable assistance on this most important matter. I think the two of \nus believe very strongly that there will be no more important a vote \nthan the one we just took. It is important from the standpoint of our \nnational economy; it is important from the point of view of our steel \nindustry; it is important from the standpoint of our workers. I know it \nwas a very difficult vote for many people, but I want to express my \npublic appreciation for their assistance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I voted to invoke cloture. It was a \ndifficult vote. The chairman of the Finance Committee and the Senator \nfrom New York deserve a great deal of credit for bringing this up the \nway they did. I regret we didn't get cloture. I think the bill would \nhave needed work, I must say, before it reached final passage, had \ncloture been invoked.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7406-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7406-S7408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    FOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEARS 2000 AND 2001\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may, I ask what the pending business is \nin the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, up to 15 minutes is \nallotted to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that the managers of the \npending bill graciously agreed to include one of two of the amendments \nI had proposed to offer in the managers' package that will be adopted \nlater today. I extend my thanks to Senator Biden and Senator Helms.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, it is true; we \nhave accepted it. It is a very good amendment and we are delighted to \ndo that.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator from Delaware. Let me briefly describe \nwhat that amendment is, and then I am also going to propose a second \namendment, which, again, the chairman of the committee and the ranking \nmember are familiar with. My intent is not to force a vote on that \namendment but to raise the issue included in the amendment. The \namendment that will be adopted later today would direct the Office of \nthe Inspector General of the Department of State ``to make every \nreasonable effort to ensure that each person named in a report of \ninvestigation by that office be afforded an opportunity to refute \nallegations or assertions that may be contained in such report about \nhim or her.''\n  In the interest of accuracy and thoroughness, the amendment would \nalso require the inspector general to include exculpatory information \nabout an individual that is discovered in the course of the \ninvestigation to be included in the final report produced by the \ninspector general.\n  I am not going to take a great deal of the Senate's time on the \nspecific details of this amendment because I know the managers very \nmuch wish to complete action on this bill. But it seems what I have \nsaid about this amendment is common sense. One would assume that what I \nhave said would be the case already. If allegations involving a \ncriminal matter would be raised about any citizen of this country, \nunder due process that citizen would have the right to know about those \nallegations and an opportunity to respond to those allegations, and any \nexculpatory information would be included in the determination of \nwhether or not to go forward. We would assume that to be the case.\n  Candidly, I must tell you, when investigations are done by the \ninspector general at the State Department--and, regrettably, other \nagencies--that is not the case. So this amendment on this bill is \ndesigned to correct the problem at the State Department. It doesn't go \nany further than that.\n  I want to thank Senator Helms and Senator Biden for their assistance \nwith this amendment and mention, in particular, that Senator Helms and \nI will be including a colloquy for the Record that clarifies technical \nmatters with respect to the intent and scope of this amendment. I have \nproposed this amendment because I truly believe that it will improve \nthe functioning and work product of the Office of the Inspector General \nin carrying out her investigations.\n  I also have another motive as well. It is a matter of fundamental \nfairness, in my view.\n  Many of the investigations that the IG deals with in the course of \nher duties would be improved, in my view, were the individuals involved \ngiven an opportunity to comment about the information developed in the \ncourse of the investigation as it relates to those individuals. Sadly, \nthis is not the general practice of the inspector general, although it \ndoes happen in some cases at the discretion of the inspector general. \nIn most cases, a report gets finalized from the inspector general, and \nthe individual never gets a chance to correct what may be factual \ninaccuracies before a decision is taken to refer the matter to the \nJustice Department, or to the Director General of the State Department \nfor possible criminal prosecution or for disciplinary action.\n  I think it is only fair to allow an individual to be provided that \ninformation prior to some disciplinary action being recommended, \nbecause, frankly, even though there is a grievance process, there is a \ntendency in the Congress to assume that the inspector general has \naccurately stated the case and the individual's promotion prospects are \nput into jeopardy.\n  The chairman and ranking member know that I propose this amendment in \npart because I know firsthand that had the inspector general checked \nout some of the information her investigators erroneously included in \none of their reports related to this Senator, that information would \nnever have been part of the report.\n  In fact, I ask unanimous consent at this point to have printed in the \nRecord some correspondence between myself and the inspector general.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 1996.\n     Hon. Jacquelyn L. Williams-Bridgers,\n     Inspector General, Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Williams-Bridgers: I am writing to you with \n     respect to a report produced by your office late last year \n     concerning an investigation conducted about matters related \n     to the U.S. Embassy in Dublin and the U.S. Ambassador Jean \n     Kennedy Smith--``Special Inquiry, Embassy Dublin, Republic of \n     Ireland, Jean Kennedy Smith, Ambassador, Dennis A. Sandberg, \n     Deputy Chief of Mission, December 29, 1995.''\n       I am shocked and angered by the cavalier manner in which \n     your office saw fit to include my name in this report eight \n     times, purporting to represent my conversations, comments or \n     intentions with respect to individuals employed at the U.S. \n     Embassy in Dublin, without ever making any effort to contact \n     me or my office for comment. Had you done so, I would have \n     told you in the strongest terms that there was absolutely no \n     truth to the suggestion made in the report that I took or \n     sought to take retribution against individuals in the Embassy \n     because of some policy or personality differences that they \n     may have with Ambassador Smith.\n       I am certain anyone who reads this report will be shocked \n     to discover that never once was I contacted by your \n     ``investigators.'' It would seem to me that a very basic \n     element of any credible and professional investigation is \n     that anyone who might be able to be shed light on the matter \n     under investigation be contacted, particularly when you \n     intend to include that individual's name in the final report. \n     I wonder how many other individuals whose names are mentioned \n     in this report were never contacted or interviewed by your \n     office? Frankly, the clear misrepresentations contained in \n     the report as it relates to me seriously call into question \n     the quality and integrity of the report in its entirety.\n       I believe that simple fairness and professionalism dictate \n     that I receive an apology from your office for such \n     unprofessional behavior.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                              Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Department of State,\n\n\n                                        The Inspector General,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 1996.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: I am writing in response to your letter \n     of March 6, 1996, and as a followup to our telephone \n     conversation last night concerning our December 29, 1995, \n     Special Inquiry of Embassy Dublin.\n       Let me begin by stating emphatically that this office is in \n     possession of no information whatever which would suggest \n     that you ``took or sought to take retribution against \n     individuals in the Embassy because of some policy or \n     personality differences they may have had with Ambassador \n     Smith.'' Our intention in the Dublin report was merely to \n     convey the fear that was engendered in the minds of career \n     employees by the clear misuse of your name and position by an \n     individual who purported to speak for the Ambassador. Indeed, \n     while Ambassador Smith\n\n[[Page S7407]]\n\n     confirmed that she told you about the dissent cable, she \n     emphatically denied that she provided you or anyone else with \n     the names of the dissenters. We have no reason to believe \n     that she did. Moreover, Ambassador Smith herself never \n     suggested to us that you made the critical comments \n     attributed to you by her assistant and, again, we have no \n     reason to believe that you did. Because we believed that your \n     name and title was bandied about without your knowledge or \n     authorization in what amounted to a brazen fear campaign, we \n     never attempted to interview you concerning the matter. That \n     was a clear mistake on our part.\n       In retrospect, at a minimum, we should have made it \n     absolutely clear in our report that we had no reason to \n     believe the assertions made about you, either with respect to \n     your purported reaction upon being told of the conduct of the \n     Dublin dissenter or with regard to your alleged intention to \n     personally discuss the matter with the affected employees. \n     While we repeatedly used modifiers such as ``reportedly'' \n     when discussing anything relating to what you were alleged to \n     have said, I now realize that we should have provided you \n     with an opportunity to comment. The Boston Herald article of \n     March 5, 1996, clearly demonstrated how mischief could be \n     made of your name in this matter. I apologize for not being \n     more sensitive to how our language could be misconstrued. I \n     intend to use this error constructively to ensure that such a \n     problem does not recur.\n       The Privacy Act compels us in the normal circumstances to \n     redact names, titles, and identifying information from \n     sensitive reports prior to their public release. Had this \n     report been requested through the Freedom of Information Act \n     or the Privacy Act, we most certainly would have redacted \n     your name and title from the report. We are required, \n     however, to provide, unredacted reports to relevant oversight \n     committees at the Chairman's request.\n       In accordance with the mandate of the Inspector General Act \n     to keep the Congress fully informed of matters within its \n     jurisdiction, I provided, upon request, copies of the \n     unredacted Dublin Special Inquiry to the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee on Wednesday, February 28, 1996. My \n     transmittal letter reiterated that this report had not been \n     reviewed in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act or \n     the Privacy Act for release to the public and that any \n     improper release of information from this report would \n     seriously undermine my statutory responsibilities in the \n     Department.\n       While I am certain that this is of little consolation to \n     you, I firmly believe that the reason we did not attempt to \n     interview you is that we felt that you had done nothing \n     wrong. I recognize that our subjective judgment in that \n     regard is not necessarily clear from an objective reading of \n     the report. Again, for that I apologize.\n           Sincerely,\n                                   Jacquelyn L. Williams-Bridgers.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I was never asked about the allegations, nor \napparently was anyone else in this report conducted by the inspector \ngeneral. The report alleged that I had tried to punish or to harm in \nsome way two State Department employees for using the dissent channel \nby blocking their promotions internally. When I questioned the IG about \nthe matter, she admitted that her investigators had not done a very \nprofessional job. There was not a shred of evidence within the \nDepartment to indicate that I had done anything with regard to this \nmatter. I didn't even know who these people were, nor did anyone on my \nstaff.\n  Had I been given access to those portions of the report as they \nrelated to me, I think this mistake would have been caught and it would \nnever have been included in the final report. The inspector general did \nsubsequently apologize to me both personally and in writing. I am \ngrateful to her for that; however, I am not sure that ordinary Foreign \nService officers or political appointees would have been given similar \ntreatment, and the damage to their careers and reputations would have \nalready occurred in any event.\n  That is why I believe this amendment is very important. I thank again \nSenator Helms and Senator Biden and their staffs for helping put this \nmatter together. This way it would at least allow for people who are \ncharged with these matters to have an opportunity to respond, to know \nwhat they are being charged with so that corrections can be made.\n  Again, I emphasize that if you are not a well-known individual, you \nmight not get the kind of apology and the corrections that I think \nought to be made. That is why I believe this amendment is important.\n  Let me turn, if I can, to a second amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a moment \nbefore he turns to the second amendment, I can't emphasize how \nimportant I think the change is that the Senator suggests and the \nenthusiasm with which we accept the amendment.\n  I happen to like the Senator's second amendment that he is going to \nwithdraw. I hope that will happen in the remainder of this year. If we \ncan't get it done this year, I hope we can next year. I hope the \ncommittee will take a look at the entire functioning of the inspector \ngeneral's office. Quite frankly, a similar thing came up in my other \ncommittee, the Judiciary Committee.\n  Quite frankly, I think we initiated reforms that were needed a decade \nor more ago to provide for these inspector generals, and they are \nthroughout the Government, which is a good thing. It is not a bad \nthing. But what we haven't done, in my opinion, is we haven't given the \nsame kind of scrutiny and oversight into how the offices function as we \nhave, for example, the Attorney General's office, or the overall \nfunctioning of the State Department.\n  I hope this is the beginning of not any kind of witch hunt but just a \nserious, thoughtful oversight about whether or not the inspector \ngeneral's authority puts it in a position where it has sort of \nincrementally involved itself in a way that the rights of individuals \nwho are being looked at or who are caught up in a net are, quite \nfrankly, not treated the way we would expect, for example, the U.S. \nAttorney's Office to proceed.\n  I thank the Senator. As I said, I like the second amendment which he \nis going to be withdrawing. Hopefully, we will have an opportunity, \nwith his leadership, to revisit that on another piece of legislation, \nor on the floor independently.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 690\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 690.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 690.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section--\n\n     SEC.   . TRANSFER OF AUTHORITY FOR CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS \n                   FROM STATE DEPARTMENT INSPECTOR GENERAL TO \n                   DIPLOMATIC SECURITY SERVICE.\n\n       (a) Section 37(a)(1) of the State Department Basic \n     Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2709(a)(1)) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(1) conduct investigations--\n       ``(A) concerning illegal passport or visa issuance or use; \n     and\n       ``(B) concerning potential violations of Federal criminal \n     law by employees of the Department of State or the \n     Broadcasting Board of Governors.''\n       (b) Section 209(c)(3) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 \n     (22 U.S.C. 3929(c)(3) is amended by adding the following--\n       ``In such cases, the Inspector General shall immediately \n     notify the Director of the Diplomatic Security Service, who, \n     unless otherwise directed by the Attorney General, shall \n     assume the responsibility for the investigation.''\n       (b) The amendment made by this section shall take effect \n     October 1, 2000.\n       (c) Not later than February 1, 2000, the Secretary of State \n     and the State Department Inspector General shall report to \n     the appropriate congressional committees on--\n       (1) the budget transfer required from the Inspector General \n     to the Diplomatic Security Service to carry out the \n     provisions of this section;\n       (2) other budgetary resources necessary to carry out the \n     provisions of this section;\n       (3) any other matters relevant to the implementation of \n     this section.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment would transfer the authority \nfor criminal investigations from the State Department Office of \nInspector General to the Office of Diplomatic Security in cases of \npassport fraud and to the Attorney General in cases of other potential \ncriminal offenses.\n  Let me say at the very outset that I realize this is a very \ncontroversial amendment. But I would like to take this opportunity to \nexplain to my colleagues why I have decided to discuss this matter \ntoday.\n  Based upon a number of inspector general investigations I have \nreviewed, I question whether the inspector general, who is not a \nlawyer, should be supervising criminal investigations at all. The \noriginal mission of the inspector general was to perform routine audits \nboth to examine financial records and to review the operations of \nvarious programs.\n  The inspector general also is charged with inspecting overseas \ndiplomatic\n\n[[Page S7408]]\n\nmissions and domestic bureaus to ensure that the State Department is \nperforming with maximum efficiency and using resources appropriately. \nCertainly the inspector general can, and should, continue to \nconcentrate in these areas. But criminal investigations are far more \ncomplex and sensitive than routine audits and inspections.\n  I think many of my colleagues would be surprised at the type and \nscope of investigations that the State Department inspector general \nundertakes, and, frankly, at the number of matters that get referred to \nthe Justice Department for further action which the Justice Department \ndeclines to take up.\n  The inspector general currently decides when and who to investigate. \nThere are virtually no checks--none--on the office once it has \ncommenced a criminal investigation.\n  While the State Department inspector general's office is supposed to \nbe a neutral finder of fact, experience shows that historically that \noffice has acted in a highly adversarial manner trying to establish \ncases that can be referred to the Justice Department.\n  I happen to believe, as an aside, that the inspector general's \nhandling of matters relating to Ambassador Richard Holbrooke \nunnecessarily delayed the consideration of his nomination to the Senate \nand at additional taxpayer cost.\n  Let me, however, commend the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee for the very thorough but expeditious manner in which he has \nguided the Foreign Relations Committee deliberations of that particular \nnomination.\n  I would also like to call to the attention of the Members the final \nreport of the independent counsel appointed to investigate the so-\ncalled ``Clinton passport matter,'' which arose in the course of the \n1992 Presidential elections. Joseph diGenova, the independent counsel \nin that case, took the State Department Office of the Inspector General \nto task for the sloppiness and lack of professionalism with which it \nconducted the initial investigation of this matter. He concluded by \nsaying that this matter should never have been referred for criminal \nprosecution, nor should an independent counsel have been appointed.\n  It is not my intention to push this amendment to a final vote. I know \nthe managers of the bill and the members of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee have some questions about this amendment as it is currently \ndrafted. I respect their judgment tremendously. At the very least, \nhowever, I believe there is a need for an independent agency, the \nGeneral Accounting Office, to take a long and hard and serious look at \nthe practices of the inspector general's office with respect to \ncriminal investigations and assess whether these offices are the \nappropriate places for criminal matters to be looked at.\n  These offices were set up to conduct and perform certain valuable and \nimportant functions. In my view, as with so many other offices, once \nthey get started they go off into areas they lack expertise in and \nconduct investigations which are questionable, at best. This has \nhappened, with little or no checks and balances.\n  Even under the independent counsel law, I point out, a person is \nentitled to know what they are charged with and given a chance to \nrespond to the allegations raised. Under the Inspector General's \ninvestigations, a person is not given those rights.\n  Fundamental due process would seem to insist everyone be given the \nopportunity to respond to charges leveled against them.\n  I think this is a serious matter. I am hopeful the matter can be \ncorrected without having to go through a legislative route. I think it \ncan be done administratively. I urge the State Department, the \nSecretary of State, and others to make these corrections. If not, I \nwill come back with this amendment next year. I will offer it in \ncommittee and I will offer it on the floor to legislatively deal with \nthis issue.\n  I am anxious to hear other thoughts and ideas on how to correct this \nproblem. I take it seriously when the careers of individuals can be \nruined and destroyed by opening up one of these investigations without \nproviding that individual with an opportunity to respond to those \ncharges.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment I offered a few \nmoments ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7408-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment does not kill the National \nEndowment for Democracy, nor does it cut off one penny from its budget. \nRather, this amendment reforms the grant-making process of the NED.\n  The NED seeks to promote democracy around the world. I believe it is \nonly just and fair that its grant-making process be open and \ncompetitive on a level playing field for all applicants. Mr. President, \n65 percent of NED's grant money is automatically allocated to four so-\ncalled ``core grantees,'' while everyone else has to compete for the \nremaining 35 percent of the budget. I really do not think this is fair.\n  The core grantees have done good work in promoting democracy abroad, \nbut are the programs sponsored by the core grantees so superior to all \nthe other programs we have that we must assume they should \nautomatically get the full 65 percent while everyone else has to \ncompete for a much smaller piece of the pie?\n  My amendment does not cut funding for the NED or even necessarily for \nthese four grantee groups. It just phases out, over a 5-year period, \nthe automatic bonanza these groups get every year. This amendment will \nsimply level the playing field so these groups have to compete for \nfunding like everybody else.\n  So I urge my colleagues to understand this does not cut a penny. It \ndoes not change the basic mission. It just says we have reached the \npoint, with these taxpayers' dollars, where it really should be phased \ndown to the point where everything is done on a competitive basis.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The National Endowment for Democracy for the last 18 years has made \ngrants to organizations all over the world to boost democracy in the \nmost critical areas. It came about during the Reagan administration, in \nwhich the genius of the plan, of pulling together representatives of \nthe Republican Party, the Democratic Party, the National Chamber of \nCommerce, and AFL-CIO, brought checks and balances within our own \npolitical spectrum but\n\n[[Page S7409]]\n\noutside the State Department, outside the Government. For the last 18 \nyears, these grants have not been politicized. As a matter of fact, as \nthere are areas of concern that come to the board of the National \nEndowment, each of the four groups is asked to meet the challenge, to \noffer alternatives competitively for peer review, and then review by \nstaff, and finally votes by members.\n  I have been privileged to serve for the last 8 years on the board of \nthe National Endowment for Democracy. At each meeting I have examined \nover 100 of these grants. They come, each time, with really superior \neffort by four entities we can count on, the two party institutes in \nthe Chamber and the labor people of this country.\n  I see no need to amend that process. It is a process that has worked \nwell. It is a process that has not been politicized. It has a good \ntrack record. If the Senator's amendment is adopted, we will inevitably \nhave a fairly large bureaucracy of people sifting through grants from \nall sources.\n  Grants do come from some 250 different entities and formulate at \nleast a third of the grants that are awarded by the board. Some of \nthese are worthy and some are not so worthy, but we can count upon \nquality of response, and I think that is important. It is a situation \nof trying to fix something that is not broke, and I hope Senators will \nresist that impulse. There is not a compelling need for change. The \namendment did not have any type of airing in a hearing for examination \nand for testimony by witnesses on either or all sides.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for 5 seconds?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I agree with the Senator from Indiana and suggest it has \nthe added benefit of taking four groups on different ideological ends \nof the spectrum and having them cooperate, work together. It has a \nsalutary impact on how they function relative to one another overall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Feingold amendment to the State \nDepartment authorization bill would have the effect of diminishing the \nstanding enjoyed by the four principal grantees--and partners--of the \nNational Endowment for Democracy.\n  When the Endowment was established in 1983, the Congress envisioned \nthat four core grantees would be established along with the NED to \ncarry out its mission--the National Democratic Institute (NDI), the \nInternational Republican Institute (IRI), the Center for International \nPrivate Enterprise (CIPE) affiliated with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nand the AFL-CIO's Solidarity Center. The reason for this decentralized \napproach was a belief--shared by leading Democrats and Republicans \nalike--that the promotion of democracy is an enduring American interest \nand that representatives of American civil society would be better able \nthan government officials to help their counterparts--political \nparties, labor movements, business associations and civic groups--that \nare struggling to build democratic systems in their own countries. \nPrivate organizations doing private work in the public interest ought \nto be supported and expanded by federal funding.\n  The National Endowment for Democracy has been debated on this floor \non numerous occasions, most recently at some length in 1997, after \nwhich the Senate voted 72 to 27 to reaffirm its support for the \nEndowment and its programs. Along with successive Administrations--\nincluding those of Presidents Reagan, Bush and Clinton alike--this body \nhas consistently voiced its support for the mission and unique \ncontribution to the spread of democracy by this organization.\n  The Feingold amendment would eliminate the concept of the ``core \ngrantees'' of the Endowment which is the heart of the operational \npremise that the NED embodies. While the amendment purports to make the \nEndowment more efficient and effective by making all NED grants \ncompetitive, it would actually have the opposite effect. If passed, the \namendment's unintended consequence would be to create a centralized, \nbureaucratic structure that would severely weaken the NED, and slow the \nresponsiveness of the core grantees. It would also oblige the \nRepublican and Democratic institutes to compete with one another for \nthe same funding, so instead of working in tandem to promote American \nideals abroad, they would be set at odds with each other. The same \nwould happen with the institutes for business and labor: conflict, \nrather then comity. The harmonious package of programs would be \ndissolved--for no apparent reason.\n  The Endowment is a cost effective initiative that works. Anyone who \nhas taken the time to examine the activities of the Endowment's core \ngrantees or talked with the beneficiaries of their work in places like \nNorthern Ireland, Nigeria, Indonesia, Cuba and Bosnia, would agree.\n  The NED should be encouraged to continue this mission, which reflects \nthe noblest American political tradition and serves the strategic \ninterests of the United States. It should not be hamstrung by the new \nand unwarranted restrictions that are proposed in this amendment.\n  It was the decision by the Congress that there should be four \nprincipal grantees of the Endowment because they each have a unique \ncontribution to make in promoting democracy. This was a correct \ndecision, and the core grantees should continue to be seen as different \nfrom other grantees and an integral part of the Endowment. If we should \nnow change the Endowment's fundamental premise, the ability of these \ncore grantees to respond quickly to democratic openings will be \nundermined.\n  It has been suggested that under the current arrangement the work of \nthe core grantees is not subject to adequate scrutiny because the \nEndowment each year sets aside a modest allocation of funding for each \nof their programs. This allocation--of 4.1 million for each institute's \nglobal array of programs--does not mean that they get a free ride or a \nblank check. It is important to note that every single one of the over \n200 grants awarded annually by the Endowment is strictly reviewed by \nprogram and financial staff and by a distinguished bipartisan Board of \nDirectors currently chaired by the distinguished former congressman \nfrom Indiana, Dr. John Brademas. This is true regardless of whether the \ngrantee is one of the four core grantees or not. The core grantees are \ncovered by the same reporting and evaluation requirements that effect \nall grantees. Let us leave the decision-making for the allocation of \nfunding in the very able hands of the Endowment's Board of Directors, \nwhich includes some of the most accomplished international affairs \nstrategists and democrats in the United States.\n  This body frequently earmarks organizations that it believes should \nreceive public support. There is nothing wrong nor nefarious in this \napproach. I hope the Senate will take this opportunity to reaffirm its \nstrong support for the work of the four institutes associated with the \nEndowment--the republican and democratic party institutes, and those \nassociated with the labor movement and the business community--by \nvoting No on the Feingold amendment.\n  This amendment seeks to fix something that is not broken. The \namendment will not improve the Endowment, but to weaken its unique \ncapacity to be flexible, responsive and effective. The last thing we \nshould do is to hastily tinker with the internal workings of this \nimportant institution without any serious examination of the supposed \nproblems this amendment is meant to address.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to thank Senator Helms and Senator \nBiden for accepting as part of S. 886, the Foreign Relations \nAuthorization Act, my amendment to remove the requirement that an \nautomated entry-exit program be established at land and sea ports and \nreplace that with a required feasibility study to be completed within 1 \nyear. This amendment would correct a significant error made in the 1996 \nImmigration Act that if left uncorrected will cause a significant loss \nof U.S. jobs in export and tourist industries, and would also \nsignificantly harm our relations with Canada and Mexico.\n  This amendment is the same as legislation that passed the Senate in \ntwo forms last year, with the sole exception of provisions related to \nthe U.S. Customs Service, which were removed at the request of the \nFinance Committee because it has scheduled a series of oversight \nhearings on the Customs Service, which is also up for reauthorization \nthis year, and the removal of authorizations for the INS. Last year, \nthe legislation passed the Senate first by unanimous consent as a stand \nalone bill (S. 1360) and second, as part of the Commerce, Justice, \nState appropriations bill.\n  Section 110 of the 1996 Immigration Act mandated that an automated \nsystem be established to record the entry and exit of all aliens as a \nmeans to provide more information on individuals who ``over stay'' \ntheir visas. However, this well-intentioned government program, if \nimplemented, would be quite disastrous. Today, when INS or Customs \nofficials inspect people at land borders, they examine papers as \nnecessary and make quick determinations, using their discretion on when \nto inspect further or solicit more information. If every single \npassenger of every single vehicle was required to provide potentially \nvoluminous information and be entered into a computer--even assuming an \nincredibly quick 30 seconds per individual--the traffic delays would \nexceed 20 hours in numerous jurisdictions at both the northern and \nsouthern borders. This would create a human, economic, and even \nenvironmental nightmare in both directions. Last year, Congress delayed \nimplementation of this program until March 30, 2001. But after that \ndate, the crisis will begin.\n  In 1996, the House version of the omnibus immigration bill contained \na measure simply to establish pilot projects to collect entry and \ndeparture records at fewer than a handful of airports. The Senate bill \ncontained a general provision to require an automated entry-exit \nsystem--but also only at airports. Then, in conference, without any \ndebate, a mandatory entry-exit\n\n[[Page S7412]]\n\nsystem to capture the records of ``every alien'' was added.\n  Representative Smith and Senator Simpson, to their credit, conceded \nin a letter to the Canadian Ambassador that it was not the intent of \nthe 1996 Act to cover, for example, Canadians at the northern border. \nHowever, because of the term ``every alien,'' the INS has interpreted \nthe law to require this program to be implemented at all land borders, \nin addition to air and sea ports of entry. To the credit of the INS, it \nconcedes that it cannot implement such a system and the agency \nquestions what it will do if it is forced to do so.\n  The Congress itself never considered such a system. That the \nlegislative proposal was changed fundamentally in conference is clear. \nAs Judiciary Committee Chair Orrin Hatch has stated, ``I think that we \nhave all come to realize that section 110 of the 1996 Act [was] \ninserted in conference with little or no record, [and] no consideration \nor debate. It was well intended, there is no question, but I think \npoorly constructed.''\n  I would like to thank Senators Kennedy, Grams, Leahy, Burns, McCain, \nGorton, Craig, Murkowski, Murray, Jeffords, Snowe, Smith of Oregon, \nDorgan, Levin, Moynihan, Schumer, Mack, Durbin, and Hagel for \ncosponsoring this amendment and for their support along the way on this \nbattle to prevent the major disruptions that Section 110 would cause to \nour economy and our international relations. I would particularly like \nto express my appreciation for the leadership on this amendment \ndisplayed by Senator Grams and his staff, who are trying to save jobs \nfor the people of Minnesota that would be lost if this automated entry-\nexit system came into effect at the northern border. Mr. President, I \nyield the floor.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 713\n\n     (Purpose: To require reports with respect to the holding of a \n                     referendum on Western Sahara)\n\n       On page 115, after line 18, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  .

Mr. President, I'm delighted that the managers' \namendment includes the provision Senator Gordon Smith, Senator Leahy, \nand I sponsored to require the State Department to report on progress \non the July 2000 referendum in the Western Sahara, and I commend \nSenators Helms and Biden for including this provision in the managers' \namendment.\n  Since 1988, the United Nations has sought to organize a free, fair, \nand open referendum on self-determination for the people of the Western \nSahara, the former Spanish colony that Morocco has illegally occupied \nsince 1975.\n  The International Court of Justice, the Organization of African \nUnity, the United States, and many other nations throughout the world \nhave not recognized Morocco's claim to the area. However, Morocco's \noccupation continues. Tens of thousands of the Sahrawi people languish \nin refugee camps in southern Algeria and have been denied the \nopportunity to determine their own future.\n  A U.N. referendum was originally scheduled for 1992. It has since \nbeen delayed many times, primarily due to the resistance of the \nGovernment of Morocco.\n  In the 1997 Houston Accords, achieved under the leadership of former \nSecretary of State James Baker, and in a U.N. plan last December, the \ninternational community called for the conclusion of the voter \nregistration process and a referendum. Morocco subsequently agreed to \nallow the referendum to occur by July 2000.\n  I know the Administration shares our interest in resolving this long-\nstanding dispute. The State Department should make it clear to both \nparties to this dispute that our government expects the people of the \nWestern Sahara to be allowed to exercise their right to self-\ndetermination in a free, fair, and open referendum by July 2000.\n  Morocco has been a faithful ally of the United States for more than \n200 years, but its refusal to allow the people of the Western Sahara to \ndetermine their own political future undercuts America's efforts to \npromote democratic principles worldwide.\n  The United States can play a constructive role in promoting a \nresolution of this dispute. To promote that objective, the provision \nincluded in the managers' amendment would require the State Department \nto report on January 1, 2000 and again on June 1, 2000 on specific \nsteps being taken by the Government of Morocco and by the Popular Front \nfor the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de Oro (POLISARIO) to \nensure that a free, fair, and open referendum in which the people of \nthe Western Sahara will choose between independence and integration \nwith Morocco will be held by July 2000.\n  The reports will include a description of preparations for the \nreferendum, including the extent to which free access to the territory \nfor independent and international organizations, including election \nobservers and international media, will be guaranteed. Human rights \norganizations and other international organizations must be allowed to \nobserve the referendum.\n  The reports will also include a description of current efforts by the \nDepartment of State to ensure that a referendum will be held by July \n2000 and an assessment of the likelihood that the July 2000 date will \nbe met.\n  They will also include a description of obstacles, if any, to the \nvoter registration process and other preparations for the referendum, \nand efforts being made by the parties and the United States Government \nto overcome those obstacles. Finally, the reports will include an \nassessment of progress being made in the repatriation process.\n  A solution to the conflict over the Western Sahara will enhance \nsecurity and stability in Northern Africa. After more than ten years of \ndelay, the people of the Western Sahara should be permitted to \ndetermine for themselves who will govern them. I look forward to that \nday, and I commend my colleagues for including this provision in the \nbill.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 714\n\n(Purpose: To require the designation of a senior-level State Department \n                   official for Northeastern Europe)\n\n       On page 35, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC. 302. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FOR NORTHEASTERN EUROPE.\n\n       The Secretary of State shall designate an existing senior-\n     level official of the Department of State with responsibility \n     for promoting regional cooperation in and coordinating United \n     States policy toward Northeastern Europe.\n\n               policy coordinator for northeastern europe\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the State Department has been working to \npromote regional cooperation in Northeastern Europe. The idea behind \nthis policy is more fully to integrate the Baltic countries into Europe \nand overcome cold war divisions to promote stability in the region. I \nsupport this approach, and I want to see it institutionalized at the \nState Department by designating a senior-level official with \nresponsibility for coordinating policy toward Northeastern Europe.\n  This policy of integration also reduces tensions, since regional \ncooperation that includes Russia's northwestern regions gives Russia a \nstake in regional stability. The policy will also\n\n[[Page S7413]]\n\nshow Russia that it need not feel threatened by the integration of the \nBaltic States into European institutions. The Baltic countries have \nincreased their ties with the northwestern Russian regions, much the \nway Canada has ties with the border states of the United States. The \nBaltic States benefit as well from regional cooperation with the Nordic \ncountries, further cementing the Baltic nations as part of Europe.\n  It is mutually beneficial for the all the Northeastern European \ncountries to address regional problems, such as environmental problems \ncaused by the former Soviet Union, or burgeoning crime and drug \nsmuggling from the Russian mafia.\n  The Northern European Initiative announced in 1997 is just one \nexample of this policy. It fosters regional cooperation and cross-\nborder ties, relying on the private sector and nongovernmental \norganizations, as well as governments, in the areas of trade and \ninvestment, institution building, law enforcement, nuclear waste \ncontrol, and the development of civil society, among others. Another \npositive step was the signing of the Baltic Charter in 1998 that \nstrengthens Baltic bilateral ties and ties with the United States and \naddresses Baltic security concerns. Regional organizations have been \nset up, including BALTSEA, to coordinate military assistance, as well \nas several joint Baltic efforts at defense cooperation.\n  The State Department has set out on an ambitious agenda that I think \nis going in a very positive direction. However, I am afraid other \ncrises and problems, for instance the many issues that will come up in \nSoutheastern Europe following the crisis in Kosovo, will divert the \nDepartment's attention from this policy and cause it to lose steam. \nTherefore, I am offering this amendment to direct the Secretary to \ndesignate an existing senior-level State Department official with \nresponsibility for coordinating policy toward Northeastern Europe. The \nway this assignment of responsibility would fit in the State \nDepartment's structure is up to the Secretary.\n  I also want to make clear that I mean no criticism of the Assistant \nSecretary for European Affairs by proposing this amendment. On the \ncontrary, I think he has done an extraordinarily good job in pursuing \nthe integration of Northeastern Europe. But with all of Europe on his \nmind, I think it would only further the aims of the bureau to be sure \nthat a senior-level official is designated to coordinate and promote \nthis policy.\n  I appreciate the support of Senator Helms and Senator Biden, and \nunderstand that this amendment has been added to the manager's package.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 715\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n\n                    self-determination in east timor\n\n       Sec.  . (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) On May 5, 1999 the Governments of Indonesia and \n     Portugal signed an agreement that provides for an August 8, \n     1999 ballot organized by the United Nations on East Timor's \n     political status;\n       (2) On June 22, 1999 the ballot was rescheduled for August \n     21 or 22 due to concerns that the conditions necessary for a \n     free and fair vote could not be established prior to August \n     8;\n       (3) On January 27, 1999, President Habibie expressed a \n     willingness to consider independence for East Timor if a \n     majority of the East Timorese reject autonomy in the August \n     ballot;\n       (4) Under the May 5th agreement the Government of Indonesia \n     is responsible for ensuring that the August ballot is carried \n     out in a fair and peaceful way in an atmosphere free of \n     intimidation, violence or interference;\n       (5) The inclusion of anti-independence militia members in \n     Indonesian forces responsible for establishing security in \n     East Timor violates the May 5th agreement which states that \n     the absolute neutrality of the military and police is \n     essential for holding a free and fair ballot;\n       (6) The arming of anti-independence militias by members of \n     the Indonesian military for the purpose of sabotaging the \n     August ballot has resulted in hundreds of civilians killed, \n     injured or disappeared in separate attacks by these militias \n     who continue to act without restraint;\n       (7) The United Nations Secretary General has received \n     credible reports of political violence, including \n     intimidation and killings, by armed anti-independence \n     militias against unarmed pro-independence civilians;\n       (8) There have been killings of opponents of independence, \n     including civilians and militia members;\n       (9) The killings in East Timor should be fully investigated \n     and the individuals responsible brought to justice;\n       (10) Access to East Timor by international human rights \n     monitors and humanitarian organizations is limited, and \n     members of the press have been threatened;\n       (11) The presence of members of the United Nations \n     Assistance Mission in East Timor has already resulted in an \n     improved security environment in the East Timorese capital of \n     Dili;\n       (12) A robust international observer mission and police \n     force throughout East Timor is critical to creating a stable \n     and secure environment necessary for a free and fair ballot;\n       (13) The Administration should be commended for its support \n     for the United Nations Assistance Mission in East Timor which \n     will provide monitoring and support for the ballot and \n     include international civilian police, military liaison \n     officers and election monitors;\n       (b) Policy.--(1) The President, Secretary of State, \n     Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (acting through the United States executive directors to \n     international financial institutions) should immediately \n     intensify their efforts to prevail upon the Indonesian \n     Government and military to--\n       (A) disarm and disband anti-independence militias;\n       (B) grant full access to East Timor by international human \n     rights monitors, humanitarian organizations, and the press;\n       (C) allow Timorese who have been living in exile to return \n     to East Timor to participate in the ballot; and\n       (2) the President should submit a report to the Congress \n     not later than 21 days after passage of this Act, containing \n     a description of the Administration's efforts and his \n     assessment of steps taken by the Indonesian Government and \n     military to ensure a stable and secure environment in East \n     Timor, including those steps described in paragraph (1).\n\n                    self-determination in east timor\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment in support \nof a peaceful process of self-determination in East Timor. I am pleased \nthat Senators Feingold, Reed, McConnell, Harkin, Moynihan, Chafee, \nKohl, Jeffords, Kennedy, Kerry, Feinstein, Murray, Schumer, Boxer, \nDurbin, Wellstone, and Wyden are cosponsoring this amendment. Many of \nthem have worked hard on this issue for as long as they have been in \nthe United States Senate.\n  I understand the amendment will be accepted.\n  Mr. President, today, the Indonesian Government has an historic \nopportunity to resolve a conflict that has been the cause of suffering \nand instability for 23 years. It has made a commitment to vote on \nAugust 21 or 22, on East Timor's future, and recognized its \nresponsibility to ensure that the vote is free and fair.\n  On May 5th, when I introduced a similar resolution, I remarked on \nIndonesia's accomplishments in the past year: President Suharto \nrelinquished power; the Indonesian Government endorsed a ballot on \nautonomy; and the United Nations, Portugal and Indonesia signed an \nagreement on the procedures for that vote.\n  There has been more progress in the past month. Democratic elections \nhave been held and the first members of an international observer \nmission and police force arrived in East Timor.\n  The amendment that we are offering today recognizes many of the \npositive steps that have been taken. A year ago few people would have \npredicted that a settlement of East Timor's future would be in sight.\n  But it also expresses our deep concern that August 21st is quickly \napproaching, and current conditions in East Timor are far from \nconducive to holding a free and fair ballot.\n  Hundreds of civilians have been killed, injured or disappeared in \nongoing violence by anti-independence militias armed by members of the \nIndonesian military for the purpose of sabotaging the vote.\n  The inclusion of anti-independence members in Indonesian forces \nresponsible for establishing security in East Timor threatens the \nneutrality of the military and police, and violates the terms of the \nMay 5th agreement.\n  International human rights monitors and humanitarian organizations \ncontinue to face problems gaining access to the island, and members of \nthe press have been threatened.\n  This amendment calls on the Secretary of State, the Secretary of \nDefense and the Secretary of the Treasury--acting through U.S. \nexecutive directors to international financial institutions--to \nimmediately intensify their efforts to prevail upon the Indonesian \nGovernment to disarm and disband the anti-independence militias.\n\n[[Page S7414]]\n\n  We should be prepared to use all the resources at our disposal, \nincluding our voice and vote at the World Bank, the Asian Development \nBank and other international financial institutions, to convince the \nIndonesians to stop the violence. This is not only their \nresponsibility, it is in their best interests. If the Indonesian \nmilitary succeeds in sabotaging the vote, Indonesia will face \ninternational condemnation.\n  On June 11th, I and other Members of Congress sent a letter to World \nBank President James Wolfensohn about the need for the World Bank to \nuse its leverage with the Indonesian Government. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the test of that letter be printed in the Record at the \nend of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the international community has recognized \nthe urgency of this situation. An international monitoring and police \npresence throughout East Timor is critical to creating a secure \nenvironment.\n  The Administration is shouldering its share of the costs of the UN \nmonitors and police, and its members who arrived in East Timor several \nweeks ago already report some progress in stemming the violence.\n  But far more needs to be done. It is time for the Indonesian \nGovernment and military to do their part--to act decisively to ensure \nthat a free and fair vote can occur.\n  This amendment reinforces what others have said and what the \nIndonesian Government has already committed to do. I thank the managers \nof the bill for accepting the amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                    June 11, 1999.\n     Hon. James Wolfensohn,\n     President, The World Bank,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jim: For many years, we have consistently raised \n     concerns about the failure of the Indonesian Government to \n     respect the human rights of the people of East Timor and to \n     allow them an opportunity to express their right of self-\n     determination. We are writing to convey our deep concern \n     about the escalating violence in East Timor, which has put in \n     doubt the August 8th ballot on East Timor's political future.\n       We have called on the Indonesian Government to stop \n     military and paramilitary violence which threatens to \n     undermine the vote, yet the threats and killings continue \n     unabated. United Nations officials, East Timorese leaders, \n     and members of the Catholic Church, including Bishop Belo, \n     blame the Indonesian military for intentionally seeking to \n     sabotage the vote. We have called on our own Administration \n     to work urgently to pressure Jakarta to take the steps \n     necessary for a free and fair vote.\n       We believe it is now imperative that the international \n     financial institutions (IFIs), most importantly the World \n     Bank, make clear to the Indonesian Government that if the \n     August ballot is not free and fair, continued large scale \n     investment by the IFIs will be in jeopardy. Jakarta must be \n     convinced of what is at stake. If it fails to act decisively \n     to permit a free and fair vote, it will risk becoming a \n     pariah state. The government and army must abide by the May \n     5th UN-sponsored tripartite accord, most specifically by \n     stopping and disarming the anti-independence militias that \n     are using the weapons supplied to them by the Indonesian \n     military to intimidate and attack East Timorese civilians.\n       We appeal to you to personally press the Indonesian \n     Government to create a secure environment for the August vote \n     and to prevent any efforts to restrict aid to East Timorese \n     who have been displaced by the militia violence.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n       Patrick Leahy, U.S. Senator.\n       Russell D. Feingold, U.S. Senator.\n       Daniel Patrick Moynihan, U.S. Senator.\n       Tom Harkin, U.S. Senator.\n       Richard J. Durbin, U.S. Senator.\n       Luis V.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \na peaceful process of self-determination in East Timor. These are both \nexciting and troubling times in Indonesia as a whole, and the future of \nEast Timor may be resolved in the coming months. President Habibie \nhimself indicated that he would work toward resolution of East Timor's \nstatus by the end of the year.\n  The recent Parliamentary elections in Indonesia proceeded peacefully, \nand virtually without incident. It appears as if a democratic \ntransition will be forthcoming, and I am hopeful that the people of \nIndonesia remain committed to free and fair elections. While we have \nsupported these elections, and encouraged a fair process, we \nsimultaneously receive reports of increased social unrest. Clashes \nbetween Muslims and Christians in Ambon are only one indication of the \ntensions which underlie relations between different ethnic groups.\n  The situation in East Timor has historically divided sympathies over \nan acceptable solution, and violent attacks in the region have become \nmore prevalent since the beginning of the year. Evidence has indicated \nthat anti-independence militias have been supported and armed by some \nmembers of the Indonesian military. The end result of such support can \nonly be an increase in the political tensions and violence in East \nTimor. The militias have committed scores of human rights abuses \nagainst the ethnic East Timorese in an effort to suppress any movement \ntowards full independence in East Timor.\n  It is as yet unclear how East Timor's status will ultimately be \nresolved. Solutions from greater autonomy within Indonesia to full \nindependence are only two of the proposals that have been brought \nforward. The international community has sought to encourage an open \ndecision process by the people of East Timor as to what their future \nstatus should hold, but the increased strength of the anti-independence \nmilitias threatens to undermine the process. In order for a free ballot \nto be held in the coming months, the United States must make an effort \nto ensure that the process is fair.\n  I co-sponsored a resolution offered by Senator Leahy to encourage an \nopen ballot on the question of East Timor, but this resolution also \nurges full access by international human rights monitors and the \ndisbanding of the militias. Such steps are critical to the fair \ndetermination of East Timor's future, and I hope that this Congress \nwill continue to show its support for the ballot process.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nSenator Leahy's amendment promoting peaceful self determination for the \npeoples of East Timor and bringing the attention of the United States \nto the long and difficult climb of the East Timorese towards democracy. \nI am pleased to join Senator Feingold as a cosponsor of this amendment \nwhich underscores the importance of the historic opportunity which the \nEast Timorese face, and our duty to support them in their struggle for \npeace and self determination. The upcoming August vote, or \nconsultation, on East Timorese autonomy is crucial, not only for the \nEast Timorese people, but for America and for every nation that \nsupports democracy and stands against the rule of terror and violence \nwhich has shaped twenty years of East Timorese history.\n  The past year has witnessed extraordinary progress. The efforts of \nPortugal, the United Nations, the global community and the East \nTimorese leaders have been impressive. Combined with the willingness of \nthe Indonesian government, these efforts have at last resulted in a \nplan for the peaceful and democratic determination of East Timor's \npolitical destiny. I would like to recognize all those whose courage \nand commitment have led us towards the August consultation, a \nconsultation which will allow the East Timorese, at long last, to \ndecide for themselves how they are to be governed.\n  Nevertheless, much remains to be done. As great an achievement as the \npromised consultation may be, the future is far from certain. East \nTimor, already troubled by years of bloodshed, has seen even greater \nescalations in human rights abuses in recent months. Although it has \nalready buried 200,000 people who have died violently since the 1975 \nIndonesian invasion, East Timor continues to be riven by conflict. \nOrganized campaigns of terror and intimidation have been aimed at East \nTimorese leaders and journalists who favor autonomy. Some international \nobservers have reported that\n\n[[Page S7415]]\n\nEast Timorese have been systematically herded into camps in efforts to \nprovide large blocs of pro-Indonesian votes in the August consultation. \nMilitia activity, violence, and destruction continue unabated.\n  If the violence in East Timor is to cease, the militias must be \nstripped of their weapons and disbanded. International observers will \nplay a critical role, both in the course of the consultation and in the \nimplementation of the results that follow. Only subjecting this process \nto the harsh light of international scrutiny can we hope to prevent \nEast Timor's violent past from serving as prologue to an equally \nviolent future. Without our active participation and support, the hope \nof a lasting peace in East Timor is in danger of being lost.\n  Mr. President, this historic opportunity for peace must not be \nallowed to slip away.

Mr. President, I rise to express serious concerns which \nI have about the amendment offered by the Senator from Connecticut \nregarding investigation procedures at the Office of Inspector General \nfor the Department of State. These concerns are not mine alone, but \nhave been brought to the attention of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee by a number of inspectors general. The amendment requires the \nInspector General for the Department of State to provide each \nindividual mentioned in a report an opportunity to refute any \nallegation or assertion made regarding that person's activities. While \nI understand the Senator from Connecticut's concerns, I fear that the \namendment as written could have serious repercussions for law \nenforcement. For example, providing allegations and assertions to each \nindividual mentioned in a criminal investigation prior to a referral, \nno matter how tangentially involved, could compromise a subsequent \ninvestigation by the Department of Justice. In addition, it could \nreveal sources of information and subject those sources to reprisals \nand chill future cooperation from potential witnesses. Second, the \namendment could create rights that witnesses and targets of other \ninvestigations do not have. It is unclear what litigation or grievances \ncould result from a failure to follow the amendment. Third, there are a \nnumber of unsettled issues in the amendment such as what constitutes \n``exculpatory material'' and whether a subject, witness, or an \nindividual with only marginal relevance to the investigation is \nentitled to review the actual report. Fourth, I understand the State \nDepartment Inspector General is concerned that the reporting \nrequirement could be used to second-guess discretion that she uses in \nher investigations. Finally, by using the ambiguous term \n``assertions,'' the amendment puts an unnecessary burden on the \nInspector General after the report is complete to seek out each person \nnamed and allow them to comment on even the most innocuous assertions \nrelating to them. This will unduly delay the investigative process and \nput a strain on the office's resources.\n  In addition to these concerns about the amendment itself, I am also \nconcerned that it is being offered without any hearings at all or \nconsideration by the Governmental Affairs Committee. As the Chairman is \naware, the Governmental Affairs Committee has jurisdiction over the \nInspector General Act. If there are in fact legitimate concerns that \nthe amendment is intended to address, then perhaps it should apply to \nall inspectors general rather than singling out this particular one.\n  Despite these reservations, I understand the Foreign Relations \nCommittee has worked hard to craft this amendment. Therefore, I will \nnot object to its consideration at this time if the Chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee will agree to work with me in conference to \naddress the concerns that I have raised.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee \nfor his comments. I know that he has a strong interest in the \ninspectors general as well as in properly conducted investigations. I \nappreciate his willingness to work with me in conference to address the \nissues he has raised and I look forward to doing so.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chairman for his work on this bill and I \nlook forward to working with him in conference.\n\n\n                    office of the inspector general\n\n  Mr. Dodd. Mr. President, I want to thank the Chairman of the \nCommittee, Senator Helms, for accepting my amendment as it relates to \nindividuals named in reports of investigations prepared by the Office \nof the Inspector General at the State Department. This amendment would \nprovide these individuals with an opportunity to comment on information \ncontained in the report as it relates to them and to provide \nexplanatory or exculpatory information that may be relevant to the \ninvestigation.\n  Mr. Helms. It is my understanding that it is not the intention of the \nSenator from Connecticut to override key provisions of the Foreign \nService Act, the Inspector General Act of 1978, the Privacy Act of 1974 \nor whistleblower protections with this amendment.\n  Mr. Dodd. That is correct, Mr. President. As you will note from the \nway the amendment has been drafted, I in no way intend to undermine the \nability of the Inspector General to carry out her duties. Subsection \n(c) of my amendment makes it clear that I do not seek to override or \ncall into question existing provisions of law that govern the \ninvestigative practices of the Inspector General or statutory \nprotections of individuals such as those contained in the Privacy Act \nof 1974 or provisions of section 2303(b)(8) of title 5 (relating to \nwhistleblower protection.)\n  I have offered this amendment because I believe that both fundamental \nfairness and good government dictate that an individual mentioned in a \nreport of investigation be given an opportunity to provide information \nas it relates to him, so that the fullest picture is set forth in the \nfinal report of investigation of the Office of the Inspector General.\n  Mr. Helms. Am I correct in saying that it is not the intention of the \nSenator from Connecticut that the full report of investigation be \nturned over to each and every person named in a report, but rather that \nan individual be advised of allegations regarding him?\n  Mr. Dodd. The Senator is correct. I do not seek to have the report \nmade available to every named individual, simply be shown or briefed \norally on the substance of those portions, that bear directly on that \nindividual, consistent with appropriate privacy and whistleblower \nprotections.\n  Nor do I seek with this amendment to grant individuals access to the \ninvestigative files, notes, or interim memos that may have been \ndeveloped during the course of the investigation by the Office of the \nInspector General.\n  I also do not want to overburden the Inspector General in cases where \nan investigation results in nothing of any significance and the case is \nsimply closed. Certainly in such instances the Office of the Inspector \nGeneral need not go through the process of providing information to any \nindividual who might have been named in the course of an investigation.\n  Finally I recognize that there may be certain instances where an \nongoing criminal investigation would be compromised if information were \nmade available to an individual. That is why I chose the words ``shall \nmake every reasonable effort'' to provide a measure of flexibility to \nthe Inspector General. She may determine under certain circumstances \nthat it is inadvisable to make information available. If she does so, \nshe must simply inform the Committees of jurisdiction of the instances \nin which she has not made information available to an individual, as \npart of her reports to Congress, including the rationale for doing so. \nThis information may be provided on a classified basis if necessary.\n  Mr. Helms. Mr. President, I believe this clarifies any questions with \nrespect to this amendment and I believe that the managers are prepared \nto accept this amendment.\n  Mr. Dodd. I thank the managers for their assistance with this matter.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 728\n\n(Purpose: To require the Secretary of State to report on United States \n        citizens injured or killed by certain terrorist groups)\n\n       On page 115, after line 18, insert the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC. 730.

SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING CHILD LABOR.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The International Labor Organization (in this \n     resolution referred to as the ``ILO'') estimates that at \n     least 250,000,000 children under the age of 15 are working \n     around the world, many of them in dangerous jobs that prevent \n     them from pursuing an education and damage their physical and \n     moral well-being.\n       (2) Children are the most vulnerable element of society and \n     are often abused physically and mentally in the work place.\n       (3) Making children work endangers their education, health, \n     and normal development.\n       (4) UNICEF estimates that by the year 2000, over \n     1,000,000,000 adults will be unable to read or write on even \n     a basic level because they had to work as children and were \n     not educated.\n       (5) Nearly 41 percent of the children in Africa, 22 percent \n     in Asia, and 17 percent in Latin America go to work without \n     ever having seen the inside of a classroom.\n       (6) The President, in his State of the Union address, \n     called abusive child labor ``the most intolerable labor \n     practice of all,'' and called upon other countries to join in \n     the fight against abusive and exploitative child labor.\n       (7) The Department of Labor has conducted 5 detailed \n     studies that document the growing trend of child labor in the \n     global economy, including a study that shows children as \n     young as 4 are making assorted products that are traded in \n     the global marketplace.\n       (8) The prevalence of child labor in many developing \n     countries is rooted in widespread poverty that is \n     attributable to unemployment and underemployment among \n     adults, low living standards, and insufficient education and \n     training opportunities among adult workers and children.\n       (9) The ILO has unanimously reported a new Convention on \n     the Worst Forms of Child Labor.\n       (10) The United States negotiators played a leading role in \n     the negotiations leading up to the successful conclusion of \n     the new ILO Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor.\n       (11) On September 23, 1993, the United States Senate \n     unanimously adopted a resolution stating its opposition to \n     the importation of products made by abusive and exploitative \n     child labor and the exploitation of children for commercial \n     gain.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) abusive and exploitative child labor should not be \n     tolerated anywhere it occurs;\n       (2) ILO member States should be commended for their efforts \n     in negotiating this historic convention;\n       (3) it should be the policy of the United States to \n     continue to work with all foreign nations and international \n     organizations to promote an end to abusive and exploitative \n     child labor; and\n       (4) the Senate looks forward to the prompt submission by \n     the President of the new ILO Convention on the Worst Forms of \n     Child Labor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 730\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec.    . (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) \n     was established to prosecute individuals responsible for \n     genocide and other serious violations of international \n     humanitarian law committed in the territory of Rwanda;\n       (2) A separate tribunal, the International Criminal \n     Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), was created with a \n     similar purpose for crimes committed in the territory of the \n     former Yugoslavia;\n       (3) The acts of genocide and crimes against humanity that \n     have been perpetrated against civilians in the Great Lakes \n     region of Africa equal in horror the acts committed in the \n     territory of the former Yugoslavia;\n       (4) The ICTR has succeeded in issuing at least 28 \n     indictments against 48 individuals, and currently has in \n     custody 38 individuals presumed to have led and directed the \n     1994 genocide;\n       (5) The ICTR issued the first conviction ever by an \n     international court for the crime of genocide against Jean-\n     Paul Akayesu, the former mayor of Taba, who was sentenced to \n     life in prison;\n       (6) The mandate of the ICTR is limited to acts committed \n     only during calendar year 1994, yet the mandate of the ICTY \n     covers serious violations of international humanitarian law \n     since 1991 through the present;\n       (7) There has been well substantiated allegations of major \n     crimes against humanity and war crimes that have taken place \n     in the Great Lakes region of Africa that fall outside of the \n     current mandate of the Tribunal in terms of either the dates \n     when, or geographical areas where, such crimes took place;\n       (8) The attention accorded the ICTY and the indictments \n     that have been made as a result of the ICTY's broad mandate \n     continue to play an important role in current U.S. policy in \n     the Balkans;\n       (9) The international community must send an unmistakable \n     signal that genocide and other crimes against humanity cannot \n     be committed with impunity;\n       (b) It is the sense of the Congress that,--\n       The President should instruct the United States U.N. \n     Representative to advocate to the Security Council to direct \n     the Office for Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) to \n     reevaluate the conduct and operation of the ICTR. \n     Particularly, the OIOS should assess the progress made by the \n     Tribunal in implementing the recommendations of the Report\n\n[[Page S7420]]\n\n     of the U.N. Secretary-General on the Activities of the Office \n     of Internal Oversight Services, A/52/784, of 6 February, \n     1998. The OIOS should also include an evaluation of the \n     potential impact of expanding the original mandate of the \n     ICTR.\n       (c) Report.--90 days after enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary of State shall report to Congress on the \n     effectiveness and progress of the ICTR. The report shall \n     include an assessment of the ICTR's ability to meet its \n     current mandate and an evaluation of the potential impact of \n     expanding that mandate to include crimes committed after \n     calendar year 1994.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr President, I rise today to join my distinguished \ncolleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, in offering an amendment to \nencourage a peaceful process of self-determination in East Timor. This \namendment closely mirrors what he and I and several other Senators \nexpress in S. Res. 96, introduced last month. We are offering this as \nan amendment to highlight the significance of the process underway in \nEast Timor that will once and for all determine its political status.\n  As we all know, Indonesian President Habibie announced on January 27 \nthat the government of Indonesia was finally willing to seek to learn \nand respect the wishes of the people in that territory. On May 5, the \nGovernments of Indonesia and Portugal signed an agreement to hold a \nUnited Nations-supervised ``consultation'' on August 8 to determine \nEast Timor's future political status.\n  Despite this positive development, excitement and tension over the \npossibility of gaining independence have in recent months led to a \ngross deterioration of the security situation. Militias, comprised of \nindividuals determined to intimidate the East Timorese people into \nsupport for continued integration with Indonesia and widely believed to \nbe supported by the Indonesian military, are responsible for a sharp \nincrease in violence.\n  Let me recount some of the horror stories I have heard coming out of \nEast Timor recently. To cite just a few examples, pro-government \nmilitias, backed by Indonesian troops, reportedly shot and killed 17 \nsupporters of independence on April 5. Shortly thereafter, pro-\nindependence groups reported clashes, arrests and deaths, as well as \ncivilians fleeing violence in six cities. One of those cities was \nLiquica where at least 25 people were brutally murdered by pro-\ngovernment militias when up to 2000 civilians sought shelter in the \nlocal Catholic church. Later, on April 17, hundreds of East Timorese \nfled the capital of Dili as knife-wielding militias attacked anyone \nsuspected of supporting independence. At least 30 were killed in this \nincident as Indonesian troops made little effort to stop the violence. \nThe perpetrators have not all been on the government side. Over the \nyears there have been atrocities on the pro-independence side as well. \nIn recent months, however, the overwhelming majority of the violence \nhas come from army elements and militias under their effective control. \nOverall, hundreds of civilians have been killed, wounded or \n``disappeared'' in separate militia attacks.\n  Unfortunately, the possibility exists that tension and violence could \nstill terrorize the island between now and the ballot, although I hope \nthat is not the case. Pro-integration militia leaders announced on \nApril 29 that they reject the concept of the upcoming ballot, or \nanything that could be considered a referendum. They have further \nstated that if a ballot leads to independence, they are prepared to \nfight a guerrilla war for decades if necessary to defend Indonesian \nrule of the territory. Independent observers fear that neither side \nwill accept a loss in the ballot, thus setting the stage for a \nprolonged conflict in East Timor. This type of rhetoric does not \nreassure us about the prospects for a successful transition for the \npeople of East Timor, regardless of which form of government they \nchoose. The climate in East Timor today, sadly, may have become too \nviolent for a legitimate poll to take place. Worse yet, the agreement \non the ballot process will be rendered meaningless if people must fear \nfor their lives when they dare to participate in the process.\n  In the May 5 agreement, the Government of Indonesia agreed to take \nresponsibility for ensuring that the ballot is carried out in a fair \nand peaceful way. Unfortunately, it is unclear that they are \nimplementing this aspect of the agreement. Quite the opposite. Whether \nIndonesian troops have actually participated in some of these incidents \nor not, the authorities certainly must accept the blame for allowing, \nand in some cases encouraging, the bloody tactics of the pro-\nintegration militias. The continuation of this violence is a threat to \nthe very sanctity and legitimacy of the process that is underway. Thus, \nthe Leahy-Feingold amendment specifically calls on Jakarta to do all it \ncan to seek a peaceful process and a fair resolution to the situation \nin East Timor.\n  I am encouraged by the calm manner in which the people of Indonesia \nwent to the polls earlier this month to elect a new government. While \nthe election was not perfect, it is a step in the right direction for \nthe people of that nation, and demonstrates an openness not seen in \ndecades there.\n  I believe the United States has a responsibility--an obligation--to \nput as much pressure as possible on the Indonesian government to help \nencourage an environment conducive to a free, fair, peaceful ballot \nprocess for the people of East Timor. I am pleased that we have taken a \nleadership role in offering technical, financial, and diplomatic \nsupport to the recently authorized U.N. Assistance Mission in East \nTimor, known as UNAMET.\n  Our amendment recognizes the very significant progress that has been \nmade so far, in particular the calming impact the very presence of U.N. \nofficials has appeared to have on the security situation in the \ncapital, Dili. Nevertheless, problems still remain, so the amendment \nalso highlights the increase in violence and human rights abuses by \nanti-independence militias and urges the Habibie government to curtail \nIndonesian military support to the militias. The amendment also \nencourages the Government of Indonesia to grant full access to all \nareas of East Timor by international human rights monitors, \nhumanitarian organizations and the press, and to allow all Timorese who \nnow live in exile the ability to return to East Timor to participate in \nthis important ballot.\n  It is not in our power to guarantee the free, fair exercise of the \nrights of the people of East Timor to determine their future. It is, \nhowever, in our interest to do all that we can to work with the United \nNations, other concerned countries, the government of Indonesia and the \npeople of East Timor to create an opportunity for a successful ballot \nprocess. We cannot forget that the Timorese have been living with \nviolence and oppression for more than 23 years. These many years have \nnot dulled the desire of the East Timorese for freedom, or quieted \ntheir demands to have a role in the determination of East Timor's \nstatus.\n  We have to do all we can to support an environment that can produce a \nfair ballot in East Timor now and throughout the rest of this process.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 731\n\n  (Purpose: To require a report on the worldwide circulation of small \n                        arms and light weapons)\n\n       On page 115, after line 18, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. ____. REPORTING REQUIREMENT ON WORLDWIDE CIRCULATION OF \n                   SMALL ARMS AND LIGHT WEAPONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In numerous regional conflicts, the presence of vast \n     numbers of small arms and light weapons has prolonged and \n     exacerbated conflict and frustrated attempts by the \n     international community to secure lasting peace. The sheer \n     volume of available weaponry has been a major factor in the \n     devastation witnessed in recent conflicts in Angola, \n     Cambodia, Liberia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, \n     Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan, among others, and has contributed \n     to the violence endemic to narcotrafficking in Colombia and \n     Mexico.\n       (2) Increased access by terrorists, guerrilla groups, \n     criminals, and others to small arms and light weapons poses a \n     real threat to United States participants in peacekeeping \n     operations and United States forces based overseas, as well \n     as to United States citizens traveling overseas.\n       (3) In accordance with the reorganization of the Department \n     of State made by the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring \n     Act of 1998, effective March 28, 1999, all functions and \n     authorities of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency were \n     transferred to the Secretary of State. One of the stated \n     goals of that Act is to integrate the Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency into the Department of State ``to give new \n     emphasis to a broad range of efforts to curb proliferation of \n     dangerous weapons and delivery systems''.\n\n[[Page S7421]]\n\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \n     the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     containing--\n       (1) an assessment of whether the export of small arms poses \n     any proliferation problems including--\n       (A) estimates of the numbers and sources of licit and \n     illicit small arms and light arms in circulation and their \n     origins;\n       (B) the challenges associated with monitoring small arms; \n     and\n       (C) the political, economic, and security dimensions of \n     this issue, and the threats posed, if any, by these weapons \n     to United States interests, including national security \n     interests;\n       (2) an assessment of whether the export of small arms of \n     the type sold commercially in the United States should be \n     considered a foreign policy or proliferation issue;\n       (3) a description of current Department of State activities \n     to monitor and, to the extent possible ensure adequate \n     control of, both the licit and illicit manufacture, transfer, \n     and proliferation of small arms and light weapons, including \n     efforts to survey and assess this matter with respect to \n     Africa and to survey and assess the scope and scale of the \n     issue, including stockpile security and destruction of excess \n     inventory, in NATO and Partnership for Peace countries;\n       (4) a description of the impact of the reorganization of \n     the Department of State made by the Foreign Affairs Reform \n     and Restructuring Act of 1998 on the transfer of functions \n     relating to monitoring, licensing, analysis, and policy on \n     small arms and light weapons, including--\n       (A) the integration of and the functions relating to small \n     arms and light weapons of the United States Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency with those of the Department of State;\n       (B) the functions of the Bureau of Arms Control, the Bureau \n     of Nonproliferation, the Bureau of Political-Military \n     Affairs, the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law \n     Enforcement, regional bureaus, and any other relevant bureau \n     or office of the Department of State, including the \n     allocation of personnel and funds, as they pertain to small \n     arms and light weapons;\n       (C) the functions of the regional bureaus of the Department \n     of State in providing information and policy coordination in \n     bilateral and multilateral settings on small arms and light \n     weapons;\n       (D) the functions of the Under Secretary of State for Arms \n     Control and International Security pertaining to small arms \n     and light weapons; and\n       (E) the functions of the scientific and policy advisory \n     board on arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament \n     pertaining to small arms and light weapons; and\n       (5) an assessment of whether foreign governments are \n     enforcing their own laws concerning small arms and light \n     weapons import and sale, including commitments under the \n     Inter-American Convention Against the Illicit Manufacturing \n     of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, and \n     Other Related Materials or other relevant international \n     agreements.\n\n          Global Proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, my amendment calls upon the Department \nof State to provide Congress with a report on the global proliferation \nof small arms and light weapons, and State Department activities to \naddress this issue.\n  For fifty years we have been used to thinking about arms control in \nterms of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. But, to my mind, the \nwidespread proliferation of small arms and light weapons has now \nemerged as an equally pressing issue on the international arms control \nagenda.\n  Let me try to sketch out the scope and dimension of this problem, and \nwhy I think it is critical that this issue be included in the first-\nrank of U.S. arms control and security policy:\n  An estimated 500 million illicit small arms and light weapons are in \ncirculation around the globe.\n  In the past decade, an estimated 4 million people have been killed in \ncivil war and bloody fighting. Nine out of ten of these deaths are \nattributed to small arms and light weapons, and, according to the \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross, more than 50% of those killed \nare believed to be civilians.\n  The sheer volume of available weaponry has been a major factor in the \ndevastation witnessed in recent conflicts in Angola, Cambodia, Liberia, \nMozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan, \namong others, as well as the sort of violence endemic to narco-\ntrafficking in Colombia and Mexico.\n  According to a report last year by ABC News, at least seven million \nillicit small arms and light weapons are in circulation in West Africa.\n  According to Human Rights Watch, a variety of small arms and light \nweapons were readily available on the black market in Rwanda prior to \nthe civil war and genocide in that country:\n  In 1994 an AK-47 could be purchased in Rwanda for $250;\n  a grenade for $20; and,\n  a 60mm Mortar Bomb for $85.\n  More than 50 million AK-47s have been manufactured in the last 40 \nyears, far more than are accounted for in government stockpiles or \nregistries. During the past decade it is estimated that more than 1 \nmillion Uzis and 10 million Uzi copies have gone into circulation.\n  According to the South African Institute for Security Studies, an \nestimated 30,000 stolen firearms enter the illegal marketplace annually \nin South Africa. Mozambique, a country whose total population is 15 \nmillion, has more than 10 million small arms in circulation.\n  Although there are no reliable statistics available, numerous \nanalysts and press reports have noted that in recent years various \nactors in the Russian military, government, and mafia have been active \nin selling large quantities of Russian military equipment on the black \nmarket.\n  The United Nations and the Red Cross estimate that there are that \nmore than 10 million small arms are in circulation in Afghanistan, \nwhere the terrorist organization of Osama Bin Laden is based.\n\n  Over 1 million small arms--ranging from pistols to AK-47s to hand \ngrenades--are readily available in arms bazaars on the Pakistani side \nof the Afghan border. Many of these weapons are believed to flow to the \nKashmir, where they contribute to the instability and tension between \nIndia and Pakistan, who both now posses nuclear weapons.\n  The United Nations estimated that over 650,000 weapons disappeared \nfrom government depots in Albania in the three years leading up to the \noutbreak of violence in the Balkans, including 20,000 tons of \nexplosives. The NATO peacekeepers who are now moving into Kosovo may be \nunder threat and danger from these weapons.\n  In fact, the increased access by terrorists, guerilla groups, \ncriminals, and others to small arms and light weapons poses a real \nthreat to U.S. participants in peacekeeping operations and U.S. forces \nbased overseas.\n  Although it is my belief that the United States is not the biggest \ncontributor to the problem of the global proliferation of small arms \nand light weapons--the United Nations has found that almost 300 \ncompanies in 50 countries now manufacture small arms and related \nequipment, a 25% increase in production since 1984--in 1996 the U.S. \nlicensed for export more than $527 million in light military weapons. \nWith the average price of $100-300 per weapon, this represents a huge \nvolume of weapons.\n  Most troubling, there is increased incidence of U.S. manufactured \nweapons flowing in the international black market. In 1998, at the \nrequest of foreign governments, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nand Firearms conducted 15,199 traces of weapons used in crimes.\n  In 1994, Mexico reported 3,376 illegally acquired U.S.-origin \nfirearms. Many of these weapons were originally sold legally to \nlegitimate buyers but then transferred illegally, many to the Mexican \ndrug cartels, once they left the United States: Between 1989 and 1993, \nthe State Department approved 108 licenses for the export of $34 \nmillion in small arms to Mexico, but it performed only three follow-up \ninspections to ensure that the weapons were delivered to and stayed in \nthe hands of the intended users.\n  Other countries have equally porous arms sales and licensing \nregulations: In the United Kingdom, only 24 of 2,181 arms export \nlicenses to 35 countries were refused last year.\n  Clearly this is a huge problem, with profound implications for U.S. \nsecurity interests. As Secretary Albright noted in her speech to the \nInternational Rescue Committee last year: ``The world is awash in small \narms and light weapons.''\n  The purpose of this amendment is very simple. It calls for a Report \nby the Department of State to provide Congress with an assessment of \nthe dimension of the problem, the threats posed by these weapons to \nU.S. interests, and the activities of the Department regarding the \nproliferation of small arms and light weapons.\n\n[[Page S7422]]\n\n  It is my hope that this information will provide policymakers with a \nbetter understanding of this issue, whether sufficient resources are \nbeing devoted to addressing the threats posed to U.S. interests, and if \nadditional resources will need to be directed towards this issue in the \nfuture.\n  I understand that the Managers have cleared and will accept this \nAmendment for inclusion in the State Department Authorization bill. As \na former member of the Foreign Relations Committee it was a pleasure to \nbe able to work again with my former Chairman and Ranking Member, and I \nwould like to thank them for working with me on this Amendment. I look \nforward to the opportunity to continue to work with them on this \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an amendment to \nthe State Department authorization bill. For 75 years academic freedom \nwas squelched in the Soviet Union and the tools to build a democratic \nsociety were lost to its successor states. Thankfully, that is now \npassed. The Russians have the right to claim that they freed their own \ncountry from the horrors of a decayed Marxist-Leninist dictatorship. \nThe Russian people and their leaders have something about which to be \nproud.\n  I rise in that spirit to discuss an amendment that is simple in both \npremise and purpose: build democratic leaders of the NIS for the future \nthrough education. This modest amendment will partially fund doctoral \ngraduate study in the social sciences for students from the NIS during \nthe next two years. The benefits of education and exposure to the \nUnited States will be long lasting.\n  We want to give these students from the NIS a chance to see American \ndemocracy and learn the tools to improve their own society. Indeed, for \nmany it will be their first chance to visit the world's oldest \ndemocracy; to see the promise that democracy offers; and to judge its \nfruits for themselves. As one of our most famous visitors, Alexis de \nTocqueville, wrote:\n\n       Let us look to America, not in order to make a servile copy \n     of the institutions that she has established, but to gain a \n     clearer view of the polity that will be the best for us; let \n     us look there less to find examples than instruction; let us \n     borrow from her the principles, rather than the details, of \n     her laws . . . the principles on which the American \n     constitutions rest, those principles of order, of the balance \n     of powers, of true liberty, of deep and sincere respect for \n     right, are indispensable to all republics . . .\n\n  In 1948 the United States instituted the now famous Marshall Plan \nwhich included among its many provisions a fund for technical \nassistance. Part of this fund included the ``productivity campaign'' \nwhich was designed to bring European businessmen and labor \nrepresentatives here to learn American methods of production. During \nthe Plan's three years, over 6,000 Europeans came to the United States \nto study U.S. production. Though the funding for this part of the plan \nwas less than one-half of one percent of all the Marshall Plan aid, its \nimpact was far greater. The impact of this amendment may also be great.\n  We must note here the current state of Russia's affairs: it is \ndeplorable. Despite this situation, last spring the United States \nSenate voted to expand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. \nThroughout the elements of the Russian political system NATO expansion \nwas viewed as a hostile act they will have to defend against; and they \nhave said if they have to defend their territory, they will do so with \nnuclear weapons; that is all they have left.\n  The distrust born from NATO expansion will not fade quickly. Let us \nhope that this amendment will provide individuals from Russia and the \nother NIS the opportunity to see that we Americans do not hope for \nRussia's demise and isolation. Perhaps we can dispel the betrayal they \nmay feel as a result of NATO enlargement, and give them the tools to \nfurther develop their own democracies.\n  Beyond that, the importance of training the next generation of social \nscientists in the NIS is immeasurable. It is this generation that will \nrevitalize the universities, teaching the next generation economics, \npolitical science, sociology and other disciplines. It is this \ngeneration of social scientists who will be prepared to enter their \nGovernments armed with new ideas and new ways of thinking different \nfrom the status quo; they will bring their new knowledge and standards, \ntheir linkages to the United States back to their own countries, and \nthey will have the best opportunity to influence change there.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The managers amendment which I am pleased to cosponsor \nwith the chairman amends this legislation to name it the ``Admiral \nJames W. Nance Foreign Relations Act, Fiscal years 2000 and 2001.''\n  Admiral ``Bud'' Nance was a dear friend of the chairman and a close \nfriend of many of us in the Senate.\n  He served his country with extraordinary distinction, and in the \nfinal years of his life served as Staff Director to the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee. One of Bud Nance's objectives, which he shared \nwith the chairman, was to see this particular legislation become law.\n  The Senate's approval today will be a major step to that end. When \nthis legislation becomes law we will have authorized the payment of \nmost of the United States arrearages to the United Nations and \nencouraged significant reforms in that body.\n  In addition, the Congress will have authorized the funding of our \nactivities overseas for the years 2000 and 2001.\n  I look at those dates and can't help but think that in many ways, \nthis being but just one, your friend, our friend, Bud Nance, will \nindeed be with us as we enter the new millennium.\n  I would like to thank the majority staff for their work in helping \nput this bill together--particularly Steve Biegun who assumed the role \nof staff director after our friend Bud Nance passed away.\n  Patti McNerney has been tireless as majority counsel in leading the \ncomplex staff negotiations that helped make this bill possible.\n  I would also like to thank Brian McKeon, our minority counsel for his \nhard work and the rest of the minority staff, including Jennifer Park \nand our Pearson Fellow, Joan Wadelton who put many long hours in with \nthe rest of the majority and minority staff. We would not be looking at \nfinal passage today without all their dedicated efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendments are \nagreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 705 through 731), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are five \nminutes equally divided.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to, in the minute or so I have left, \ncongratulate the chairman of the committee for a job very well done. \nThe managers' amendment, which he sent to the desk, I might point out, \namends the legislation to name this legislation the Admiral James W. \nNance Foreign Relations Act, Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001.\n  Bud Nance was a man who was a dear, close friend to the chairman, and \na close friend of many of us in the Senate. He served this country with \nextraordinary distinction in the final years of his life. He served as \nstaff director of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  One of Bud Nance's objectives, which he shared with the chairman, was \nthat this particular legislation become law, and he began to \nreestablish the relevance of and the bipartisan nature of the \ncommittee. He deserves great credit for that. I think the idea of \nnaming this legislation after him is very fitting and appropriate.\n  I thank the chairman again for his cooperation, for his willingness \nto listen, and for his help. He is a lucky man to have had such a close \nfriend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in behalf of the Nance family, I express my \nappreciation not only to Senator Biden but to all of the other Senators \nwho signed the statement of authenticity with reference to that. And \npersonally, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to them. Thank you so \nmuch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n[[Page S7423]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass? On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I was talking this morning about a very \nsignificant event that transpired last week in Geneva on June 17. It \nwas a historic event in the battle to end the scourge of abusive and \nexploitative child labor. By a unanimous vote, the International Labor \nOrganization's member states, including the United States, approved a \nnew convention banning the worst forms of child labor.\n  For the first time in history, the world spoke with one voice in \nopposition to abusive and exploitative child labor. Countries from \nacross the political, economic, and religious spectrum--from Jewish to \nMuslim, from Buddhists to Christians--came together to proclaim \nunequivocally that ``abusive and exploitative child labor is a practice \nwhich will not be tolerated and must be abolished.''\n  Gone is the argument that abusive and exploitative child labor is an \nacceptable practice because of a country's economic circumstances. Gone \nis the argument that abusive and exploitative child labor is acceptable \nbecause of cultural traditions. And gone is the argument that abusive \nand exploitative child labor is a necessary evil on the road to \neconomic development. The United States and the international community \nas a whole unanimously for the first time laid those arguments to rest \nand laid the groundwork to begin the process of ending the scourge of \nabusive and exploitative child labor.\n  Mr. President, for the better part of a decade, I have been in my own \ncapacity working to do what I can to end abusive and exploitative child \nlabor around the globe, including in the United States. The ILO \nestimates that there are about 250 million children worldwide, many as \nyoung as 6 or 7, who are working. These are not just part-time jobs. \nMany of them work in dangerous environments which are detrimental to \ntheir emotional, physical, and moral well-being.\n  Last year, I traveled with my staff to Katmandu, Nepal, and also to \nPakistan, India, and Bangladesh. We were able to witness firsthand the \nabuse of child labor.\n  This chart shows a plant we went to in Katmandu. It was on a Sunday. \nI was taken there by a young man who had previously been a child \nlaborer. On the outside of the gate there was this sign in both \nNepalese and English: Child labour under the age of 14 is strictly \nprohibited.\n  I actually took this picture. Because we had information that the \nowner was gone and this young man I was with knew the guard at the \ngate, we were let in. When we were let in, I started taking pictures. \nThis is one of many pictures I have of some of the young children \nworking in that plant. We determined their ages to be somewhere in the \nneighborhood of 7 or 8 years. This was about 7 or 8 o'clock on a Sunday \nnight. These kids were working in very dusty, dirty conditions, and \nthis shows them as virtual slaves, unable to leave, unable to do \nanything but work at the rug plant.\n  This gives a little idea of the child labor I was able to glimpse on \nmy trip. Had they known we were coming to that plant, they would have \ntaken the children out the back door and we would not have seen any \nchildren there. They would have said: See, we don't have any child \nlabor.\n  That is why it took a surreptitious action on my part to get in and \ntake the pictures, so that I could get proof of the child labor and the \ndeplorable conditions which occur not just in Nepal, but all over the \nworld.\n  In India, I met children who were liberated from hand-knotted carpet \nfactories where they were chained--chained, Mr. President--to looms and \nforced to work as many as 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. These children \nwere nothing more than slaves. They earned no money. They received no \neducation. They had no hope for a future until they were freed by the \nSouth Asian Coalition Against Child Servitude, headed by Kailash \nSatyarthi.\n  I have a chart prepared with ILO data. We see Latin America and the \nCaribbean have about 17 million children working; Africa, 80 million; \nAsia, 153 million; and about half a million in Oceania. That comes down \nto a total of about 250 million children worldwide.\n  Again, I want to be clear that we are not just talking about kids \nworking after school, working part-time. That is not it at all. The \nconvention that the ILO adopted deals with children who are chained to \nlooms, handle dangerous chemicals, ingest metal dust, are forced to \nsell illegal drugs, forced into prostitution, forced into armed \nconflict, some of whom who work in glass factories where furnace \ntemperatures exceed 1,500 degrees. These children are forced to work \nwith no protective equipment. They work only for the economic gains of \nothers. This is in sharp contrast to any kind of a part-time job for \nsome spending money for the latest CD.\n  In this picture, taken in the Sialkot region of Pakistan, 8-year-old \nMohammad Ashraf Irfan is making surgical equipment. He is 8 years old \nworking around hot metal and sharp instruments. He has no protective \nclothing on at all, not even for his eyes. This is his lot in life at \nthe ripe old age of 8. This is what the convention, adopted in Geneva \nlast week, will start preventing.\n  Mr. President, as you and many of my colleagues know, President \nClinton traveled to Geneva, Switzerland, last week to address the \nInternational Labor Organization's conference. He is the first \nPresident in U.S. history to address the ILO in its 80-year history. \nImagine that. I was privileged to be asked to accompany the President \nfor this historic event.\n  In his address to the ILO, President Clinton spoke eloquently of the \ncrying need to protect all children from abusive and exploitative \nlabor. The President said, in part:\n  There are some things we cannot and will not tolerate. We will not \ntolerate children being used in pornography and prostitution. We will \nnot tolerate children in slavery or bondage. We will not\n\n[[Page S7424]]\n\ntolerate children being forcibly recruited to serve in armed conflicts. \nWe will not tolerate young children risking their health and breaking \ntheir bodies in hazardous and dangerous working conditions for hours \nunconscionably long--regardless of country, regardless of circumstance.\n\n  I cannot agree more. I was very proud of President Clinton--proud \nthat he was the first U.S. President in history to address the ILO, \nproud that he focused his remarks on the issue of child labor and on \nhis support for this convention.\n  I will briefly describe the new Convention on the Worst Forms of \nChild Labor. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the convention be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. The convention defines the worst forms as being all forms \nof slavery, debt bondage, forced or compulsory labor, the sale and \ntrafficking of children, including forced or compulsory recruitment of \nchildren for use in armed conflict, child prostitution, children \nproducing and trafficking in narcotic drugs, or any other work which, \nby its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is \nlikely to harm the health, the safety, or morals of children. It also \ndefines a child as any person under the age of 18.\n  Mr. President, this is what we are talking about. Look at this young \ngirl in this photograph. We do not know her age, but from all accounts, \npeople who know this area say she is probably less than 9 years old. \nShe and her two friends have straps around their heads, and she is \ncarrying what looks like seven big blocks or bricks on her back which \nare much to heavy for such a small child and are doing permanent damage \nto her spine and neck. She is barefoot and hunched over. As you can \nsee, her friends of an equal age are carrying a similar load.\n  These are the worst forms of child labor. That is what this \nconvention is all about. The convention calls on the ILO member states \nto take immediate and effective actions to prohibit and eliminate the \nworst forms of child labor.\n  I am looking at a chart, which is a photo of another young girl in \nIndia carrying construction material on her head. One can see her arms \nare straight, her face is dirty and sweaty, and she should be in school \nrather than having all this construction material, about 30 or 40 \npounds piled on the top of her head. She is also doing permanent damage \nto her neck and spine. This is the sort of gross labor abuse the \nconvention seeks to end.\n  As I said, the convention defines a child for these purposes as any \nchild under the age of 18. It calls on member states to implement \naction plans to move children from the workplace to the classroom. \nUNICEF reports that over 1 billion adults will be functionally \nilliterate on the eve of the new millennium because they worked as \nchildren and were denied an education.\n  That is why I am especially pleased about the importance the \nconvention placed on education as a principal means for reducing \ninstances of abusive and exploitative child labor. I believe very \nstrongly that these child laborers must go from exploitation to \neducation.\n  This chart shows a list of what the convention abolishes: Child \nslavery, child bondage, child prostitution, children in pornography, \ntrafficking in children, forced recruitment of children for armed \nconflict, recruitment of children in the production or sale of \nnarcotics, and hazardous work by children.\n  But, let me come back to the forced recruitment of children for armed \nconflict for just a moment. We do not have forced recruitment in the \nUnited States for children. But I am aware our Armed Forces are able to \nrecruit children who are 17 years of age. Quite frankly, we need a \ndebate in this body about whether or not we ought to allow that to \ncontinue. I, for one, believe that the armed services ought to be held \nin abeyance from recruiting and signing up young people in the armed \nservices until they at least reach the age of 18. But that is a debate \nfor another time.\n  As I stated earlier, I believe that children should go from \nexploitation to education. We visited a very important milestone in \nthis effort in Dacca, Bangladesh, last year when we found almost 10,000 \nyoung children, mostly girls--about 90 percent--who had been working in \nthe garment factories. After an historic agreement with the help of the \nILO and the Bangladeshi Garment Manufacturers Export Association, these \nchildren were moved out of the garment factories and into about 353 \nschools established in Dacca for this sole purpose.\n  We visited a couple of those schools, and I will just tell you, \nlooking at these young girls, who maybe a year before could not read or \nwrite, now were standing up and reciting whole passages from books, \nbeing able to write, and you could see in their eyes they are not going \nto go back to exploitation.\n  The people in Bangladesh, in the government and in industry, said it \nis probably one of the best things that has happened to them, because \nthey are going to have a more highly educated workforce, a more \nproductive workforce, and that means their whole standard of living is \ngoing to increase.\n  The convention adopted last week also calls on all member nations to \nidentify and reach out to children at special risk and to take into \naccount the special situation of girls with regard to education. And I \nam also very pleased about that provision.\n  There are many other important elements contained in the convention \nwhich I have not mentioned. I encourage all of my colleagues to read \nthis document thoroughly.\n  I would also mention another historic fact about this convention.\n  For the first time in its history, the U.S. tripartite group to the \nILO, which consists of representatives from government, business and \nlabor, went to Geneva to negotiate on this important convention, and \nthey unanimously agreed on the final version.\n  So I commend Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman and the other members \nof the U.S. delegation, including Mr. John Sweeney, the president of \nthe AFL-CIO, and Ed Potter, from the U.S. Council on International \nBusiness, for their leadership on this convention.\n  With the adoption of the new Convention on the Worst Forms of Child \nLabor, the ILO has written an important new chapter in our effort to \nhonor our values and protect our children.\n  Today, in recognition of this effort, I offered a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution regarding the International Labor Organization's new \nConvention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor which was accepted as part \nof the managers' package. This amendment calls upon the President to \npromptly submit to the Senate the new convention. It commends the ILO \nmember states for their negotiating efforts and states that it should \nbe the policy of the United States to work with all foreign nations and \ninternational organizations to promote an end to abusive and \nexploitative child labor.\n  Again, it is my understanding that very shortly President Clinton \nwill be transmitting this convention to the Senate for our \nconsideration. I am hopeful that the Committee on Foreign Relations \nwill take up the convention, have hearings on it, and report it out as \nsoon as possible.\n  Again, with the unanimous support of labor, government and business, \nI see no reason why the United States should not be one of the first \ncountries to ratify this new convention. So I am hopeful that before \nthis session of the Congress ends that the Senate will act on it and \nratify the Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor.\n  Once again, I thank Senators Wellstone, Kohl, Lautenberg, Kennedy, \nDodd, Torricelli, Wyden, and Feingold for cosponsoring this important \namendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\nA. Proposed Convention concerning the prohibition and immediate action \n         for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour\n\n       The General Conference of the International Labour \n     Organization.\n       Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the \n     International Labour Office, and having met in its 87th \n     Session on 1 June 1999, and\n       Considering the need to adopt new instruments for the \n     prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child \n     labour, as the main priority for national and international \n     action, including international cooperation and assistance, \n     to complement the Convention and Recommendation concerning \n     Minimum Age for Admission to Employment,\n\n[[Page S7425]]\n\n     1973, which remain fundamental instruments on child labour, \n     and\n       Considering that the effective elimination of the worst \n     forms of child labour requires immediate and comprehensive \n     action, taking into account the importance of free basic \n     education and the need to remove the children concerned from \n     all such work and to provide for their rehabilitation and \n     social integration while addressing the needs of their \n     families, and\n       Recalling the Resolution concerning the elimination of \n     child labour adopted by the International Labour Conference \n     at its 83rd Session, in 1996.\n       Recognizing that child labour is to a great extent caused \n     by poverty and that the long-term solution lies in sustained \n     economic growth leading to social progress, in particular \n     poverty alleviation and universal education, and\n       Recalling the Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted \n     by the United Nations General Assembly on 20 November 1989, \n     and\n       Recalling the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and \n     Rights at Work and its Follow-up, adopted by the \n     International Labour Conference at its 86th Session in 1998, \n     and\n       Recalling that some of the worst forms of child labour are \n     covered by other international instruments, in particular the \n     Forced Labour Convention, 1930, and the United Nations \n     Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the \n     Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to \n     Slavery, 1956, and\n       Having decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with \n     regard to child labour, which is the fourth item on the \n     agenda of the session, and\n       Having determined that these proposals shall take the form \n     of an international Convention;\n\n     adopts this 17th day of June of the year one thousand nine \n     hundred and ninety-nine the following Convention, which may \n     be cited as the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999.\n\n                               Article 1\n\n       Each Member which ratifies this Convention shall take \n     immediate and effective measures to secure the prohibition \n     and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, as a \n     matter of urgency\n\n                               Article 2\n\n       For the purposes of this Convention, the term ``child'' \n     shall apply to all persons under the age of 18.\n\n                               Article 3\n\n       For the purposes of this Convention, the expression ``the \n     worst forms of child labour'' comprises:\n       (a) all forms of slavery or practices similar to slavery, \n     such as the same and trafficking of children, debt bondage \n     and serfdom and forced or compulsory labour, including forced \n     or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed \n     conflict;\n       (b) the use, procuring or offering of a child for \n     prostitution, for the production of pornography or for \n     pornographic performances;\n       (c) the use, procuring or offering of a child for illicit \n     activities, in particular for the production and trafficking \n     of drugs as defined in the relevant international treaties;\n       (d) work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which \n     it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety or \n     morals of children.\n\n                               Article 4\n\n       1.

Proposed Convention concerning the prohibition and immediate action \n         for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour\n\n       The General Conference of the International Labour \n     Organization,\n       Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the \n     International Labour Office, and having met in its 87th \n     Session on 1 June 1999, and\n       Having adopted the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, \n     1999, and\n       Having decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with \n     regard to child labour, which is the fourth item on the \n     agenda of the session, and\n       Having determined that these proposals shall take the form \n     of a Recommendation supplementing the Worst Forms of Child \n     Labour Convention, 1999;\n\n     adopts this 17th day of June of the year one thousands nine \n     hundred and ninety-nine the following Recommendation, which \n     may be cited as the Worse Forms of Child Labour \n     Recommendation, 1999.\n       1. The provisions of this Recommendation supplement those \n     of the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 \n     (hereafter referred to as ``the Convention''), and should be \n     applied in conjunction with them.\n\n                        I. Programmes of action\n\n       2. The programmes of action referred to in Article 6 of the \n     Convention should be designed and implemented, as a matter of \n     urgency, in consultation with relevant government \n     institutions and employers' and workers' organizations, \n     taking into consideration the views of the children directly \n     affected by the worst forms of child labour, their families \n     and, as appropriate, other concerned groups committed to the \n     aims of the Convention and this Recommendation. Such programs \n     should aim at, inter alia:\n       (a) identifying and denouncing the worst forms of child \n     labour;\n       (b) preventing the engagement of children in or removing \n     them from the worst forms of child labour, protecting them \n     from reprisals and providing for their rehabilitation and \n     social integration through measures which address their \n     educational, physical and psychological needs:\n       (c) giving special attention to:\n       (i) younger children;\n       (ii) the girl child;\n       (iii) the problem of hidden work situations, in which girls \n     are at special risk;\n       (iv) other groups of children with special vulnerabilities \n     or needs;\n       (d) identifying, reaching out to and working with \n     communities where children are at special risk;\n       (e) informing, sensitizing and mobilizing public opinion \n     and concerned groups, including children and their families.\n\n                           II. Hazardous work\n\n       3. In determining the types of work referred to under \n     Article 3(d) of the Convention, and in identifying where they \n     exist, consideration should be given, inter alia to:\n       (a) work which exposes children to physical, psychological \n     or sexual abuse;\n       (b) work underground, under water, at dangerous heights or \n     in confined spaces;\n       (c) work with dangerous machinery, equipment and tools, or \n     which involves the manual handling or transport of heavy \n     loads;\n       (d) work in an unhealthy environment which may, for \n     example, expose children to hazardous substances, agents or \n     processes, or, to temperatures, noise levels, or vibrations \n     damaging to their health;\n       (e) work under particularly difficult conditions such as \n     work for long hours or during the night or work where the \n     child is unreasonably confined to the premises of the \n     employer.\n       4. For the types of work referred to under Article 3(d) of \n     the Convention and Paragraph 3 above, national laws or \n     regulations, or the competent authority, may, after \n     consultation with the workers' and employers' organizations \n     concerned, authorize employment or work as from the age of \n     16, on condition that the health, safety and morals of the \n     children concerned are fully protected, and the children \n     have received adequate specific instruction or vocational \n     training in the relevant branch of activity.\n\n                          III. Implementation\n\n       5. (1) Detailed information and statistical data on the \n     nature and extent of child labour should be compiled and kept \n     up to date to serve as a basis for determining priorities for\n\n[[Page S7426]]\n\n     national action for the abolition of child labour, in \n     particular for the prohibition and elimination of its worst \n     forms, as a matter of urgency.\n       (2) As far as possible, such information and statistical \n     data should include data disaggregated by sex, age group, \n     occupation, branch of economic activity and status in \n     employment, school attendance and geographical location. The \n     importance of an effective system of birth registration, \n     including the issuing of birth certificates, should be taken \n     into account.\n       (3) Relevant data concerning violations of national \n     provisions for the prohibition and immediate elimination of \n     the worst forms of child labour should be compiled and kept \n     up to date.\n       6. The compilation and processing of the information and \n     data referred to in Paragraph 5 above should be carried out \n     with due regard for the right to privacy.\n       7. The information compiled under Paragraph 5 should be \n     communicated to the International Labour Office on a regular \n     basis.\n       8. Members should establish or designate appropriate \n     national mechanisms to monitor the implementation of national \n     provisions for the prohibition and elimination of the worst \n     forms of child labour after consultation with employers' and \n     workers' organizations.\n       9. Members should ensure that the competent authorities \n     which have responsibilities for implementing national \n     provisions for the prohibition and elimination of the worst \n     forms of child labour cooperate with each other and \n     coordinate their activities.\n       10. National laws or regulations or the competent authority \n     should determine the persons to be held responsible in the \n     event of non-compliance with national provisions for the \n     prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child \n     labour.\n       11. Members should, in so far as it is compatible with \n     national law, cooperate with international efforts aimed at \n     the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child \n     labour as a matter of urgency by:\n       (a) gathering and exchanging information concerning \n     criminal offences, including those involving international \n     networks;\n       (b) detecting and prosecuting those involved in the sale \n     and trafficking of children, or in the use, procuring or \n     offering of children for illicit activities, for \n     prostitution, for the production of pornography or for \n     pornographic performances;\n       (c) registering perpetrators of such offences.\n       12. Members should provide that the following worst forms \n     of child labour are criminal offences:\n       (a) all forms of slavery or practices similar to slavery, \n     such as the sale and trafficking of children, debt bondage \n     and serfdom and forced or compulsory labour, including forced \n     or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed \n     conflict;\n       (b) the use, procuring or offering of a child for \n     prostitution, for the production of pornography or for \n     pornographic performances; and\n       (c) the use, procuring or offering of a child for illicit \n     activities, in particular for the production and trafficking \n     of drugs as defined in the relevant international treaties, \n     or for activities which involve the unlawful carrying or use \n     of firearms or other weapons.\n       13. Members should ensure that penalties including, where \n     appropriate, criminal penalties are applied for violations of \n     the national provisions for the prohibition and elimination \n     of any type of work referred to in Article 3(d) of the \n     Convention.\n       14. Members should also provide, as a matter of urgency, \n     for other criminal, civil or administrative remedies, where \n     appropriate, to ensure the effective enforcement of national \n     provisions for the prohibition and immediate elimination of \n     the worst forms of child labour, such as special supervision \n     of enterprises which have used the worst forms of child \n     labour, and, in cases of persistent violation, consideration \n     of temporary or permanent revoking of permits to operate.\n       15. Other measures aimed at the prohibition and immediate \n     elimination of the worst forms of child labour might include \n     the following:\n       (a) informing, sensitizing and mobilizing the general \n     public, including national and local political leaders, \n     parliamentarians and the judiciary.\n       (b) involving and training employers' and workers' \n     organizations and civic organizations;\n       (c) providing appropriate training for government officials \n     concerned, especially inspectors and law enforcement \n     officials, and for other relevant professionals;\n       (d) providing for the prosecution in their own country of \n     the Member's nationals who commit offences under its national \n     provisions for the prohibition and immediate elimination of \n     the worst forms of child labour even when these offences \n     are committed in another country;\n       (e) simplifying legal and administrative procedures and \n     ensuring that they are appropriate and prompt;\n       (f) encouraging the development of policies by undertakings \n     to promote the aims of the Convention;\n       (g) monitoring and giving publicity to best practices on \n     the elimination of child labour;\n       (h) giving publicity to legal or other provisions on child \n     labour in the different languages or dialects;\n       (i) establishing special complaints procedures and making \n     provisions to protect from discrimination and reprisals those \n     who legitimately expose violations of the provisions of the \n     Convention, as well as establishing help lines or points of \n     contact and ombudspersons;\n       (j) adopting appropriate measures to improve the \n     educational infrastructure and the training of teachers to \n     meet the needs of boys and girls;\n       (k) as far as possible, taking into account in national \n     programs of action the need for job creation and vocational \n     training for the parents and adults in the families of the \n     children working in the conditions covered by the Convention \n     and the need for sensitizing parents on the problem of \n     children working in such conditions.\n       16. Enhanced international cooperation and/or assistance \n     among Members for the prohibition and effective elimination \n     of the worst forms of child labour should complement national \n     efforts and may, as appropriate, be developed and implemented \n     in consultation with employers' and workers' organizations. \n     Such international cooperation and/or assistance should \n     include:\n       (a) mobilizing resources for national or international \n     programmes;\n       (b) mutual legal assistance;\n       (c) technical assistance including the exchange of \n     information;\n       (d) support for social and economic development, poverty \n     eradication programmes and universal education.\n\n\n                             ILO CONVENTION\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as my good friend from Delaware is aware, \nlast week the International Labor Organization (ILO) unanimously \nadopted a new Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor. This \nConvention calls on ILO Member States to take immediate and effective \nactions to prohibit and eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The \nConvention also defines the worst forms of child labor as: all forms of \nslavery, debt bondage, forced or compulsory labor, or the sale and \ntrafficking of children, including forced or compulsory recruitment of \nchildren for use in armed conflict; child prostitution; children \nproducing and trafficking of narcotic drugs; or any other work which by \nits nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely \nto harm the health, safety, or morals of children. It also defines a \nchild as any person under the age of 18.\n  I was privileged to travel with the President to the ILO where he \naddressed the delegates on child labor and affirmed the United States \nGovernment support of this important Convention.\n  Would the Senator from Delaware agree that this important and \nhistoric Convention should be considered as a high priority item and \nconsidered in a timely fashion after submission to the Senate by the \nPresident?\n  Mr. BIDEN. My friend from Iowa is correct. This is an important \nConvention and I assure you that from my point of view this new \nConvention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor should be a high priority. \nI am aware that this Convention pertains to abolishing child slavery, \nchild prostitution and other hazardous work endangering a child's well-\nbeing. Therefore, I will work with the Chairman of the Committee to try \nto bring this treaty before the Committee as soon as practical after it \nis submitted by the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7426-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7426-S7427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will make a few comments about the \nimportance of managed care reform and the importance of passing a \nstrong Patients' Bill of Rights in this Congress.\n  The bill that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want us to \nconsider, I believe, is fundamentally flawed. First, it fails to cover \ntwo-thirds of privately insured Americans. Secondly, it fails to \nprevent insurers from arbitrarily interfering with the decisions of a \npatient's treating physician. And, third, it is weak in giving \nconsumers the right to sue their insurance companies for faulty \ndecisions to withhold care.\n  Today, I want to focus on a few issues that have critical importance \nto me: access to specialty care, network adequacy, and genetic \ndiscrimination.\n  When we marked up the bill in the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee, I offered an amendment to ensure that patients have \naccess to the specialty care they need. I intend to offer it again if \nwe are ever allowed a full and fair debate on this bill.\n  This is a critical issue for people with disabilities, women with \nbreast cancer, and others with chronic health conditions. But it is \nimportant for all Americans. The inability to access specialists is the \nnumber-one reason people\n\n[[Page S7427]]\n\ngive when they leave a health plan, and it is a top issue they want \nCongress to address.\n  The Republican bill is deficient in this area. Aside from two minor \nprovisions regarding access to OB/GYNs and pediatricians--access that \nalmost all health plans already provide--there is nothing in the \nRepublican bill that guarantees access to specialty care such as that \nprovided by neurologists, pediatric oncologists, rehabilitation \nphysicians, and others.\n  We need to ensure that people can see specialists outside of their \nHMO's network at no additional cost if specialists in the plan's \nnetwork cannot meet their needs. We need to allow a specialist to be \nthe primary care coordinator for patients with disabilities or life-\nthreatening or degenerative conditions. And we need to provide for \nstanding referrals for people who need ongoing specialty care, which \nenables them to go straight to the specialist instead of jumping \nthrough hoops with primary care doctors or insurance companies.\n  These provisions would not create onerous new burdens on plans. In \nfact, many plans already allow specialists to be primary care \ncoordinators, and they let people have standing referrals. Most \nimportantly, they address the tragic cases we have heard about that \nstem from delay or denial of access to specialists.\n  Finally, helping people get timely access to specialty care is not \njust smart and compassionate policy; it will also help minimize the \nneed for litigation that results from a failure to have access.\n  Another amendment I have been working on ensures that each insurance \nplan has sufficient providers in its network to deliver the care that \nis promised. Again, this is an area where the Republican bill is, I \nthink, very inadequate. There is no provision in the Republican bill to \nensure network adequacy. This is a very important issue in my State of \nIowa.\n  My amendment ensures that every network plan has a sufficient number \nand mix of providers to deliver the covered services.\n  It also requires plans to incorporate a primary care physician in \ntheir network who is within 30 minutes or 30 driving miles of a \npatient's home. If the plan cannot include patients within that \ndistance, patients need to be allowed to go ``out-of-network'' to \nobtain the care they need. In other words, no one should have to drive \nmore than 30 miles or 30 minutes to see a primary care physician.\n  It is important to understand what is happening now. Many managed \ncare companies now contract only with urban-based providers. Not only \ndoes this require patients to travel considerable distances to receive \nbasic health care, but these urban-based networks also weaken the rural \nhealth infrastructure by shutting local doctors and local clinics out \nof the network. This is wrong and must be stopped.\n  I have been working also on the genetic issues of this since the \nearly 1990s when I introduced an amendment to the HIPAA that prohibited \ngenetic discrimination by group health plans. As ranking member of the \nLabor-HHS appropriations subcommittee, I have also been and continue to \nbe a strong supporter of the Human Genome Project. In the HELP \nCommittee, the authorizing committee, I worked with Senators Dodd and \nKennedy on a genetic discrimination amendment. I intend to continue \nworking on this issue when and if we get a Patients' Bill of Rights on \nthe floor.\n  We have all discussed at length the importance of prohibiting \ndiscrimination on the basis of all predictive genetic information in \nall health insurance markets. I am pleased that the Republican bill \nrecognized that we need to prohibit discrimination in the group and in \nthe individual markets, and that we need to prohibit discrimination not \nonly on the basis of genetic tests but on the basis of a person's \nfamily history.\n  Still, the Republican bill failed to address several other equally \ncritical issues in this area. The bottom line is that we must prohibit \ndiscrimination by insurers and employers.\n  To prohibit discrimination in one context only invites discrimination \nin the other. For example, if we only prohibit discrimination in the \ninsurance context, employers who are worried about future increased \nmedical costs will simply not hire individuals who have a genetic \npredisposition to a particular disease.\n\n  Similarly, we must prohibit health insurance companies from \ndisclosing genetic discrimination to other insurance companies, to \nindustry-wide data banks, and employers. If we really want to prevent \ndiscrimination, we should not let genetic information get into the \nwrong hands in the first place.\n  Finally, if we really want a prohibition of genetic discrimination to \nhave teeth, we have to have strong remedies and penalties. The $100-a-\nday fine against health insurers that my colleagues across the aisle \nhave proposed will do little to prevent health insurers from \ndiscriminating, and it does nothing to compensate a victim of such \ndiscrimination. We must do better than this.\n  Mr. President, let me say that we must not pass up this chance to \nmake true and significant reforms to managed care programs. This is the \nissue that the American people have said they most want the Congress to \naddress. And they are watching us carefully to see if we will enact \nreal reform or a series of meaningless sound bites.\n  If we take strong action that allows clear-cut access to specialty \ncare, ensures network adequacy, and prohibits genetic discrimination, \nwe will have gone a long way to providing real reform and providing for \na meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as thousands of Kosovar Albanians flood \nacross the Macedonian and Albanian borders, we are getting the first \nreports of refugee landmine victims. Last week, two refugees were \nkilled and another seriously injured as they hurried to return to their \nhomes in Kosovo.\n  Just put this in perspective. Some 25 people have been injured or \nkilled by mines in Kosovo since the refugees began returning. It is a \nsenseless loss of life and it is tragic, but it is predictable. It is \npredictable because tens of thousands of landmines were left behind by \nSerb forces. Others were put there by the KLA. They litter fields, \nroads, and bridges, and they have even been left in houses. They have \nbeen left in booby traps. As sad as anything, there are mass graves \nmarking the atrocities that have occurred there. And as family members \ngo back to try to find out if their loved ones are in those graves, \neven some of the graves have been booby-trapped by landmines.\n  These landmines are the greatest threat to people on the ground, \nincluding NATO forces, and the number of innocent victims--children \nplaying, farmers plowing their fields, women walking along the roads--\nwill continue to rise.\n  It is one thing to conduct an air war with the latest laser-guided \ntechnology and, thankfully, there were no NATO casualties, but it is \nanother thing to face an invisible enemy on the ground. In Bosnia, most \nU.S. casualties were from landmines. In Kosovo, too, mines are the \ninvisible enemy. They can't distinguish between friend or foe, soldier \nor civilian, adult or child.\n  A June 15 article in the Los Angeles Times entitled, ``A Strategy on \nLand Mines is Needed Now,'' described the problems mines pose in \nKosovo, and they called on the international community to develop a \ncomprehensive strategy for clearing the mines and aiding the victims.\n  Such a strategy is critical to promoting peace and moving forward \nwith reconstruction and economic development. The United States, as the \nleader of NATO, will play a key role in designing and financing that \nstrategy.\n  But the article neglects to address another key part of the problem--\nthe continued use of mines. It is a bit similiar to trying to keep \ngarbage out of a river. You can clean up the garbage, but if people \nkeep dumping it into the river, you haven't solved the problem. You \nneed to stop garbage from being dumped. We need to stigmatize \nantipersonnel mines so they are\n\n[[Page S7428]]\n\nnot put into the ground in the first place by anybody, by any country, \nby any combatant, by anyone anywhere.\n  That is what most countries are trying to do. Now, 135 countries have \nsigned the Ottawa Convention that bans the use of antipersonnel mines, \nand 81 countries have ratified it. That convention sets a new \ninternational norm outlawing a weapon that has caused enormous \nsuffering of innocent people in some 70 countries.\n  Like booby traps, which are also outlawed, mines are triggered by the \nvictim. They are inherently indiscriminate and the casualties are \nusually noncombatants.\n  Unfortunately, the most powerful Nation on earth, the United States, \nhas not joined the convention. So despite the leading role the United \nStates has taken in demining and helping victims, we, like Russia, \nChina, and some other countries that manufacture mines, are standing in \nthe way of the effort to outlaw this weapon.\n  Ironically, every member of NATO, except the United States and \nTurkey, has signed the Ottawa Convention. We not only weaken the \nconvention by our absence, we also complicate joint military operations \nwith our NATO allies.\n  Now, the United States can send deminers, those who remove the mines. \nWe can give millions of dollars in aid to mine victims. The Leahy War \nVictims Fund does that every year in the sum of many millions of \ndollars. We can sit down with other nations to rebuild as many \ncountries as there are conflicts. But the truth is, the only effective \nstrategy to stop the carnage caused by landmines has three parts: \nDemining, victims assistance, and most importantly, banning their use \ntoday, tomorrow, and forever. That is what the Ottawa Convention does. \nUnless countries such as the United States, Russia, Pakistan, India, \nand China join, they invite others to keep using mines. It is in Kosovo \ntoday but somewhere else tomorrow.\n  The United States is not causing the landmine problem, but the United \nStates is blocking a total solution because, without us, there is no \nsolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Los Angeles Times \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, June 15, 1999]\n\n                 A Strategy on Land Mines Is Needed Now\n\n          (By Robert Oakley, Lori Helene Gronich, Ted Sahlin)\n\n       Tens of thousands of land mines will be left behind as Serb \n     forces withdraw from Kosovo, and nobody has a long-term plan \n     for removing them. The international community must begin \n     work together now to develop an integrated approach or \n     prospects for peace and economic recovery in Kosovo will be \n     thwarted.\n       Knowledge about the relationship between land mine \n     problems, peace settlements and rebuilding shattered \n     communities is scarce. Operation Provide Comfort in Iraq and \n     the stabilization of affairs in Bosnia are experiences that \n     can help shape effective planning for Kosovo. In northern \n     Iraq, there were recognizable phases to the refugee \n     operation. First, the military entered and secured the area. \n     Mines were removed from refugee reception zones and core \n     transportation routes. Then, international relief \n     organizations came forward and restarted their local \n     operations.\n       But the next step--taking these mines out of the ground--\n     did not take place. Despite the valuable mine location \n     information provided by area residents and some international \n     relief workers, land mines were treated as an acceptable, if \n     pernicious, danger to the population. Wise planners will \n     include the accounts of local residents and international aid \n     workers in Kosovo.\n       Large-scale mine removal normally occurs when the threat of \n     violence has receded, armed forces have departed, and local \n     governance has been restored. National and international \n     organizations then work with local leaders to develop long-\n     term aid plans and mine-removal programs.\n       In Bosnia, soldiers and civilians alike were aware of the \n     land mine threat. Allied military forces, after several \n     fatalities and traumatic injuries, made land mine awareness \n     among the troops a high priority. These troops, however, \n     primarily removed mines when it was necessary for force \n     protection. International companies, local contractors and \n     local forces tackled the larger mine problem, and they are \n     still at work today. Not only do they compete for funding, \n     they influence priorities as well. This is not a \n     comprehensive master plan.\n       All five components of mine action--awareness; surveying, \n     mapping and marking; removal; destruction; and victim \n     assistance--should be an integral part of any comprehensive \n     international operation. First, all minefield information \n     must be given immediately to allied leaders. Should any of \n     the combatants have only incomplete or inaccurate mine \n     records, their soldiers should show the entering forces \n     just where the mines have been placed. This will save \n     lives. It was not done in Bosnia, and it exacted a high \n     price. Human suffering remains, and economic output is \n     still less than half of what it was in 1990.\n       In the initial phase of the Kosovo peace, international \n     military forces will clear mines to protect themselves and \n     allow for the necessary freedom of movement to accomplish \n     their mission. This mine-clearing effort should also support \n     the rapid return of refugees and the swift resumption of \n     local commerce. Military mine-clearing and mine-awareness \n     training should be supplemented by mine-awareness education \n     for refugees and internally displaced persons. Assuring \n     adequate medical supplies and attention for mine casualties \n     should be a high priority.\n       Once the initial phase of a Kosovo deployment is completed, \n     the international protection force is likely to limit and \n     then stop its mine-clearance work. Civilian groups must then \n     take over. International experts often are brought in to help \n     training local residents in mine safety and removal. Local \n     security forces can also be trained and equipped to \n     participate. Despite the widespread belief that mine \n     clearance is an integral part of post-conflict peace-\n     building, economic revitalization and sustainable \n     development, there is no agreed model for addressing or even \n     coordinating these different needs and roles.\n       If the work in Kosovo is to be effective, international \n     planners must develop a comprehensive strategy now. \n     Otherwise, the fighting may cease, but the casualties will go \n     on.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will close with this, as I have many \nother times. In the use of any weapons, there always will be questions \nas to who is right and who is wrong. But I have to think the use of \nlandmines raises beyond a strategic question, raises the real moral \nquestion, and because the victims of landmines are so \ndisproportionately civilian, we do get into moral questions. As the \nmost powerful Nation on earth, and also the Nation most blessed with \nresources and advantages of any nation in history, I think we fail a \nmoral duty if we don't do more to ban the use of antipersonnel \nlandmines.\n  It is a child walking to school. It is a mother going to a stream to \nget water. It is a parent tilling what little fields they have. It is \nsomebody trying to help out with medical care. It is a missionary. It \nis so many others--all on peaceful, proper pursuits of their lives. \nThey are the ones who step on these landmines and are killed or maimed. \nThe child who sees a shiny toy in the field and loses his arm and his \nface. It is the person who tries to save the child who steps on the \nmine itself. It is the refugee family trying to go back to the country \nthat they were expelled from who are dying from them. We have to do \nmore.\n  I wish there would be a day when there would never be another war. \nThere will not be. We can't stop that. But we can take steps to stop \nthe day that landmines will ever be used again.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7428-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7428-S7446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate at \nthis time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is currently considering S. 1233, \nthe agriculture appropriations bill and the pending amendment is \namendment No. 703.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, now we are back to where we were \nyesterday just about 24 hours ago. At the request of the Democratic \nleader, the\n\n[[Page S7429]]\n\namendment on the Patients' Bill of Rights was submitted to the Senate \nas an amendment on the appropriations bill yesterday afternoon. The \nmajority leader then offered an amendment to that amendment, which was \neffectively the legislation that was passed out of the Health and \nEducation committee some 3 months ago and the tax provisions from the \nSenate Republican leadership proposal. That is an amendment to Senator \nDaschle's proposal.\n  We have this measure now before the Senate. Many of us over the last \n2 years have tried to gain the opportunity to debate what we call the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. The underlying concept of the Patients' Bill \nof Rights is very simple and very straightforward. Our legislation has \nthe strong and compelling support of over 200 organizations all across \nthis country. Medical decisions that affect the members of our families \nought to be made by doctors--by professional, trained medical \npersonnel--and the patients. They ought to be the ones that make the \ndecisions that are going to affect our lives and the lives of our \nfamilies, our grandparents, and our children. Those decisions should \nnot be made by an insurance agent, or by an HMO official.\n  This is a very basic and fundamental concept, and all of the basic \nmeasures--the proposals--that are advanced in our Patients' Bill of \nRights, which was introduced by Senator Daschle, reflect this concept. \nThe Republican proposal does not address this critically important \nconcept. I call the Republican proposal the ``patients' bill of \nwrongs.'' They use the right words in their title, but that's it. Their \nbill doesn't guarantee that these decisions are going to be made by the \ndoctors and nurses and by the trained medical professionals.\n  The Members of this body do not have to take what I say on this \ninterpretation of the Republican proposal. The fact remains that we \nhave been waiting and waiting and waiting for well over a year, or for \nclose to 2 years, to hear from our Republican friends about the medical \nassociations or the medical professionals that support their proposal. \nLet's be clear, we don't advance this proposal because we are \nDemocrats. We advance it because it will protect consumers and families \nin this country.\n  It isn't that I say it, or that Senator Daschle says it, or that any \nof our colleagues say it. It is because the doctors in this country say \nit. The American Medical Association says it. The American Nurses \nAssociations says it. The consumer organizations that have been \ndedicated to protecting patients have said it.\n  If you look over the list of those various groups that are supporting \nour particular proposal, you will find that virtually every \norganization that represents women's health care support our \nlegislation, and for very good reasons, which we will outline today. \nVirtually every leading group that has dedicated itself to protecting \nthe well-being of children in our society and the health care of \nchildren are supporting our proposal. Why? For very good reasons, which \nhave been outlined before by Senator Daschle, Senator Reed and those of \nus who support helping children. You will find that virtually every \norganization in this country that is concerned about the needs of the \ndisabled in our society is supporting our program. Virtually every \ngroup that is concerned about cancer and cancer research is supporting \nour particular proposal. And virtually none are supporting the \nopposition's proposal.\n  This is something that the American consumers ought to understand. \nThis is something the American consumers ought to realize.\n  I see our leader on the floor at this time. I think all of us are \nlooking forward to listening to his presentation.\n  I yield the floor at this time and will come back and address the \nSenate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, he was talking \nearlier about the amazing array of groups in support of our bill. I \nthink I heard the Senator say it really represents virtually the entire \nuniverse of health care provider organizations that we know in this \ncountry. Certainly they are not all necessarily Democratic groups or \nprogressive groups.\n  Would the Senator comment on the diversity of the groups supporting \nour proposal? I think this is a point that is sometimes lost--the \nbreadth of organizations that say this is a top priority as a \nlegislative issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As the Senator knows full well, we can take one example. \nThere are many, and we will come back to those later in the afternoon. \nBut the Senator has been a strong supporter in terms of increasing the \nNIH research budget and has followed the various recommendations so \nthat hopefully we are going to double the NIH research budget. Our \nRepublican colleagues have supported this proposal. Senator Mack and \nSenator Specter have been leaders. Senator Harkin has been one of the \nimportant leaders. Many other Members have supported that proposal. \nWhy? Because it is universally accepted that we are in the early \nmorning sunrise period of major scientific breakthroughs on many of the \nkinds of diseases that affect millions of our fellow citizens.\n  This year, more than 563,000 will die from cancer, and 1.2 million \nwill be diagnosed. We have these enormous potential breakthroughs that \ncan mean the difference between life and death. These breakthrough \ntreatments allow individuals some degree of hope of being freed from \nAlzheimer's or Parkinson's disease or cancer. Every medical researcher \nunderstands that. That is why they support the access to clinical \ntrials piece in our proposal. When they have the breakthrough in the \nlaboratory, they want to get it to the bedside. The way that is done is \nthrough clinical trials.\n  Under the Daschle proposal, we would continue the traditional support \nfor clinical trials so that we can move these breakthroughs that are \ncoming in the laboratory to the patients, to the mothers, and to the \ndaughters, and to others.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator explain the term ``clinical trials?'' \nThe Senator has made such an important point about this issue. There \nare so many differences between the Republican and Democratic bills. \nOne of the myriad of differences has to do with the so-called \n``clinical trial'' provision. The Senator has spoken on the floor so \npatiently and eloquently about the concept of clinical trials and \naccess to them. When we talk about clinical trials, are we talking \nabout innovative techniques to respond to health problems that take \nfull advantage of research and the opportunities of medicine that this \ncountry provides? Are we talking about giving people access to that \nmedicine and cutting-edge technology just as soon as it is available?\n  Isn't that really what we are talking about?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  If I could add to what the Senator has said, we have made great \nprogress in dealing with cancer, especially children's cancers, over \nthe last 10 years. The principal reason for this progress is the large \nnumber of clinical trials. We should take the time to spell out what \nhas actually happened in the clinical trials and why that is an \nimportant provision of the leader's Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We should talk about clinical trials and how critical \nthey are.\n  I ask the Senator if he could inform Members what impact it would \nhave on an individual were he or she able to have access to clinical \ntrials today under this bill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Senator, I will speak from a personal point of view. My \nson was 12 years old when he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, bone \ncancer. Chances of survival were 15 percent; the mortality rate was 85 \npercent. We were able to enroll my son in a National Institutes of \nHealth clinical trial, which only 22 children had gone through \nsuccessfully. He was in that program for 2 years. By the time he \nfinished, they had more than 400 children taking part in that program \nwho survived osteosarcoma, with a breakthrough new treatment for \nosteosarcoma. Seven thousand children are affected every single year. \nAt that time, the loss of a leg was a matter of course; it is not at \nthe present time.\n  There is no question that not only my son but many of the other \nchildren would not likely have survived had they not participated in \nthe clinical trial. That treatment for osteosarcoma is now the standard \ntreatment and is saving countless children's lives.\n  There are many other examples. Our greatest progress in cancer \nresearch\n\n[[Page S7430]]\n\nand in treating cancer has been a direct result of clinical trials.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the Senator would yield for a clarification, is the \nSenator saying that in many cases today insurance companies and managed \ncare organizations are refusing to allow a patient access to the very \nkind of treatment that you say your son received? Is that what is going \non?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Not only am I saying that, but most important is that \nthe directors of the Lombardi Cancer Research Center, located here in \nWashington, DC, one of the major centers in the country in cancer \nresearch programs and clinical trials, is saying that as well. The \ndirector says they employ eight professionals who work 18 hours a day \ncombating health maintenance organizations to help enroll women in \nbreast cancer clinical trials. Doctors have recommended patients for \nclinical trials, with treatment that can probably save their lives, but \ndue to resistance and denials by the health maintenance organizations, \nthose women are effectively denied treatment that may save their lives. \nThat is happening today.\n  As the Senator knows, all we are trying to do with this particular \nproposal is follow sound medical guidelines, the medical guidelines \nthat your doctor--who may be an oncologist acting on behalf of a victim \nof breast cancer--believes, given the clinical trials taking place, \nproviding you a real chance of surviving if we enlist you in the \nclinical trial; this is in your medical best interest.\n  Your bill says your physician's medical determination is going to be \nthe controlling judgment. It isn't going to be an accountant in the HMO \nwho says: We don't believe that treatment is justified and we are not \nprepared to pay for it; I am making the medical judgment--even though I \nam trained as an accountant.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is talking now about specifics, and Senator \nDaschle was asking about clinical trials.\n  Let me ask another specific. Regarding emergency room treatment. \nSenator Kennedy makes the point there is the Patients' Bill of Rights \non this side and the Patients' Bill of Rights on that side. But they \nare not the same. There is a big difference.\n  Let me give an example regarding emergency room care. I told the \nstory of a case of a woman named Jacqueline the other day. Jacqueline \nis a real person. She was hiking in the Shenandoah. While hiking in the \nShenandoah, she slipped and fell down a 40-foot cliff. She fractured \nthree bones in her body, including her pelvis. She was unconscious. She \nwas medivac'ed by helicopter, taken to a hospital emergency room, and \ntreated. She survived.\n  The HMO said: We don't intend to pay for your emergency room \ntreatment because you didn't have prior approval to go to the emergency \nroom.\n  This is a woman who was unconscious.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights that the AMA and so many other groups \nhave endorsed--they have written in support--is different from the bill \nthe majority party offers in the emergency room treatment in the sense \nthat we require not only the ``prudent'' layperson standard in \nemergency care and emergency room, but we require also the \npoststability care that is necessary after you have been to an \nemergency room, and their bill does not do it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. We have had constant \nexamples of abuses that have taken place. Senators have printed in the \nRecord these human tragedies.\n  The Senator understands fully that this is not only something from \nlast year or something from last month. The situation the Senator has \noutlined is happening today. It has happened this morning; it has \nhappened this afternoon; it will happen tomorrow. It will continue to \nhappen unless and until we pass this legislation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I just described a case of a woman being hauled into the \nhospital unconscious and being told: We can't pay your bill because you \ndidn't get prior approval for emergency room treatment.\n  That is absurd. That is the kind of horror story that requires all \nAmericans to believe we must pass a Patients' Bill of Rights that has \nteeth and works to solve real problems.\n  Isn't it the case, with respect to emergency room care, that we in \nthis Congress have already given all senior citizens in the Medicare \nprogram exactly what is proposed in our bill with respect to emergency \nroom treatment and poststability care? Isn't it the case that every \nMember of the Senate has already voted for that in Medicare, saying \nyes, that is the right thing to do; but when it comes to the Patients' \nBill of Rights they say: We want to have a Patients' Bill of Rights, \nbut on our emergency room care, we don't intend to offer that \nprotection on not only emergency room care but also poststability care \nin a hospital after you get out of the emergency room; we don't intend \nto offer that, even though we have already done that and voted for it \nfor Medicare patients.\n  I don't understand the contradiction; does the Senator from \nMassachusetts?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has correctly stated the current situation. \nIt isn't only Medicare. It is also in Medicaid, as well as the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program. Every Senator has these protections.\n  The interesting question I ask the Senator, if these protections were \nsuch burdens on the delivery system, doesn't the Senator think he would \nhave heard? These protections are available today, for those who are \ncovered with Medicaid or Medicare. The other side in opposition to the \nDaschle proposal is always saying these protections are burdening the \nsystem, and we can't protect all Americans because it will burden the \nsystem?\n  The Senator has made the correct point. We do it today in Medicaid. \nWe do it in Medicare. We do it for Federal employees. Most of the good \nHMOs do it. It is the bad apples that are threatening the well-being \nand the health of many of the citizens in our States whose procedures \nwe need to address.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will respond, if the Senator will yield to me further, \nwith the story I told on the floor of the Senate, about the woman who \nwas also injured, whose brain was swelling and who was in an ambulance \nbeing taken to a hospital and who said to the ambulance driver, I do \nnot want to go to X hospital. She named the hospital. I want to go to Y \nhospital farther down the road. This woman lying in the back of an \nambulance with a brain injury said: I want to go to the hospital \nfarther away. Why did she say that? Because she read that the hospital \nthat was closest had made decisions about patients' care that were more \na function of corporate profit and loss than they were about health \ncare, and she did not want, with a brain injury, to be wheeled into the \nemergency room with the notion somebody was going to look at her and \nmake a dollar-and-cents decision about her health care.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the Senator will yield on that point, I would like to \ncomment. I think what he has noted is exactly another reason why it is \nso important for us to have a debate about access to emergency rooms \nand other necessary care.\n  I would note that just the opposite of what the Senator describes \noftentimes occurs. A managed care company, or an HMO, actually will \nmake you drive past the nearest hospital to go to a hospital farther \naway, where they have a contract.\n  Sometimes a patient will choose not to use the nearest hospital, for \na lot of reasons--better care, preferred specialists, different \nservices. A patient may want to go farther away. But, in many cases, \nmaybe a preponderance of cases, they actually have to drive past \nhospitals to go to the hospital the HMO has chosen, rather than the one \nthey would choose for themselves.\n  Again, I think the Senator makes a very good point.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I just make this point? Access to emergency care, \nwhich is carefully protected in the leader's legislation, does the \nleader know that the provisions in his legislation were almost \nunanimously supported in the President's Commission on Quality Care? \nThe one exception is the President's Commission did not make the \nrecommendation that it be put in law, although they said every quality \nhealth maintenance organization ought to have it.\n  Second, the American Association of Health Plans has recommended it.\n\n[[Page S7431]]\n\n They do not mandate it, but they recommend it, saying it is essential \nin providing care.\n  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners--not a Democratic \ngroup, the majority of Insurance Commissioners are probably \nRepublicans--has recommended it for the States. They say, in the \nStates, as a matter of good quality health care, they ought to have the \nprovisions which are in our Patients' Bill of Rights. As the Senators \nhave pointed out, it has been included in Medicare.\n  So this proposal, which was offered and defeated in the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee, should be a matter where we \nhave an opportunity to present it and let the Senate make a judgment. \nAs I mentioned, it has been recommended by the nonpartisan commission. \nIt has been recommended by the independent insurance commissioners. It \nis in Medicare. We would like to hear on the floor of the Senate those \nindividuals who are opposed, those individuals who say no to this \nparticular protection. That is the kind of protection that is included \nin the Daschle proposal, which is of such importance.\n  Mr. President, I see others want to speak on this proposal.\n  In looking down this list of protections, you can ask yourselves: \nWhere do these protections really come from? As I mentioned, the \nprotections we have put into the Daschle proposal are effectively the \nones supported by the President's commission, the American Association \nfor Health Plans, and the Insurance Commissioners. It is in Medicare. \nIt is working, and it is working effectively. We do not have examples \nthat protecting those under Medicare is a burden, and I do not think \nthose who are opposed to that particular proposal can make an effective \ncase in opposition to this provision.\n\n  I will take the time later to mention two or three more protections. \nVirtually every one of these protections is either part of a \nrecommendation from the President's commission, part of the \nrecommendations of the American Association of Health Plans, \nrecommended by the state Insurance Commissioners, or is being \nimplemented and protecting persons covered under Medicare.\n  These are commonsense proposals. They are not protections we have \nsuddenly grabbed from some way-out organization or group. They are \nfundamentally rooted in sound health care practices. That is the case \nwe want to bring to the floor of the Senate.\n  I see my colleague and friend on the floor now, wishing to speak. I \nwill be back to address the Senate shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. \nFirst, on this issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights, I ran for the \nSenate in part so I could address this issue, which is of critical \nimportance to the people of North Carolina and the people of America, \nin a completely nonpartisan way. I am not interested in engaging in \npartisan politics between Democrats and Republicans. What I am \ninterested in is a real discussion about an issue that is absolutely \ncritically important to the people of this country and the people of \nNorth Carolina. Let me talk briefly about one aspect of the Patients' \nBill of Rights that I think is so important.\n  Imagine there is a 29-year-old woman who lives in the Research \nTriangle of North Carolina which is between Raleigh-Durham and Chapel \nHill, between Duke University Medical School and the University of \nNorth Carolina Medical School. Let's assume she is the mother of two \nchildren, having recently had a young child, born 6 months ago. She \ngoes in for a postpartum checkup after the birth of her child, and the \ndoctor looks at a mole on her back that seems suspicious. After some \nfurther testing, it is confirmed that her and her family's worst \nnightmare is true; she has a melanoma.\n  After they do further investigation, they determine there are \nclinical trials going on at Duke University Medical Center, just down \nthe road from where she and her family live, which could provide \nlifesaving treatment for her condition. So she goes to her HMO and \nsays: I want to be part of this; I want to make sure I have access to \nthe best health care available. Literally, her life is as stake. She \nfinds out from her HMO, unfortunately, that Duke is not part of the \nnetwork of her HMO. So, as a result, treatment for her melanoma, which \nis so critically needed, is not available.\n  Here we have a situation where a simple thing is true. An HMO system, \na health insurance system, a health insurance company, should not be \nable to stand between this woman and the lifesaving medical treatment \nshe so badly needs and her family so badly needs for her. A real \nPatients' Bill of Rights would ensure that someone in her condition \nwould have access to the best specialty care available, whether or not \nthat care is within or without her HMO network. It would ensure, in my \nexample, that she could, in fact, go 15 miles down the road to Duke \nUniversity Medical Center and get the treatment that may well save her \nlife--the life of a mother and a wife.\n  This is the kind of thing we need to be doing something about in the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. She should not be confronted with an obstacle \ncourse in order to get the treatment she needs and deserves. She needs \nto have ready, direct access to the care she obviously needs under \nthese circumstances. That was an illustration.\n\n  I want to talk, secondly, about a real-life example. We received a \nphone call in my office from a young man who lives in Cary, NC, which \nis just outside of Raleigh. His name is Steve Grissom. Fifteen years \nago, Steve Grissom was diagnosed with leukemia. The truth is, for most \npeople, that would be an extraordinary life-altering and devastating \nthing to have occur. Unfortunately, that is not the end of the problem \nfor Steve Grissom.\n  In 1985, because of his leukemia, he was required to have a blood \ntransfusion. Most folks who are listening to this story probably know \nwhere it is headed. As a result of this blood transfusion, which he had \nto get because of his leukemia, he now has AIDS. He got AIDS as a \nresult of the blood transfusion.\n  With the onset of AIDS, he had multiple medical problems. Included \namong those medical problems was the development of something called \npulmonary hypertension which made it very difficult for him to breathe. \nThe doctors who treated him prescribed oxygen 24 hours a day, 7 days a \nweek to help him maintain his oxygen level. This prescription was made \nby a pulmonary specialist at Duke University, something that was \nclearly needed to save his life.\n  He was doing fine. Then his employer changed health care companies, \nunbeknownst to him. When the new HMO took over, they cut off payment \nfor the oxygen that Steve had been dependent on for a long time now--24 \nhours a day, 7 days a week.\n  Let me tell you how that decision was made. It was not made by some \nmedical doctor who examined Steve and decided he did not need this \ntreatment. It was not made by a specialist who had a different opinion \nthan the pulmonary specialist at Duke University. Instead it was made \nby a clerical/bureaucratic person at the HMO sitting behind a desk \nlooking at papers. The conclusion that person came to was that his \noxygen saturation levels were not sufficiently low under their criteria \nto justify him receiving oxygen 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, even \nthough the most highly trained medical specialist in the area at Duke \nUniversity Hospital had prescribed this oxygen for him. He said it was \nlifesaving, absolutely critical.\n  The result of all this was basically an insurance company bureaucrat \nsitting behind a desk overrode a doctor who has spent his life in this \narea, who had become one of the best known pulmonary specialists in the \ncountry at Duke University, who had prescribed this oxygen therapy for \nSteve. Here is a man who has been confronted with extraordinary \nsetbacks in his life, the kinds of things that would put most of us \nunder the ground.\n  Here is the extraordinary thing about Steve Grissom. He has continued \nto fight. Even though his health insurance company now says they will \nnot pay for the care he needs, he has managed to pay out of his own \npocket for as much of this care as he can get.\n  He has called my office and said: I want to come to Washington. I \nwant to testify. I want to talk to Members of\n\n[[Page S7432]]\n\nthe Senate, Members of the Congress. I want to tell them about the \nproblem I am having getting any continuity of care which I so \ndesperately need.\n  The truth of the matter is, what Steve Grissom is doing is he is \nfighting in every way he knows how to cease being a statistic, to stop \nbeing a name and a number on a piece of paper on somebody's desk \nsitting in an insurance company office.\n  He is an extraordinary example of heroism. He is the kind of person \nwhom I think most of us would hold up to our children and members of \nour family as what we hope they will be when confronted with \nextraordinary, difficult setbacks.\n  He fought back. He got the blood transfusion he needed in 1985. When \nhe was then confronted with something that would absolutely overcome \nmost people, which is AIDS as a result of the blood transfusion, he \ncontinued to do everything in his power to get the treatment he needed \nand go forward with his life.\n\n  When he was on oxygen 24 hours a day, 7 days a week just to stay \nalive and his employer changed HMOs and they cut off payment for the \ntreatment that kept him alive, he continued to fight. Here is the most \nextraordinary thing about it. Not only has he continued to fight, not \nonly has he expressed a willingness to come and talk to Members of the \nSenate, to testify before this Congress about what he has been \nconfronted with, there is absolutely no bitterness in this man. He has \nbeen kind and gracious. He has said: I want to do everything I can to \nensure that what has happened to me does not happen to other Americans, \ndoes not happen to other North Carolinians. I want to explain to \nMembers of Congress why it is so critically important that we pass a \nmeaningful Patients' Bill of Rights, one that will protect people who \nare confronted with the kind of situation with which I am confronted.\n  The truth of the matter is, it is extraordinary that he is still \nalive. He continues to be a huge part of his family's life. He is, by \nany measure, a hero. But to the insurance company, Steve Grissom is a \nliability. He is somebody who costs $515 a month to pay for the oxygen \nthat is needed to keep him alive.\n  The reality is that they made the decision about Steve Grissom for \nthe same reason that HMOs and health insurance companies make these \ndecisions all across the country, affecting children and adults and \nfamilies all over this country every day. They did it based on the \nbottom line--profits. They had established an arbitrary criteria for \nwhat was necessary for somebody in Steve's situation to get oxygen \ntherapy and treatment that he needed. Regardless of his individual \nsituation, regardless of the fact that the doctors who were responsible \nfor treating him, who are highly trained, highly specialized experts at \nDuke University Medical Center, had said he needs this treatment, they \nrejected it. They made the decision that no longer would he receive \nthis oxygen, and they would not pay for it anymore.\n  I cannot help but believe the majority of Americans think that what \nhas been done to Steve Grissom is wrong; that the courage he has shown \nin the face of extraordinary adversity is something that should be \nadmired and looked up to. He is absolutely entitled to the benefit of \nthe doubt, to the extent there is any doubt, that a specialist at Duke \nUniversity has determined that he is entitled to this treatment that he \nso desperately needs.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Given that this patient is denied the treatment that can \nmake all the difference in restoring his health or well-being, and \ngiven that we have heard examples where, as a result of denying that \ntreatment, a decision made by the health maintenance organization \ndespite the recommendations of the medical professional--can the \nSenator tell me the remedies available? What remedies are available to \na family whose loved one dies or whose loved one sustains a permanent \ninjury because a judgment was made by the insurance company or the HMO, \nin conflict with the recommendation by the treating doctor. What remedy \nis available to that family that loses its breadwinner or has to care \nfor an individual who is permanently injured for the rest of their \nlife? What remedy is available for the family who loses a loved one due \nto the negligence or the clear malfeasance of the insurance company or \nthe HMO?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. The Senator's question highlights an enormous problem in \nexisting law and a problem that we are trying to desperately cure in \nthis Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Under the circumstance I have just described, if something happens to \nSteve Grissom, i.e., he suffers more serious injury or dies as a result \nof an arbitrary decision made by an insurance company bureaucrat, if \nthat occurs, first of all, under the existing law, that HMO and that \nbureaucrat cannot in any way be held responsible. They are totally \nimmune to responsibility, unlike every other American--you, I, any \nother American--who could be held accountable in court for that \ndecision. They are totally immune from responsibility. They are \nprotected.\n  As a result, they only have one incentive for what they do, and that \nincentive is the green dollar bill, the profit, the bottom line. It is \nthe only thing that matters to them. That is the basis on which these \ndecisions are made.\n  Not only that, not only can they not be held accountable in court, I \nsay to the Senator, there is not even an independent review board that \ncan look at this decision that has been made and determine whether it \nis unfair, whether it is unjust, and whether it is medically unsound.\n  So basically, Steve Grissom and his family, in this life-threatening \nsituation, are confronted with a circumstance where they have no remedy \nat all. They can do absolutely nothing.\n  Does that answer the Senator's question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Further, is the Senator suggesting that this is the only \narea in civil law that a remedy is really being denied on the basis of \nreal negligence, malfeasance? Are these the only companies in America \nthat have this sort of privileged position of being free from what I \nthink most Americans would understand as accountability? Is that what \nthe Senator is suggesting?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. That is exactly what I am suggesting, I say to the \nSenator.\n  I add, anecdotally, one of the things that the Senator knows, I have \ncome from 20 years of having represented folks in court cases. One of \nthe questions we always ask jurors in the process of jury selection is: \nDo you believe everyone should be treated exactly the same in this \ncourtroom? Universally, the answer is yes. Because the American people \nare fairminded. They believe everyone should be treated equally, \neveryone should be treated the same. They believe in both personal and \ncorporate responsibility, that everybody ought to be held accountable \nfor what they do or do not do--the very same way we teach our children \nthey should be held accountable for what they do or do not do.\n  Instead, under existing law in this country, we have decided HMOs and \nhealth insurance companies are privileged characters. They get treated \nin a way that no other American business is treated, that no other \nAmerican citizen--the people who are listening to this debate--is \ntreated. They are held responsible for what they do.\n  But for some reason, under the law, unless and until we are able to \nchange it, HMOs and health insurance companies are treated in a very \nprivileged way. They cannot be held responsible for what they do. \nUnfortunately, that has enormous consequences for people, for families, \nand for children. The consequence is they have no reason to do anything \nother than the profit motivation, and the bottom line, which is the \ndollar. That is one of the problems we are working desperately to cure \nin our Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally--because I see others on the floor; and this \nissue is going to be addressed in the Daschle proposal--I am wondering \nwhether the Senator would agree with Justice William Young, a Federal \njudge on the Federal bench in Massachusetts, who was appointed by \nPresident Ronald Reagan, who said, after a very tragic case--and I will \nnot review all of the facts here, but it was quite clear that there was \nresponsibility by the insurance companies; and it will be self-evident \nin his quote; and there was a real injustice done--this is what Judge \nWilliam Young, appointed by President Reagan, who prior to the time he\n\n[[Page S7433]]\n\nserved on the bench was a Republican, said:\n\n       Disturbing to this Court is the failure of Congress to \n     amend a statute that, due to the changing realities of the \n     modern health care system, has gone conspicuously awry from \n     its original intent. This Court has no choice but to pluck \n     the case out of State court . . . and then, at the behest of \n     Travelers [Insurance Company]--\n\n  That is effectively the culprit--\n\n     slam the courthouse door in [the wife's] face and leave her \n     without any remedy. ERISA has evolved into a shield of \n     immunity that protects health insurers . . . from potential \n     liability for the consequences of their wrongful denial of \n     health benefits.\n\n  That is the statement from the bench of a distinguished Federal judge \nwho came down and eventually effectively testified about the injustice \nof this provision. As I understand it, the Daschle proposal addresses \nthat inequity and unfairness, which the Senator has outlined.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. May I respond to that briefly, I say to Senator Kennedy?\n  I would ask for a comment from you on this issue. In terms of talking \nto your constituents in Massachusetts, can you tell me what response \nyou have gotten, including from health care providers, on the issue of \nwhether it is important to them, No. 1, that there be an independent \nreview board so when folks' claims are denied, they have some ready \nprocess to use to get relief, and, secondly, whether they believe it is \nfair for HMOs and health insurance companies to be treated completely \ndifferently than every other segment of American society?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As the Senator knows, they have independent review. We \nhave it under the Medicare proposal. It works. It works very \neffectively. It works pretty well. It is somewhat different in scope \nthan was included in the Daschle proposal. I favor this one here, but \nthere is an independent review. But not only in that measure, we have \nsome 23 million Americans who are working for State and local \ngovernments that have the kind of protection that is favored in the \nDaschle proposal, and it is working very effectively.\n  One of the very important programs that has the kind of protections \nthe Senator has favored and that I favor is what they call the Calpurse \nProgram in the State of California, which has well over a million \nindividuals who are part of that program with the kind of protections \nthat are supported by the Senator.\n  What they have found out--we will have a chance to get into this, \nhopefully, at the time we get a debate on it--is that the cost of that \nwhole program has not increased as much as the increase in health \ninsurance nationwide, or even in the programs in California that do not \nhave that protection.\n  Do you want to know why, Senator, I believe that is so? For the same \nreason we had the expert witnesses who appeared before Senator \nSpecter's Appropriations Committee; and that is, because the HMOs take \nmore time and attention to make sure the patients are going to get \nbetter kinds of health care and health care coverage. That basically \nmeans they are able to get a better handle on the cost.\n  So it makes a major difference in terms of the quality of health \ncare, and it makes a major difference in terms of the protections of \nindividuals.\n  I thank the Senator for his response.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would the Senator from North Carolina yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  I have been very impressed with what he has said. As the Senator \nknows, I have been advocating the Patients' Bill of Rights for quite a \nwhile. Just this week I had traveled to different parts of my State--to \nLong Island, to New York City, to Syracuse, to Rochester. Everywhere I \nwent, I found an amazing thing: The providers, the doctors, including \nthe medical society, the AMA, the nurses, the hospitals are allied with \nthe patients. Usually they are at loggerheads. But they were allied \ntogether in asking for a real Patients' Bill of Rights, not a Patients' \nBill of Rights in name only.\n  We do not want to go through putting something on the floor that \nsays: Patients' Bill of Rights, and does not protect patients. We are \nworried about that.\n  The reason I think we want an open debate and not just: Well, here is \nyour version; we will vote for it. Here is our version; we will vote it \ndown. We are finished with the Patients' Bill of Rights--we do not want \nthat because we do not want to be able to just go home and say we \npassed something and then 3 months from now the very same doctors, and \nothers, will say: It doesn't do any good. You didn't do anything.\n  We went through this on guns. We were going to pass something in this \nbody that did absolutely nothing. Then the very same people who say the \ngun laws do not work, or who tried to cripple and emasculate the \nprovisions we passed, said the laws do not work.\n  So the question I ask is--here are some examples of inequities that I \nhave come across. I just would like to ask the Senator from North \nCarolina if he thinks the Patients' Bill of Rights would help in these \ninstances; and they are just amazing.\n  One, an HMO denies high-dose chemotherapy for a man with lung and \nbrain cancer, stating it is experimental. What was the HMO's solution? \nThe claim agent told his family to get in touch with organizations that \nhave fundraisers for patients denied HMO coverage. Can you imagine the \ngall of that? A man is dying of cancer. They find a solution that might \nwork. There is finally some hope in the family. Not only does the HMO \nsay, no, we won't pay for it, but at the same time they say go have \nsome fundraisers while the person has cancer. How about this one----\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask, if I might, will the Senator from North Carolina \nyield to me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from North Carolina \nhas the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for the purpose of a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining \n65 minutes of debate before the vote at 5:45 on the motion to table be \ndivided as follows: 40 minutes under the control of Senator Nickles on \nthe Republican side and 25 minutes under the control of Senator Kennedy \non the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 more minutes to the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Senator. I will conclude my remarks. The \npoint I make is so important, which is that this is not a partisan \ndebate. This is not a debate and should not be a debate between \nDemocrats and Republicans. I didn't come to the Senate to fight with my \nRepublican colleagues. I came to the Senate to represent the people of \nNorth Carolina--Republicans, Democrats, Independents, whatever their \npolitics. We desperately need to talk about the specific provisions of \na real, substantive, meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights. That is what \nneeds to happen. That is the reason we are on the floor today talking \nabout this amendment. It is the reason this amendment has been attached \nto the agriculture appropriations bill.\n  We need desperately to talk about these issues because they are so \ncritically important to the people of my State--all of the people of my \nState--and they are important to all Americans. We have to make sure \nthat folks have direct access to specialty care. It does absolutely no \ngood for us to have the most advanced medical care and treatment and \nresearch in the world in this country if folks can't get to it. Folks \nhave to be able to have access to the high-quality medical care that is \nconstantly advancing on a daily basis in medical centers throughout \nthis country, including medical centers in my home State, including \nDuke University Medical Center, University of North Carolina, Bowman \nGrey, and East Carolina University.\n  We have great medical centers in North Carolina. But those folks and \nthe care they can provide do no good whatsoever if they can't provide \nthe treatment to the patients. That is where health insurance \ncompanies, HMOs, stand as a roadblock between the doctors and the \nhealth care providers who are spending their lives developing these \nlifesaving treatments and the patients who so desperately need them.\n\n[[Page S7434]]\n\n  Steve Grissom, the gentlemen I described with leukemia and AIDS, is a \nperfect example. There are heroes all over this country, all over North \nCarolina, who are standing up and fighting battles against health \nproblems that are critical to them and their families. We have to give \nthem direct access to the treatment and care that can save their lives \nand change the lives of their families.\n  It is very simple. The bottom line is this: Patients, not profits, \nshould be the bottom line in health care. That is what this Patients' \nBill of Rights is about. We simply want an opportunity to talk about it \nto our colleagues, whom we respect, on the floor of the Senate, to talk \nabout it to the American people. And I am telling you, the American \npeople in their gut know that this is something that needs to be \npassed, needs to be done, and that health insurance companies and HMOs \nabsolutely should not stand between children and families and the \nhealth care that, in many cases, can save their lives.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the accommodation and \ncooperation by my friend and colleague, Senator Durbin from Illinois. \nThere are several on this side who wish to speak on this issue as well. \nWe have been wanting to speak for about the last hour.\n  I yield to the Senator from Vermont for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is an important time for America to \nlisten to this debate because the lives and health of individuals \nthroughout this Nation are at stake. It is interesting to note, looking \nback to last year when the Democratic proposal came forward, at first \nthey wanted it to be voted on immediately. Then we worked together on \nthis side of the aisle and worked up a bill that we find is superior to \ntheirs in many respects, which I will talk about later, and all of a \nsudden they didn't want to bring it up without 100 amendments. We could \nnot get a time agreement to get to the bill. Even though some of the \nthings sound quite dramatic and wonderful, when we analyze them, we \nfind that in many respects we believe the majority's bill is superior.\n  First of all, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act addresses those areas \nof health care quality on which there is a broad consensus. It is solid \nlegislation that will result in a greatly improved health care system \nfor all Americans.\n  The Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions has been long \ndedicated to action in order to improve the quality of health care. Our \ncommitment to developing appropriate managed care standards has been \ndemonstrated by the 17 additional hearings related to health care \nquality. And Senator Frist's Public Health and Safety Subcommittee held \nthree hearings on the work of the Agency for Health Care Policy and \nResearch (AHCPR).\n  Each of these hearings helped us in developing the separate pieces of \nlegislation that are reflected in our Patients' Bill of Rights Act.\n  People need to know what their plan will cover and how they will get \ntheir health care. The Patients' Bill of Rights requires full \ndisclosure by an employer about the health plans it offers to \nemployees.\n  Patients also need to know how adverse decisions by a plan can be \nappealed, both internally and externally, to an independent medical \nreviewer. That is a critical difference. We emphasize good health care. \nUnder our bill the reviewer's decision will be binding on the health \nplan. However, the patient will maintain his or her current rights to \ngo to court. Timely utilization decisions and a defined process for \nappealing such decisions are the keys to restoring trust in the health \ncare system.\n  Our legislation also provides Americans covered by health insurance \nwith new rights to prevent discrimination based on predictive genetic \ninformation.\n  It ensures that medical decisions are made by physicians in \nconsultation with their patients and are based on the best scientific \nevidence. And it provides a stronger emphasis on quality improvement in \nour health care system with a refocused role for AHCPR.\n  The other bill uses the generally accepted practice in the area which \ncan deviate very strongly from best medicine. We give you best \nmedicine.\n  Some believe that the answer to improving our nation's health care \nquality is to allow greater access to the tort system. However, you \nsimply cannot sue your way to better health. We believe that patients \nmust get the care they need when they need it, not just after they go \nto court in a lawsuit to repair the damage.\n  In the ``Patients' Bill of Rights,'' we make sure each patient is \nafforded every opportunity to have the right treatment decision made by \nhealth care professionals. In the event that does occur, patients have \nthe recourse of pursuing an outside appeal. Prevention, not litigation, \nis the best medicine.\n  Our bill creates new, enforceable Federal health care standards to \ncover those 48 million of the 124 million Americans covered by \nemployer-sponsored plans. These are the very same people that the \nStates, through their regulation of private health insurance companies, \ncannot protect.\n  What are these standards? They include: a prudent layperson standard \nfor emergency care; a mandatory point of service option; direct access \nto OB/GYNs and pediatricians; continuity of care; a prohibition on gag \nrules; access to Medication; access to Specialists; and self-pay for \nbehavioral health.\n  It would be inappropriate to set Federal health insurance standards \nthat duplicate the responsibility of the 50 State insurance \ndepartments. As the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, \nput it: ``(w)e do not want States to be preempted by Congressional or \nadministrative ac\ntions. . . . Congress should focus attention on those consumers who \nhave no protections in self-funded ERISA plans.''\n\n  Senator Kennedy's approach would set health insurance standards that \nduplicate the responsibility of the 50 State insurance departments. \nWorse yet, it would mandate that the Health Care Financing \nAdministration (HCFA) enforce them if a State decides not to adopt \nthem.\n  Those of us who have been involved with this know what happened \nduring the recent past when the HIPAA bill was passed on to HCFA. It \nwas a mess. Almost nothing was getting done.\n  HCFA cannot even keep up with its current responsibilities. This past \nrecess Senator Leahy and I held a meeting in Vermont to let New England \nhome health providers meet with HCFA. It was a packed and angry house, \nwith providers traveling from New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and \nConnecticut.\n  It is in no one's best interest to build a dual system of overlapping \nState and Federal health insurance regulation.\n  Increasing health insurance premiums causes significant losses in \ncoverage.\n  This is the main difference. You can promise a lot of things when you \ntry to do them. But if the result of what you do is that up to 1 \nmillion people lose coverage because of the increased cost, that is not \nthe way we ought to go.\n  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) pegged the cost of the \nDemocratic bill at six times higher than S. 326. Based on our best \nestimates, passage of the Democratic bill would result in a loss of \ncoverage for over 1.5 million working Americans and their families. To \nput this in perspective, this would mean that would have their family's \ncoverage canceled under the Democratic bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. On the Senator's time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On my time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has referred to the loss in terms of \ncoverage by the General Accounting Office. Will the Senator share that \nletter which allegedly reached that conclusion? Will the Senator put \nthat in the Record at this time so we have a full statement of the \nGeneral Accounting Office rather than just using the figure that the \nSenator used? Will the Senator make that whole letter a part of the \nRecord?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I would be happy to make that a part of the Record, \nyes.\n\n[[Page S7435]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Let me repeat that. Adoption of the Democratic approach \nwould cancel the insurance policies of almost a million and half \nAmericans. I cannot support legislation that would result in the loss \nof health insurance coverage for a population the size covered in the \ncombined states of Vermont, Delaware, South Dakota, and Wyoming.\n  Fortunately, we can provide the key protections that consumers want \nat a minimal cost and without disruption of coverage--if we apply these \nprotections responsibly and where they are needed.\n  In sharp contrast to the Democratic alternative, our bill would \nactually increase coverage. With the additional of the Tax Code \nprovisions to S. 326, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act, our bill allows \nfor the full deduction of health insurance for the self-employed, the \nfull availability of medical savings accounts and the carryover of \nunused benefits from flexible spending accounts. With the new Patients' \nBill of Rights Plus Act we provide Americans with greater choice to \nmore affordable health insurance.\n  S. 326, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act, provides necessary consumer \nprotections without adding significant new costs; without increasing \nlitigation; and without micro-managing health plans.\n  I also point out that under the law a doctor is still open to suit. \nAlthough they are prescribed health plans, the doctors are liable.\n  Our goal is to give Americans the protections they want and need in a \npackage that they can afford and that we can enact.\n  This is why I hope the Patients' Bill of Rights that we are offering \ntoday will be enacted and signed into law by the President.\n  I believe very strongly that the advantages we get, especially that \nwe require, the standard of best medicine, and not just the medicine \nthat is generally used in the area is by far a much better protection \nfor the people we are trying to protect--the patients--than the \nDemocrat's Patient's Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         General Accounting Office, Health, Education and Human \n           Services Division,\n                                     Washington, DC, July 7, 1998.\n\n     Subject: Private Health Insurance: Impact of Premium \n         Increases on the Number of Covered Individuals Is \n         Uncertain\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Chairman, Committee on Labor and Human Resources, U.S. \n         Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Almost 150 million individuals obtained \n     health insurance through the workplace in 1996, either \n     through their own employment or the employment of a family \n     member. During the last several years, an increasing number \n     of individuals with employer-sponsored insurance have \n     enrolled in some form of managed care rather than in fee-for-\n     service plans. Recently, concerns have grown regarding the \n     ways in which some managed care plans operate and the \n     adequacy of information shared between each plan, its \n     providers, and its members.\n       In response to these concerns, several legislative \n     proposals have been made to require health insurance plans to \n     adopt specified operational practices. The proposals apply to \n     all types of plans, but would likely have their greatest \n     impact on health maintenance organizations (HMO). Other types \n     of plans, such as preferred provider organizations (PPO) and \n     indemnity, or fee-for-service, plans, will likely be affected \n     to a lesser degree. Included in various proposals are \n     requirements, for example, to disclose certain \n     information,\\1\\ guarantee patient access to emergency and \n     specialty services, implement internal and external grievance \n     policies, guarantee freedom of communication between \n     providers and patients, and eliminate the Employee Retirement \n     Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) restrictions on health \n     plan liability.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\Footnotes at end of Report. (Figure not reproducible in \n     Record.)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       However, some lawmakers are concerned that these types of \n     mandates could increase the cost of health insurance and have \n     the unintended consequence of reducing the number of \n     individuals covered by private health insurance.\n       This letter responds to your request for information on the \n     relationship between the amount charged for private health \n     insurance and the number of insured individuals. You also \n     asked us to analyze the basis for a widely cited statistic \n     from the Lewin Group, a private research and consulting \n     organization, that the number of insured individuals would \n     fall by 400,000 for every 1-percent increase in health \n     insurance premiums. Specifically, we (1) examined the trends \n     in employers' decisions to offer insurance and employees' \n     decisions to purchase it, (2) assessed the methodology used \n     by the Lewin Group to support its 400,000 coverage loss \n     estimate, (3) assessed the methodology used by the Lewin \n     Group to produce its most recent estimates, and (4) evaluated \n     conditions or factors that could affect the impact of premium \n     increases on insurance coverage. To conduct our study, we \n     reviewed relevant published research. We also evaluated the \n     applicability of the Lewin Group's estimates given the data, \n     methods, and assumptions it used to produce its estimates. We \n     performed our work between May 1998 and June 1998 in \n     accordance with generally accepted government auditing \n     standards.\n       In summary, during a period of rising health insurance \n     premiums, the proportion of employees offered coverage rose, \n     while the share that accepted insurance fell. Between 1988 \n     and 1996, health insurance premiums increased, on average, by \n     approximately 8 percent per year.\\2\\ During roughly the same \n     period, 1987 to 1996, the proportion of workers who were \n     offered insurance by their employers rose from 72.4 percent \n     to 75.4 percent, according to one recent study.\\3\\ The same \n     study found that the proportion of workers who accepted \n     coverage, however, fell from 88.3 percent to 80.1 percent. \n     This may be because employers required employees to pay a \n     larger share of the premiums.\\4\\ In 1988, employees in small \n     firms (fewer than 200 workers) paid an average of 12 percent \n     of single-coverage premiums. Employees in large firms paid \n     about 13 percent.\\5\\ By 1996, the employee share had risen to \n     33 percent in small firms and 22 percent in large firms. \n     Other factors, such as decreases in some workers' real \n     incomes, Medicaid-eligibility expansions, and changes in \n     benefit generosity, also may have contributed to the fall in \n     the acceptance rate.\n       In November, 1997, the Lewin Group used published studies \n     to estimate that 400,000 fewer individuals would have health \n     insurance coverage for every 1 percent increase in insurance \n     premiums.\\6\\ Several of these studies had sought to quantify \n     the impact of subsidized insurance premiums on the increase \n     in the number of employers offering insurance. The Lewin \n     Group concluded from these studies that a 1-percent decrease \n     in premiums would likely induce an additional 0.4 percent of \n     employers to offer insurance. It then assumed that an \n     increase in premiums might cause a similar percentage of \n     firms to drop health insurance coverage and cause 400,000 \n     individuals to be without coverage. The findings of more \n     recent studies, however, call into question the basis for the \n     Lewin Group's estimate. Although these studies did not \n     quantify the relationship between premium increases and \n     changes in the number of employees with coverage, they \n     clearly show that employers generally continued to offer \n     insurance during a period of rising premiums but that fewer \n     employees decided to purchase coverage. The estimate also \n     assumes equal premium increases for all types of insurance \n     products. If new federal mandates primarily affect HMO \n     premiums, some employees may switch to other types of \n     insurance--especially insurance with different benefit \n     packages--instead of dropping coverage entirely. Thus, the \n     Lewin Group's estimate may not be a good predictor of the \n     coverage loss that might be caused by new federal mandates.\n       In January 1998, the Lewin Group lowered its estimate of \n     potential coverage losses by about 25 percent.\\7\\ It now \n     estimates that a 1-percent premium increase could result in \n     approximately 300,000 fewer individuals being covered by \n     private insurance. The new estimate is based on the Lewin \n     Group's statistical analysis of the relationship between how \n     much employees pay for insurance and the probability that \n     they, their spouses, and their dependent children have \n     employer-sponsored health insurance. However, it is unclear \n     how accurately the Lewin Group was able to measure the price \n     paid by the individuals in its sample. Moreover, the new \n     estimate applies to situations in which premiums for all \n     insurance types increase, on average, by 1 percent. If \n     premiums increase by 1 percent only for some insurance types \n     (for example, HMOs), then the coverage loss predicted by the \n     Lewin Group would be less than 300,000.\n       Because many factors can affect the number of individuals \n     covered by private insurance, it is difficult to predict the \n     impact of an increase in insurance premiums. For example, new \n     mandates may increase premiums but may also change \n     individuals' willingness to purchase insurance. Individuals \n     may not mind paying higher premiums if they like the changes \n     brought about by the mandates. The extent to which employers \n     pass on premium increases to employees also can affect \n     coverage by influencing employees' purchasing decisions. \n     Another important determinant is the extent to which \n     employees switch from plans with high premium increases to \n     plans with no or low premium increases, or to less expensive \n     plans with more limited benefits. Finally, changes in other \n     economic factors, such as income, or changes in public \n     insurance program eligibility requirements can affect the \n     number of individuals with private health insurance.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       Between 1995 and 1997, real health insurance premiums \n     (adjusted for inflation) remained nearly constant or fell \n     slightly\n\n[[Page S7436]]\n\n     across all plan types. (See table 1.) This represents a sharp \n     decline from the previous 5 years, in which inflation-\n     adjusted growth was as high as 11.6 percent for indemnity \n     plans and 10.6 percent for HMO plans in 1990.\n\n                                 TABLE 1.--PERCENTAGE OF REAL ANNUAL GROWTH IN PREMIUMS BY TYPE OF HEALTH PLAN, 1990-97\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                        Plan type                            1990        1991        1992        1993        1994        1995        1996        1997\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIndemnity...............................................        11.6         7.8         8.0         5.5         2.5        -0.1        -1.8         0.3\nPPO.....................................................         9.6         5.9         7.6         5.2         0.6         0.7        -2.4        -0.2\nHMO.....................................................        10.6         7.9         6.8         5.3         2.7        -2.4        -3.4       -0.3\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSources: GAO calculations based on data from KPMG Peat Marwick (1991-97); Health Insurance Association of America (1990), and Bureau of Labor Statistics\n  Consumer Price Index. Includes employer and employee shares of premiums for workers in private firms with at least 200 employees.\n\n       About 70 percent of the population under age 65 was covered \n     by health insurance purchased through an employer or union, \n     or purchased privately as an individual in 1996, according to \n     Current Population Survey (CPS) data. About 12 percent was \n     covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or the Civilian Health and \n     Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), and \n     about 18 percent was uninsured. From 1989 to 1996, the \n     percentage of the population covered by employer-sponsored, \n     union-sponsored, or individual insurance\\8\\ decreased \n     slightly, but these options still remained a dominant source \n     of coverage for people under age 65. (See fig. 1.) During the \n     same period, the proportion of the population covered by \n     Medicaid and the proportion without insurance both increased.\n\n\n  more workers were offered insurance, but fewer accepted coverage as \n                           premiums increased\n\n       Recent studies suggest that employers typically do not stop \n     offering health insurance when premiums increase. Between \n     1988 and 1996, health insurance premiums--unadjusted for \n     inflation--increased by about 8 percent per year, on average. \n     During approximately the same time period, one study\\9\\ found \n     that the fraction of workers offered insurance by their \n     employers grew slightly, from 72.4 percent to 75.4 percent. \n     The proportion of workers who had access to employer-\n     sponsored insurance, either through their own job or the job \n     of a family member, remained essentially constant at about 82 \n     percent. Another study\\10\\ reported that the fraction of \n     small firms (those with fewer than 200 employees) offering \n     insurance coverage grew from 46 percent in 1989 to 49 percent \n     in 1996. The study also found that 99 percent of large firms \n     offered insurance in 1996.\n       Fewer workers, however, are choosing to accept employer-\n     sponsored coverage for themselves or their dependents. In \n     1987, 88.3 percent of workers accepted coverage when their \n     employers offered it. In 1996, only 80.1 percent of workers \n     accepted coverage. The fall in the acceptance rate was \n     relatively large for workers under age 25 (from 86.5 percent \n     to 70.1 percent) and those making $7 per hour or less (from \n     79.7 percent to 63.2 percent). The fraction of workers who \n     accepted employer-sponsored insurance either through their \n     own job or that of a family member also declined, from 93.2 \n     percent to 89.1 percent. Consequently, even though a greater \n     percentage of employers offered insurance, the acceptance \n     rate fell to such an extent that a smaller proportion of \n     workers was covered by employer-sponsored insurance in 1996 \n     compared with 1997.\n       The fall in the acceptance rate may be attributable partly \n     to required increases in employees' insurance premium \n     contributions. One study found that employees in small firms \n     paid an average of 12 percent of single coverage premiums in \n     1988 and employees in large firms paid 13 percent.\\11\\ In \n     1996, the employee share had risen to 33 percent in small \n     firms and 22 percent in large firms. According to the Lewin \n     Group, the combined effect of the increase in premiums and \n     the increase in the employees' share of those premiums \n     resulted in workers paying 189 percent more in real terms for \n     single coverage and 85 percent more in real terms for family \n     coverage in 1996 compared with 1988.\n       Other factors also may have contributed to the drop in the \n     acceptance rate. A decline in real wages for some workers may \n     have made coverage less affordable. Expansions in Medicaid \n     eligibility provided a coverage alternative for some families \n     and may have decreased workers' willingness to accept \n     employer-sponsored insurance. Furthermore, possible changes \n     in benefit packages may have made coverage less desirable.\n\n\n   lewin estimate of 400,000 coverage loss based on outdated studies\n\n       In November 1997,\\12\\ the Lewin Group estimated that \n     400,000 fewer people might be covered by health insurance if \n     new legislation caused premiums to rise by 1 percent. Its \n     estimate was largely based on studies of the effects of \n     insurance premium subsidies on employers' decisions to offer \n     insurance. However, recent research casts doubt on the \n     applicability of these findings to other situations. \n     Furthermore, according to the Barents Group, a research and \n     consulting firm, the Lewin Group's coverage loss estimate may \n     be too high because some individuals may switch to other \n     types of health plans if new legislation causes HMO premiums \n     to rise.\n       Few studies have analyzed the relationship between the cost \n     of insurance and the number of individuals covered. The \n     studies available to Lewin in November 1997 primarily focused \n     on employers' decisions to offer insurance. These studies \n     varied widely both in their research questions and their \n     findings. Several studies\\13\\ examined the effects of \n     programs designed to increase coverage by subsidizing the \n     premiums paid by employers--particularly small ones. The \n     estimates from this group of studies varied, with one \n     suggesting that between 0.07 percent and 0.33 percent of \n     small firms might begin to offer insurance if premiums were \n     reduced by about 1 percent. Some older studies, using data \n     from 1971 and before, found that between 0.6 percent and 2 \n     percent of firms might stop offering health insurance \n     coverage if premiums increased by 1 percent.\n       The Lewin Group selected a range of estimates, from what it \n     judged to be the best available, to predict that between 0.2 \n     percent and 0.6 percent of firms would stop offering coverage \n     if insurance premiums increased by 1 percent. It then \n     selected the midpoint of this range (0.4 percent) as its best \n     estimate. To calculate the potential impact on coverage, the \n     Lewin Group multiplied 150 million--the number of workers and \n     their dependents covered by employer-sponsored health plans \n     in 1996--by 0.004--the percentage of firms expected to drop \n     coverage.\\14\\ This calculation suggested that 600,000 \n     individuals would lose employer-sponsored health insurance if \n     premiums increased by 1 percent. However, on the basis of its \n     analysis of CPS data, the Lewin Group assumed that about one-\n     third (or 200,000) of these 600,000 workers would obtain \n     insurance either through the policies of working family \n     members, the individual insurance market, or public insurance \n     programs.\\15\\ Consequently, it estimated that a 1-percent \n     premium increase might result in a drop in coverage of about \n     400,000 individuals.\n       The Lewin Group's estimated potential coverage loss does \n     not consider the possibility that employers or employees \n     might switch to different types of insurance products if one \n     type becomes relatively more expensive. This is important in \n     the current context because many of the proposed federal \n     mandates are expected primarily to affect HMOs and have \n     little or no impact on PPOs and indemnity plans. The Barents \n     Group, a private research and consulting organization, \n     recently reported on the potential coverage loss that \n     proposed mandates could cause.\\16\\ The Barents Group used the \n     Lewin coverage loss estimate but reduced it by 25 percent to \n     allow for the possibility that some employees might switch \n     from HMOs to other types of insurance plans instead of \n     dropping coverage altogether.\n\n\n     current Lewin Group coverage loss estimate lower by 25 percent\n\n       Recent data analysis by the Lewin Group led it to revise \n     its estimate of potential coverage loss. The Lewin Group now \n     projects a loss of employer-sponsored coverage of \n     approximately 300,000 people for every one percent increase \n     in premiums. This estimate, reported in January 1998, is \n     approximately 25 percent lower than its November 1997 \n     estimate. The new estimate is based on the Lewin Group's \n     statistical analysis of the relationship between what \n     employees pay for insurance and the probability that they, \n     their spouses, and their dependent children have employer-\n     sponsored health insurance.\\17\\\n       A key variable in the January 1998 Lewin Group study is the \n     price of insurance, but because of data limitations, this was \n     measured imperfectly. The study primarily used CPS data from \n     1989 to 1996. CPS data, however, do not contain information \n     on health insurance premium amounts. Lewin, therefore, used \n     three data sources to impute the amount employees paid for \n     insurance:\\18\\ the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Surveys \n     (NMES), the KPMG Peat Merwick employer surveys for 1991 \n     through 1996, and the Health Insurance Association of America \n     (HIAA) employer surveys for 1988 through 1990. The authors of \n     the Lewis report acknowledged that these surveys were not \n     strictly comparable, and that the information used to measure \n     the employee share of health insurance may have been \n     different for 1988 through 1990 than for 1991 throgh 1996. \n     Another potential shortcoming related to premium amounts is \n     that the analysis did not allow for the possibility that some \n     workers may decline coverage from their own employers when \n     they can obtain it through a family members' employer-based \n     coverage.\n       The Lewin Group's estimate is of the coverage decline that \n     would result from an overall average premium increase of 1 \n     percent. Yet, the proposed federal mandates are expected \n     primarily to affect HMOs. If HMOs' premiums rise by \n     1 percent, then premiums for other types of insurance \n     would probably not increase as much. HMO enrollees, \n     therefore, would be affected most by the premium \n     increases. Under these circumstances, the\n\n[[Page S7437]]\n\n     Lewin Group's estimate could overstate the coverage \n     decline.\n       The Lewin Group explicitly assumed that all observed \n     coverage changes were due to employees' decisions.\\19\\ \n     Consequently, it used the imputed employee contribution as \n     the relevant cost of insurance. This assumption is broadly \n     supported by the recent literature. However, if some \n     employees lost access to insurance because of their \n     employers' decisions to no longer offer it, the Lewin Group's \n     estimate may incorrectly predict employees' reactions to \n     changes in premiums.\n\n\n       potential coverage loss uncertain, depends on many factors\n\n       Insufficient information is currently available to predict \n     accurately the coverage loss that may result from health \n     insurance premium increases associated with new federal \n     mandates. One problem is that the potential cost of the \n     mandates and their impact on premiums is not yet known. \n     However, even if the premium increase was known with \n     certainty, previous research and economic theory suggest that \n     the impact on coverage depends on a number of conditions. \n     Coverage changes will depend on the extent to which premiums \n     rise for employees and whether they can switch to insurance \n     plans less affected by the mandates. The specific policy \n     adopted also can affect how employees respond to resulting \n     premium increases. Finally, changes in many economic and \n     other factors can cause coverage changes that mask or \n     exaggerate the impact of premium increases. The following \n     list describes several conditions that could affect observed \n     changes in health insurance coverage if new federal mandates \n     increase insurance costs.\n       1. The percentage of premiums paid by employees and the \n     amount of any premium increase the employers pass on to \n     employees. If, as recent evidence suggests, employees' \n     decisions largely affect the extent of coverage, then the \n     relevant price increase is the percentage increase in their \n     contribution. For example, about two-thirds of employees in \n     small firms had to contribute toward premium costs in 1996. \n     Those employees paid about 50 percent of the total premium. \n     If total premiums rise by 1 percent and employers pass on the \n     full increase to employees, then the employees' contribution \n     would rise by 2 percent.\n       2. The extent to which additional benefits are valued by \n     consumers. If higher insurance premiums are the result of \n     additional benefits that consumers value, then any coverage \n     loss will be less than the coverage loss that might occur if \n     premiums increased but benefits stayed the same (or the \n     additional benefits had little consumer value). In its \n     November 1997 letter, the Lewin Group notes that its \n     ``estimates of the number of persons losing coverage will \n     differ depending upon the health policy being analyzed.'' The \n     Lewin Group goes on to suggest that ``some proposals that \n     increase premium costs are often associated with other \n     provisions that may either lessen or intensify incentives for \n     individuals to drop coverage.''\n       3. The extent to which some types of plans have no or low \n     premium increases and employees can switch to them. Proposed \n     new federal mandates are expected primarily to increase costs \n     of HMOs. Faced with a rise in HMO premiums, some employees \n     may switch to PPOs or indemnity insurance rather than drop \n     coverage entirely. The Barents Group assumed this switching \n     behavior might lower the Lewin Group's coverage loss estimate \n     by 25 percent.\n       4. Changes in other insurance benefits. Instead of raising \n     premiums in response to new mandated benefits, insurance \n     companies and employers may find ways to reduce other parts \n     of the insurance package to keep premiums constant. It is \n     unknown how employees might respond to such changes in their \n     insurance plans.\n       5. Changes in real wages and other factors. Changes in \n     economic conditions or eligibility for public insurance \n     programs can also affect private insurance coverage. For \n     example, the Lewin Group estimated that a 1-percent rise in \n     real incomes could increase private insurance coverage by \n     nearly 0.37 percent (about 550,000 workers and dependents). \n     Likewise, expansions in Medicaid eligibility could cause some \n     workers to substitute public insurance for employer-sponsored \n     family coverage.\n\n\n                     comments from the lewin group\n\n       In commenting on a draft of this correspondence, a \n     representative of the Lewin Group said that we had accurately \n     characterized its analysis and findings. The representative \n     suggested one technical clarification in our report's \n     characterization of the Lewin Group study that we adopted.\n       As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce \n     its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution until \n     30 days from the date of this letter.

It is this lower \nnumber that I used.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take a moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with regard to just one fact that the \nSenator has mentioned, I have the GAO report to which the Senator \nrefers. The fact that the Senator refers and is talking about is on \npage 4 of the report. It says:\n\n       If premiums increase by 1 percent only for some insurance \n     types (for example, HMOs), then the coverage loss predicted \n     by the Lewin Group to . . .\n\n  Not the GAO, it is the Lewin Group that makes the estimate referred \nto in the GAO letter.\n  To the contrary, if you read on, GAO says:\n\n       Because many factors can affect the number of individuals \n     covered by private insurance, it is difficult to predict the \n     impact of an increase in insurance premiums. For example, new \n     mandates may increase premiums but may also change \n     individuals' willingness to purchase insurance.\n\n  Therefore, there might be more people covered.\n  This is the kind of thing we ought to be debating out here. This is \njust the type of thing we ought to be debating. We have a lot of \ndistortions and misrepresentations. The insurance companies themselves \nhave spent $100 million\n\n[[Page S7438]]\n\nin distorting our proposal. What we want to do is to try to clarify the \nRecord on this.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could just mention one other point, the Senator \ntalked about what we wanted to do last year with regard to the \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  I have in my hand the majority leader's unanimous consent request. \nHere it is. This is an offer from last June 18, a little over a year \nago, when we were trying to bring this legislation up.\n\n       I ask unanimous consent that prior to the August recess . . \n     .\n\n  Isn't that interesting? June of last year; they are saying ``prior to \nthe August recess.''\n\n       . . . the majority leader after notifying the minority \n     leader shall turn to the consideration of the bill to be \n     introduced by the majority leader . . .\n\n  It doesn't tell us what that is going to be.\n\n       . . . or his designee regarding health care. I further ask \n     that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n\n  And following the report by the clerk that Senator Daschle be \nrecognized to offer as a substitute the text of S. 1891, which really \nwasn't the all-inclusive legislation, the majority leader is trying to \ntell the Democratic leader which bill he ought to put in.\n\n       I further ask that during the consideration of the health \n     care legislation it be in order for Members to offer health \n     care amendments in the first and second degree. I further ask \n     consent that the Chair not enter a motion to adjourn or \n     recess for the August recess prior to a vote or in relation \n     to the majority leader's bill and the minority leader's \n     amendment, and following those votes it be in order for the \n     majority leader return to the legislation to the calendar.\n\n  To the calendar--not send it over to the House of Representatives--to \nthe calendar.\n  Let's be clear about who is serious about bringing this up. Here is \ntheir consent request. They are going to return it to the calendar. \nEven if we win the vote, under their proposal, that could be the end of \nit.\n  Then it says:\n\n       Finally, I ask consent that it not be in order to offer any \n     legislation, motion, or amendment relative to health care \n     prior to the initiation of this agreement and following the \n     execution of the agreement.\n\n  Therefore, you can't offer a health care measure for the rest of the \nCongress.\n  If the Senator from Vermont can say with a straight face that it is \nthe Democrats who are trying to lock this thing up when the Senator has \nhis own leader making a proposal like this, he is defying any kind of \nrational understanding of what a unanimous consent rule is.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am going to ask a very brief question. Is it not true \nthat at 5:45--in 45 minutes--there will be a motion by the Republicans \nto table the Democratic version of the Patients' Bill of Rights without \nfurther debate, without further amendment, and to bring to an end this \ndebate about whether families across America will have the stronger \nvoice in terms of their health insurance protection?\n  I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, who has been here for a few \nmonths, to respond, if he will. Why is it that the Republican majority \nis so concerned about or afraid of the idea of actually debating or \ndeliberating something which is so important to American families, \ntheir health care?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We will have to listen to the explanation coming from \nthe other side. We know what the spokesman for the health insurance \nindustry has said. We know what their answer has been, and that is to \nvirtually instruct the Republican leadership just to say no. We know \nwhat the leadership on the other side has said about this: We are not \ngoing to get a chance to debate this issue.\n\n  People can draw their own conclusions. They have indicated this will \nnot be permitted to come up, even though it is the people's business.\n  I see the Senator from Rhode Island on the floor. I yield 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, as I look at the Republican proposals, they \nare deficient in many ways. Of particular concern to me is the way this \nproposal mistreats children.\n  The Democratic proposal, the proposal we would like to not only \ndebate but also to vote on, emphasizes the need to protect the children \nof America. I hope we all can agree that at the end of this Congress at \nleast we can provide adequate protections in managed care for children.\n  Don't just take my word for it. Take the word of organizations \nincluding the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association \nof Children's Residential Centers, the American Academy of Child and \nAdolescent Psychiatry, the Children's Defense Fund, the Child Welfare \nLeague of America. All of these organizations support unequivocally the \nDemocratic Patients' Bill of Rights. This is the legislation we know \nand they know will protect the children of America.\n  There are three key points that are terribly important with respect \nto the differences between the Republican proposal and the Democratic \nproposal.\n  First, our legislation will assure access to pediatric specialists. \nIn the world of medicine today, it is not just sufficient to visit an \noncologist if you have cancer and you are a child, because pediatric \noncology is a particular specialty that is necessary for children who \nhave serious cancers.\n  Second, our legislation provides clearly expedited review procedures \nif child development is threatened--not just their life but their \ndevelopment. This is a critical issue that is virtually unique to \nchildren. This is something we have to protect and ensure.\n  Third, we also have provisions within our legislation that will \nmeasure outcomes in terms of children, so that when parents are trying \nto determine what plan is best for their child, they can actually look \nat measured results: How well this particular plan did--not with a \nlarge population of adults, but particularly with respect to children.\n  The Republican plan has some fuzzy language regarding pediatricians \nand specialists.\n  Clearly and unequivocally, there is language in the Democratic \nlegislation that guarantees children access to providers who are \ntrained to take care of them, access to pediatric specialists, \nexpedited review procedures in the case of developmental difficulties \nfor children, and also outcome measures that actually take children \ninto consideration. These are critical issues that have to be included \nin any managed care legislation we pass on the floor of the Senate.\n  What did the American people think about that? I have listed August \norganizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics in support of \nthis measure. Let me tell Members what the American people think.\n  In February of 1999, a survey by Lake Sosin Snell Perry and \nAssociates and the Tarrance Group--one a Democratic polling firm, the \nother a Republican polling firm--revealed 86 percent of voters surveyed \nfavored having Congress require health plans to provide children with \naccess to pediatric specialists and hospitals that specialize in \ntreating children.\n  That is an overwhelming example of what the American people are \nasking: Protect their children, and give them access to pediatric \nspecialists. Let them choose, as mothers and fathers, pediatricians to \nbe primary care providers for their sons and daughters.\n  Not only do the American people demand these provisions, they will \nalso pay for them. Seventy-six percent of the voters surveyed said they \nwould pay for these protections, ``even if it increased health \ninsurance costs for families with children by $100 a year.''\n  They want these protections. Only the Democratic version gives them \nthese protections.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield myself a couple of minutes, and then I will \nyield to my colleague from Maine.\n  Our colleague from Massachusetts said there was a unanimous consent \nrequest last year; we were talking about doing this last June and July. \nThat is correct. We offered several unanimous consent requests, from \nJune 18, July 15, and July 25, to bring this bill up to allow both \nsides to have a chance to vote on their proposals. We offered a number \nof amendments before the August break. Those were not agreed upon.\n  Everyone has had a chance to offer their bill and to have it voted \non. We\n\n[[Page S7439]]\n\nwould have a package, we would have a bill, before the Senate that \npossibly could pass. That was not agreed upon last year. I don't know \nif it will be agreed upon this year. I told the Democratic sponsors we \nare willing to come to some time agreement, some limit on amendments, \nbut we are not just going to have the bill on the floor for an \nunlimited number of amendments with unlimited debate.\n  Somebody asked, Why haven't we done this?\n  The Kennedy bill increased health care costs a lot. It is estimated \nthat health care costs will increase 4.8 percent in addition to \nwhatever health care increases are already scheduled. Increases are \nscheduled to be 7 to 9 percent. Take the average of that, 8 percent, \nand add 4.8 percent. That is a 13-percent increase in health care \ncosts. That will increase the number of uninsured by at least 1.5 \nmillion.\n  I am going to work energetically to see we don't pass any bill that \nincreases people's health care costs by 13 percent in 1 year. \nCertainly, I will work energetically to see we don't pass a health care \nbill that increases the number of uninsured by 1.5 million. That would \nbe a serious mistake.\n  Whatever the Senate does, it should do no harm. If we increase health \ncare costs in double digits and increase the number of uninsured by \nover a million, we have done a lot of harm. Some Members will not do \nthat.\n  We should make some needed reforms. One of my colleagues worked \nenergetically to put together a good package that makes needed reforms.\n  I yield 7 minutes to our colleague from Maine, Senator Collins.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, there is growing unease across this \nNation about the changes in how we receive our health care, which has \nprompted the current debate on managed care. People worry, if they or \ntheir loved ones become ill, that their HMO may deny them coverage and \nforce them to accept either inadequate care or financial ruin--or \nperhaps even both. They believe vital decisions affecting their lives \nwill be made not by a supportive family doctor but by an unfeeling \nbureaucracy.\n  All Members agree that medically necessary patient care should never \nbe sacrificed to the bottom line and that health care decisions should \nbe in the hands of medical professionals, not in the hands of insurance \naccountants.\n  We do, however, face an extremely delicate balancing act as we \nattempt to respond to concerns without resorting to unduly burdensome \nFederal controls and mandates that will further drive up the costs of \nhealth insurance and cause some people to lose their coverage \naltogether. That is the crux of this entire debate.\n  I am very alarmed by recent reports that American employers \neverywhere, from giant multinational corporations to the small corner \nstore, are facing huge hikes in their medical insurance coverage for \ntheir employees, averaging over 8 percent, and sometimes soaring to 20 \npercent or more. This is a remarkable contrast to the past few years \nwhen premiums rose less than 3 percent, if at all.\n\n  We know for a fact that increasing health insurance premiums cause \nsignificant losses in coverage. That is the primary reason why I am so \nopposed to the approach offered by the Senator from Massachusetts. Even \nif we discard CBO's previous estimate that the Kennedy bill would \nincrease premiums by 6.1 percent and accept the newly revised estimate \nof 4.8 percent, the fact is the CBO score for the Democratic bill is \nsix times higher than the cost for the bill we are proposing.\n  Moreover, the Lewin Associates, in a study for the AFL-CIO, has \nestimated that for every 1-percent increase in premiums, we are \njeopardizing the insurance coverage of as many as 300,000 Americans. \nBased on these projections, the passage of the Kennedy legislation \ncould result in the loss of coverage for more than 1.4 million \nAmericans. That is more than the population of the entire State of \nMaine. This is a significant cost.\n  If you look at the CBO estimate of the revised Kennedy bill, CBO \nestimates it will impose additional costs to the private sector of \nnearly $41 billion over the next 5 years. That is a cost that is going \nto cause employers to drop insurance altogether or employees to be \nunable to pay their share of the premium. At a time when the number of \nuninsured Americans, unfortunately, is increasing with every year, we \nshould be acting to decrease the number of uninsured Americans, not \nimpose costly new burdens that are going to cause some of the most \nvulnerable working Americans to lose their coverage altogether.\n  Our approach, on the other hand, provides the key protections that \nconsumers need and want without causing costs to soar. It applies these \nprotections responsibly, where they are needed. Our legislation does \nnot preempt, but rather builds upon the good work the States have done \nin the area of patients' rights and protections. States have had the \nprimary responsibility for the regulation of health insurance since the \n1940s. As someone who has worked in State government for 5 years \noverseeing a Bureau of Insurance, I know State regulators and State \nlegislators have done an excellent job of responding to the needs and \nconcerns of their citizens.\n  Let me give you just a few examples. Mr. President, 47 States have \nalready passed laws prohibiting gag clauses that restrict \ncommunications between patients and their doctors; 40 States have \nrequirements for emergency care; all 50 States have requirements for \ngrievance procedures; 36 require direct access to an obstetrician or a \ngynecologist.\n  The States have acted, without any prod or mandate from Washington, \nto protect health care consumers. That is why the National Association \nof Insurance Commissioners supports the approach we have taken in our \nbill.\n  In a March letter to the chairman of the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, the NAIC pointed out:\n\n       It is our belief that states should and will continue the \n     efforts to develop creative, flexible, market-sensitive \n     protections for health consumers in fully insured plans, and \n     Congress should focus attention on those consumers who have \n     no protections in self-funded ERISA plans.\n\n  That is exactly the approach we have taken. Currently, Federal law \nprohibits States from regulating the self-funded, employer-sponsored \nhealth plans that cover 48 million Americans. Our legislation is \nintended to protect the unprotected. We would extend many of the same \nrights and protections to these consumers and their families that those \nin State-regulated plans already enjoy.\n  For the first time they will be guaranteed the right to talk freely \nand openly with their doctors about their treatment options. We would \nban the gag clauses. They will be guaranteed coverage for emergency \nroom care that a ``prudent layperson'' would deem medically necessary \nwithout prior authorization. They will be able to see a pediatrician or \nan OB/GYN without a referral from their plan's ``gatekeeper.'' They \nwill have the option of seeing a doctor who is not part of the HMO's \nnetwork. They will be guaranteed access to nonformulary drugs when it \nis medically necessary. They will have an assurance of continuity of \ncare if their health plan terminates its contract with their doctor or \nhospital.\n  The opponents of our legislation contend that the Federal Government \nshould simply preempt the States' patient protection laws unless they \nare virtually identical to what the Federal Government would require. \nBut the States' approaches to these patient protections vary widely. \nFor example, States may have emergency requirements, but not exactly \nthe same standard that the Democrats in Senator Kennedy's bill would \nimpose on everyone. States that have already acted in this area would \nhave to make extensive changes to their laws, if they are forced to \ncomply with the one-size-fits-all model.\n  Moreover, what if the State has made an affirmative decision not to \nact in one of these areas? What if the bill failed in the legislature \nor was vetoed by the Governor? Let me give you a recent example from my \nState. Maine law requires plans to allow direct access to ob/gyn care--\nwithout a referral from the primary care physician--but only for an \nannual visit. Maine also requires plans to allow ob/gyns to serve as \nthe primary care provider. Our State Legislature recently decided that \nthe current provisions provide sufficient protection and rejected a \nbill that would have expanded the direct access\n\n[[Page S7440]]\n\nprovision, primarily out of concern that it would drive up premium \ncosts. I would note that this decision was made by a legislature \ncontrolled by the Democratic Party. In cases like these, the Kennedy \nproposal for a one-size-fits-all model would be a clear pre-emption of \nState authority.\n  Other provisions of our bill provide new protections for millions \nmore Americans. A key provision of our bill builds upon the existing \nregulatory framework under ERISA to give all 124 million Americans in \nemployer-sponsored plans assurance that they will get the care that \nthey need when they need it. The legislation will enhance current ERISA \ninformation disclosure requirements and penalties and strengthen \nexisting requirements for coverage determinations, grievances and \nappeals, including the addition of a new requirement for independent, \nexternal review.\n  All 124 million Americans in employer-sponsored plans will be \nentitled to clear and complete information about their health plan--\nabout what it covers and does not cover, about any cost-sharing \nrequirements, and about the plan's providers. Helping patients \nunderstand their coverage before they need to use it will help to avoid \ncoverage disputes later.\n  The goal of any patients' rights legislation should be to resolve \ndisputes about coverage up front, when the care is needed, not months \nor even years later in a court room.\n  Our bill would accomplish this goal by creating a strong internal and \nan independent external review process. First, patients or doctors who \nare unhappy with an HMO's decision could appeal it internally through a \nreview conducted by individuals with ``appropriate expertise'' who were \nnot involved in the initial decision. Moreover, this review would have \nto be conducted by a physician if the denial is based on a \ndetermination that the service is not medically necessary or is an \nexperimental treatment. Patients could expect results from this review \nwithin 30 days, or 72 hours in cases when delay poses a serious risk to \nthe patient's life or health.\n  Patients turned down by this internal review would then have the \nright to a free, external review by medical experts who are completely \nindependent of the health plan. This review must be completed within 30 \ndays--and even faster in a medical emergency or when the delay would be \ndetrimental to the patient's health. Moreover, the decision of these \noutside reviewers is binding on the health plan, but not on the \npatient. If the patient is not satisfied, he or she retains the right \nto sue in federal or state court for attorneys' fees, court costs, the \nvalue of the benefit and injunctive relief.\n\n  Our bill places treatment decisions in the hands of doctors, not \nlawyers. If your HMO denies you treatment that your doctor believes is \nmedically necessary, you should not have to resort to a costly and \nlengthy court battle to get the care you need. You should not have to \nhire a lawyer and file an expensive lawsuit to get the treatment.\n  Our approach contrasts with the approach taken in the measure offered \nby Senators Daschle and Kennedy that would encourage patients to sue \nhealth plans. I do not support Senator Kennedy's approach. You just \ncan't sue your way to quality health care.\n  We would solve problems up front, when the care is needed, not months \nor even years later after the harm has occurred. According to the GAO, \nit takes an average of 33 months to resolve malpractice cases. This \ndoes nothing to ensure a patient's right to timely and appropriate \ncare. Moreover, patients only receive 43 cents out of every dollar \nawarded in malpractice cases. The rest winds up in the pockets of trial \nlawyers and administrators of the court and insurance systems.\n  I met with a group of Maine employers who expressed their serious \nconcerns about the Kennedy proposal to expand liability for health \nplans and employers. The Assistant Director for Human Resources at \nBowdoin College talked about how moving to a self-funded, ERISA plan \nenabled them to continue to offer affordable coverage to Bowdoin \nemployees when premiums for their fully-insured plan skyrocketed in the \nlate 1980s. Since they self-funded, they have actually been able to \nlower premiums for their employees, while, at the same time, enhance \ntheir benefit package with such features as well-baby care, free annual \nphysicals, and prescription drug cards with low copayments. They told \nme that the Democrats' proposal to expand liability seriously \njeopardizes their ability to offer affordable coverage for their \nemployees. Similar concerns were expressed by the Maine Municipal \nAssociation, L.L. Bean, Bath Iron Works, and other responsible Maine \nemployers.\n  And finally, our amendment will make health insurance more affordable \nby allowing self-employed individuals to deduct the full amount of \ntheir health care premiums. Establishing parity in the tax treatment of \nhealth insurance costs between the self-employed and those working for \nlarge businesses is a matter of basic equity, and it will also help to \nreduce the number of uninsured, but working, Americans. It will make \nhealth insurance more affordable for the 82,000 people in Maine who are \nself-employed. They include our lobstermen, our hairdressers, our \nelectricians, our plumbers, and the many owners of mom-and-pop stores \nthat dot communities throughout my state.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this amendments strikes the right \nbalance as we effectively address concerns about quality and choice \nwithout resorting to unduly burdensome federal controls and mandates \nthat will further drive up costs and cause some Americans to lose their \nhealth insurance altogether, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me \nin supporting it.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains to both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 19 minutes and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts has 9.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield my colleague from Tennessee 8 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, there has been a lot of misinformation and \nI am sure a lot of confusion on the part of many because of allegations \nthat have gone back and forth because of the rhetoric, so I think I \nwill use my few minutes to outline what is in the Patients' Bill of \nRights Plus Act; that is, the Republican leadership bill we have been \ndiscussing for the last several days.\n  I am very proud of the bill we have put forward. I am proud of it as \na physician, as a member of the task force that helped put this bill \ntogether, and as a Senator, because I believe with passage of this bill \nwe can do what I think everybody in the body wants to do, and that is \nto improve the quality of care for individuals across this country, \ntheir children, and on into the next generation.\n  The bill we put forward has really six major components with three \nobjectives. The three objectives are to enhance health care quality, to \nenhance access, and to provide consumer protections. We do that through \nsix components.\n  First, as the Senator from Maine has just gone through, strong \nconsumer protection standards. The second way of achieving that is that \nwe offer good, comparative information among plans, at a time when it \nis very confusing to the beneficiary, to the individual patient, what \nplan offers what, and what benefits are covered.\n  Third--and I am proud of this--we have a strong internal, and even \nmore important, I believe, external appeals process establishing these \nrights for 124 million people. We are talking about scope in a lot of \nthese discussions, but let's remember this applies to 124 million \nAmericans who are covered both by the self-insured and fully insured \ngroup health plans.\n  Fourth, we have in our bill a ban on the use of genetic information \nby insurance companies for underwriting purposes. It is very important, \nas we look at the human genome project, which is producing 2 billion \nbits of information, all of which can be to the benefit of mankind if \nit is used appropriately.\n  Fifth, we have a quality focus in our bill which is lacking in other \nbills and other proposals. We have expanded quality research activities \nthrough the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. We address \nissues of access. This is in contrast to the bill on the other side, \nbecause we have a major problem in this country today of about 41 \nmillion people who are uninsured. You are not going to find this \nSenator voting for a bill that drives people to the ranks of the \nuninsured and expands that 41 million to 42 million.\n\n[[Page S7441]]\n\n  As my colleague from Maine just pointed out, every 1-percent increase \nin premiums drives about 300,000 people to the ranks of the uninsured. \nI doubt one will find very many Senators on our side in favor of \nincreasing that number of uninsured.\n  We addressed the issue of access through two means: No. 1 is medical \nsavings accounts expansion, and No. 2 is to have availability of a full \ndeduction for health insurance benefits for the self-employed.\n  As the Senator from Maine pointed out, States already regulate \ninsured health plans. Thus, our bill addresses the unprotected with the \nprotections. We do it through emergency care. A prudent layperson, \nsomebody in a restaurant has some chest pain--is it indigestion or a \nheart attack? You go to the emergency room and are reimbursed, because \na prudent layperson standard is used and, therefore, that service is \ncovered.\n  Choice of plans: In our bill, we make sure those plans that offer \nnetwork-only plans are required to offer what is called point-of-\nservice options.\n  Consumer protections: Obstetricians, gynecologists, pediatricians--we \nhave heard these words used a lot. Who are these physicians? Do you \nhave access? Under our bill, health plans would be required to allow \ndirect access to obstetricians, to gynecologists, and to pediatricians \nfor routine care without referrals, without gatekeepers.\n  Continuity of care: Under our bill, plans that terminate or nonrenew \ndoctors or providers from their networks would allow continued use of \nthe provider for up to 90 days or, if someone is pregnant, up through \nthe postpartum period.\n  Access to medication: We all know that formularies are used \nincreasingly by people broadly because of the cost of prescription \ndrugs. In our plan, we make sure physicians and providers and people \nwith clinical experience are on those boards that put together these \nformularies. In our bill, we make sure that nonformulary alternatives \nare available when medically necessary and when appropriate. \nPhysicians, pharmacists, not just bureaucrats, will be putting these \nformularies together.\n  Access to specialists: I am a heart and lung transplant surgeon. I \nhave had the opportunity to transplant hundreds of hearts and lungs and \ndo hundreds of heart operations, and I know the importance of access to \na specialist. Under our bill, health plans would be required to ensure \nthat patients have access to covered speciality care within the network \nor, if necessary, provide that access through contractual relationships \nif heart surgeon Bill Frist happens not to be inside that network.\n  Gag rules: We all know that physicians should not have gags placed on \nthem when they talk to patients. We have a strong gag rule prohibition \nin our bill. No more gag rules.\n  A second approach is that we require comparative information be given \nto individuals so they can compare one plan to another so they will \nknow what services are covered and what services are not.\n  I mentioned grievance and appeals. All group health plans would be \nrequired to have written grievance procedures and have both an internal \nappeals process as well as an external appeals process if there is some \ndisagreement as to what is covered and what is not covered.\n  Timeframes--we address it in our bill. Expedited requests for care, \nif there is any question of jeopardizing the patient's health, is \nallowed.\n\n  Qualification of reviewers: This is a significant improvement in our \nbill compared to last year. We make absolutely sure that an \nappropriately qualified external reviewer; that is, a provider who has \nexpertise in the field where there is some question. If it is a \nquestion about heart surgery, you have a heart surgeon, somebody \nfamiliar to heart surgery as the reviewer. The external appeals process \nis, I believe, greatly strengthened by having this independent--and \nthose are the words we use--``external medical reviewer where \nnecessary.''\n  We allow in those cases where a treatment is considered experimental \nthat that also can be handled in this external review process. We \nrequire that external reviewer to have ``relevant expertise.''\n  My time is just about out. There are three other issues.\n  Genetic information: Our bill recognizes that ``predictive genetic \ninformation'' can be used against you by an insurance company, either \nraising premiums or denying coverage. We prohibit it.\n  Our bill focuses on quality improvement by taking the Agency for \nHealth Care Research and Quality and focusing on health service \ndelivery and training scientists, providing information systems to \nimprove quality, and, lastly, our bill invests in the infrastructure \nnecessary to measure quality.\n  Medical savings accounts and full health insurance deduction for the \nself-employed are a part of our bill.\n  That is our bill in a nutshell. It looks at consumer standards. It \nlooks at improved quality, it looks at improved access. It is a bill of \nwhich I am proud. It is a bill I know all of us can support. It is a \nbill that will improve health care in the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have been yielded 4 minutes by the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts not only for yielding but for his leadership over many \nyears on this issue. Let me make a couple of points.\n  First of all, the Senator from Tennessee has outlined his bill, and \nit is a different approach. I ask Americans to ask: Why do all of the \nleading doctors' groups, including the American Medical Association, \nwhy do the leading consumer groups up and down the line, support our \napproach? If the bill on the other side is so good for consumers and so \ngood for physicians and providers, then why are they all supporting \nthis bill? And if, as the Senator from Tennessee believes, all of these \nare worthy goals--specialists, appeals processes, et cetera--then why \nnot go all the way? Why not do it right? Why not do it in a way that \nthe AMA and all the consumer groups and all of those that both sides \nare talking about protecting choose? The bill they choose is our bill.\n  Second, on cost, because I know the Senator from Maine mentioned \ncost, the most recent estimates by CBO said that the Daschle-Kennedy \nbill, at the end of 5 years, would cost $2 extra a month a person. Ask \nAmericans: Would they pay that to have access to specialists, to have \nemergency room treatment, to have the kinds of things we have been \ntalking about? You bet. They would pay it in a New York minute. So if \ncost is the concern, it is not much, and you get a lot. If helping \nproviders and consumers is the concern, our bill prevails.\n  What we are going to do tonight is table any proposal. That is not \nadequate, nor is it even adequate, at least from my point of view as a \nfreshman Senator, to try to deal with this issue and just push it away. \nWe believe passionately that patients need help, that consumers need \nhelp, that physicians and nurses and hospitals need help.\n  We believe the HMOs have swung too far in their ability to police the \nbasic patient-doctor relationship. We do not think that a quick ``let's \nget rid of this, let's have a quick vote and say it is over'' serves \nthe American people.\n  What we will be doing on this side is continuing to fight until we \ncan get a full and open debate. I want to debate the Senator from \nTennessee on whether the Daschle bill or his bill really gives access \nto specialists. I want to debate the Senator from Tennessee on whether \nthe appeals process in our bill or in his bill is the most open.\n  I want to debate the Senator from Tennessee on every one of the \nissues that has been mentioned. The process that we are going through \nnow does not allow that debate. I do not know where it will come out. \nMy guess is it may come out similar to the last debate we had where a \nnumber of people, in a bipartisan way, come together for a stronger \nbill. But that may not happen.\n  But at the very least, in conclusion, we should have a full and open \ndebate. And a motion to table and a vote on one bill and then the other \nto get rid of this is not fair to the American people.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n\n[[Page S7442]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes for the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. On the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 46 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator from Pennsylvania 5 minutes.\n  Ms. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for yielding me time. I \ncongratulate him and the entire working group on the Republican side of \nthe aisle--Senators Jeffords, Collins, Frist, and Gramm for putting \ntogether what I believe is a bill that this Senate should embrace. I \nthink America, if they were given the choice between what is being \noffered on the Democratic side and what is being offered on the \nRepublican side, would quickly embrace this plan for many reasons.\n  No. 1, it is a much more comprehensive plan. This is the Patients' \nBill of Rights Plus. It is not just some consumer protection measures \nwhich Democrats have put forward--and we have, to some degree, done the \nsame--but it goes much farther. By looking at the health care picture \nin America, on a comprehensive basis, we took a step back and said, \nwhat can we do to improve quality, to improve access, to reduce costs--\nnot responding to hot button poll issues?\n  It seems to be the popular move around here--when something polls \nwell, we rush out here and try, with legislative fixes, to pass \nsomething that sounds good to the American public.\n  We did not take that approach. We took the approach of how, from a \npublic policy point of view, we are going to solve real problems in \nAmerica--not real problems that maybe poll well but real problems that \nsolve structural problems, structural problems in the health care \nsystem, which will end up benefiting millions of people.\n\n  One such area is that of access. Much has been talked about in \nrelation to patients' rights. We have not heard a lot of talk on the \nother side about access to insurance. There are a couple of components \nto that.\n  No. 1, keep the costs down. We have heard a lot of talk about how the \nother bill, the Kennedy bill, dramatically increases costs. Our bill \ndoes not do that. So in that respect, we already, by virtue of not \ndriving up health care costs, improve access. But we do more than that.\n  We do two specific things in the tax portion of this bill. First, we \nincrease the deductibility of insurance for the self-employed up to 100 \npercent. So we put them on an even playing field with those who have \nemployer-provided health care. We give 100 percent deductibility, \nthereby increasing the desirability of owning health care insurance, of \nbuying that insurance for yourself as a self-employed individual, \nthereby getting more people into the health care system, which is \nsomething everybody believes is necessary and desirable.\n  Second, we provide for medical savings accounts. Medical savings \naccounts have gotten, from a public policy perspective, a little bit of \na bad rap based on what was passed here a few years ago. What was \npassed here a few years ago was a program that was designed to fail. \nThose who designed it got exactly what was predicted--failure.\n  It is a program that is very limited. Very few taxpayers can \nparticipate in it. It is time limited. It does not allow you to carry \ncontributions from year to year. It is a program that has very little \nin the way of a design that would be attractive. In fact, what would \nattract people to MSAs is the ability to control their own health care \ncosts, which is the ability to profit personally--instead of the \ninsurance companies managing your health care, doing things that keep \nyou healthy. Those are some of the attractions of MSAs that are the \ncontrol element, all of which are forfeited under the existing MSA \nproposal.\n  The bill that we are offering removes all these restrictions--\nartificial--to dampen the enthusiasm for the program, to make it less \nattractive and less workable, and allows a full-blown medical savings \naccount proposal to go forward and to put it into the mix of health \ncare delivery options, insurance options, again, creating more choices, \ncreating, in this case, a high deductible insurance option that is very \nattractive to people who we have a very difficult time bringing into \nthe insurance system but are very important to get in there, and those \nare younger workers, in particular.\n  We have a very difficult time convincing younger uninsured people \nthat it is maybe worthwhile to go out and buy insurance coverage. Most \nyoung people think they are infallible, that they cannot be hurt, that \nthey do not need insurance. What we do is create a savings component to \nhealth insurance which is a very attractive thing, particularly for \nyounger people and yet, at the same time, very useful for everyone--\nonce people understand how the dynamics of medical savings accounts \nwork.\n  So it has the dual components of attracting those very desirable \npeople into the insurance pool--younger workers who have, in fact, less \nhealth care costs--and at the same time provides the kinds of choices \nand quality and the proper incentives to the rest of the population in \nthe health care system through these medical savings accounts.\n\n  So I am very excited that what we have been able to accomplish in \nthis bill is not just to provide some hot button issues with regard to \nHMOs which poll well--and I understand that----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We have provided a comprehensive approach to health \ncare reform and one that I think we can all be very proud of.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for yielding me time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senate for yielding.\n  You know what this reminds me of? This reminds me of the Senate. \nImagine, both sides of the aisle--Republican and Democrat--on the floor \ndiscussing and debating an issue which counts with American families--\nhealth insurance.\n  Is it going to be there when we need it? Will it be affordable? Can \nwe trust our doctors not to be overruled by insurance company \nbureaucrats?\n  I like this debate. That is why I ran for the Senate. But in 10 \nminutes there will be a vote on a Republican motion to table to end \nthis debate, to stop it, to say that there is going to be no further \ndebate, no future amendments--it is over.\n  I do not think that makes sense. Weren't we sent here to enter into \nthis debate? To face these issues on an up-or-down vote? I am prepared \nto do that.\n  I know that some of the votes on these amendments will not be easy, \nbut I think we have an excellent bill in the Democratic Patients' Bill \nof Rights, a bill that has been endorsed by every major health \norganization, children's advocacy groups, and labor-business across the \nboard.\n  I am prepared to stand and defend this bill, offer amendments that \ngive to families the assurance they are going to get quality health \ncare. But the Republican side does not want this debate. They do not \nwant to vote on these amendments. They called it ``health care-plus.'' \nIt is ``health care-minus.'' Every day they are taking away from \nAmerican families their power to choose a doctor, their power to have \nthe right specialist, their willingness, I guess, to sit down with \ntheir doctor and realize they are getting an honest answer.\n  It is a shame that in 10 minutes this motion to table is going to \ncome before us. This really resembles the Senate--deliberation on an \nissue that counts. I hope the motion to table is defeated. Let's have \nthe real debate on this issue.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to today to ask my colleagues to \nconsider several intriguing questions. What would we do if I told you \nthat Americans were deliberately being denied access to our country's \ngreatest technologies and developments? What if I told you that there \nis a business in this country that is permitted to make any kind of \nbusiness decision they want and potentially adversely effect millions \nof consumers' lives and not be held accountable? What if I told you \nthat Congress has had the answer to these questions and, most \nimportantly, the solutions to these problems but because of a few \npeople and a great deal\n\n[[Page S7443]]\n\nof money from one special interest group, the American people have been \ndenied a substantially better quality of life? Well, unfortunately, all \nthis is true.\n  Over 200 organizations representing doctors, nurses, patients' right \nadvocates, consumer organizations and labor groups and American people \neverywhere have all spoken loud and long: The time is now to pass a \nmeaningful patient's bill of rights. My Democratic colleagues stand \nready, once again, to engage in a discussion with our Republican \ncolleagues so that we can finally put the American people's interest \nbefore health insurance company profits.\n  Over 100 million workers who labor hard and pay health insurance are \nbeing denied critical medical services. We are led to believe by some \nthat the health care system under managed care is working just fine. In \nour own circles of friends and family, we know that this is simply not \ntrue. The numbers are staggering. I have a chart here that will not \nsurprise anyone.\n  In 1998, 115 million Americans either had a problem or knew someone \nwho had a problem with managed care and that number is dramatically on \nthe rise. Let me say that again. At least, 115 million people in this \ncountry are experiencing difficulties obtaining medical services for \nwhich they pay for every month. The issue is clear. Managed health care \nreform is long overdue.\n  First and foremost, we need a managed health care system that is \ninclusive, providing the best health care for everyone that spends \ntheir hard earned dollars on health insurance. The Republican managed \ncare bill leaves out over 100 million Americans: two-thirds of those \nthat have private health insurance. Let me be even more specific using \nmy own State, New Mexico, as a example of what I am referring to.\n  There are approximately 900,000 privately insured patients in the \nState of New Mexico. Without passage of the Democratic Patients' Bill \nof Rights, look at the list of major patient protections that over \n900,000 New Mexicans will not have.\n  Under the Republican bill, almost 700,000 New Mexicans will not have \nsubstantive protections and 350,000 will not be covered at all if the \nRepublicans pass their bill. The Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights \nwill assure that 900,000 New Mexicans will receive all these \nprotections that I have listed on this chart.\n  These numbers represent real people with real health concerns. These \nnumbers represent people who expect Congress to put the health \ninterests of Americans first.\n  Let me address just a few of the basic protections that I believe a \nmanaged care system should provide and that, in fact, the Democratic \nPatient's Bill of Rights includes.\n  We need a managed care health system that does not financially \npenalize health care professionals who try to provide the best care for \ntheir patients. We can no longer permit managed care companies to fire \nproviders who report quality concerns or who speak up on behalf of \ntheir patients and assist their patients when their HMO denies care.\n  We need a managed care health system that does not allow HMO's to \noperate with few providers and long waiting periods for appointments, \nand that force patients to drive long hours to get needed care, even if \nthere are qualified providers nearby. Where you live in our country \nshould not be reason enough to exclude you from the best medical care \navailable. In a state such as New Mexico this is a critical concern.\n  We need a managed care health system that does not prohibit health \nplans from excluding non-physician providers such as nurse \npractitioners, psychologists, and social workers from their networks. \nUnder the Republican bill, patients, especially those in rural and \nother areas without an adequate supply of physicians, could be left out \nin the cold. Once again, in the State of New Mexico these are critical \nconcerns.\n  Simply put, we need a managed health care system that puts patient \nprotections first before insurance company profits.\n  Let me also address one other issue. I have heard concerns from some \nof my Republican colleagues regarding the impact that reforming health \ninsurance might have on small businesses. I too have long been \nconcerned with the effect of federal policy on this part of the \nbusiness sector. New Mexico relies significantly on the innovation and \nhard work of the small businessperson and I have consistently worked to \nprotect their interests. But instead of trying to scare small \nbusinesses with inadequate information that seemingly threatens their \nlivelihoods as some might do, let's take a look at the facts.\n  In a recent study by the Small Business Alliance and the Kaiser \nFamily Foundation, the overwhelming majority of small businesses would \ncontinue to provide health insurance after managed care reform and the \nmajority of these business endorsed key elements of the Democratic \nPatient's Bill of Rights including real independent appeals, access to \nspeciality care, and direct access to OB/GYN services, as well as the \npatient's right to hold insurance companies accountable for their \ndecisions.\n  I began my comments asking several fundamental questions about \nconsumer rights. I would like to conclude by encouraging all of my \ncolleagues to consider the issues which I have raised and I look \nforward to substantive debate on these critical matters that have such \na profound effect on the health of this Nation.\n  We have an opportunity to stand up for American families, protect \nAmerican children and respond to the needs of American workers. I urge \nall of my colleagues to stand together with the overwhelming majority \nof the American people and begin a discussion that will ultimately lead \nto the passage of a meaningful patient's bill of rights for all \nAmericans. The American people have waited long enough.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President. I would like to clarify my position on \nthese procedural votes regarding managed care reform legislation.\n  I think Senators on both sides of the aisle are familiar with my \nposition on the need for managed care reform legislation to ensure that \nhealth care consumers are treated fairly by their HMOs and other \nmanaged care plans.\n  Indeed, I have authored bipartisan legislation--both in this Congress \nand the last--to provide a basic floor of federal protections for all \nprivately insured Americans. And, I am pleased to be joined in that \nendeavor by Senators Bob Graham, Joe Lieberman, Arlen Specter, Max \nBaucus, Chuck Robb and Evan Bayh.\n  Though I will vote not to table the Republican bill, I want to make \nclear, I do not think this bill goes far enough in protecting \nconsumers. Nor am I entirely comfortable with the Democratic bill. Let \nme cite just a few examples.\n  In the Chafee-Graham-Lieberman bill, our patient protections would \nextend to all privately insured Americans--not just to the self-funded \ncomponent of the ERISA population, as is the case with most of the \npatient protections in the Republican bill.\n  A credible enforcement mechanism is also critical to ensuring that \nany patient protections we adopt here in the Senate are taken seriously \nby managed care plans. The Chafee-Graham-Lieberman bill contains a \nstrong enforcement mechanism which would permit injured parties to seek \nredress in federal court. Here the Democratic bill goes too far in \nexposing health plans to state tort liability, while the strengthened \nERISA remedy contained in the Republican bill does not go far enough.\n  Our bipartisan bill also contains very strong internal and external \nappeals provisions to ensure that patients get their appeals heard in \nan expeditious and equitable manner. I am not convinced the Republican \nbill does enough in this area.\n  Regardless of our legitimate differences, I am not in favor of trying \nto force the debate on managed care in this manner. I respectfully urge \nboth sides to work in good faith to arrive at a reasonable time \nagreement to facilitate an orderly debate as soon as practicable on \nthis very important legislation.\n  In that regard, I do not think 40 amendments on either side is \nrealistic given all of the other matters competing for the Senate's \nattention; nor, for that matter, do I think 3 amendments would give the \nSenate the opportunity to fully debate these issues.\n  If we are serious about Senate consideration of managed care \nlegislation--as I believe both sides are--I see\n\n[[Page S7444]]\n\nno reason why we cannot come to an agreement on a date certain for \ntaking up this legislation, and a date certain for completing it. I \nbelieve the Senate could complete consideration of this legislation \nwithin a period of five or six days.\n  So, let us proceed in a timely manner to debate these differences and \nto vote to resolve them. That is our task, and I am willing to help in \nwhatever ways I can to ensure a full and meaningful debate.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my frustration \nand outrage with the inability of the Republican leadership to allow a \nfair and open debate on a real Patients' Bill of Rights. I do not like \nthe idea of tying up must do appropriations bills to try and force a \nfair and open debate on access to health care services. However, due to \nthe inability to find a reasonable compromise on the number of \namendments, we have been forced to bring this issue to every possible \nvehicle.\n  There are many things we do here that simply do not have the impact \nwe seem to think they do. We spend more time debating a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget instead of simply doing the hard work \nto balance the budget. We proved that despite weeks of debate all we \nneeded to do was make the tough choices and balance the budget. Yet \nwhen it comes to something like access to emergency room treatment or \naccess to experimental life saving treatments, we can't find three days \non the Senate floor. This is the kind of legislation that really does \nimpact American working families. I would argue that it deserves a full \nand open debate on the Senate floor.\n  The pending amendment before us is not, and let me repeat, is not a \nPatient Bill of Rights. Oddly enough it excludes most insured Americans \nand in many cases, simply reiterates current insurance policy. It does \nnot provide the kind of protections and guarantees that will ensure \nthat when you need your insurance it is there for you and your \nfamilies. Let's face it, most people do not even think about their \nhealth insurance until they become sick. Certainly insurance companies \ndo not notify them every week or month when collecting their premiums \nthat there are many services and benefits that they do not have access \nto. It is amazing how accurate insurance companies can be in collecting \npremiums, but when it comes time to access benefits it becomes a huge \nbureaucracy with little or no accountability.\n  The Republican leadership bill is inadequate in many areas. Let me \npoint out one major hole in this legislation. During markup of this \namendment in the HELP Committee I offered a very short and simple \namendment to prohibit so-called ``drive through mastectomies.'' My \namendment would have prohibited insurance companies from requiring \ndoctors to perform major breast cancer surgery in an out patient \nsetting and discharging the woman within hours. We saw this happen when \ninsurance companies decided that there was no medical necessity for a \nwoman to stay more than 12 hours in a hospital following the birth of a \nchild. They said there was no need for follow up for the newborn infant \nbeyond 12 hours. There was no understanding of the effects of child \nbirth on a woman and no role for the woman or physician to determine \nwhat is medically necessary for both the new mother and new born \ninfant.\n  I offered the drive through mastectomy prohibition amendment only \nbecause an amendment offered earlier in the markup would continue the \npractice of allowing insurance personnel to determine what was \nmedically necessary. Not doctors or patients, but insurance company \nbean counters. I offered my amendment to ensure that no insurance \ncompany would be allowed to engage in drive through mastectomies. My \namendment did not require a mandatory hospital stay. It did not set the \nnumber of days or hours. It simply said that only the doctor and \npatient would be able to determine if a hospital stay was medically \nnecessary. The woman who suffered the shock of the diagnosis of breast \ncancer; the woman who was told a mastectomy was the only choice; the \nwoman who faced this life altering surgery. She decides.\n\n  Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side did not feel \ncomfortable giving the decision to the woman and her doctor. They did \nnot like legislating by body part. Neither do I. But I could not sit by \nand be silent on this issue. Defeating the medically necessary \namendment offered prior to my amendment, forced me to legislate by body \npart. I would do it again to ensure that women facing a mastectomy are \nnot sent home to deal with the physical and emotional after shocks.\n  For many years I have listened to many of my colleagues talk about \nbreast cancer and breast cancer research or a breast cancer stamp. When \nit sometimes to really helping breast cancer survivors, some of my \nRepublican colleagues vote ``no.'' I hope we are able to correct this \nand give all of my colleagues, not just those on the HELP Committee the \nchance to vote ``yes.''\n  I also want to remind many of my colleagues who support doubling \nresearch at NIH, that we are facing a situation where we have all this \ngreat research and yet we allow insurance companies to deny access. \nToday we heard testimony at the Labor, HHS Subcommittee hearing about \njuvenile diabetes. It was an inspiring hearing with over 100 children \nand several celebrities. Yet as I sat there listening to testimony from \nNIH about the need to increase funding and how close we are to finding \na cure, I was struck by the fact that the Republican leadership bill \nwould allow the continued practice of denying access to clinical \ntrials, access to new experimental drugs and treatments, access to \nspecialities and access to speciality care provided at NIH cancer \ncenters.\n  It does little good to increase research or to find a cure for \ndiabetes or Parkinsons disease if very few can afford the cure or are \ndenied access to the cure. We need to continue our focus on research, \nbut cannot simply ignore the issue of access.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting a real Patient's \nBill of Rights that puts the decision on health care back into the \nhands of the consumer and the physician. It does not dismantle managed \ncare. But it ensures that insurance companies managed care, not \nprofits.\n  I do not want to increase the cost of health care costs, I simply \nwant to make sure that people get what they pay for. That they have the \nsame access to cure that we as Members of the Senate enjoy as we \nparticipate in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. The President \nhas made sure that we have patient protections. Our constituents \ndeserve no less.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am voting against tabling both \ncompeting versions of the Patient's Bill of Rights because I believe \nboth should be considered by the Senate. I oppose any proposal to limit \namendments on either bill and then have just an up or down vote on each \nBill.\n  I believe a bill should be considered in regular order in the usual \nmanner subject to the Senate rules which would permit amendments and \ndebate under our rules without a unanimous consent agreement limiting \namendments or debate.\n  My own preference for the Patient's Bill of Rights is the bipartisan \nproposal S. 374 sponsored by Senators Chafee, Graham, Lieberman, \nBaucus, and myself.\n  If any bill is called up subject to regular order, the various \nprovisions could be considered and voted upon and the Senate would work \nits will on the competing provisions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Two minutes 50 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to reserve the last 20 seconds, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. President, to listen to my friends on the other side, you would \nthink that you were hearing the talking points written by the insurance \nindustry: It costs too much.\n  Here is the CBO report: 4.8 percent for average premiums for \nemployer-sponsored health insurance over 5 years. For the sake of this \nexercise, call it 5 percent. Say a families' premium is $5,000. That is \n$250 over 5 years. Allocate that in terms of employer-employee, and you \nwill find that the cost paid by an employee is around the cost of a Big \nMac each month. This\n\n[[Page S7445]]\n\nis a buy to ensure that you are going to have the protections in our \nlegislation.\n  We hear about all the things that their program is doing. But the one \nthing that Senator Frist left out is that they are only covering a \nthird of all of Americans. They are leaving out more than 110 million \nAmericans. If this plan is so good, why not include everyone?\n  For those that are so concerned about the cost, I hope they are going \nto explain where they are getting the money that the Joint Tax \nCommittee says their proposal will cost. Their medical savings accounts \nalone--which are little more than a tax shelter for the rich--are $4.2 \nbillion over the next 7 years. But they don't say how they will pay for \nit in their proposal.\n  They are concerned about cost? Why are they expanding that tax \nloophole? Why aren't they at least jawboning the insurance companies to \nhold down the 6 to 10 percent increase that we see in the insurance \npremiums every year just to increase profits?\n  Every single provision of the Republican bill is riddled with \nloopholes. It is a bill that only an insurance company accountant could \nlike. As this debate proceeds, we will expose those loopholes.\n  Mr. President, one of the ways you know a person is by who their \nfriends are. Our friends in this debate are the 200 groups that \nrepresent the doctors and nurses--the health delivery professionals--\nand consumers. Not a single organization supports the opposition.\n  If our amendment is tabled, it is a vote against children, a vote \nagainst families, a vote against women; it is a vote against every \nindividual with a serious health problem, and it is a vote in favor of \nmismanaged care and a vote in favor of placing insurance company \nprofits ahead of patient care. I hope the motion to table Senator \nDaschle's amendment is defeated.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 5 minutes 4 seconds, and \nSenator Kennedy has 20 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMaine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the assistant majority leader.\n  The goal of any patients' rights legislation should be to resolve \ndisputes about coverage, about access to treatment upfront when the \ncare is needed, not months or even years later in a courtroom. That is \na fundamental difference between the bill supported by Senator Kennedy \nand the proposal that we have advanced.\n  Our legislation would accomplish this goal by creating a strong \ninternal and external review process. If a patient or a physician is \nunhappy with an HMO's decision, the patient or the provider can appeal \nit internally for a review. If they are unhappy with the review \ndecision, the internal review, they have the right for a free and quick \nreview by an external panel. The goal of our legislation is to ensure \nthat people get the treatment they have been promised.\n  Moreover, the decision of the outside reviewers is binding on the \nhealth plan but not on the patient. If the patient is still not \nsatisfied, he or she retains the right to sue in Federal or State court \nfor attorneys' fees, court costs, value of the benefit, and injunctive \nrelief.\n  Our bill places treatment decisions in the hands of physicians, not \ntrial lawyers. If your HMO denies you the treatment your doctor \nbelieves is medically necessary, you should not have to resort to a \ncostly and lengthy court battle to get the care you need. You should \nnot have to hire a lawyer and file an expensive lawsuit to get \ntreatment.\n  Our approach contrasts with the approach taken in the measure offered \nby Senator Kennedy. Their approach, which I do not support, would \nencourage patients to sue health care plans. You just can't sue your \nway to quality health care. We want to solve the problems upfront, when \nthe care is needed, not months or even years later, after the harm has \noccurred.\n  According to the GAO, it takes an average of 33 months to resolve \nmedical malpractice cases. This does nothing to ensure a patient's \nright to timely and appropriate care. Moreover, patients only receive \n43 cents out of every dollar awarded in malpractice cases. The rest \nwinds up in the pockets of trial lawyers and the administrators of \ncourt and insurance systems.\n  Suing is not the answer. The answer is having a fair, free, and \nprompt appeals process that gets patients the care they need, the care \nthey were promised before harm can be done.\n  I recently met with a group of Maine employers who expressed their \nvery serious concerns about the Kennedy proposal to expand liability \nfor health plans and employers. One of these employers was Bowdoin \nCollege in Brunswick, ME. I want to talk briefly about Bowdoin's \nexperience.\n  They moved to a self-funded plan in order to improve the coverage \nprovided to their employees. They now provide an annual physical, low-\ncost prescription coverage, and well-baby care. But they told me that \nif the Democrats' proposal to expand liability goes through, it would \nseriously jeopardize their ability to offer affordable coverage for \ntheir employees. They would return to the insurance market and to a \nplan less favorable to their employees.\n  I thank the assistant majority leader for yielding the additional \nminute. I yield back my time to the assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 12 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will reserve 12 seconds.\n  In a moment there will be a motion to table the Republican \nsubstitute. I hope our colleagues will vote against that motion to \ntable and then, hopefully, after that is not tabled, I will move to \ntable the Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. President, I will do so for a couple of reasons. One, it doesn't \nbelong on the agriculture bill. I told my colleagues we are willing to \ncome up with a reasonable time agreement and a limited number of \namendments to debate this issue. It doesn't belong on the agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  There are other reasons to table the underlying Kennedy amendment. If \nyou want to increase health care costs, that is what this bill does. It \nwill increase health care costs 5 percent, in addition to the 6, 7, 8, \n9 percent of health care inflation. You are going to have a 13 or 14-\npercent increase in health care costs, which is going to increase the \nnumber of uninsured probably by 1.5 million, maybe more. We should not \nbe passing legislation to put 1.5 million people into the uninsured \ncategory. That would be a serious mistake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the issue that is before us with the \nproposal that Senator Daschle has advanced is a very basic and \nfundamental one: Who ought to be making the decisions on your health \ncare?\n  The whole concept behind the Daschle proposal is that we should let \nthe medical professional guide that judgment--the doctor, nurse and \npatient together. That ought to be the basis of the judgment--not an \naccountant, not an insurance company official. That is really at the \nheart of this whole legislation. Our legislation protects that and \npreserves it.\n  The other legislation that is reported out of our committee fails to \ndo it. That is why we have the support of the health care professionals \nand they do not. I hope we will have the opportunity to at least debate \nthese various issues in an orderly way. That is what this battle is \nabout. I hope that we will be able to continue with a reasonable \nprocedure to permit the Senate to make a judgment.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am afraid my colleague from \nMassachusetts didn't hear my colleague from Tennessee state that we do \nhave internal appeals that are decided by physicians. We also have \nexternal appeals that are decided by experts in the medical community. \nSo if his statement is correct, he should vote for our proposal. I \nencourage him to do so.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, has all time expired?\n\n[[Page S7446]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, unfortunately I was unable to vote on the \ncloture petition on the motion to proceed to H.R. 975, the Steel Import \nLimitation Act. If I was able, I would have voted against cloture. This \nlegislation will not achieve its desired purpose and will only hurt \nAmerican workers and consumers.\n  Some supporters of this legislation have asserted that this bill is \nnecessary to support the steel industry. I am willing to do my part to \nensure that America continues to have the most efficient and \ncompetitive steel industry in the world. The domestic steel industry \nplays an important role in protecting our national security by ensuring \nthat we will have enough steel to build ships, tanks, planes, and \nmissiles to protect the United States. Additionally, steel remains an \nimportant input in large sectors of our economy, including \ntransportation equipment, fabricated metal products, industrial \nmachinery and construction.\n  However, this legislation is not written to save domestic steel jobs, \nbut instead will jeopardize American jobs. For every 1 job that \nproduces steel, 40 jobs in the downstream industries use steel. If \nCongress passes this quota legislation, it will cause a shortage and \ndrastic increase in the price of steel that will threaten the jobs of \nthe 8 million employees in steel-using industries. For example, \nCaterpillar, Inc. uses a heavy special-section steel for bulldozer \ntrack-shoes. This steel is not produced in the United States, so \nCaterpillar imports it from overseas to its American plants. If we pass \nthis quota legislation, Caterpillar will not be able to import the \nsteel it requires, which will threaten the jobs of Caterpillar's 40,261 \nworkers in the U.S.\n  I also do not think that this quota legislation will help the steel \nindustry. According to the Wall Street Journal, American steelmakers \nbuy up to 25% of the steel coming into the United States. The steel \ncompanies need to buy this steel to reach their highest capacity of \nsteel production. Weirton imports close to 400,000 tons of slab a year. \nBethlehem Steel imported at least 416,000 tons of steel last year. If \nwe shut off the necessary imports of foreign steel to these companies, \nhow can they keep American steel product workers employed?\n  While I know that the steel industry has been affected by the dumping \nof foreign steel in the U.S. market, I believe that the proper steps \nhave been taken to deal with this crisis. Since January, 1999, 42 \nantidumping and countervailing duty steel investigations have been \ninitiated or completed. As a result of just one of these anti-dumping \ncases, duties of between 67.14% and 17.86% will be imposed on select \nJapanese firms. These duties will ensure that U.S. companies will have \na better chance to compete.\n  That the existing process for handling anti-dumping cases is working \nis proven by the recent statistics on steel imports. Total steel \nimports dropped 42% from August, 1998, to April, 1999. In fact, April, \n1999, imports are actually 6% below steel imports in April, 1997. \nImports of hot-rolled steel, which account for 25 percent of all steel \nimports, fell 72% since the peak levels of November, 1998. Hot-rolled \nsteel imports from Japan, Russia, and Brazil fell almost 100% from \nNovember to April. It is no wonder that Secretary Daley said in the \nFriday, June 18, Washington Post that ``the steel crisis of '98, in my \nopinion, is over.'' Given the decline in recent imports, there seems to \nbe no need for this legislation. These results, under existing law, \nwere attained in a manner fully consistent with our obligations under \nthe World Trade Organization.\n  This leads me to a more important point. We should not look at this \nlegislation in only the narrow view of what it will do for the steel \nindustry. Instead, we should see what it will do to the world economy.\n\n[[Page S7447]]\n\n  The past two years have been devastating for many of our trading \npartners. Most of Asia is slowly turning the corner back from the \ndisaster of the Asian economic crisis. Just recently, Japan announced a \npositive growth rate of 1.9% after six successive quarters of \ncontraction. Both Brazil and Argentina have suffered from economic \nturmoil. In Europe, the Russian economy remains a basket case. Germany, \nthe former European economic powerhouse, grew a mere 0.4% in real \nterms, and is on the verge of recession.\n  The United States must be careful not to do anything that will plunge \nthe world into recession. If we were to pass this non-WTO compliant \nlegislation, the likely result is that other countries will respond by \nlimiting our products from their markets. The resulting trade wars \ncould affect millions of workers and lead to economic and political \nturmoil. While some view such a result as extreme, we all should \nremember that the Smoot-Hawley tariff legislation started a similar \nseries of trade wars in the early 1930s that directly corresponded to \nthe rise of Hitler and the origins of World War II.\n  Some would urge us to pass this legislation with the hopes that it \nwill emasculate the WTO. I can only tell you how much I regret this \nshort-sighted view. The United States, more than any other country, \ncreated today's trading system based on the principles of free trade. \nIt was developed after witnessing how the trade wars of the 1930s led \nto the worldwide calamity of World War II. The United States has \npursued a trade policy based on open markets for more than 50 years \nunder both Republican and Democratic leadership. We should not allow \nmisguided politics to destroy all of the gains that we fought so hard \nto achieve, precisely when we are reaping the benefits of these \npolicies.\n  Instead, the United States, which has the strongest economy in the \nworld, should try to use its leverage to continue to open markets. We \nshould open the November WTO Ministerial as the champions of \ncompetition and open markets, not hiding behind a wall of quotas and \ntariffs. We in Congress should do our part to ensure that the United \nStates remains in its position of world leadership. Instead of debating \nthis ill-advised quota bill, we should be passing fast track authority \nfor the President. The President needs this authority to continue to \nmake agreements to knock down foreign barriers to American goods. \nAdditionally, we should pass legislation to grant NAFTA parity to our \nCaribbean allies and to give trade incentives to help Africa grow and \nprosper. My hope is that after we reject this current legislation, we \ncan start debating real progress in trade policy and how we can \neliminate barriers to foreign goods to ensure that our citizens \ncontinue to prosper into the 21st Century.\n  In conclusion, I congratulate my colleagues who voted against cloture \non the motion to proceed to this legislation. We will now begin the \nnext global century not hiding behind barriers, but continuing the \nfight for open markets and prosperity.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to take a few brief moments to \ncomment on the cloture vote that just occurred regarding H.R. 975, the \nSteel Import Limitation bill.\n  As has been noted by several of my colleagues this afternoon, this \nwas a difficult vote. There exist compelling interests on both sides of \nthe steel quota issue that were only touched upon earlier. Without \nquestion, this legislation is critically important to those men and \nwomen involved in the steel industry who have suffered financially due \nto alleged steel dumping practices. At the same time, this bill could \nalso have a profound effect on this country's trade policy and \ncountless other American industries' relationships with our foreign \ntrading partners.\n  Understanding that these are cursory assessments of the deeper \nsubstance of this bill, I present them simply to underscore the need to \ndiscuss the bill at greater length, to emphasize the importance of \nallowing Senators the opportunity to articulate their specific concerns \nand positions on this legislation. This was not a vote on final passage \nor a vote to support this bill in its current form. Rather, it was a \nvote to move forward and fully consider this legislation and amendments \nto it. Regardless of one's opinion on the impact of this legislation, \nit deserved the chance to be considered and debated completely and \nfairly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7447-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE GOVERNMENT OF BOLIVIA'S COUNTERNARCOTICS PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LOTT. As the Senate moves toward consideration of the Foreign \nOperations Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2000, I want to note the \nsignificant efforts being made by the Government of Bolivia in its \ncounternarcotics program. Since taking office in August, 1997, the \ngovernment of Hugo Banzer has reduced Bolivia's cocaine production \npotential by a remarkable 40 percent.

I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record a letter I received from the Vice \nPresident of Bolivia, Mr. Jorge Quiroga Ramirez, which discusses the \nBolivian Government's plans and seeks continued American assistance in \nits counternarcotics efforts.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Presidencia del Congreso National, Vicepresidencia-de la \n           Republica,\n                                             La Paz, May 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sir: I am writing to ask your help in addressing \n     Bolivia's counter-narcotics needs in the coming Fiscal Year. \n     As you are aware the government of President Banzer has \n     embarked on an ambitious program (the Dignity Plan) to end \n     our country's involvement in the illegal drug trade by the \n     time we leave office in 2002. To date, the Dignity Plan has \n     produced impressive results. In just twenty--one months we \n     have successfully eradicated close to 40% of coca crops that \n     go into making cocaine, and we are on target to meet our goal \n     of a drug-free Bolivia by 2002. Our success thus far has been \n     achieved through a combination of national political will and \n     assistance from the international donor community.\n       We are at a critical juncture in the development of the \n     Dignity Plan. Having gained broad based domestic support for \n     our policies, we now have to show our people that we can \n     provide more legitimate commercial ventures as alternatives \n     to coca in order to keep them from returning to coca planting \n     in the future. It would be a profound tragedy for Bolivia and \n     for the consumer nations if, after scud successful \n     eradication, we were unable to hold the progress gained. The \n     Bolivian people are willing to leave the illegal narcotics \n     circuit if we can show them that feasible commercial \n     alternatives exist. Where we have accomplished this, re-\n     planting rates are at historical lows and our system of \n     community--based compensation (as opposed to individual \n     compensation) provides the best incentives for keeping our \n     farmers in legitimate agricultural enterprises.\n       Proud as we are of our record, we know that the most \n     difficult work lies ahead. We must maintain historic levels \n     of eradication while dramatically enhancing our Alternative \n     Development efforts to ensure that this eradication holds. \n     For these reasons we are turning to the international donor \n     community, and especially to the United States. I must be \n     candid in stating, however, that the levels of counter-\n     narcotics and alternative development funding which have \n     recently been proposed for Bolivia, will fall well short of \n     our needs.\n       In February of this year I visited Washington to present a \n     comprehensive budget for the last years of our Dignity Plan. \n     This figure of $384 million from the United States (coupled \n     with our own contributions and those from Europe) across four \n     years represents our best estimates of waht will be required \n     to move our country out of the international narcotics \n     circuit. As a former Finance Minister I understand and \n     respect the need for fiscal discipline and I know that the \n     United States Congress is struggling with its own budget \n     priorities for the coming years. I would point out, however, \n     that we have a once-in-a generation opportunity to completely \n     win a battle, in Bolivia, in the worldwide war against drugs. \n     If we fail to meet this challenge it may take us decades to \n     arrive at this point again as the credibility of counter \n     narcotics programs will suffer.\n       I would like to again ask your help and support in locating \n     the resources needed for complete funding of the Dignity Plan \n     request. With the proper levels of assistance we can soon \n     celebrate with the United States the day when my country is \n     out of the drug circuit entirely and Bolivian based cocaine \n     no longer plagues the streets of our countries. The war on \n     drugs needs its first victory. With your help Bolivia can be \n     that victory.\n       Thank you for your support and consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Jorge F. Quiroga R.,\n         Vicepresident of the Republic of Bolivia, President of \n           the National Congress.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7448-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7448]]\n                  RETIREMENT OF GENERAL CHARLES KRULAK\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the \noutstanding service to our nation of General Charles Krulak, Commandant \nof the Marine Corps who is about to retire. General Krulak is \ncompleting 35 years of active service in the Marine Corps since he \ngraduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1964. During his service, the \nGeneral obtained a Masters Degree in Labor Relations from George \nWashington University. He is also a graduate of the Amphibious Warfare \nSchool, the Army Command and General Staff College, and the prestigious \nNational War College.\n  General Krulak's illustrious career included command of a platoon and \ntwo rifle companies during two tours of duty in the Vietnam conflict. \nHe has been a battalion commander, Commanding General of a Marine \nExpeditionary Brigade, and the Assistant Division Commander of the 2nd \nMarine Division located at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. He later was \nassigned duties as the Commanding General of the 6th Marine \nExpeditionary Group and Commanding General of the 2nd Force Service \nSupport Group. He served as the Commanding General of this Force \nService Support Group during Operation Desert Storm in the Persian \nGulf. In addition to these command assignments, General Krulak's \nprofessional career has included a wide variety of other command and \nstaff assignments including a tour of duty in the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense and the White House.\n  In June 1989, General Krulak received his first star and, three years \nlater, he was promoted to Major General and assigned to the Marine \nCorps Combat Development Command at Quantico, Virginia. One year later, \nhe was promoted to Lieutenant General. This was followed by a transfer \nto Hawaii and assignment as Commander, Marine Forces Pacific. It was in \nthis role that I became personally acquainted with this Marine's \nremarkably high degree of professionalism. Four years ago, General \nKrulak became the 31st Commandant of the Marine Corps, during which he \nled our Marines admirably and set a high degree of professionalism not \nonly in basic training, but also throughout the entire Marine Corps. He \nestablished, demanded and obtained a high degree of moral conduct from \nhis Marines as a direct result of his exemplary leadership. However, \nthe General's positive attributes do not stop there. He has \ndemonstrated a remarkable ability to visualize and plan for the \nweapons, equipment, doctrine, tactics, and techniques the Marine Corps \nwill be using for decades ahead.\n  It is an honor for me to recognize the high quality of leadership \nthis General has given our Marines these past four years. Our nation \nhas been fortunate in having him as Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n  I know the members of the Senate will join me in paying tribute to \nGeneral Krulak and wishing him and his lovely wife, Zandi well in their \nretirement. We will sorely miss them.\n  In addition to expressing our fond farewell to General Krulak, I want \nto take this opportunity to welcome the 32nd Commandant of the Marine \nCorps, General James L. Jones. General Jones is no stranger to the U.S. \nSenate. He served here in the U.S. Marine Corps Liaison office from \nAugust 1979 until July 1984. I am confident General Jones will serve \nour nation as Commandant in a comparable manner as his predecessor. \nWelcome aboard General Jones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7448-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CHANGES TO THE BUDGETARY AGGREGATES AND APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE \n                               ALLOCATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                 KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I rise to speak about a resolution \nrelated to Kosovo which was brought before the Senate late last \nThursday evening and adopted by unanimous consent.\n  This concurrent resolution commends the President and the Armed \nForces for the ``success'' of Operation Allied Force. I had \nreservations in supporting this resolution, but ultimately decided to \ndo so because it provided an opportunity to honor the men and women in \nuniform who put their lives on the line for this dangerous cause.\n  However, to term this operation a success, either now or in the \nforeseeable future, is an unconscionable stretch of the truth, at best. \nThis mission represented a complete failure of the Clinton \nadministration's foreign policy. This resolution also implies that the \nbook has been closed on Kosovo, and peace will reign in the Balkans. I \ndo not think it is necessary to remind the Senate of the bloody and \ntumultuous history of the region, or\n\n[[Page S7449]]\n\nthe uncertainty of the future. And it certainly is not appropriate to \nmislabel this foreign policy mishap as a success.\n  The failure of the administration's policy was apparent from the \nnegotiations at Rambouillet. It was one-sided from the beginning and \nSecretary Albright made no secret where the administration's loyalties \nlay: ``If the Serbs are the cause of the breakdown, we're going to go \nforward with the NATO decision to carry out air strikes,'' she \nthreatened. It was NATO's way, or no way. It is little wonder an \nagreement was not reached. The arrangement provided no preservation of \nnational sovereignty for Yugoslavia. NATO troops would have been \nauthorized ``free and unrestricted passage and unimpeded access \nthroughout the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia].'' There was also \nno guarantee, and indeed evidence to the contrary, that Yugoslavia's \nsovereignty and territorial integrity would remain intact after NATO \ntroops rolled into the country. The United States took sides in the \nnegotiations, and then wondered why the Serbs refused to sign the \nproposed agreement.\n  Equally harmful to the peace process was the lack of historical \nunderstanding with which the administration engaged in the \nnegotiations. Kosovo is the site of key historical and religious \nmonuments for the Serbs. However, the President and Secretary failed to \nrecognize this fundamental fact. It was both arrogance and \nshortsightedness which allowed the administration to proceed on this \nflawed course to disaster. I do not claim to be a scholar of the region \nmyself; however, I am not arrogant enough to believe one can solve \ncenturies-old conflicts with three nights of an air campaign, as the \nadministration originally anticipated.\n  The administration ``policy'' was nothing more than a policy du jour. \nAt first, the goal of the air strikes was to bring Milosevic to the \nnegotiating table. Next, the strikes were to harm Serb military might. \nThen strikes were to force a complete Serb withdrawal from Kosovo. \nRegardless of what the strikes were supposed to do, they were never \npart of a methodical, strategic plan. Instead, they were a knee-jerk \nreaction to daily events.\n  Perhaps most disconcerting is the potential damage the operation may \nhave inflicted on the NATO alliance. This mission marked the first time \nin the 50 years of the alliance's history that it was involved in an \noperation that had nothing to do with defending the territorial \nintegrity of one of its members. The operation should be proof positive \nabout the dangers of a ``new strategic concept'' that would expand \nNATO's missions beyond territorial self-defense to peacekeeping arenas \noutside its borders. NATO maintains a hefty burden in protecting \nmembers from an unstable Russian and Korean Peninsula, and the growing \nproliferation threat around the world without the burden of regional \npeace-keeping, or other humanitarian missions which have nothing to do \nwith preserving the territorial integrity of members.\n  I point out these facts not to lessen the impact of the human tragedy \nthat occurred in Yugoslavia before the bombing began, or to lessen the \nresponsibility of Milosevic's role in that tragedy. However, I feel \ncompelled to raise this issue in the Senate today because it is \npremature to hail the Kosovo agreement as a success. Today, the Balkans \nare far less stable than when the operation began on march 24. The \nlesson to be learned from this operation should not be that good \nintentions are good reasons for foreign policy whims, particularly when \nthose whims risk the lives of our men and women in uniform.\n  The brave men and women of the Armed Forces deserve the praise and \nthanks of a grateful nation for serving with distinction and honor. I \nwholeheartedly join the Senate in thanking the members of the Armed \nForces who served in the campaign in the Balkans. However, I am not \nready to endorse this ill-conceived mission as a victory for the United \nStates or NATO. Instead, this mission ought to go down in the history \nbooks as a lesson in what foreign policy blunders should be avoided in \nthe future.\n  To recover from this blunder, the President must provide a \ncomprehensive post-war plan for the region. Bringing true peace to \nKosovo will depend on the development of a stable balance of power on \nthe ground. Whatever course of action is pursued by the administration, \nit must be one that ultimately would help the United States and its \nNATO allies to reduce their military commitments in the Balkans, and \navoid entangling the United States and the Alliance in another Kosovo \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7449-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7449-S7450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               U.S. CITIZENS KILLED IN ACTS OF TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The defense of American citizens is the highest duty of \nour government. That duty is fulfilled not only by protecting Americans \nat home, but U.S. citizens when they are abroad. This nation is a city \non a hill, and our stand against oppression often has made us a target \nfor those dark forces of violence and tyranny in the world. Terrorism \nis and will continue to be a principal weapon of those who would seek \nto threaten the United States and all for which our country stands.\n  The Middle East is the region of the world with the greatest amount \nof terrorist activity. Five of the seven state sponsors of terrorism \nare located in or border on the region the State Department defines as \nthe Near East. Our close ally Israel is often the target of terrorist \ngroups operating in the Middle East, and the deaths of Americans due to \nterrorist attacks in Israel has been of particular concern to me.\n  My amendment to the State Department Authorization bill simply \nrequires the State Department to compile a report on U.S. citizens who \nhave been killed in terrorist attacks in Israel or in territory \ncontrolled by the Palestinian Authority. The report will include a list \nof terrorist attacks in which U.S. citizens were killed and information \non the groups of individuals responsible for the attack. The \nwhereabouts of suspects implicated in the attacks, whether each suspect \nhas been incarcerated or incarcerated and released, the status of each \ncase pending against each suspect, whether the State Department has \noffered any reward for these terrorist suspects, and an overview of \nU.S. efforts to investigate and apprehend these suspects are particular \npoints of concern my amendment addresses.\n  Since the signing of Oslo in 1993, at least 12 American citizens have \nbeen killed in terrorist attacks in Israel or territory controlled by \nthe Palestinian Authority: Nachson Wachsman, Joan Davenny, Leah Stern, \nYael Botwin, Yaron Unger, Sara Duker, Matthew Eisenfeld, Ira Weinstein, \nAlisa Flatow, David Boim, Daniel Frei, and Yitzchak Weinstock.\n  Responsibility for almost all of these murders has been claimed by \nHamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad, two terrorist groups supported by \nIran and Syria and dedicated to the destruction of Israel.\n  Terrorism's toll on Israel has been high as well. Since the beginning \nof the Oslo process in 1993, Israel has lost more than 280 of its \ncitizens to terrorist violence in over 1,000 terrorist attacks (a \nportion of the Israeli population comparable to 15,000 Americans).\n  Jean-Claude Niddam of the Israeli Ministry of Justice testified \nbefore the Senate Appropriations Foreign Operations Subcommittee on \nMarch 25, 1999, and gave an overview of the difficulties related to \nprosecuting suspects implicated in the murder of U.S. citizens.\n\n  First, Mr. Niddam notes that terrorists suspected of killing \nAmericans have found shelter in the Palestinian Authority. For the last \n4 years, Israel has submitted almost 40 official requests to the \nPalestinian Authority to transfer suspects implicated in terrorism \nagainst Israelis and Americans, but has yet to receive a reply. Out of \n38 requests to arrest and transfer terrorist suspects, only 12 suspects \nare currently under arrest and 7 are serving or served until recently \nin the Palestinian police force.\n  Mr. Niddam's testimony focused on eight terrorist suspects involved \nin terrorist attacks against Americans. Three of these suspects have \nbeen detained by the Palestinian Authority. One of those imprisoned, \nImjad Hinawi, confessed in a Palestinian court to the murder of David \nBoim. The confession was witnessed by a U.S. embassy official present \nat the trial. If there is a good reason why the Administration has not \nindicted Mr. Hinawi, it is the time for a clear explanation.\n\n[[Page S7450]]\n\n  Another suspect, Ibrahim Ghanimat, linked to the shooting deaths of \nYaron Unger and his wife Efrat, spends his nights in prison but is free \nto come and go during the day. Adnan al-Ghul, Yusuf Samiri, and \nMohammad Dief, three other suspects involved in the killings of \nAmericans, are all at large. Nafez Sabi'h was implicated in a bombing \nthat killed three Americans, but was believed to be serving in the \nPalestinian police force until several months ago.\n  In recent years, other suspects implicated in the murder of American \ncitizens have served in the Palestinian police force. In July 1998, the \nIsraeli Government released a report stating that four terrorist \nsuspects involved in the February 1996 Jerusalem bus bombing, in which \nthree American citizens were killed, were serving in Palestinian \nsecurity forces.\n  A climate conducive to terrorism is the most serious threat to a \nlasting peace settlement in the Middle East. When Abul Abbas, the \nhijacker of the Achille Lauro, lives freely in Gaza and is a close \nassociate of Yasser Arafat; when the Palestinian Authority's official \nmedia arm, the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation, airs programming \nwhich teaches Palestinian children to hate Israelis; when terrorist \nsuspects are given positions in the Palestinian security forces--\ngenuine peace is undermined and U.S. interests endangered in the Middle \nEast.\n  It is time for the United States to get serious about defending its \nown. President Clinton promised that no quarter would be given to \nterrorists who killed 12 Americans in the Africa embassy bombings in \nAugust 1998. But I fear this administration has not been pursuing \naggressively terrorist suspects implicated in the murder of a similar \nnumber of Americans in Israel.\n  Recent testimony by top administration officials does not indicate \nthat our resolve to prosecute these cases is strengthening. Martin \nIndyk, Assistant Secretary of State for the Near East, was called to \ntestify before the Senate Appropriations Committee last March on \nterrorism against U.S. citizens, but his written testimony did not even \ndiscuss these cases or what the State Department is doing to resolve \nthem.\n  George Washington once said that if we desire to avoid insult, we \nmust be able to repel it. A credible defense deters aggression and war, \nand a similar principle is at work in meeting the threat of terrorism \ntoday. If terrorists know they will suffer for attacking Americans, \nthey will be less likely to engage in such violence. President Reagan's \nresponse to Libyan terrorism quieted that government for over a decade.\n  While we cannot prevent violence against every American abroad, we \ncan ensure that terrorists who attack U.S. citizens are pursued \nrelentlessly.

A bill to make technical corrections in title 17, United \nStates Code, and other laws; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  copyright act technical corrections\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to rise, along with the \nranking minority Member on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, to \nintroduce a series of intellectual property related ``high-tech'' \nmeasures designed to promote the continued growth of these vital \nsectors of the American economy and to protect the interests and \ninvestment of the entrepreneurs, authors, and innovators who fuel their \ngrowth.\n  It is no secret that high technology is the driving force in the \nAmerican economy today. American technology is setting new standards \nfor the global economy, from computer chip technology and computer \nhardware, to personal and business software applications, to Internet, \nmultimedia and telecommunications technology, and even cutting-edge \npharmaceuticals and genetic research. In my own state of Utah, these \ninformation technology industries contribute in excess of $7 billion \neach year to the State's economy and pay wages that average 66 percent \nhigher than the state average. Their performance has placed Utah among \nthe world's top ten technology centers according to Newsweek Magazine. \nWhere Wired is a Way of Life, Newsweek, November 9, 1998, at 44. \nSimilar success is seen across the country, with seven of the world's \ntop ten technology centers located in the United States, and with \nAmerican creative industries now surpassing all other export sectors in \nforeign sales and exports.\n  Underlying all of these technologies are the intangible property \nrights--\n\n[[Page S7453]]\n\ncopyrights, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets--that serve to \npromote creativity and innovation by safeguarding the investment, \neffort, and goodwill of those who venture into these fast-paced and \nvolatile fields. Providing adequate protections for these intellectual \nproperty rights in the global high-tech environment is critical, \nparticularly in the digital environment where electronic piracy is so \neasy, so cheap, and yet so potentially devastating to intellectual \nproperty owners--many of which are small entrepreneurial enterprises. \nIn Utah, 65 percent of the information technology companies have fewer \nthan 25 employees, and a majority have annual revenues of less than $1 \nmillion. Over half of Utah's information technology companies have been \nin business for less than 10 years, with nearly a quarter having opened \ntheir doors since 1995. Intellectual property is the lifeblood of these \ncompanies and others similarly situated throughout the country, and \neven a single instance of piracy may be enough to drive them out of \nbusiness. What's more, without adequate international protection, these \ncompanies would simply be unable to compete in the global marketplace.\n  That is why in the last Congress we enacted a number of measures to \nprovide enhanced protection for intellectual property in the new \nglobal, high-tech environment. For example, last year Congress ratified \ntwo new landmark World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) \ntreaties to update international copyright standards to respond to the \nchallenges of the global economy and the digital, networked \nenvironment. In enacting the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), \nCongress implemented these treaties in the United States by bringing \nour own copyright laws into the digital age and set the standard \ninternationally for other nations to follow in amending their own laws \nto meet the requirements of the new WIPO treaties. In addition, as a \npart of that bill, we paved the way for new growth in online commerce \nby creating greater security for copyright owners and for the Internet \nservice providers who transmit and store copyrighted works online. We \nalso addressed new technologies, such as webcasting and satellite \nradio, to provide a copyright framework in which these new platforms \ncan flourish.\n\n  This year, Senator Leahy and I are continuing to focus our attention, \nand that of the Judiciary Committee, on important high-tech and \nintellectual property legislation. Already this year the Judiciary \nCommittee has reported, and the Senate has enacted, legislation to \nextend the Satellite Home Viewer Act, which will enable the satellite \nindustry to use new and emerging technology to provide competition in \nthe multichannel video marketplace and allow satellite subscribers to \nreceive local network stations by way of their satellite dishes for the \nfirst time.\n  Today we are introducing a number of additional measures relating to \ntechnology and intellectual property to strengthen our laws further in \norder to provide both incentives to creativity and deterrents against \ninfringement. Included among these are legislation that builds upon \nexisting protections, including last year's measures to deter digital \npiracy, by raising the Copyright Act's limit on statutory damages, \nthereby making it more costly to engage in cyber-piracy and copyright \ntheft. Also included is a measure to make technical ``clean-up'' \namendments to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in order to make its \nprovisions clearer and more user-friendly. On the trademark side, \nSenator Leahy and I are introducing a bill to make the protection of \nfamous marks easier and more efficient and to provide recourse for \ntrademark owners against the federal government for trademark \ninfringement. Finally, we are introducing Patent and Trademark Office \nreauthorization legislation to allow the PTO to better serve its \ncustomers--America's innovators and trademark owners--through the \ncollection and retention of patent and trademark fees.\n  It is our intention to turn to these bills in the Judiciary Committee \nprior to the July 4th recess at a Committee markup session dedicated \nsolely to the consideration of intellectual property legislation. I \nexpect these measures to be noncontroversial, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the Senate as we bring these bills to the \nfloor.\n\n\n             the copyright damages improvement act of 1999\n\n  The Copyright Damages Improvement Act will provide strengthened \nprotections for copyright owners and added deterrence against \ninfringement by making it more costly to engage in digital piracy and \ncopyright theft. In an age where electronic piracy costs next to \nnothing and where the distribution of pirated goods to locations around \nthe world is as easy as the click of a button, we are faced with the \ndanger that the costs of engaging in piracy will pale in comparison \nwith the anticipated rewards. Last year we strengthened the Copyright \nAct's substantive protections to deter digital piracy in this global \nnetworked environment. The bill we are introducing today will make it \nmore costly to infringe these and the Copyright Act's other substantive \nprotections by raising the limit on statutory damages by 50 percent.\n  Section 504(c) of the Copyright Act provides for the award of \nstatutory damages at the plaintiff's election in order to provide \ngreater security for copyright owners, who often find it difficult to \nprove actual damages in infringement cases--particularly in the \nelectronic environment--and to provide greater deterrence for would-be \ninfringers. The current provision caps statutory damages at $20,000 \n($100,000 in cases of willful infringement), which reflects figures set \nin statute in 1988 when the United States joined the Berne Convention. \nThe combination of more than a decade of inflation and revolutionary \nchanges in technology have rendered those figures largely inadequate to \nachieve their aims. The Copyright Damages Improvement Act updates the \nstatutory damage provisions to account for both these factors.\n  Under the bill, the cap on statutory damages is increased by 50 \npercent, from $20,000 to $30,000, and the minimum is similarly \nincreased from $500 to $750. For cases of willful infringement, the cap \nis raised to $150,000. In addition, the bill creates a new tier of \nstatutory damages targeted at bad actors who engage in a repeated \npattern or practice of infringement. In these cases, the court is \nauthorized to award statutory damages up to $250,000.\n  This will not mean that a court must impose the full amount of \ndamages in any given case, or even that it will be more likely to do \nso. In most cases, courts attempt to do justice by fixing the statutory \ndamages at a level that approximates actual damages and defendant's \nprofits. What this bill does is give courts wider discretion to award \ndamages that are commensurate with the harm caused and the gravity of \nthe offense. At the same time, the bill preserves provisions of the \ncurrent law allowing the court to reduce the award of statutory damages \nto as little as $200 in cases of innocent infringement and requiring \nthe court to remit damages in certain cases involving nonprofit \neducational institutions, libraries, archives, or public broadcasting \nentities.\n\n\n                  Copyright Act Technical Corrections\n\n  Senator Leahy and I are also introducing a general clean-up measure \nas a follow-up to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the Sonny \nBono Copyright Term Extension Act, which were enacted at the end of the \nlast Congress. This bill improves these bills to make them more user-\nfriendly for copyright owners and those who make use of their works in \naccordance with the provisions of the Copyright Act.\n\n\n                  The Trademark Amendments Act of 1999\n\n  The Trademark Amendments Act will provide stronger and more efficient \nprotection for trademark owners and consumers by making it possible to \nprevent trademark dilution before it occurs, by clarifying the remedies \navailable under the federal trademark dilution statute when it does \noccur, by providing recourse against the federal government for its \ninfringement of others' trademarks, and by creating greater certainty \nand uniformity in the area of trade dress protection.\n  In 1995, Senator Leahy and I sponsored the Federal Trademark Dilution \nAct to provide a uniform federal cause of action for trademark \ndilution--the commercial use in commerce of a mark that dilutes, or \n``whittles away,'' the distinctive quality of a famous trademark. Under \nthis legislation, now codified as section 43(c) of the Lanham Act, the \nowner of a famous mark is able to\n\n[[Page S7454]]\n\nprotect the investment and consumer goodwill associated with his mark \nby preventing others from using the same or similar marks in ways that \ntarnish or blur the distinctiveness of his mark, even where such uses \ndo not directly compete with the goods or services of the trademark \nowner. This new federal cause of action has been used increasingly in \nthe high-tech, online environment as a means of combating cyber-pirates \nand shady dealers who register famous marks as Internet domain names, \nseeking to sell them at a huge profit to the legitimate trademark \nowners or to reap where they have not sown, trading on the goodwill of \nothers by confusing consumers about their relationships to famous \nbrand-names. This problem is particularly acute in the Internet context \nwhere the only assurance of quality or sponsorship may be the \ninformation found on a web page and the IP address that leads consumers \nthere.\n\n  On the whole, the Federal Trademark Dilution Act has been effective \nin achieving better protection for trademark owners and national \nuniformity in this area of the law. There are a number of areas, \nhowever, in which we can improve implementation of the law and its \nability to protect both trademark owners and consumers. The Trademark \nAmendments Act of 1999 is designed to do just that.\n  First, it authorizes the Trademark Trial and Appeals Board (TTAB) to \nconsider dilution as grounds for refusal to register a mark or for \ncancellation of a registered mark. In Babson Bros. Co. v. Surge Power \nCorp., 39 USPQ 2d. 1953 (TTAB 1996), the TTAB held that it was not \nauthorized by the Federal Trademark Dilution Act to consider dilution \nas grounds for opposition or cancellation of a registration. Thus, \nunder current law a trademark owner may seek relief under the federal \ndilution statute only after dilution of the mark has occurred. And at \nleast one circuit has held that likelihood of dilution is not enough, \nthe trademark owner must prove actual dilution. The result is that the \nowner of a famous mark must stand idly by throughout the registration \nprocess and await recourse through costly litigation in federal court \nonly after he has suffered harm to his mark. By specifically allowing \nthe trademark owner to oppose registration or to petition for \ncancellation of a diluting mark, the bill we are introducing today will \nprevent needless harm to the goodwill and distinctiveness of many \ntrademarks and will make enforcing the federal dilution statute less \ncostly and time consuming for all involved.\n  Second, the bill clarifies the trademark remedies available in \ndilution cases, including injunctive relief, defendant's profits, \ndamages, costs, and, in exceptional cases, reasonable attorney fees, \nand the destruction of articles containing the diluting mark.\n  In addition, our bill will amend the Lanham Act to subject the \nfederal government to suit for trademark infringement and dilution. The \nfederal government increasingly participates in the marketplace as a \nprovider of goods and services in competition with private entities. In \nfact, the federal government owns a substantial number of trademarks \nregistered with the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), and the Lanham \nAct even allows the PTO Commissioner to waive the registration fees for \nfederal agencies. As a trademark owner, the federal government enjoys \nthe full panoply of rights under the Lanham Act, including the right to \nsue private citizens and businesses to enforce its rights under the \nAct. In contrast, in Preferred Risk Mutual Insurance Co. v. United \nStates, 39 F3d 789 (8th Cir. 1996), the Eighth Circuit held that the \nfederal government is immune from suit for trademark infringement \nabsent an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity.\n\n  Limited waivers of sovereign immunity exist for patent and copyright \ncases, as well as for cases involving protected plant varieties and \nsemiconductor chip mask works. Congress has also explicitly abrogated \nstate immunity from suit under the 11th Amendment for cases involving \ntrademark, copyright, and patent infringement. Our bill will extend \nthese same policies to the federal government, making it subject to \nsuit for trademark infringement and dilution on the same terms and \nconditions as states under the Lanham Act.\n  The bill we are introducing will also promote greater uniformity and \ncertainty in the area of trade dress protection by requiring plaintiffs \nto demonstrate that an unregistered mark is not functional. While trade \ndress may be afforded protection and registered on the Principal \nRegister if it serves as a trademark or service mark, protection under \nthe Lanham Act does not extend to functional trade dress features--\nthose that are essential to compete in a given market--which are \nproperly the subject of patent law. Where the plaintiff has \ndemonstrated through the examination process that the trade dress is \neligible for registration, the federal registration serves as prima \nfacie evidence of the validity of the mark and the registration, and in \neffect as prima facie evidence of nonfunctionality. For those cases \nwhere the plaintiff asserting trade dress protection has not \ndemonstrated eligibility for registration through the trademark \nexamination process, a majority of courts require the plaintiff to \nprove nonfunctionality. A minority of courts, however, have held that \nfunctionality is an affirmative defense which must be proved by the \ndefendant.\n  Our bill creates uniformity by adopting the majority view, requiring \nthe plaintiff to demonstrate nonfunctionality, either in the \nexamination process or as an element of his case in seeking to enforce \ntrade dress rights in litigation. This is consistent with the \nprinciples of federal trademark law and the common law, which requires \nplaintiffs to prove the essential elements of their case. Moreover, it \nwill promote both certainty and competitive fairness by encouraging \ntrade dress owners to register eligible designs and to seek patent \nprotection for those that are ineligible due to functionality\n  Finally, this bill makes a number of technical ``clean-up'' \namendments relating to the Trademark Law Treaty Implementation Act, \nwhich was enacted at the end of the last Congress.\n\n\n  the United States Patent and trademark office reauthorization act, \n                            fiscal year 2000\n\n  The fourth bill we are introducing today is designed to allow the PTO \nto better serve American innovators and trademark owners through the \ncollection and retention of patent and trademark fees. Last year we \nenacted legislation to provide the PTO with the resources it needs to \nmeet the demands of its workload and to limit the ability of Congress \nand the Administration to divert money from the PTO to unrelated \nfederal programs--all while providing for an overall decrease in patent \nfees. The bill we are introducing today continues those policies by \nallowing the PTO to generate the revenue it needs to operate as a fully \nfee-funded agency and to retain those fees for use in its patent and \ntrademark operations, without fee diversions or the creation of new \nsurcharges.\n  In the past, a substantial portion of patent fees revenues have been \ndiverted in the budget process to pay for unrelated federal programs. \nThe result has been substantial backlogs in patent pendency and a \ngeneral inability to provide the type of service our nation's inventors \npay for. I, along with several of my colleagues, have vigorously \nopposed this practice. The legislation we enacted last year went a long \nway to ensure that this practice would not continue. The legislation we \nare introducing today will continue this assurance by authorizing the \nPTO to raise just the revenues it needs to meet its program goals and \nretain those fees for use in its patent and trademark operations. The \nbill also makes available $116 million in fees from previous years, \nwhich the Administration has sought to withhold, and prohibits the \nimposition of unprecedented new surcharge fees sought by the \nAdministration's budget to subsidize federal health and life insurance \nbenefits for PTO employees. In the end, this legislation will promote a \nstronger, more efficient patent office and will mean, quite simply, \nthat America's innovators and trademark owners will get what they pay \nfor.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues to \npromote the progress of innovation in this country and the continued \ngrowth of the high-tech industrial base that has put our nation at the \nforefront of the global economy. Each of the bills we are introducing \ntoday will help to do\n\n[[Page S7455]]\n\nthat, and I urge my colleagues' support.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee in introducing four bills to reauthorize the Patent \nand Trademark Office, update the statutory damages available under the \nCopyright Act, make technical corrections to two new copyright laws \nenacted last year, and prevent trademark dilution. As the Chairman and \nI have already indicated in our June 11 joint statement, we hope that \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee reports these bills promptly and that \nthe Senate considers the bills without delay.\n  The introduction of these bills is a good start, but we must not lose \nsight of the other copyright and patent issues requiring our attention \nbefore the end of this Congress. The Senate Judiciary Committee has a \nfull slate of intellectual property matters to consider and I am \npleased to work on a bipartisan basis with the Chairman on an agenda to \nprovide the creators and inventors of copyrighted and patented works \nwith the protection they may need in our global economy, while at the \nsame time providing libraries, educational institutions and other users \nwith the clarity they need as to what constitutes a fair use of such \nworks.\n  Among the other important intellectual property matters for us to \nconsider are the following:\n  Distance Education. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing \nlast month on the Copyright Office's thorough and balanced report on \ncopyright and digital distance education. We need to address the \nlegislative recommendations outlined in that report to ensure that our \nlaws permit the appropriate use of copyrighted works in valid distance \nlearning activities.\n  Patent Reform. A critical matter on the intellectual property agenda, \nimportant to the nation's economic future, is reform of our patent \nlaws. I worked on a bipartisan basis in the last Congress to get the \nOmnibus Patent Act, S. 507, reported by the Judiciary Committee to the \nSenate by a vote of 177 to one, and then tried to have this bill \nconsidered and passed by the Senate. Unfortunately, the bill became \nstalled due to resistance by some in the majority. We should consider \nand pass this important legislation.\n  Madrid Protocol Implementation Act. I introduced this legislation, S. \n671, to help American businesses, and especially small and medium-sized \ncompanies, protect their trademarks as they expand into international \nmarkets by conforming American trademark application procedures to the \nterms of the Protocol in anticipation of the U.S.'s eventual \nratification of the treaty. Ratification by the United States of this \ntreaty would help create a ``one stop'' international trademark \nregistration process, which would be an enormous benefit for American \nbusinesses.\n\n  Database Protection. I noted upon passage of the Digital Millennium \nCopyright Act last year that there was not enough time before the end \nof that Congress to give due consideration to the issue of database \nprotection, and that I hoped the Senate Judiciary Committee would hold \nhearings and consider database protection legislation in this Congress, \nwith a commitment to make more progress. I support legal protection \nagainst commercial misappropriation of collections of information, but \nam sensitive to the concerns raised by the Administration, the \nlibraries, certain educational institutions, and the scientific \ncommunity. This is a complex and important matter that I look forward \nto considering in this Congress.\n  Tampering with Product Identification Codes. Product identification \ncodes provide a means for manufacturers to track their goods, which can \nbe important to protect consumers in cases of defective, tainted or \nharmful products and to implement product recalls. Defacing, removing \nor tampering with product identification codes can thwart these \ntracking efforts, with potential safety consequences for American \nconsumers. We should examine the scope of, and legislative solutions to \nremedy, this problem.\n  Online Trademark Protection or ``Cybersquatting.'' I have long been \nconcerned with protection online of registered trademarks. Indeed, when \nthe Congress passed the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, I noted \nthat:\n\n       [A]lthough no one else has yet considered this application, \n     it is my hope that this antidilution statute can help stem \n     the use of deceptive Internet addresses taken by those who \n     are choosing marks that are associated with the products and \n     reputations of others. (Congressional Record, December 29, \n     1995, page S19312).\n\n  Last year, my amendment authorizing a study by the National Research \nCouncil of the National Academy of Sciences of the effects on trademark \nholders of adding new top-level domain names and requesting \nrecommendations on related dispute resolution procedures, was enacted \nas part of the Next Generation Internet Research Act. We have not yet \nseen the results of that study, and I understand that the Internet \nCorporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (I-CANN) and World \nIntellectual Property Organization (WIPO) are considering mechanisms \nfor resolving trademark and other disputes over assignments of domain \nnames in an expeditious and inexpensive manner.\n  This is an important issue both for trademark holders and for the \nfuture of the global Internet. While I share the concern of trademark \nholders over what WIPO has characterized as ``predatory and parasitical \npractices by a minority of domain registrants acting in bad faith'' to \nregister famous or well-known marks of others--which can lead to \nconsumer confusion or downright fraud--the Congress should tread \ncarefully to ensure that any remedies do not impede or stifle the free \nflow of information on the Internet.\n\n\n     the patent fee integrity and innovation protection act of 1999\n\n  We are introducing today the Patent Fee Integrity and Innovation \nProtection Act to reauthorize the Patent and Trademark Office for \nfiscal year 2000, on terms that ensure the fees collected from users \nwill be used to operate the Patent and Trademark Office and not \ndiverted to other uses.\n  The PTO is fully funded and operated through the payment of \napplication and user fees. Indeed, taxpayer support for the operations \nof the PTO was eliminated in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1990, which imposed a large fee increase (referred to as a \n``surcharge'') on those who use the PTO, namely businesses and \ninventors applying for or seeking to protect patents on trademarks.\n  The fees accumulated from the surcharge were held in a surcharge \naccount, for use by the PTO to support the patent and trademark \nsystems. Unfortunately, however, the funds in the surcharge account \nwere also diverted to fund other, unrelated government programs. By \nfiscal year 1997, almost $54 million from the surcharge account was \ndiverted from PTO operations.\n  Last year, Congress responded to this diversion of PTO fees by \nenacting H.R. 3723/S. 507, which the Chairman and I had introduced on \nMarch 20, 1997. That legislation authorized a schedule of fees to fund \nthe PTO, but no other government program, and resulted in the first \ndecrease in patent application fees in at least 50 years.\n  This PTO reauthorization bill would make $116,000,000 available to \nthe Patent and Trademark Office, a self-sustaining agency, to pay for \nsalaries and necessary expenses in FY 2000. This money reflects the \namount in carryover funds from FY99 that PTO expects to receive from \nfees collected, pursuant to the Patent Act and the Trademark Act. By \nauthorizing the money to go to PTO, the bill would avoid diversion of \nthese fees to other government agencies and programs. Inventors and the \nbusiness community who rely on the patent and trademark systems do not \nwant the fees they pay to be diverted but would rather see this money \nspent on PTO upgraded equipment, additional examiners and expert \npersonnel or other items to make the systems more efficient. I agree.\n\n\n                copyright act technical corrections act\n\n  In the last Congress, Senator Hatch and I worked together for passage \nof the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the Sonny Bono \nCopyright Term Extension Act. This significant legislation is intended \nto encourage copyright owners to make their works available online by \nupdating the copyright laws with additional protections for digital \nworks, and conforming copyright terms available to American authors to \nthose available overseas. We are now introducing legislation that will \nmake certain technical corrections to those bills.\n  Specifically, this bill (1) renumbers the section number for the \nliability\n\n[[Page S7456]]\n\nlimits for online service providers; (2) renumbers paragraphs in the \nsection on ``ephemeral recordings'' which are used solely for \ntransmitting or archiving a performance or audiovisual display; (3) \nclarifies that the Commissioner of Patents is to be paid at level III \nof the executive schedule rather than level V, consistent with a \nprovision in the DMCA; and (4) changes from one to two years the time \nfor seeking design protection after a design is made public by the \ndesigner or, in other words, forfeits protection if an application for \nregistration is not made within 2 years of the design being made \npublic.\n  I remain hopeful that as this bills moves forward we can also address \nanother item inadvertently omitted from the DMCA. Specifically, to \ninclude public broadcasting entities in the liability limitation \nprovisions granted under the DMCA to nonprofit libraries, archives and \neducational institutions.\n  The House of Representatives passed its version of this legislation, \nH.R. 1189, on April 13, 1999, and I urge prompt Senate action on this \nHatch-Leahy bill.\n\n\n the digital theft deterrence and copyright damages improvement act of \n                                  1999\n\n  I have long been concerned about reducing the levels of software \npiracy in this country and around the world. The theft of digital \ncopyrighted works and, in particular, of software results in lost jobs \nto American workers, lost taxes to Federal and State governments, and \nlost revenue to American companies. A report released last week by the \nBusiness Software Alliance estimates that worldwide theft of \ncopyrighted software in 1998 amounted to nearly $11 billion. According \nto the report, if this ``pirated software has instead been legally \npurchased, the industry would have been able to employ 32,700 more \npeople. In 2008, if software piracy remains at its current rate, 52,700 \njobs will be lost in the core software industry.'' This theft also \nreflects losses of $991 million in tax revenue in the United States.\n  These statistics about the harm done to our economy by the theft of \ncopyrighted software alone, prompted me to introduce the ``Criminal \nCopyright Improvement Act'' in both the 104th and 105th Congresses, and \nwork over those two Congresses for passage of this legislation, which \nwas finally enacted as the ``No Electronic Theft Act.'' The current \nrates of software piracy show that we need to do better to combat this \ntheft, both with enforcement of our current copyright laws and with \nstrengthened copyright laws to deter potential infringes.\n  I am, therefore, pleased to join Senator Hatch in introducing the \nDigital Theft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement Act. The \nbill would amend the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 504(c), by \nincreasing the amounts of statutory damages recoverable for copyright \ninfringements. These amounts were last increased in 1988 when the \nUnited States acceded to the Berne Convention. Specifically, the bill \nwould increase the cap on statutory damages by 50 percent, raising the \nminimum from $500 to $750 and raising the maximum from $20,000 to \n$30,000. In addition, the bill would raise from $100,000 to $150,000 \nthe amount of statutory damages for willful infringements.\n  Courts determining the amount of statutory damages in any given case \nwould have discretion to impose damages within these statutory ranges \nat just and appropriate levels, depending on the harm caused, ill-\ngotten profits obtained and the gravity of the offense. The bill \npreserves provisions of the current law allowing the court to reduce \nthe award of statutory damages to as little as $200 in cases of \ninnocent infringement and requiring the court to remit damages in \ncertain cases involving nonprofit educational institutions, libraries, \narchives, or public broadcasting entities.\n  In addition, the bill would create a new tier of statutory damages \nallowing a court to award damages in the amount of $250,000 per \ninfringed work where the infringement is part of a willful and repeated \npattern of practice of infringement.\n  I note that the House version of this legislation, H.R. 1761, omits \nany scienter requirement for the new proposed enhanced penalty for \ninfringers who engage in a repeated pattern of infringement. I share \nthe concerns raised by the Copyright Office that this provision, absent \na willfulness scienter requirement, would permit imposition of the \nenhanced penalty even against person who negligently, albeit \nrepeatedly, engaged in acts of infringement. The Hatch-Leahy bill \navoids casting such a wide net, which could chill legitimate fair uses \nof copyrighted works.\n\n\n                  the trademark amendments act of 1999\n\n  Finally, I am pleased to join Senator Hatch in introducing the \nTrademark Amendments Act to enhance protection for trademark owners and \nconsumers by making it possible to prevent trademark dilution before it \noccurs, by clarifying the remedies available under the Federal \ntrademark dilution statute when it does occur, by providing recourse \nagainst the Federal Government for its infringement of others' \ntrademarks, and by creating greater certainty and uniformity in the \narea of trade dress protection.\n  Current law provides for injunctive relief after an identical or \nsimilar mark has been in use and has caused actual dilution of a famous \nmark, but provides no means to oppose an application for a mark or to \ncancel a registered mark that will result in dilution of the holder's \nfamous mark. In Babson Bros. Co. v. Surge Power Corp., 39 USPQ 2d. 1953 \n(TTAB 1996), the Trademark Trial and Appeals Board (TTAB) held that it \nwas not authorized by the ``Federal Trademark Dilution Act'' to \nconsider dilution as grounds for opposition or cancellation of a \nregistration. The bill remedies this situation by authorizing the TTAB \nto consider dilution as grounds for refusal to register a mark or for \ncancellation of a registered mark. This would permit the trademark \nowner to oppose registration or to petition for cancellation of a \ndiluting mark, and thereby prevent needless harm to the goodwill and \ndistinctiveness of many trademarks and make enforcing the Federal \ndilution statute less costly and time consuming for all involved.\n  Second, the bill clarifies the trademark remedies available in \ndilution cases, including injunctive relief, defendant's profits, \ndamages, costs, and, in exceptional cases, reasonable attorney fees, \nand the destruction of articles containing the diluting mark.\n  Third, the bill amends the Lanham Act to allow for private citizens \nand corporate entities to sue the Federal Government for trademark \ninfringement and dilution. Currently, the Federal Government may not be \nsued for trademark infringement, even though the Federal Government \ncompetes in some areas with private business and may sue others for \ninfringement. This bill will level the playing field, and make the \nFederal Government subject to suit for trademark infringement and \ndilution on the same terms and conditions as States under the Lanham \nAct.\n  Fourth, the bill provides a limited amendment to the Lanham Act to \nprovide that in an action for trade dress infringement, where the \nmatter sought to be protected is not registered with the PTO, the \nplaintiff has the burden of proving that the trade dress is not \nfunctional. This will help promote fair competition and provide an \nincentive for registration.\n  Finally, this bill makes a number of technical ``clean-up'' \namendments relating to the Trademark Law Treaty Implementation Act, \nwhich was enacted at the end of the last Congress.\n  These bills represent a good start on the work before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to update American intellectual property law to \nensure that it serves to advance and protect American interests both \nhere and abroad. I began this statement, however, with the list of \ncopyright, patent and trademark issues that we should also address. We \nhave a lot more work to do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 1261. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement for \nemployment in the coastwise trade for the vessel Yankee; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n         certificate of documentation for the vessel ``yankee''\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nwaive the 1920 Merchant Marine Act, commonly known as the Jones Act, to \nallow Yankee Sailing, LLC to operate the 1959 Holland-built vessel \nYANKEE.\n  Yankee Sailing LLC is a family-owned business based out of New \nLondon, Connecticut that intends to provide 2-4 hour day sails out of \nthe New\n\n[[Page S7457]]\n\nLondon and Mystic areas in the summer months. In an effort to provide \nyear-round sailing opportunities, Yankee Sailing LLC also hopes to \noffer 1-2 week sail training trips along the coast in the fall and \nwinter. The YANKEE is equipped to carry 25-35 daytime passengers and 8-\n10 overnight passengers, and does not pose any threat to larger U.S. \nshipping interests.\n  The YANKEE is a vessel of considerable historical significance having \nbeen designed by and built for one of New England's most famous \ncontemporary sailors, the late Irving Johnson. The YANKEE shares a \nwell-established relationship with the Mystic Seaport Museum where the \nJohnson Collection is housed, and it was also the centerpiece for an \nIrving Johnson reunion held at the Seaport this past October.\n  The owners request the waiver because while the vessel was originally \ndocumented in the United States with a home port of Mystic, CT, it was \nbuilt in Holland and is, therefore, excluded from coastal trade by the \nJones Act. The owners were aware of the Jones Act's restrictions, \nhowever, they were unclear as to its applicability with regard to a \nvessel's size. Their understanding was that the act only pertained to \nvessels 65 feet in length or greater carrying over six passengers. \nYankee Sailing LLC hoped to operate with six passengers to generate \nrevenue until they could receive full certification allowing for larger \nsailing trips. Due to this confusion regarding the law, Yankee Sailing \nLLC is unable to provide these small sailing trips and suffers \nfinancially as a consequence.\n  Yankee Sailing LLC wishes to provide residents of southeastern \nConnecticut the opportunity to experience the excitement of sailing and \ndid not willfully violate the Jones Act. The presence of its services \nwill help stimulate the local economy and tourism in a region \nattempting to promote an economic renaissance.\n  Based upon all of the combined facts, I believe a waiver should be \ngranted for the YANKEE. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1261\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CERTIFICATE OF DOCUMENTATION.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 \n     (46 U.S.C. App. 883), section 8 of the Act of June 19, 1886 \n     (24 Stat. 81, chapter 421; 46 U.S.C. App. 289), and sections \n     12106 and 12108 of title 46, United States Code, the \n     Secretary of Transportation may issue a certificate of \n     documentation with appropriate endorsement for employment in \n     the coastwise trade for the vessel YANKEE, United States \n     official number 1076210.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Reid, and Mrs. \n        Murray):\n  S. 1262. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to provide up-to-date school library medial resources and well-\ntrained, professionally certified school library media specialists for \nelementary schools and secondary schools, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7457-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7457-S7466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA RESOURCES, TRAINING, \n                      AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY ACT\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nsupport and strengthen America's school libraries.\n  The school library plays a vital role in the education of students. \nIt is where reading skills are reinforced; the laboratory where ideas \ntaught in class are explored and tested; the arena in which children \nexplore new ideas and learn on their own; and a vital bridge to the \nremarkable and growing resources of the information age.\n  Research shows that well-equipped and well-staffed school libraries \nare essential to promoting learning and achievement. Indeed, a 1992 \nstudy found that students in schools with well-equipped libraries and \nprofessional library media specialists perform better on achievement \ntests for reading comprehension and basic research skills.\n  This finding was echoed in a 1994 U.S. Department of Education report \non the impact of school library media centers which noted that the \nhighest achieving students tend to come from schools with strong \nlibraries and library programs.\n  And, a 1993 review of research studies concluded that free voluntary \nreading is the foundation for good grammar, writing, and reading \ncomprehension abilities. For the average American student, the school \nlibrary is the single most available source of reading material.\n  Mr. President, with our ever-changing global economy, access to \ninformation and the skills to use it are vital to ensuring that young \nAmericans are competitive and informed citizens of the world. That is \nwhy the school library is so important in supplementing what is learned \nin the classroom; promoting better learning, including reading, \nresearch, library use, and electronic database skills; and providing \nthe foundation for independent learning that allows students to achieve \nthroughout their educational careers and their lives.\n  While the promise of a well-equipped school library is limitless, and \nits importance greater than ever, the condition of libraries today does \nnot live up to that potential. As Linda Wood, a school library media \nspecialist from South Kingstown High School in Rhode Island, recently \nnoted during a Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \nhearing, school library collections are outdated and sparse. Indeed, \nschools across the nation are dependent on collections purchased in the \nmid-1960s under the original Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  As a result, many books in our school libraries predate the landing \nof manned spacecraft on the moon, the breakup of the Soviet Union, the \nend of Apartheid, the growth of the Internet, and advances in DNA \nresearch. In a rapidly changing world, our students are placed at a \nmajor disadvantage if the only scientific, historical, and geographical \nmaterials they have access to reflect times long gone by.\n  In sum, school library funding is grossly inadequate to the task of \nimproving and supplementing collections. Library spending per student \ntoday is a small fraction of the cost of a new book. Indeed, while the \naverage school library book costs $16, the average spending per student \nfor books is $6.73 in elementary schools; $7.30 in middle schools; and \n$6.27 in high schools.\n  Consequently, many outdated books that should be removed from shelves \ncannot be, since there is no money to replace them. One case in point \nis California which in response to its fourth-graders being ranked \nsecond to last among 39 states on last year's National Assessment of \nEducational Progress has begun an effort to restock school library \nshelves in order to weed out old and inaccurate books, including those \nrife with racial stereotypes and those which proclaim ``one day, man \nmight go to the moon''. For a long time, according to a recent Los \nAngeles Times article, California school librarians could not afford to \ntake such a step because there would be no books left on the shelves. \nToo few states, however, are taking similar steps to improve school \nlibraries.\n  My home state of Rhode Island is working on an innovative effort to \nensure that students gain access to materials not available in their \nown school libraries. RILINK (the Rhode Island Library Information \nNetwork for Kids) gives students and teachers 24-hour Internet access \nto a statewide catalog of school library holdings, complete with \ninformation about the book's status on the shelf. RILINK also allows \nfor on-line request of materials via interlibrary loan, with rapid \ndelivery through a statewide courier system, and provides links from \nbook information records to related Internet research sites, allowing a \nsingle book request to serve as a point of departure for a galaxy of \ninformation sources.\n  Unfortunately, such innovations, which could benefit schoolchildren \nacross the nation, cannot be expanded without adequate library funding. \nIndeed, the only federal funding that is currently available to school \nlibraries is the Title VI block grant, which allows expenditure for \nschool library and\n\n[[Page S7458]]\n\ninstructional materials as one of seven choices for local uses of \nfunds. This program is slated for elimination under the \nAdministration's fiscal year 2000 budget and Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act reauthorization proposal.\n  Mr. President, well-trained school library media specialists are also \nessential to helping students unlock their potential. These individuals \nare at the heart of guiding students in their work, providing research \ntraining, maintaining and developing collections, and ensuring that a \nlibrary fulfills its potential. In addition, they have the skills to \nguide students in the use of the broad variety of advanced \ntechnological education resources now available.\n  Unfortunately, only 68% of schools have state certified library media \nspecialists, according to Department of Education figures, and, on \naverage, there is only one specialist for every 591 students. This \nshortage means that many school libraries are staffed by volunteers and \nare open only a few days a week.\n  Mr. President, the bipartisan bill I am introducing today, along with \nSenators Cochran, Sarbanes, Wellstone, Kennedy, Daschle, Reid, and \nMurray, would restore the funding that is critical to improving school \nlibraries. The Elementary And Secondary School Library Media Resources, \nTraining, And Advanced Technology Act directs funding to schools with \nthe greatest need and would ensure that students have access to the \ninformational tools they need to learn and achieve at the highest \nlevels by providing funds to update library media resources, such as \nbooks and advanced technology, train school library media specialists, \nfacilitate resource-sharing among school libraries, and improve \ncollaboration between school library media specialists and teachers.\n  The bill also establishes the School Library Access Program to \nprovide students with access to school libraries during non-school \nhours, including before and after school, weekends, and summers.\n  Providing access to the most up-to-date school library collections is \nan essential part of increasing student achievement, improving literacy \nskills, fostering a love of reading, and helping students become \nlifelong learners. The Elementary and Secondary School Library Media \nResources, Training, and Advanced Technology Act, which is strongly \nsupported by the American Library Association, will help accomplish \nthese essential goals. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important \nlegislation and work for its inclusion in the upcoming reauthorization \nof the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation and a letter of support written by the American Library \nAssociation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1262\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Elementary and Secondary \n     School Library Media Resources, Training, and Advanced \n     Technology Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to improve academic achievement of students by \n     providing students with increased access to up-to-date school \n     library materials, a well-equipped, technologically advanced \n     school library media center, and well-trained, professionally \n     certified school library media specialists;\n       (2) to support the acquisition of up-to-date school library \n     media resources for the use of students, school library media \n     specialists, and teachers in elementary schools and secondary \n     schools;\n       (3) to provide school library media specialists with the \n     tools and training opportunities necessary for the \n     specialists to facilitate the development and enhancement of \n     the information literacy, information retrieval, and critical \n     thinking skills of students; and\n       (4)(A) to ensure the effective coordination of resources \n     for library, technology, and professional development \n     activities for elementary schools and secondary schools; and\n       (B) to ensure collaboration between school library media \n     specialists, and elementary school and secondary school \n     teachers and administrators, in developing curriculum-based \n     instructional activities for students so that school library \n     media specialists are partners in the learning process of \n     students.\n\n     SEC. 3. SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA RESOURCES.\n\n       Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 (20 U.S.C. 6801 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n\n   ``PART F--ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA RESOURCES\n\n                  ``Subpart 1--Library Media Resources\n\n     ``SEC. 3701.

This bill would \n     provide assistance to the nation's school libraries and \n     school library media specialists at a time when they are \n     laboring mightily to cope with the challenges of increasing \n     school enrollment, new technology and the lack of funding for \n     school library resources.\n       As a school librarian myself in Juneau, Alaska, I know \n     personally how this legislation will contribute to effective \n     learning by our school children. Many of the nation's school \n     libraries have collections that are old, inaccurate and out \n     of date. How can we encourage children to read and continue \n     to be life-long learners if the material we have available \n     for them is inadequate?\n       Your legislation proposes to upgrade collections, encourage \n     and train school librarians, effect greater cooperation \n     between school professionals directly involved in teaching \n     children--school library media specialists, teachers and \n     administrators, and encourages the sharing of resources \n     electronically. This critical legislation should be included \n     in the reauthorization process now going forward in the \n     Senate. The school children of today deserve the best \n     resources we have to give them.\n       On behalf of the 57,000 school, public, academic and \n     special librarians, library trustees, friends of libraries \n     and library supporters, I thank you for your efforts to \n     improve the resources in school libraries. We offer the \n     support of our members in working towards passage of the \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Ann K.

A bill to amend the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to limit the \nreductions in medicare payments under the prospective payment system \nfor hospital outpatient department services; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n              hospital outpatient preservation act of 1999\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am introducing today, with Senators \nHatch and Gorton, the Hospital Outpatient Preservation Act of 1999.\n\n  The Congress passed landmark legislation in 1997, the Balanced Budget \nAct. The BBA has played an important role in ensuring the integrity of \nthe Medicare program, but our good intentions to rein in costs went too \nfar, too fast in some areas. In fact, I fear that our zeal may result \nin decreased access to care and lower quality of care for Medicare \nbeneficiaries if we do not act to soften the impact of BBA \nimplementation on health care providers.\n  I am particularly concerned about the consequences of payment cuts \nunder BBA for Vermont's hospitals and health systems. Norman Wright, \nPresident of the Vermont Hospital and Health Systems Association, has \nsaid, ``It is clear that the outpatient prospective payment system \nbeing implemented from Washington poses a real threat to the \ncontinuation of quality services being provided by Vermont hospital \noutpatient departments.''\n  Through the Hospital Outpatient Preservation Act of 1999, we are \nseeking to address concerns about outpatient reimbursement cuts for \nhospitals. The BBA requires the implementation of a prospective payment \nsystem (PPS) for the reimbursement of Medicare hospital outpatient \ndepartment services to control rising costs in that area, as the \nprovision of care has shifted from inpatient to less costly outpatient \nservices. Our proposed legislation would amend BBA '97 by temporarily \nlimiting the reduction in payments under the new outpatient PPS for \noutpatient department services to give hospitals a period to adjust to \nthe reimbursement cuts.\n  Medicare outpatient margins, already negative in 1999, are estimated \nto drop to a negative 28.8 percent if costs increase at a historical \nrate of growth, and to a negative 20.3 percent if costs increase more \nslowly. The Health Care Financing Administration's analysis of its \nproposed rule on the implementation of outpatient PPS found that \naverage reductions in outpatient department services reimbursement for \nall\n\n[[Page S7460]]\n\nhospitals would be 4 percent, but that the reimbursement to low-volume \nhospitals would decline by an average of 17 percent. For example, \nSouthwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington, Vermont, is \nestimated to experience a 16 percent decline in payment. The Chief \nExecutive Officer of Mt. Ascutney Hospital in Ascutney, Vermont, \nstated, ``The new outpatient prospective payment methodology would cut \nour reimbursement to the point that our operating margin would be in \njeopardy. This coming on the heels of other cuts has an additive \nnegative effect.''\n  If vulnerable rural hospitals are not provided a gradual transition \nperiod to reorganize operations, such a large decline in reimbursement \ncould spell financial disaster. Teaching hospitals are also projected \nto sustain a greater than average loss under the new methodology. I am \nconcerned that financial cutbacks of this magnitude could impact the \naccess to care and the quality of care provided to Medicare \nbeneficiaries by hospitals that are already ailing under payment cuts \nfor Medicare inpatient services and from managed organization payment \ncuts.\n  The ``Hospital Outpatient Preservation Act of 1999'' would limit a \nhospital's losses for covered outpatient department services furnished \nprior to and during the first full calendar year of outpatient PPS \nimplementation to 5 percent, so that a hospital would receive no less \nthan 95 percent of what the hospital would have been paid under the \ncurrent reimbursement mechanism. In the second year, the maximum \npayment loss would be 10 percent, and in the third year, 15 percent. \nThere would be no limit after the third year.\n  The BBA went too far, too fast in cutting costs, and now it's time to \nfind the right balance by swinging the pendulum back toward quality. \nThe Hospital Outpatient Preservation Act of 1999 would address one area \nof concern by providing a phased implementation period of three years \nto allow hospitals, particularly the hardest hit rural and major \nteaching hospitals, time to adjust to the cuts in reimbursement. \nThrough such legislation, we can maintain the financial integrity of \nthe Medicare program, while guaranteeing access to high-quality health \ncare services for Medicare beneficiaries.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1264. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 and the National Education Statistics Act of 1994 to ensure \nthat elementary and secondary schools prepare girls to compete in the \n21st century, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                     educating america's girls act\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator Ted \nKennedy, to introduce legislation that will play a critical role in the \nadvancement of education as we prepare for the demands of the 21st \nCentury. Specifically, the ``Educating America's Girls Act of 1999'' \nwill ensure that our nation's children--and young women in particular--\nwill be prepared for the job market of the coming millenium, while also \nensuring that the unique needs of girls are properly addressed in our \nnation's schools and classrooms.\n  Given the critical role of education in preparing our children for \nthe future, it is understandable that there is heightened interest in \nensuring that the highest academic standards and best practices are \nincorporated in our nation's schools and classrooms. As Congress \nundertakes the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act (ESEA) of 1965, the provisions of the ``Educating \nAmerica's Girls Act'' will ensure that the varying educational needs of \nall students, and young girls in particular, are recognized and \naddressed--and ultimately ensure that our efforts to reform and improve \neducation are realized.\n  Mr. President, due to the changes adopted in 1994, gender equity is a \nmajor theme throughout the ESEA. Specifically, the needs of girls are \naddressed in current law by requiring professional development \nactivities to meet the needs of diverse students, including girls; \nencouraging professional development and recruitment activities to \nincrease the numbers of women math and science teachers; including \nsexual harassment and abuse as a focus of the Safe and Drug-Free \nSchools Act; broadening dropout prevention activities to address the \nneeds of pregnant and parenting teens; and reauthorizing the Women's \nEducational Equity Act (WEEA), which funds research and programs to \nachieve educational equity for women.\n  During the ESEA reauthorization process, we should not only work to \nmaintain the important gender equity provisions that were included in \nthe 1994 law, but also to prepare girls for the future by adding the \nfollowing provisions: ensure education technology programs are targeted \nin a manner that addresses the unique needs of all students, including \ngirls; provide schools with resources to combat sexual harassment and \nabuse; collect data on high school athletic participation by girls; \nkeep pregnant and parenting teens in school; and reauthorize WEEA.\n  Accordingly, the ``Educating America's Girls Act'' contains \nprovisions that will address all of these needs, so I urge that my \ncolleagues support this legislation and these additions during the \nupcoming reauthorization of the ESEA.\n  Mr. President, with the growing demand for technological skills in \nthe workplace--including six out of 10 jobs requiring technological \nskills--the need to incorporate technology in the classroom cannot be \nunderstated. Accordingly, the utilization of education technology in \nthe classroom is an arena in which we must ensure that all students, \nincluding girls, are not put at a disadvantage.\n  Of note, a 1998 report by the American Association of University \nWomen, Gender Gaps: Where Our Schools Still Fail Our Children, found \nthat girls, when compared to boys, are at a significant disadvantage as \ntechnology is increasingly incorporated into the classroom. \nSpecifically, girls tend to come to the classroom with less exposure to \ncomputers and other technology, and girls believe that they are less \nadept at using technology than boys. As a result, girls tend to have a \nmore ``circumscribed, limited, and cautious'' interaction with \ntechnology than boys, as highlighted in the report.\n  Schools can assist girls in developing a confident relationship to \ntechnology by integrating digital tools into the curriculum so girls \ncan pursue their own interests. Unfortunately, current law lacks \nassurances that federal education programs will compensate for girls' \ndifferent learning styles and different exposures to technology.\n  Accordingly, provisions in the ``Educating America's Girls Act'' will \nensure that the different learning styles of girls and other students \nwill be taken into consideration when monies are awarded for a variety \nof existing K-12 programs. Furthermore, it also includes the ``High \nTechnology for Girls Act'' (High-Tech Girls), legislation I have \nalready introduced that will ensure young girls are encouraged to \npursue degrees and demanding careers in math, science, engineering, and \ntechnology--fields that are critical in the increasingly \ntechnologically-driven workplace.\n  Mr. President, as we seek to ensure that the unique technological \nneeds of girls are addressed in the classroom, we also cannot ignore \nthat sexual harassment and abuse is another issue of importance as we \nseek to educate our nation's children.\n  While comprehensive research should be done on the pervasiveness of \nsexual harassment in schools--and ``Educating America's Girls Act'' \nwill ensure that such a study is completed--various studies have found \nthat the vast majority of secondary school students experience some \nform of sexual harassment during their school lives.\n  For instance, the AAUW Educational Foundation's 1993 survey of 8th \nthrough 11th grade students on sexual harassment in schools, Hostile \nHallways: The AAUW Survey on Sexual Harassment in America's Schools, \nfound that the vast majority of secondary school students experienced \nsome form of sexual harassment and that girls are disproportionately \naffected.\n  While data on the incidence of sexual harassment is scant, Hostile \nHallways found that 85 percent of girls experienced some form of sexual \nharassment; 65 percent of girls who have been harassed were harassed in \nthe classroom;\n\n[[Page S7461]]\n\nand 73 percent of girls who have been harassed were harassed in the \nhallway of their school; a student's first experience of sexual \nharassment is most likely to occur in the middle school/junior high \nyears of 6th to 9th grade; and 81 percent of girls who have been \nharassed do not report it to adults.\n  A 1996 University of Michigan study showed that sexual harassment can \nresult in academic problems such as paying less attention in class and \nHostile Hallways found that 32 percent of girls do not want to talk as \nmuch in class after experiencing harassment. Furthermore, thirty-three \npercent of girls do not want to go to school at all due to the stress \nand anxiety they suffered as a result of the sexual harassment, and \nnearly one in four girls say that harassment caused them to stay home \nfrom school or cut a class.\n  We know little else about the extent of sexual harassment or even the \nnature and extent of more serious sexual crimes in schools. The Safe \nand Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (SDFSCA) requires the \nNational Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to collect data on \nviolence in elementary and secondary schools in the United States. \nHowever, these reports provide only a very limited picture of sexual \noffenses in schools because they only capture data on rape or sexual \nbattery reported to police. Further, school crime victimization surveys \ndo not include questions on threats or abuse that are sexual in nature.\n  Sexual harassment in schools is illegal, a form of sexual \ndiscrimination banned under Title IX of the Education Amendment of \n1972. Unfortunately, on the 25th anniversary of Title IX, a report by \nthe National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education (NCWGE) found \nthat less progress was made in the area of sexual harassment than in \nany other gender equity issue in education. NCWGE concluded that few \nschools have sexual harassment policies, or effectively enforce them. \nTherefore, in addition to calling for more intensified Office of Civil \nRights enforcement, NCWGE called on schools to adopt comprehensive \npolicies and programs addressing sexual harassment.\n  The reauthorization of the ESEA gives us an opportunity to greatly \nreduce the incidence of sexual harassment by gathering data on these \noften hidden offenses and providing programs to prevent sexual \nharassment and abuse. Accordingly, the ``Educating America's Girls \nAct'' ensures that this data will be compiled and that schools are \nprovided with resources to combat sexual harassment. Of importance, \nbecause the definition of sexual harassment in elementary and secondary \nschools can be contentious, the legislation ensures that local schools \nwill have the sole authority to define the forms of sexual harassment \nthat will be addressed, and the sole authority to determine the types \nof programs that will be undertaken to address it.\n  Mr. President, equal access to education for girls also means equal \naccess to opportunities for athletic participation in our schools, \nparticularly our high schools. Unfortunately, nationwide data measuring \nthe participation of girls in physical education and high school \nathletics programs is very limited.\n  Participation in high school athletic programs is important for girls \nbecause research has shown that it improves girls' physical and mental \nhealth. For instance, a study by the President's Council on Physical \nFitness and Sports recently found that girls playing sports have better \nphysical and emotional health than those who do not. The study also \nfound that higher rates of athletic participation were associated with \nlower rates of sexual activity and pregnancy. Other studies link \nphysical activity to lower rates of heart disease, breast cancer, and \nosteoporosis in later life. Sports build girls' confidence, sense of \nphysical empowerment, and social recognition within the school and \ncommunity.\n\n  In addition, many girls who participate in high school athletics \nprograms receive college scholarships. Therefore, by participating in \nhigh school athletics programs, girls increase their chances at \nreceiving a college scholarship--which may be the only way that some \nyoung women will be able to pursue a higher education.\n  Because of the lack of data on girls' participation in physical \neducation and athletics during grades K-12, the ``Educating America's \nGirls Act'' will ensure that this data is collected and reported. \nUltimately, this assembling of information will allow us to determine \nif girls are fully participating in these activities, and if further \nsteps should be taken to increase their involvement.\n  Mr. President, education is ultimately the means for all girls, \nincluding pregnant and parenting teens, to achieve economic self-\nsufficiency. Yet despite our strides to make education accessible to \ngirls, dropping out of school remains a serious problem that should be \naddressed in the reauthorization of the ESEA.\n  Five out of every 100 young adults enrolled in high school in 1996 \nleft school without successfully completing a high school program. In \nOctober of 1997, 3.6 million young adults, or 11 percent of young \nadults between the ages of 16 and 24 in the United States, were neither \nenrolled in a high school program nor had they completed high school. \nOf note, girls who drop out are less likely than boys to return and \ncomplete school.\n  Twenty-five years after the enactment of Title IX, pregnancy and \nparenting are still the most commonly cited reasons why girls drop out \nof school, and the United States has the highest teen pregnancy rate of \nany industrialized nation. In fact, almost one million teenagers become \npregnant each year and 80 percent of these pregnancies are unintended.\n  Pregnancy and parenting account for half the female dropout rate and \none fourth of the dropout rate for all students. Two-thirds of girls \nwho give birth before age 18 will not complete high school, and the \nyounger the adolescent is when she becomes pregnant, the more likely it \nis that she will not complete high school.\n  The last reauthorization of ESEA broadened the dropout prevention \nprogram to address the needs of pregnant and parenting teens. Because \nthis problem remains so pervasive, the ``Educating America's Girls \nAct'' contains provisions to strengthen the ESEA's support for programs \nthat keep pregnant and parenting teens in school, including the \nutilization of mentoring programs.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the Women's Educational Equity Act (WEEA) \nrepresents the federal commitment to helping schools eradicate sex \ndiscrimination from their programs and practices and to ensuring that \ngirls' future choices and success are determined not by their gender, \nbut by their own interests, aspirations, and abilities. Since the \nprogram's inception in 1974, the WEEA has funded research, development, \nand dissemination of curricular materials; training programs; guidance \nand testing activities; and other projects to combat inequitable \neducational practices.\n  Because of the important role that the WEEA has played in addressing \nsex discrimination over the past 25 years, the ``Educating America's \nGirls Act'' reauthorizes the WEEA so that it can continue to address \nthe needs of women for many years to come.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that the reauthorization of the \nESEA provides us with a unique opportunity to address the numerous \nneeds of our nation's students as we prepare for the 21st Century. I \nbelieve that the provisions of the ``Educating America's Girls Act'' \nwill address a variety of these needs--and the unique needs of girls in \nparticular--and urge that my colleagues support this legislation \naccordingly during the months ahead.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in recent decades, the nation's schools \nhave made great progress in ensuring that young girls receive an \nequitable education. Gender gaps in math and science performance have \nnarrowed. More girls are taking algebra, geometry, pre-calculus, \ntrigonometry, and calculus than ever before. More girls are taking \nhonors and advanced placement level courses in calculus and chemistry.\n  Schools are making progress in other areas as well. More and more \nschools are instituting programs to address the problems of sexual \nharassment and abuse. Increasing numbers of girls are participating in \nhigh school athletics and receiving college athletic scholarships.\n  While these improvements are commendable, they are not enough. \nContinued progress is necessary. The Educating America's Girls Act \naddresses\n\n[[Page S7462]]\n\nsome of the most pressing issues in educational equity: access to \ntechnology, school safety, high school athletics, and dropout rates.\n  Technology education is particularly important for all students, but \ngirls' needs are particularly acute. While gaps between boys and girls \nin math and science are narrowing, the gender gap in technology is \ngrowing.\n  Girls tend to come to the classroom with less exposure to computers \nand other technology than boys. Girls often believe that they are less \nadept at using technology than boys are. They tend to be more cautious \nthan boys in the ways that they interact with technology.\n  Girls are also dramatically under-represented in advanced computer \nscience courses, making them less eligible than boys for high wage, \nhigh-tech jobs. The fact that girls are less likely than boys to take \nadvanced computer science courses actually helps perpetuate a cycle of \ndisadvantage in educational technology. Because fewer girls will have \nthe skills to enter high-tech fields, fewer women will be developers of \neducational software and fewer role models will be available for young \ngirls.\n  For girls to have equal access to the growing job market in the \ncomputer field, immediate steps must be taken to close the technology \ngap between boys and girls. The Educating America's Girls Act addresses \nproblems with girls' access to technology by providing professional \ndevelopment to assist teachers in dealing more effectively with the \ntechnology needs of girls. It gives local and state governments and \nprivate and pubic schools and institutions of higher education the \nopportunity to meet their needs in their applications for federal \ngrants. Finally, the Act states that the Title III provisions \nauthorizing support for development of education technology must give \nspecial consideration to programs incorporating the technology learning \nneeds of girls.\n  School safety is another concern for America's girls. Recent studies \nreveal that 85 percent of girls have experienced some form of sexual \nharassment. Sixty-five percent of girls who have been harassed were \nharassed in the classroom, and 73 percent were harassed in school \nhallways. Eighty-one percent of girls who have been harassed do not \nreport the harassment to an adult. Thirty-three percent of girls report \nnot wanting to go to school because of anxiety and stress caused by \nharassment. Nearly one quarter of girls report staying home from school \nor cutting classes because of harassment.\n  These numbers are clearly unacceptable. It is imperative that our \nschools do a better job of recognizing and eradicating sexual \nharassment in schools. As the recent Supreme Court ruling in Davis v. \nMonroe County Board of Education makes clear, school districts may now \nbe sued for damages if they fail to respond to student sexual \nharassment of other students.\n  The Educating America's Girl's Act provides $10 million for district \nlevel programs to train teachers and administrators in identifying and \npreventing sexual harassment. In addition, the Act makes high rates of \nsexual harassment in schools a consideration in determining the \ndistribution of state grants for violence prevention programs. It also \nrequires that sexual harassment and abuse prevention be among the \nactivities included in a school's comprehensive drug and violence \nprogram. Finally, the Act requires the National Center for Educational \nStatistics to collect data on sexual harassment and abuse in schools as \na means of identifying and addressing the problem more effectively.\n  The Act supports girls' participation in high school athletics. Since \nthe passage of Title IX over a quarter century ago, increasing numbers \nof girls are participating in organized sports, although boys continue \nto participate at higher rates.\n  Studies show that girls who do so are emotionally and physically \nhealthier than girls who do not. Involvement in sports can also lead to \nhigher self-esteem and confidence, more positive attitudes toward \nschool, an improved sense of physical well-being, social recognition in \nthe school and community, and a reduction in destructive behavior.\n  In addition, higher rates of athletic participation for girls are \nassociated with lower rates of sexual activity and pregnancy. Girls who \nparticipate in sports are also less likely to drop out of school and \nless likely to smoke cigarettes. Girls who engage in physical activity \nin high school are less likely to suffer from heart disease, breast \ncancer, and osteoporosis in late life.\n  Participation in sports also has a positive effect on students' \nacademic performance. Students involved in sports and other \nextracurricular activities perform better on assessments in reading and \nmathematics. In addition, for many girls, high school athletic \nopportunities translate into college scholarships.\n  Although there is ample evidence that physical activity and athletics \nare beneficial to girls, they are less physically active and less \ninvolved in high school athletics than boys are. In order to determine \nin what ways girls are affected by athletic participation, it is vital \nthat accurate data on girls' participation in physical education and \nhigh school athletics be collected and made available. Unfortunately, \ncurrent nationwide data is limited, making it difficult to determine \nprogress toward equity in athletics, as required by Title IX. The Act \nhelps ensure that girls' interests are being met by requiring data \ncollection on the participation of high school students, by gender, in \nphysical education and athletics.\n  The Act also addresses concerns about the dropout rate among pregnant \nteenagers. Almost one million girls in America become pregnant each \nyear, and 80 percent of these pregnancies are unintended. Education is \nthe means for all girls, including pregnant and parenting teens, to \nachieve economic success. Yet girls who become pregnant as teenagers \nare most likely to drop out of school, jeopardizing not only their own \neconomic security but that of their children as well. The younger a \ngirl is when she becomes pregnant, the more likely she is to drop out. \nTwo-thirds of girls who become pregnant before age 18 will not complete \nschool. Girls who drop out of school are less likely to return than \nboys. While teenage pregnancy rates have declined in recent years, they \nare still too high and a reason for grave concern.\n  The Act focuses on the needs of pregnant and parenting teens by \nsupporting mentoring and support programs that encourage girls who are \npregnant or have children to stay in school.\n  It is also important that the Women's Educational Equity Act be \nreauthorized. WEEA stands for the federal commitment to help schools \neradicate sex discrimination and ensure that girls' futures are not \nlimited by their gender, but are determined by their interests, \naspirations, and abilities. Since its enactment in 1974, it has \nprovided critical support in combating inequitable educational \npractices.\n  It provides resources for teachers, administrators, and parents \nseeking proven methods to ensure equity in schools and communities. It \nprovides materials and tools to help schools comply with Title IX. It \nprovides research and model programs to back up Title IX's promise to \nstudents of a non-discriminatory education.\n  It helps girls become confident, educated, and self-sufficient women \nthrough projects to prevent teen pregnancy; to keep girls in school; to \nguide them toward careers in math, science, and technology; and to \nprovide them with mentors. It has funded over 700 programs since 1974, \nincluding programs on math and science education and careers, sexual \nharassment, gender-biased teaching practices, and women's history.\n  The Educating America's Girls Act will continue all this vital work \non behalf of girls and young women by reauthorizing the Women's \nEducational Equity Act.\n  Significant strides have been made in securing more equitable \neducation for the nation's young women and girls, but we cannot afford \nto be complacent. We must keep moving forward to guarantee that girls \nare full participants in the economic and social development of our \ncountry. Measures to assure gender equity in education are a key means \nof accomplishing this goal. Passage of the Educating America's Girls \nAct is a vital next step for increasing gender equity in education.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Gregg, Mr. \n        Coverdell, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Helms, and Mr. \n        Voinovich):\n\n[[Page S7463]]\n\n  S. 1266. A bill to allow a State to combine certain funds to improve \nthe academic achievement of all its students; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                          the straight a's act\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Academic \nAchievement for All Act. As a parent and grandparent I know that there \nis no more important issue than our children's education. Education \nunlocks the door to a lifetime of learning; prepares us to participate \nin our democracy; helps our children lead productive, independent lives \nand ensures that our country is economically competitive. Education is \na vital issue before the Senate as we consider the reauthorization of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act--the heart of Washington \nD.C.'s role in K-12 education.\n  Over the last several years I have talked with countless teachers, \nprincipals, parents, and school board members about our educational \nsystem. I consistently hear that Washington, D.C. interferes with local \nefforts to help students achieve high standards. I hear about \nbureaucratic hurdles, reams of paperwork and one-size-fits-all \nprograms. Based on that input, Congressman Goodling and I have written \na bill that will refocus federal education programs on children and \nlearning instead of process and paperwork. It is based on a fundamental \ntrust that parents, teachers, local educators and states will make the \nbest decisions regarding our children's education, rather than \nbureaucrats 3,000 miles away in Washington, DC. Its only common sense.\n  For too long Washington's programs have been driven by an obsession \nto comply with rules and regulations. In our state, 50 percent of all \nthe paperwork an educator deals with is the result of federal programs. \nYet the average school district receives only six percent of its budget \nfrom the federal government. On a nationwide basis, federal paperwork \neats up 48 million people hours per year. That's 25,000 employees \nworking full time on paper, not on helping our students learn. Is our \neducators' time spent filling out forms or teaching children how to \nread?\n  Former Secretary of Education Bill Bennett put it succinctly in a \nrecent statement: ``. . . our students have fallen further and further \nbehind students in other countries. American 12th graders now rank 19th \nout of 21 nation in mathematics achievement; 16th of 21 in science; \n15th out of 16 in advanced math; and 16th out of 16 nations in advanced \nphysics. And this competition does not include Singapore, Korea, Japan \nand Hong Kong--which is rather like finishing last in a professional \nhockey league that does not include Canadians.''\n  The good news is that we have before us an opportunity to restructure \nthe way the federal government interacts with states and local \ncommunities in terms of education policy. We must not continue to \nsupport a system that has stifled creativity in states and local \ncommunities--the very place real education reform happens.\n  While freedom and flexibility are important, our schools should also \nbe accountable for results--not to Washington, DC but to the standards \neach state and community has been working on to ensure its students are \nprepared for the 21st Century. We can't forget that our schools are \nultimately accountable to the voters in each community who elect the \nlocal school boards and the parents who send their children to our \nschools.\n  My proposal, the Straight A's Act, will give parents, educators, \nschool districts and states more decision-making authority over the way \nin which federal education funding is used. It means our children's \nteachers will spend less time filling out paperwork and more time in \nclassrooms. And, equally important, it means that more federal \neducation dollars will find their way into our children's schools, \nwhere they belong. Right now, as little as 65 cents of every dollar the \nnation's taxpayers invest in education makes it into the classroom.\n  Straight A's relies on a simple formula: \nFreedom+Accountability=Results. States would have the option of \nsubmitting a proposal to the Secretary of Education that would set \nspecific, measurable performance goals to be reached in five years. \nStates would be allowed maximum flexibility with the use of most of \ntheir Federal K-12 formula program funds for state education priorities \nand programs in exchange for being held accountable for meeting the \ngoals set in their proposal. This would allow States the freedom to \naddress more effectively the needs of students in their state. \nAlternatively, states would be free to continue to administer Federal \neducation programs the old way. Straight A's does not eliminate any \nprogram--it's the state's choice to chose its approach.\n  What this means for states and school districts is that they can use \nfederal funds for any initiative that improves performance of students \nin their state. Those states that choose to participate can focus more \nfunds on disadvantaged students, increase efforts to improve teacher \nquality, reduce class size or even hook up all their classes to the \nInternet. The one string is that these efforts must increase the \nachievement of all students--including the lowest performing students--\nover the course of five years.\n  If states do not substantially meet those goals, they would lose \ntheir flexibility and revert to the categorical, regulated approach \nunder current law. If states do well and significantly reduce \nachievement gaps between high and low performing students, they may be \nrewarded with additional funds.\n  Finally, it should also be noted that participating states and school \ndistricts would not lose any Title I funding. If Title I, Part A is \nincluded by a state, each school district in that state would be \nassured of receiving at least as much money as they received in the \nfiscal year preceding the year of the agreements enactment.\n  This proposal will allow educators to do what they do best--teach \nkids. We should focus on students learning and achieving, not process \nand paperwork.\n  My colleagues should also know that I did not develop this concept in \na vacuum. As I mentioned earlier over the course of the past few years \nI have heard from literally hundreds of parents and educators about the \nchallenges they face trying to provide the best possible education for \ntheir children. In particular, during the last congressional recess \nperiod I traveled to several schools around Washington state and had a \nchance to talk to many educators about my legislation. They've since \nresponded with enthusiastic support for my proposal--I'd like to share \nsome of their comments with you now:\n\n       We need more control at the local level not more rules and \n     regulations from the federal government.--Dennis Birr, \n     President of the Association of Washington School Principals.\n       Senator Gorton's Straight A's proposal is well-conceived \n     with great flexibility for states and districts. It would \n     help to focus federal resources where they are most needed.--\n     Janet Barry, Issaquah Superintendent and 1996 National \n     Superintendent of the Year.\n       I believe that the choice is very clear. Would I trade the \n     present government restrictions and stifling paperwork for \n     flexibility and higher accountability? The answer is \n     absolutely yes!--Dr. Richard Semler, Superintendent of the \n     Richland School District.\n       The Straight A's Act would release a tremendous amount of \n     badly needed education dollars and give school districts the \n     flexibility they desperately need.--State Senator Don Benton \n     (R-17th) and State Representative Marc Boldt (R-17th).\n\n  I believe so strongly in the fundamental principal that local people \nmake the best decisions about our children's education that each week \nI've come to the Senate floor to recognize individuals, schools, and \neducational programs in Washington state that demonstrate innovation \nand excellence in education.\n  My first award went to the Tukwila School District which had its \nethnic diversity grow by more than 1,000 percent in the last seven \nyears. I had the opportunity to visit this district earlier this year, \nand I found that 20% of the district's students are enrolled in \nbilingual education, and all told, they speak about 30 different \nlanguages. To meet the challenge of integrating this immigrant \npopulation into the school system and the community, the Tukwila School \nDistrict, the City of Tukwila, and the local Rotary Club created ``New \nFriends & Families''--a program designed to engage these hard-to-reach \nimmigrant and refugee students and their families to make them aware of \ncommunity services and to encourage\n\n[[Page S7464]]\n\nparental involvement in their children's education. It is programs like \n``New Friends & Families'' that illustrate the local innovation and \nlocal partnerships working to ensure all of their students achieve.\n  I also had the pleasure over this last break to stop by Chris \nLuther's 3rd grade class at Beachwood Elementary School. This class did \nnot miss a spelling word on their weekly spelling tests for the entire \nschool year. This is a classroom of average kids, all with different \nbackgrounds and abilities. Yet, Mr. Luther has found a way to encourage \nand tutor these students so they are all accomplishing equally \npraiseworthy work. The key has not been some magical formula rather, \nthe success of these students comes from a concerted effort by Mr. \nLuther to boost their self-esteem, to enhance their memory skills, and \nto impress upon every child in the classroom that learning is \nimportant. Those strategies combined with the individual effort of each \nof his students has clearly paid off. Those students may not remember \nhow to spell each of the words they learned this year, but they will \nremember their third grade teacher for the rest of their lives.\n  Then there's Karen Mikolasy, Washington state's teacher of the year, \nwho has taught for 28 years at Shorecrest High School with passion for \nher students and for her work. She emphasizes consistency and \nstandards. In Mrs. Mikolasy's class homework is handed in on time and \npapers are rewritten until each student earns at least a B. That \nconsistency in expectations also carries over to consistent positive \nreinforcement to her students--she tells them daily that it is a \nprivilege to be their teacher. She says that in 28 years, not one day \nhas gone by which she hasn't wanted to be in the classroom with her \nstudents. She was also recently recognized as the Washington State \nTeacher of the Year. In the few minutes I met with her, I understood \nwhy she won this honor. Her passion and commitment to educating and \ninspiring young people was clear.\n  I hope these examples clearly illustrate why it is important that we \nreturn to our states and local communities the right to set priorities \nthat reflect the unique needs of their students and allow more \ndistricts to have the ability to innovate like the Tukwila School \nDistrict, and more teachers to spend more time with their students and \nhopefully emulate the examples set by Chris Luther and Karen Mikolasy.\n  In each of the last two years the Senate has voted to send more money \nto our classrooms, but the President has threatened a veto. I will try \nagain this year. I'm going to keep fighting for a shift from programs \nfocused on procedures and paperwork to a system that puts student \nlearning and academic achievement first--a system that lets those \nclosest to our children--their parents, teachers, and principals and \nschool board members decide what's best for our children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1266\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Academic Achievement for All \n     Act (Straight A's Act)''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to create options for States and \n     communities--\n       (1) to improve the academic achievement of all students, \n     and to focus the resources of the Federal Government upon \n     such achievement;\n       (2) to give States and communities maximum freedom in \n     determining how to boost academic achievement and implement \n     education reforms;\n       (3) to hold States and communities accountable for boosting \n     the academic achievement of all students, especially \n     disadvantaged children; and\n       (4) to narrow achievement gaps between the lowest and \n     highest performing groups of students so that no child is \n     left behind.\n\n     SEC. 3. PERFORMANCE AGREEMENT.\n\n       (a) Program Authorized.--A State may, at its option, \n     execute a performance agreement with the Secretary under \n     which the provisions of law described in section 4(a) shall \n     not apply to such State except as otherwise provided in this \n     Act.\n       (b) Approval of Performance Agreement.--A performance \n     agreement submitted to the Secretary under this section shall \n     be approved by the Secretary unless the Secretary makes a \n     written determination, within 60 days after receiving the \n     performance agreement, that the performance agreement is in \n     violation of the provisions of this Act.\n       (c) Terms of Performance Agreement.--Each performance \n     agreement executed pursuant to this Act shall include the \n     following provisions:\n       (1) Term.--A statement that the term of the performance \n     agreement shall be 5 years.\n       (2) Application of program requirements.--A statement that \n     no program requirements of any program included by the State \n     in the performance agreement shall apply, except as otherwise \n     provided in this Act.\n       (3) List.--A list provided by the State of the programs \n     that it wishes to include in the performance agreement.\n       (4) Use of funds to improve student achievement.--Include a \n     5-year plan describing how the State intends to combine and \n     use the funds from programs included in the performance \n     agreement to advance the education priorities of the State, \n     improve student achievement, and narrow achievement gaps \n     between students.\n       (5) Accountability system requirements.--If a State \n     includes part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 in its performance agreement, the State \n     shall include a certification that the State has the \n     following:\n       (A)(i) developed and implemented the challenging State \n     content standards, challenging State student performance \n     standards, and aligned assessments described in section \n     1111(b) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965, and for which local educational agencies in the State \n     are producing the individual school performance profiles \n     required by section 1116(a)(3) of such Act; or\n       (ii) developed and implemented a system to measure the \n     degree of change from 1 school year to the next in student \n     performance on such assessments;\n       (B) established a system under which assessment information \n     is disaggregated by race, ethnicity, sex, English proficiency \n     status, and socioeconomic status for the State, each local \n     educational agency, and each school, except that such \n     disaggregation shall not be required in cases in which the \n     number of students in any such group is insufficient to yield \n     statistically reliable information or would reveal the \n     identity of an individual student;\n       (C) established specific, measurable, numerical performance \n     objectives for student achievement, including--\n       (i) a definition of performance considered to be \n     satisfactory by the State on the assessment instruments \n     described under subparagraphs (A) and (B) with performance \n     objectives established for all students and for specific \n     student groups, including groups for which data is \n     disaggregated under subparagraph (B); and\n       (ii) the objective of improving the performance of all \n     groups and narrowing gaps in performance between those \n     groups; and\n       (D) developed and implemented a statewide system for \n     holding its local educational agencies and schools \n     accountable for student performance that includes--\n       (i) a procedure for identifying local educational agencies \n     and schools in need of improvement;\n       (ii) assisting and building capacity in local educational \n     agencies and schools identified as in need of improvement to \n     improve teaching and learning;

PRESERVATION OF THE START TREATY VERIFICATION \n                   REGIME.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Paragraph 6 of Article XI of the START Treaty states \n     the following: ``Each Party shall have the right to conduct \n     reentry vehicle inspections of deployed ICBMs and SLBMs to \n     confirm that such ballistic missiles contain no more reentry \n     vehicles than the number of warheads attributed to them.''.\n       (2) Paragraph 1 of Section IX of the Inspections Protocol \n     to the START Treaty states that each Party ``shall have the \n     right to conduct a total of ten reentry vehicle inspections \n     each year''.\n       (3) Paragraph 4 of Section XVIII of the Inspections \n     Protocol to the START Treaty states that the Parties ``shall, \n     when possible, clarify ambiguities regarding factual \n     information contained in the inspection report'' that each \n     inspection team must provide at the end of an inspection, \n     pursuant to paragraph 1 of Section XVIII of that Protocol.\n       (4) Paragraph 12 of Annex 3 to the Inspections Protocol to \n     the START Treaty states that, once a missile has been \n     selected and prepared for reentry vehicle inspection, the \n     inspectors shall be given ``a clear, unobstructed view of the \n     front section [of the missile], to ascertain that the front \n     section contains no more reentry vehicles than the number of \n     warheads attributed to missiles of that type''.\n       (5) Paragraph 13 of Annex 3 to the Inspections Protocol to \n     the START Treaty states the following: ``If a member of the \n     in-country escort declares that an object contained in the \n     front section is not a reentry vehicle, the inspected Party \n     shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the inspectors that \n     this object is not a reentry vehicle.''.\n       (6) Section II of Annex 8 to the Inspections Protocol to \n     the START Treaty provides that radiation detection equipment \n     may be used during reentry vehicle inspections.\n       (7) Paragraph F.1 of Section VI of Annex 8 to the \n     Inspections Protocol to the START Treaty states the \n     following: ``Radiation detection equipment shall be used to \n     measure nuclear radiation levels in order to demonstrate that \n     objects declared to be non-nuclear are non-nuclear.''.\n       (8) While the use of radiation detection equipment may help \n     to determine whether an object that ``a member of the in-\n     country escort declares..is not a reentry vehicle'' is a \n     reentry vehicle with a nuclear warhead, it cannot help to \n     determine whether that object is a reentry vehicle with a \n     non-nuclear warhead.\n       (9) Article XV of the START Treaty provides for a Joint \n     Compliance and Inspection Commission that shall meet to \n     ``resolve questions relating to compliance with the \n     obligations assumed''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States should assert and, to the maximum \n     extent possible, exercise the right for reentry vehicle \n     inspectors to obtain a clear, unobstructed view of the front \n     section of a deployed SS-18 ICBM selected for reentry vehicle \n     inspection pursuant to paragraph 6 of Article XI of the START \n     Treaty;\n       (2) the United States should assert and, to the maximum \n     extent possible, obtain Russian compliance with the \n     obligation of the host Party, pursuant to paragraph 13 of \n     Annex 3 to the Inspections Protocol to the START Treaty, to \n     demonstrate to the satisfaction of the inspectors that an \n     object which is declared not to be a reentry vehicle is not a \n     reentry vehicle;\n       (3) if a member of the in-country escort declares that an \n     object contained in the front section of a deployed SS-18 \n     ICBM selected for reentry vehicle inspection pursuant to \n     paragraph 6 of Article XI of the START Treaty is not a \n     reentry vehicle, but the inspected Party does not demonstrate \n     to the satisfaction of the inspectors that this object is not \n     a reentry vehicle, the United States inspection team should \n     record this fact in the official inspection report as an \n     ambiguity and the United States should raise this matter in \n     the Joint Compliance and Inspection Commission as a concern \n     relating to compliance of Russia with the obligations assumed \n     under the Treaty;\n       (4) the United States should not agree to any arrangement \n     whereby the use of radiation detection equipment in a reentry \n     vehicle inspection, or a combination of the use of such \n     equipment and Russian assurances regarding SS-18 ICBMs, would \n     suffice to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the inspectors \n     that an object which is declared not to be a reentry vehicle \n     is not a reentry vehicle; and\n       (5) the United States should not agree to any arrangement \n     whereby the use of technical equipment in a reentry vehicle \n     inspection would suffice to demonstrate to the satisfaction \n     of the inspectors that an object which is declared not to be \n     a reentry vehicle is not a reentry vehicle, unless the \n     Director of Central Intelligence, in consultation with the \n     Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy, has determined \n     that such equipment can demonstrate to the satisfaction of \n     the inspectors that an object which is declared\n\n[[Page S7469]]\n\n     not to be a reentry vehicle is not a reentry vehicle.\n       (c) START Treaty Defined.--In this section, the term \n     ``START Treaty'' means the Treaty With the Union of Soviet \n     Socialist Republics on the Reduction and Limitation of \n     Strategic Offensive Arms,

(a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) On May 5, 1999 the Government of Indonesia and Portugal \n     signed an agreement that provides for an August 8, 1999 \n     ballot organized by the United Nations on East Timor's \n     political status;\n       (2) On June 22, 1999 the ballot was rescheduled for August \n     21 or 22 due to concerns that the conditions necessary for a \n     free and fair vote could not be established prior to August \n     8;\n       (3) On January 27, 1999, President Habibie expressed a \n     willingness to consider independence for East Timor if a \n     majority of the East Timorese reject autonomy in the August \n     ballot;\n       (4) Under the May 5th agreement the Government of Indonesia \n     is responsible for ensuring that the August ballot is carried \n     out in a fair and peaceful way in an atmosphere free of \n     intimidation, violence or interference;\n       (5) The inclusion of anti-independence militia members in \n     Indonesian forces responsible for establishing security in \n     East Timor violates the May 5th agreement which states that \n     the absolute neutrality of the military and police is \n     essential for holding a free and fair ballot;\n       (6) The arming of anti-independence militias by members of \n     the Indonesian military for the purpose of sabotaging the \n     August ballot has resulted in hundreds of civilians killed, \n     injured or disappeared in separate attacks by these militias \n     who continue to act without restraint;\n       (7) The United Nations Secretary General has received \n     credible reports of political violence, including \n     intimidation and killing, by armed anti-independence militias \n     against unarmed pro-independence civilians;\n       (8) There have been killings of opponents of independence, \n     including civilians and militia members;\n       (9) The killings in East Timor should be fully investigated \n     and the individuals responsible brought to justice;\n       (10) Access to East Timor by international human rights \n     monitors and humanitarian organizations is limited, and \n     members of the press have been threatened;\n       (11) The presence of members of the United Nations \n     Assistance Mission in East Timor has already resulted in an \n     improved security environment in the East Timorese capital of \n     Dili;\n       (12) A robust international observer mission and police \n     force throughout East Timor is critical to creating a stable \n     and secure environment necessary for a free and fair ballot;\n       (13) The Administration should be commended for its support \n     for the United Nations Assistance Mission in East Timor which \n     will provide monitoring and support for the ballot and \n     include international civilian police, military liaison \n     officers and election monitors;\n       (b) Policy.--(1) The President, Secretary of State, \n     Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (acting through the United States executive directors to \n     international financial institutions) should immediately \n     intensify their efforts to prevail upon the Indonesian \n     Government and military to--\n       (A) disarm and disband anti-independence militias;\n       (B) grant full access to East Timor by international human \n     rights monitors, humanitarian organizations, and the press;\n       (C) allow Timorese who have been living in exile to return \n     to East Timor to participate in the ballot; and\n       (2) the President should submit a report to the Congress \n     not later than 21 days after passage of this Act, containing \n     a description of the Administration's efforts and his \n     assessment of steps taken by the Indonesian Government and \n     military to ensure a stable and secure environment in East \n     Timor, including those steps described in paragraph (1).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       MOYNIHAN AMENDMENT NO. 716\n\n  Mr. HELMS (for Mr. Moynihan) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. \n886, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 12, line 6, strike ``$7,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$5,000,000''.\n       On page 12, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n       (c) Muskie Fellowship Doctoral Graduate Studies for \n     Nationals of the Independent States of the Former Soviet \n     Union.--\n       (1) Allocation of funds.--Of the amounts authorized to be \n     appropriated under subsection (a)(1)(B), not less than \n     $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and not less than $2,000,000 \n     for fiscal year 2001, shall be made available to provide \n     scholarships for doctoral graduate study in the social \n     sciences to nationals of the independent states of the former \n     Soviet Union under the Edmund S.

SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING CHILD LABOR.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The International Labor Organization (in this \n     resolution referred to as the ``ILO'') estimates that at \n     least 250,000,000 children under the age of 15 are working \n     around the world, many of them in dangerous jobs that prevent \n     them from pursuing an education and damage their physical and \n     moral well-being.\n       (2) Children are the most vulnerable element of society and \n     are often abused physically and mentally in the work place.\n       (3) Making children work endangers their education, health, \n     and normal development.\n       (4) UNICEF estimates that by the year 2000, over \n     1,000,000,000 adults will be unable to read or write on even \n     a basic level because they had to work as children and were \n     not educated.\n       (5) Nearly 41 percent of the children in Africa, 22 percent \n     in Asia, and 17 percent in Latin America go to work without \n     ever having seen the inside of a classroom.\n       (6) The President, in his State of the Union address, \n     called abusive child labor ``the most intolerable labor \n     practice of all,'' and called upon other countries to join in \n     the fight against abusive and exploitative child labor.\n       (7) The Department of Labor has conducted 5 detailed \n     studies that document the growing trend of child labor in the \n     global economy, including a study that shows children as \n     young as 4 are making assorted products that are traded in \n     the global marketplace.\n       (8) The prevalence of child labor in many developing \n     countries is rooted in widespread poverty that is \n     attributable to unemployment and underemployment among \n     adults, low living standards, and insufficient education and \n     training opportunities among adult workers and children.\n       (9) The ILO has unanimously reported a new Convention on \n     the Worst Forms of Child Labor.\n       (10) The United States negotiators played a leading role in \n     the negotiations leading up to the successful conclusion of \n     the new ILO Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor.\n       (11) On September 23, 1993, the United States Senate \n     unanimously adopted a resolution stating its opposition to \n     the importation of products made by abusive and exploitative \n     child labor and the exploitation of children for commercial \n     gain.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) abusive and exploitative child labor should not be \n     tolerated anywhere it occurs;\n       (2) ILO member States should be commended for their efforts \n     in negotiating this historic convention;\n       (3) it should be the policy of the United States to \n     continue to work with all foreign nations and international \n     organizations to promote an end to abusive and exploitative \n     child labor; and\n       (4) the Senate looks forward to the prompt submission by \n     the President of the new ILO convention on the worst forms of \n     child labor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       FEINGOLD AMENDMENT NO. 730\n\n  Mr. HELMS (for Mr. Feingold) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. \n886, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the Bill, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) was \n     established to prosecute individuals responsible for genocide \n     and other serious violations of international humanitarian \n     law committed in the territory of Rwanda;\n       (2) A separate tribunal, the International Criminal \n     Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), was created with a \n     similar purpose for crimes committed in the territory of the \n     former Yugoslavia;\n       (3) The acts of genocide and crimes against humanity that \n     have been perpetrated against civilians in the Great Lake \n     region of Africa equal in horror the acts committed in the \n     territory of the former Yugoslavia;\n       (4) The ICTR has succeeded in issuing at least 28 \n     indictments against 48 individuals, and currently has in \n     custody 38 individuals presumed to have led and directed the \n     1994 genocide;\n       (5) The ICTR issued the first conviction ever by an \n     international court for the crime of genocide against Jean-\n     Paul Akayesu, the former mayor of Taba, who was sentenced to \n     life in prison;\n       (6) The mandate of the ICTR is limited to acts committed \n     only during calendar year 1994, yet the mandate of the ICTY \n     covers serious violations of international humanitarian law \n     since 1991 through the present;\n       (7) There has been well substantial allegations of major \n     crimes against humanity and war crimes that have taken place \n     in the Great Lakes region of Africa that fall outside of the \n     current mandate of the Tribunal in terms of either the dates \n     when, or geographical areas where, such crimes took place;\n       (8) The attention accorded the ICTY and the indictments \n     that have been made as a result of the ICTY's broad mandate \n     continue to play an important role in current U.S. policy in \n     the Balkans;\n       The International community must send an unmistakable \n     signal that genocide and other crimes against humanity cannot \n     be committed with impunity;\n       (b) It is the sense of the Congress that,\n       The President should instruct the United States U.N. \n     Representative to advocate to the Security Council to direct \n     the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) to \n     reevaluate the conduct and operation of the ICTR. \n     Particularly, the OIOS should assess the progress made by the \n     Tribunal in implementing the recommendations of the Report of \n     the U.N. Secretary-General on the Activities of the Office of \n     Internal Oversight Services, A/52/784, of 6 February, 1998. \n     The OIOS should also include an evaluation of the potential \n     impact of expanding the original mandate of the ICTR.\n       (c) Report.--90 days after enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary of State shall report to Congress on the \n     effectiveness and progress of the ICTR. The report shall \n     include an assessment of the ICTR's ability to meet its \n     current mandate and an evaluation of the potential impact of \n     expanding that mandate to include crimes committed after \n     calendar year 1994.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                FEINSTEIN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 731\n\n  Mr. HELMS (for Mrs. Feinstein (for herself, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. \nLevin)) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 886, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 115, after line 18, add the following new section:\n\n[[Page S7476]]\n\n     SEC. ____. REPORTING REQUIREMENT ON WORLDWIDE CIRCULATION OF \n                   SMALL ARMS AND LIGHT WEAPONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In numerous regional conflicts, the presence of vast \n     numbers of small arms and light weapons has prolonged and \n     exacerbated conflict and frustrated attempts by the \n     international community to secure lasting peace. The sheer \n     volume of available weaponry has been a major factor in the \n     devastation witnessed in recent conflicts in Angola, \n     Cambodia, Liberia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, \n     Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan, among others, and has contributed \n     to the violence endemic to narcotrafficking in Colombia and \n     Mexico.\n       (2) Increased access by terrorists, guerrilla groups, \n     criminals, and others to small arms and light weapons poses a \n     real threat to United States participants in peacekeeping \n     operations and United States forces based overseas, as well \n     as to United States citizens traveling overseas.\n       (3) In accordance with the reorganization of the Department \n     of State made by the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring \n     Act of 1998, effective March 28, 1999, all functions and \n     authorities of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency were \n     transferred to the Secretary of State. One of the stated \n     goals of that Act is to integrate the Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency into the Department of State ``to give new \n     emphasis to a broad range of efforts to curb proliferation of \n     dangerous weapons and delivery systems''.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \n     the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     containing--\n       (1) an assessment of whether the export of small arms poses \n     any proliferation problems including--\n       (A) estimates of the numbers and sources of licit and \n     illicit small arms and light arms in circulation and their \n     origins;\n       (B) the challenges associated with monitoring small arms; \n     and\n       (C) the political, economic, and security dimensions of \n     this issue, and the threats posed, if any, by these weapons \n     to United States interests, including national security \n     interests;\n       (2) an assessment of whether the export of small arms of \n     the type sold commercially in the United States should be \n     considered a foreign policy or proliferation issue;\n       (3) a description of current Department of State activities \n     to monitor and, to the extent possible ensure adequate \n     control of, both the licit and illicit manufacture, transfer, \n     and proliferation of small arms and light weapons, including \n     efforts to survey and assess this matter with respect to \n     Africa and to survey and assess the scope and scale of the \n     issue, including stockpile security and destruction of excess \n     inventory, in NATO and Partnership for Peace countries;\n       (4) a description of the impact of the reorganization of \n     the Department of State made by the Foreign Affairs Reform \n     and Restructuring Act of 1998 on the transfer of functions \n     relating to monitoring, licensing, analysis, and policy on \n     small arms and light weapons, including--\n       (A) the integration of and the functions relating to small \n     arms and light weapons of the United States Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency with those of the Department of State;\n       (B) the functions of the Bureau of Arms Control, the Bureau \n     of Nonproliferation, the Bureau of Political-Military \n     Affairs, the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law \n     Enforcement, regional bureaus, and any other relevant bureau \n     or office of the Department of State, including the \n     allocation of personnel and funds, as they pertain to small \n     arms and light weapons;\n       (C) the functions of the regional bureaus of the Department \n     of State in providing information and policy coordination in \n     bilateral and multilateral settings on small arms and light \n     weapons;\n       (D) the functions of the Under Secretary of State for Arms \n     Control and International Security pertaining to small arms \n     and light weapons; and\n       (E) the functions of the scientific and policy advisory \n     board on arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament \n     pertaining to small arms and light weapons; and\n       (5) an assessment of whether foreign governments are \n     enforcing their own laws concerning small arms and light \n     weapons import and sale, including commitments under the \n     Inter-American Convention Against the Illicit Manufacturing \n     of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, and \n     Other Related Materials or other relevant international \n     agreements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7476-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n                 committee on rules and administration\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, sadly, on January 24th of this year, \nthe state of Connecticut lost a resident of upstanding character who \nhad dedicated her career to public service. Mary Elizabeth Montague led \nan accomplished life for 87 years and our state owes her many thanks \nfor all of her extraordinary contributions.\n  Born in Middletown, Connecticut, Mary Elizabeth established a \ndistinguished record as a public servant. While in Middletown, she \nworked as a social service investigator for the Family Welfare \nAssociation and went on to become the first woman president of the \nlocal Parent-Teachers Association. She eventually became the PTA's \nstate district director.\n  Mary Elizabeth's diverse accomplishments led to her appointment as a \ncongressional liaison to the Small Business Administration during the \nKennedy Administration.\n  Then, in 1965, she joined Vice President Hubert Humphrey's Capitol \nHill staff handling such issues as cities, the arts, and the economy.\n  Upon leaving Vice President Humphrey's office, Mary Elizabeth \nlaunched her own public relations firm in 1968. She published numerous \neditions of ``A Woman's Guide to Washington, D.C.'' and created and \npublished ``On the Hill,'' a monthly magazine about Capitol Hill that \nwas distributed to all congressional offices.\n  In March of 1998, Mary Elizabeth was presented with the Key to \nNorwalk, Connecticut, her most recent home, for her 30 years of service \nas a communications consultant. This was only one of the 14 different \nkeys she had received from cities and towns around the state. In \naddition, Mary Elizabeth was awarded numerous commendations and \ncitations for her dedicated community service.\n  My Connecticut office shared a relationship with Mary Elizabeth for \nthe past 6 years as she tirelessly continued to better the lives of \nthose around her. Her life and work were committed to serving the \npublic good and are testaments to how one person can touch so many \npeople in a positive way.\n  Mary Elizabeth Montague is survived by her three children, Louis, \nWilliam, and Miriam, four grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter. I \noffer each of them my heartfelt condolences.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record the full text of the eulogy \noffered by Mary Elizabeth's daughter, Miriam. I believe her words have \ntruly captured the remarkable spirit of her mother and the outstanding \nlife that she led.\n  The eulogy follows:\n\n The Passing of a Great Communicator and a Great Contributor to Life--\n                        Mary Elizabeth Montague\n\n       Her life was and is a story, each chapter better than the \n     next. She was the central figure in many lives--a daughter, a \n     mother, an advisor, a friend, teacher, a companion, a \n     politician, a writer and a coordinator of events that \n     surrounded her life and all those she touched. She was a \n     woman ahead of her time managing political campaigns, \n     speaking out for the rights of children, concerned for the \n     people instituted by the system, promoting reading and \n     literacy, all in the 50's when women were supposed to be \n     quiet--she spoke. Never shy to give her opinion or back down \n     from her beliefs, she taught us to be strong, independent, \n     and to think for ourselves.\n       As a single parent, she sacrificed and made choices to \n     improve her children's lives and off to Washington we went. \n     There she continued her political endeavors as an \n     administrator, coordinator, and writer. Along the way, she \n     showed us that richness comes in the quality of life you live \n     and in the people you meet along the way. And, oh, the people \n     we met--Presidents, Congressmen, Congresswomen, Senators, \n     Ambassadors, Governors, key figures in national and \n     international politics, actors and actresses, writers and so \n     many more. But all the while, she showed us that even these \n     people were all the same, some with more power or wealth, but \n     none better than the man next door.\n       Most of all, she wanted us to believe in ourselves--that \n     God gave us talents, personality, wit and a mind to grow and \n     share. She taught us laughter and wit with a twinkle in her \n     eye and laughter in her heart.\n       Mary Elizabeth's story has not ended for she will remain in \n     our hearts, our lives, and our souls forever.\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, just a few short weeks ago, on the \nanniversary of the filing of the government's antitrust suit against \nMicrosoft, I took to the floor of the U.S. Senate to detail the rapidly \nchanging nature of the information technology industry over that \ntwelve-month period of time. I noted that, just one year ago that day, \nAOL and Netscape were two large successful companies. A year later, \nthey were a gigantic conglomerate, teamed with Sun and ready to compete \nin the next frontier of the information technology industry. MCI \nCommunications and WorldCom were two separate companies, as were Excite \nand @Home. Yahoo hadn't yet bought GeoCities and Broadcast.com. AT \nwas a long distance company. A year later, AT could have influence \nover 60% of cable systems in the United States. The stock market had \nrisen dramatically over that year, fueling our unprecedented economic \nboom.\n  What difference a year makes, I said at that time.\n  Now, last week, we were joined by some of the most brilliant and \nvisionary minds in the world as they testified before the Joint \nEconomic Committee High-Technology Summit. Two of the most brilliant, \neven among that gathering, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and \nMicrosoft Chairman Bill Gates, reinforced the notion of an \nextraordinarily dynamic industry, and painted a future promising more \ndramatic change than we have already seen.\n  As the two men who arguably have had more to do with our extended \neconomic expansion than any other in the world--one for his \ncontributions in creating the high-tech boom that has driven the \neconomy, the other for judiciously guiding that economy--we would do \nwell to listen to Mr. Gates and Mr. Greenspan when they offer their \nthoughts about America's next century. I was struck by the similarity \nof their views this week as they testified on the future of the \ninformation-technology industry, the profound benefits it has bestowed \non the U.S. and world economies, and the role government has and should \ncontinue to play in sustaining this dynamic and literally world-\nchanging force.\n  To begin with, both Mr. Gates and Chairman Greenspan point to the \nmomentous changes in the way the world operates as a result of this \nindustry's influence. Its innovations are not confined merely to IT \nproducts, but to the repercussions of how those products are used. \nAccording to Chairman Greenspan, ``innovations in information \ntechnology so-called IT have begun to alter the manner in which we do \nbusiness and create value, often in ways that were not readily \nforeseeable even five years ago. As this century comes to an end, that \ndefining characteristic of the current wave of technology is the role \nof information.''\n  Mr. Gates underscored that sentiment and gave us a glimpse of an even \nmore information-defined vision of the future in which, ``there will be \na proliferation of smart, connected devices, from palm-sized digital \nassistants and tablet personal computers to smart TVS and Web-enabled \ncell phones. All of your files,'' he told us, ``schedule, address book \nand everything else you will need will automatically be available on \neach of these. When you're traveling you'll be able to call up your \nitinerary, book an appointment or view your stock portfolio using the \ndevice you have in hand. It will know the information you need, and \nwhen and where you need it. Wherever you are,\n\n[[Page S7478]]\n\nyou'll be able to access your own digital dashboard--your personal \nportal to your own secure office desktop on any PC.''\n  Where will this information revolution lead us? If the past five \nyears are any indication of the future, it looks bright, indeed.\n  According to Mr. Gates, ``The continuing rapid growth in the Internet \nwill help power this information revolution, just as the proliferation \nof new devices will help make the Internet more useful and accessible \nto everyone. Five years ago. who would have imagined that people would \nnow be shopping for automobiles, home loans, airline tickets or \nclothing on the Web? Electronic commerce has increased tenfold in the \nlast few years, making it convenient for people to purchase almost \nanything, anytime, from anywhere. By 2002, nearly 50 million Americans \nwill be shopping online, spending almost half a trillion dollars on the \nWeb. There is endless speculation about which companies will be \nsuccessful. The big winner will be consumers. They will see better \nprices, more choice, more opportunities to do the things they want to \ndo.''\n  Chairman Greenspan agreed with Mr. Gates' sentiment that consumers \nhave been, and will continue to be, the main beneficiaries of the IT \nrevolution. ``Every new innovation,'' he told us, ``has suggested \nfurther possibilities to profitably meet increasingly sophisticated \nconsumer demands. Many ventures fail. But the few that prosper enhance \nconsumer choice.''\n\n  Both men pointed to the enormous economic benefit that has accrued \nfrom the IT industry's success.\n  ``The unexpectedly strong economic growth this country is \nexperiencing can, in large measure,'' noted Mr. Gates, ``be traced to \nthe vibrant, competitive and fast-growing computer technology industry. \nThis sector has created more new jobs than any other part of the \neconomy. In fact, we can predict today that by the year 2000, the \nsoftware industry's contribution to the U.S. economy will be greater \nthan the contribution of any other manufacturing industry in America, \nan extraordinary achievement for an industry that is less than 30 years \nold.''\n  Chairman Greenspan underscored just how strong that contribution has \nbeen already by stating flatly that, ``An economy that twenty years ago \nseemed to have seen its better days, is displaying a remarkable run of \neconomic growth that appears to have its roots in ongoing advances in \ntechnology. Nor, have the benefits been limited to just our country. \nAll else equal, the enhanced competition in tradable goods enables \nexcess capacity previously bottled up in one country to augment \nworldwide supply and exert restraint on prices in all countries' \nmarkets.''\n  Chairman Greenspan offered a note of caution, though, as it is his \njob to do, and as he has done so brilliantly to our economic benefit in \nthe last few years. ``The rate of growth of productivity cannot \nincrease indefinitely,'' he warned us, adding, ``experience advises \ncaution.''\n  We would do well to heed the Chairman's admonition, Mr. President. \nThe IT industry has indeed been a vibrant enterprise, but as Mr. Gates \naccurately noted, ``the incredible success of this industry in the \nUnited States owes a lot to the light hand of government in the \ntechnology area, the fact that people can take incredible risks and if \nthey're successful they can have incredible rewards.''\n  Mr. President, Alan Greenspan and Bill Gates are precisely correct. \nWe must not take for granted the unprecedented success of this industry \nand the bounty it has conferred upon our country and, indeed, upon the \nrest of the world.\n  The United States government must refrain from yielding to the \ntemptation to pick winners and losers in the marketplace according to \narcane and discredited economic theories that are rooted in ``what if'' \nwishes rather than ``what is'' actualities. The freedom to innovate and \nprovide quality products that will continue to improve lives is only \npossible when government does not dictate how young, vibrant, \nentrepreneurial companies can compete.\n  Again, Chairman Greenspan stated the case lucidly: ``at this stage,'' \nhe told us, ``one lesson seems reasonably clear. As we contemplate the \nappropriate public policies for an economy experiencing rapid \ntechnological advancement, we should strive to maintain the flexibility \nof our labor and capital markets that has spurred the continuous \nreplacement of capital facilities embodying older technologies with \nfacilities reflecting the newest innovations. Further reducing \nregulatory impediments to competition, will, of course, add to this \nprocess. The newer technologies have widened the potential for economic \nwell-being. Governments should seek to foster that potential.''\n  Mr. President, I could not agree more. We should be fostering the \ngrowth of the dynamic Information Technology industry, not engineering \nits deterioration into the bureaucratic morass that is government's \nspecialty.\n  Unfortunately, there are some in the Clinton administration who do \nnot share this view. They short-sightedly seek to impose the heavy hand \nof government on the IT industry to ensure that certain competitors, \nnot consumers, are the ultimate beneficiaries of this economic \nrevolution. Their current project is the break-up of the most dynamic \nand successful company of the last 25 years--perhaps in U.S. history--\nthe Microsoft Corporation.\n  As I pointed out those few weeks ago, in the presence of a company \nexerting real monopoly power, competitors would be stifled, prices \nwould rise, choices would be curtailed, consumers would be harmed. In \nfact, in the last twelve months the real world for consumers has \nimproved by all of these measures. Competition in the technology \nindustry is alive and well and nipping at the heels of Microsoft. \nPrices are down, choices are up, innovation is rampant--all great news \nfor consumers.\n  And, as these two luminaries of the current golden economic firmament \ntold us this week, the free-market conditions that will allow this \ngreat news to continue must prevail: government must keep its hands off \nof this industry.\n  I would ask that copies of both Chairman Greenspan's and Mr. Gates' \ntestimony be printed in their entirety in the Congressional Record. I \nwould urge my colleagues to read and study their remarks, and then to \njoin me in pursuing policies that will ensure that the Gates and \nGreenspan view of a future IT industry be allowed to unfold, unimpeded \nby government's misdirected and deleterious hectoring.\n  The material follows:\n\nPrepared Testimony from Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Board of Governors of \n                   the Federal Reserve--June 14, 1999\n\n       Something special has happened to the American economy in \n     recent years.\n       An economy that twenty years ago seemed to have seen its \n     better days, is displaying a remarkable run of economic \n     growth that appears to have its roots in ongoing advances in \n     technology.\n       I have hypothesized on a number of occasions that the \n     synergies that have developed, especially among the \n     microprocessor, the laser, fiber-optics, and satellite \n     technologies, have dramatically raised the potential rates of \n     return on all types of equipment that embody or utilize these \n     newer technologies. But beyond that, innovations in \n     information technology--so called IT--have begun to alter the \n     manner in which we do business and create value, often in \n     ways that were not readily foreseeable even five years ago. \n     As this century comes to an end, the defining characteristic \n     of the current wave of technology is the role of information. \n     Prior to this IT revolution most of twentieth century \n     business decisionmaking had been hampered by limited \n     information. Owing to the paucity of timely knowledge of \n     customers' needs and of the location of inventories and \n     materials flows throughout complex production systems, \n     businesses required substantial programmed redundancies to \n     function effectively.\n       Doubling up on materials and people was essential as backup \n     to the inevitable misjudgments of the real-time state of play \n     in a company. Decisions were made from information that was \n     hours, days, or even weeks old. Accordingly, production \n     planning required costly inventory safety stocks and backup \n     teams of people to maintain quality control and to respond to \n     the unanticipated and the misjudged. Large remnants of \n     information void, of course, still persist, and forecasts of \n     future events on which all business decisions ultimately \n     depend are still unavoidably uncertain. But the recent years' \n     remarkable surge in the availability of real-time information \n     has enabled business management to remove large swaths of \n     inventory safety stocks and worker redundancies, and has \n     armed firms with detailed data to fine-tune product \n     specifications to most individual customer needs.\n       Moreover, information access in real-time--resulting, for \n     example, from such\n\n[[Page S7479]]\n\n     processes as checkout counter bar code scanning and satellite \n     location of trucks--has fostered marked reductions in \n     delivery lead-times on all sorts of goods, from books to \n     capital equipment. This, in turn, has reduced the relative \n     size of the overall capital structure required to turn out \n     our goods and services.\n       Intermediate production and distribution processes, so \n     essential when information and quality control were poor, are \n     being bypassed and eventually eliminated. The increasing \n     ubiquitousness of Internet web sites is promising to \n     significantly alter the way large parts of our distribution \n     system are managed.\n       The process of innovation goes beyond the factory floor or \n     distribution channels. Design times have fallen dramatically \n     as computer modeling has eliminated the need, for example, \n     of the large staff of architectural specification drafters \n     previously required for building projects. Medical \n     diagnoses are more thorough, accurate, and far faster, \n     with access to heretofore unavailable information. \n     Treatment is accordingly hastened, and hours of procedures \n     eliminated. In addition, the dramatic advances in \n     biotechnology are significantly increasing a broad range \n     of productivity-expanding efforts in areas from \n     agriculture to medicine.\n       Economists endeavor to describe the influence of \n     technological change on activity by matching economic output \n     against measurable economic inputs: quality adjusted labor \n     and all forms of capital. They attribute the fact that \n     economic growth has persistently outpaced the contributions \n     to growth from labor and capital inputs to such things as \n     technological innovation and increased efficiencies of \n     organizations that are made possible through newer \n     technologies. For example, since 1995 output per labor \n     workhour in the nonfarm business sector--our standard measure \n     of productivity--has grown at an annual rate of about 2 \n     percent. Approximately one-third of that expansion appears to \n     be attributable to output growth in excess of the combined \n     growth of inputs.\n       Of course, it often takes time before a specific innovation \n     manifests itself as an increase in measured productivity. \n     Although some new technologies can be implemented quickly and \n     have an immediate payoff, others may take years or even \n     decades before achieving their full influence on productivity \n     as new capital is put in place that can take advantage of \n     these creations and their spillovers. Hence, the productivity \n     growth seen in recent years likely represents the benefits of \n     the ongoing diffusion and implementation of a succession of \n     technological advances; likewise, the innovative \n     breakthroughs of today will continue to bear fruit in the \n     future.\n       The evident acceleration of the process of ``creative \n     destruction,'' which has accompanied these expanding \n     innovations and which has been reflected in the shifting of \n     capital from failing technologies into those technologies at \n     the cutting edge, has been remarkable. Owing to advancing \n     information capabilities and the resulting emergence of more \n     accurate price signals and less costly price discovery, \n     market participants have been able to detect and to respond \n     to finely calibrated nuances in consumer demand. The process \n     of capital reallocation has been assisted through a \n     significant unbundling of risks made possible by the \n     development of innovative financial products, not previously \n     available. Every new innovation has suggested further \n     possibilities to profitably meet increasingly sophisticated \n     consumer demands. Many ventures fail. But the few that \n     prosper enhance consumer choice.\n       The newer technologies, as I indicated earlier, have \n     facilitated a dramatic foreshortening of the lead-times on \n     the delivery of capital equipment over the past decade. When \n     lead times for capital equipment are long, firms must \n     undertake capital spending that is adequate to deal with the \n     plausible range of business needs likely to occur after these \n     goods are delivered and installed. In essence, those capital \n     investments must be sufficient to provide insurance against \n     uncertain future demands. As lead times have declined, a \n     consequence of newer technologies, firms' forecasts of future \n     requirements have become somewhat less clouded, and the \n     desired amount of lead-time insurance in the form of a \n     reserve stock of capital has been reduced.\n       In addition to shortening lead-times, technology has \n     increased the flexibility of capital goods and production \n     processes to meet changes in the demand for product \n     characteristics and the composition of output.\n       This flexibility allows firms to deal more effectively with \n     evolving market conditions with less physical capital than \n     had been necessary in the past.\n       Taken together, reductions in the amount of spare capital \n     and increases in capital flexibility result in a saving of \n     resources that, in the aggregate, is reflected in higher \n     levels of productivity. The newer technologies and \n     foreshortened lead-times have, thus, apparently made capital \n     investment distinctly more profitable, enabling firms to \n     substitute capital for labor and other inputs far more \n     productively than they could have a decade or two ago. \n     Capital, as economists like to say, has deepened \n     significantly since 1995.\n       The surge in investment not only has restrained costs, it \n     has also increased industrial capacity faster than the rise \n     in factory output. The resulting slack in product markets has \n     put greater competitive pressure on businesses to hold down \n     prices.\n       Technology is also damping upward price pressures through \n     its effect on international trade, where technological \n     developments and a move to a less constrained world trading \n     order have progressively broken down barriers to cross-border \n     trade. All else equal, the enhanced competition in tradeable \n     goods enables excess capacity previously bottled up in one \n     country to augment worldwide supply and exert restraint on \n     prices in all countries' markets.\n       Because neither business firms nor their competitors can \n     currently count any longer on a general inflationary tendency \n     to validate decisions to raise their own prices, each company \n     feels compelled to concentrate on efforts to hold down costs. \n     The availability of new technology to each company and its \n     rivals affords both the opportunity and the competitive \n     necessity of taking steps to boost productivity. This \n     contrasts with our experiences through the 1970s and 1980s, \n     when firms apparently found it easier and more profitable to \n     seek relief from rising nominal labor costs through price \n     increases than through cost-reducing capital investments.\n       The rate of growth of productivity cannot increase \n     indefinitely. While there appears to be considerable \n     expectation in the business community, and possibly Wall \n     Street, that the productivity acceleration has not yet \n     peaked, experience advises caution. As I have noted in \n     previous testimony, history is strewn with projections of \n     technology that have fallen wide of the mark. With the \n     innumerable potential permutations and combinations of \n     various synergies, forecasting technology has been a daunting \n     exercise. There is little reason to believe that we are going \n     to be any better at this in the future than in the past. \n     Hence, despite the remarkable progress witnessed to date, we \n     have to be quite modest about our ability to project the \n     future of technology and its implications for productivity \n     growth and for the broader economy.\n       A key question that we need to answer in order to \n     appropriately evaluate the connection between technological \n     innovations and productivity growth is why have not the same \n     available technologies allowed productivity in Europe and \n     Japan to catch up to U.S. levels. While productivity in some \n     foreign industrial countries appears to have accelerated in \n     recent years, a significant gap between U.S. productivity and \n     that abroad persists.\n       One hypothesis is that a necessary condition for \n     information technology to increase output per hour is a \n     willingness to discharge or retrain workers that the newer \n     technologies have rendered redundant. Countries with less \n     flexible labor markets than the United States enjoys may have \n     been inhibited in this regard.\n       Another hypothesis is that regulations, systems of \n     corporate governance, trade restrictions, and government \n     subsidies have prevented competition from being sufficiently \n     keen to induce firms in Europe and Japan to take full \n     advantage of the efficiencies offered by the latest \n     advances in information technology and other innovations.\n       Further investigation will be necessary to evaluate the \n     importance of these possible influences. But at this stage, \n     one lesson seems reasonably clear. As we contemplate the \n     appropriate public policies for an economy experiencing rapid \n     technology advancement, we should strive to maintain the \n     flexibility of our labor and capital markets that has spurred \n     the continuous replacement of capital facilities embodying \n     older technologies with facilities reflecting the newest \n     innovations. Further reducing regulatory impediments to \n     competition, will, of course, add to this process. The newer \n     technologies have widened the potential for economic well-\n     being. Governments should seek to foster that potential.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            Prepared Testimony From Bill Gates of Microsoft\n\n                     (Testimony from June 15, 1999)\n\n       Thank you Mr. Chairman and Members of Congress. It is an \n     honor to be here. Mr. Chairman, I know that we are joined \n     today by a number of students. I'd like to extend my \n     greetings to them--and also to note how different things are \n     today than when I was in school. Today, students have access \n     to powerful personal computing devices and a sea of \n     information through the Internet that I could only dream of \n     when I was a teenager. We truly live in an amazing time. The \n     information age is an era of new possibilities for us, for \n     our children, and for the entire nation.\n       It is the greatest time of innovation and change in \n     history. In less than 25 years we have seen the personal \n     computer evolve from a hobbyists' toy to a tool many \n     Americans can't imagine being without. We have seen its power \n     double every 18 months, its price fall and its importance \n     grow at home, at school and in every office. I know that many \n     of you on this Committee are technology enthusiasts and \n     appreciate this significance of this change.\n       As we learn more about how the information age is affecting \n     us, the more we understand its central role in creating the \n     remarkable new prosperity in this country today, and in \n     accelerating economic development throughout the world. We \n     are creating a new digital economy for this new information \n     age.\n       Mr. Chairman, I know that yesterday Chairman Greenspan \n     appeared before this Committee. Last month, he made a very \n     important observation that I'd like to read\n\n[[Page S7480]]\n\n     very briefly. He said: ``The newest innovations, which we \n     label information technologies, have begun to alter the \n     manner in which we do business and create value, often in \n     ways not readily foreseeable even five years ago . . . The \n     breadth of technological advance and its application has \n     engendered a major upward revaluation of business assets, \n     both real and intangible.''\n       I'd like to reinforce Chairman Greenspan's points by \n     telling you about the findings of a major new study of the \n     digital economy carried out by the Business Software \n     Alliance, an organization representing most of the nation's \n     largest software developers. The study will be released \n     tomorrow, and I will ask that, when it is released, its \n     entire contents be entered into the record of this committee.\n       The results of the BSA study once again confirm that the \n     unexpectedly strong economic growth this country is \n     experiencing can, in large measure, be traced to the vibrant, \n     competitive and fast-growing computer technology industry. \n     This sector has created more new jobs than any other part of \n     the economy. In fact, we can predict today that by the year \n     2000, the software industry's contribution to the U.S. \n     economy will be greater than the contribution of any other \n     manufacturing industry in America--an extraordinary \n     achievement for an industry that is less than 30 years old.\n       Today, America not only sells more cars than Japan. We also \n     lead the world--by a wide margin--in software development. \n     Last year this sector grew more than 15%, and is growing at \n     nearly four times the rate of the economy as a whole. The \n     software industry contributed more than a $13 billion surplus \n     to the U.S. balance of trade, and this will rise to roughly \n     $20 billion next year. A strong technology sector has spurred \n     the renewal of industries old and new across America.\n       Moreover, new technology companies are being created every \n     day, and are generating incredible valuations overnight. The \n     slew of recent mergers reminds us just how quickly the \n     landscape of the high tech marketplace is changing. That \n     change will continue. In this industry in particular, the \n     free market is working, and working well.\n       Mr. Chairman, I believe that in Washington, DC., there is a \n     term for people who are incredibly interested in public \n     policy. They are known as policy wonks. Well, in my industry, \n     these people are called computer geeks, and I'd have to say \n     that I am one. If you will indulge me for a few moments \n     longer, I'd like to share some of my enthusiasm for what \n     technology will mean for us in the future. I am very \n     optimistic about what computer technology will mean for all \n     of us--and for the students who are joining us to day via \n     satellite.\n       As technologies change, so does our mission at Microsoft. \n     For the past 20 years our vision was of a PC on every desktop \n     and in every home--a toll that anyone could use to get things \n     done. And today, a majority of American businesses and more \n     than half of U.S. households have a PC. Now we are moving \n     into a new era. The merging of telecommunications, computer \n     technologies and consumer electronics with the world of the \n     Internet will create a new universe of intelligent PCs and \n     complimentary devices that will deliver the power of the \n     information age to anyone, anywhere, and anytime.\n       What this means is that there will be a proliferation of \n     smart, connected devices, from palm-sized digital assistants \n     and ``tablet' personal computers to smart TVs and Web-enabled \n     cellphones. All of your files, schedule, address book and \n     everything else you need will automatically be available on \n     each of these. When you're traveling you'll be able to call \n     up your itinerary, book an appointment or view your stock \n     portfolio using the device you have in hand. It will know the \n     information you need, and when and where you need it. \n     Wherever you are, you'll be able to access your own ``digital \n     dashboard''--your personal portal to your own secure office \n     desktop--on any PC.\n       We are working hard to develop software that makes \n     computers even easier to use--next year we aim to spend some \n     $3 billion on research and development. And one day in the \n     not too distant future, computers will be able to see, listen \n     and speak. At home or in the office, you'll be able to \n     control your PC by talking to it. It will automatically back \n     up your information, update its own software and synchronize \n     itself with your devices on your home network. You'll even \n     have a notepad on your refrigerator that will be up to date \n     and allow you to coordinate with other information at home, \n     at your office or at your children's school.\n       When Congress is in session, a wireless network will keep \n     you in touch with your office. I don't need to tell the \n     members of this committee how important mobility is as you \n     move between your state or district and the nation's capital. \n     As technology becomes more flexible and more powerful, it can \n     be a tremendous tool in terms of creating efficiency and \n     instant communication.\n       The PC also holds the potential to make government more \n     efficient and more responsive. We already see the beginning \n     of this with government web sites that offer people a wealth \n     of information and resources. As government increasingly \n     incorporates technology into its operations it will make \n     information flow even more open and efficient. At Microsoft, \n     our use of technology has all but eliminated paper flow, and \n     I can tell you from first-hand experience that's a wonderful \n     thing. Technology also offers an opportunity to get the \n     public more involved and, some day, perhaps, to engage people \n     in a two-way dialogue on the important issues and challenges \n     we face. The continuing rapid growth in the Internet will \n     help power this information revolution, just as the \n     proliferation of new devices will help make the Internet more \n     useful and accessible to everyone.\n       Five years ago, who would have imagined that people would \n     now be shopping for automobiles, home loans, airline tickets \n     or clothing on the Web? Electronic commerce has increased \n     tenfold in the last few years, making it convenient for \n     people to purchase almost anything, anytime, from anywhere. \n     By 2002, nearly 50 million Americans will be shopping online, \n     spending almost half a trillion dollars on the Web. There is \n     endless speculation about which companies will be successful. \n     The big winner will be consumers.\n       They will see better prices, more choices, more \n     opportunities to do the things they want to do. As Chairman \n     Greenspan made clear, companies have already seen enormous \n     benefits from computer technology--benefits that are now \n     being multiplied by online commerce. But there is much more \n     to be done. Like helping companies integrate their computing \n     systems and create digital processes to perceive and react to \n     competitive challenges and consumer needs. By doing this, \n     they will be able to extend the gains in productivity that \n     are helping fuel our economic strength today.\n       But turning this vision of the future into a reality will \n     take another important investment in America investment in \n     education. We cannot fill all of the jobs being created if we \n     don't make technology a key part of every child's education.\n       Education in the digital age will offer tremendous promise. \n     Learning will be more student-centered. Teachers, parents and \n     students will work collaboratively, and students will be \n     prepared for a technology workplace with the opportunity to \n     engage in lifelong learning, At Microsoft we call this \n     approach the Connected Learning Community. Taking education \n     into the digital age is a challenge for all of us. Government \n     at all levels, public-private partnerships and philanthropic \n     institutions will play critical roles in preparing today's \n     students for tomorrow's workplace.\n       Only 14% of teachers currently use the Internet as part of \n     their instruction. We need to make much more progress here. \n     At first, people believed that the Internet was suitable only \n     for quizzes or just learning about technology itself. Today, \n     the educational community knows that the Internet can be a \n     resource for allowing curious minds to learn in new ways--\n     about math, physics, philosophy, in fact about anything. A \n     New York school superintendent attending one of educational \n     conferences we hold at Microsoft recently explained that the \n     PC and the Internet are encouraging students to do more \n     writing, more reading and less TV watching. As a result, ``I \n     don't know'' is fast becoming ``I don't know yet.''\n       Exciting projects are underway to give students the latest \n     tools for learning. At Microsoft, we are working on a pilot \n     project at 500 schools to provide laptops to each student. \n     The results to date have been amazing in terms of increased \n     learning. Many other companies and organizations are involved \n     in similar efforts, whether providing the latest technology \n     for learning or providing scholarships for math and science \n     excellence.\n       I've had an opportunity to learn a little about how \n     Birmingham Seaholm High School and Pittsburgh Super Computing \n     Center College are using PC technology. Juniors at Birmingham \n     Seaholm are using computers in a very entrepreneurial \n     fashion--they have built a cookie factory and next year plan \n     to develop a micro robot that will take cookies off the \n     cooling rack. Students in Pittsburgh are doing great work on \n     improving high speed networking performance and capabilities. \n     These schools are to be commended for the work they've done \n     to use technology as an important tool in improving \n     education. I look forward to talking with some of the \n     students who have been working with PCs. Unlike their \n     parents, most of whom learned about computers in adulthood, \n     the information age is the only age these students have \n     known. Their success will depend on how well we teach them.\n       When you look at the phenomenal economic growth produced by \n     technology, and the huge increase in demand for highly \n     skilled knowledge workers, it is clear that our ability to \n     continue benefiting from technology will largely depend on \n     how well we educate the next generation to take advantage of \n     this new era.\n       In closing, let sum up why I'm excited to be here today and \n     to be part of this hi-tech summit. At Microsoft we make \n     software. We make software for a simple reason--we want to \n     provide tools to make people's lives better. At Microsoft \n     we're excited about the future--we're excited about the \n     tremendous economic benefits of our industry, but we're more \n     excited about helping every individual--in business, in \n     schools and in the home--lead more productive lives. Thank \n     you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7480-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7480-S7481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           KATHERINE DUNHAM CELEBRATES HER NINETIETH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my \ncolleagues a story about a most remarkable woman who is celebrating her \nninetieth birthday. Her heroic existence embodies every element of a \ntrue American.\n\n[[Page S7481]]\n\n  Katherine Dunham is a studied anthropologist, a brilliant social \nworker, an inspiring dancer and a historic activist. She started her \nfirst dance school in Chicago in 1931, and later became dance director \nfor the Works Progress Administration's Chicago theater project. In \n1967 she founded a performing arts center for inner-city youths in East \nSt. Louis, Ill.\n  One of her many accomplishments came on the night of January 15, \n1979, when she was presented with the Albert Schweitzer Music Award at \nNew York's Carnegie Hall. The significance of this award was \nunderscored as three generations of Katherine Dunham dancers and \nmusicians offered spectacular renditions of her marvelous work. The \ndance and music roared, peppered with the rich flavor of American dance \nmixed with the anthropological roots of African American heritage.\n  This kind and brave woman forged a path for less fortunate children, \noffering the arts as an outlet to their misfortunes. She gave of \nherself everything and asked little in return. Katherine Dunham was and \nremains a stellar addition to our rich American heritage.\n  I hope you will join me in wishing Ms. Dunham a very happy \nbirthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7481-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  A TRIBUTE TO FORREST ``WOODY'' WEBER\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to you today to pay tribute to \none of Wisconsin's finest educators, Forrest ``Woody'' Weber. Woody \nrecently retired after a distinguished career spanning 36 years. \nFocusing his talents in elementary schools, Woody proved instrumental \nin developing the young lives of his students.\n  Woody served children and their families as a guidance counselor for \n21 consistent years, during which time he specialized in classroom and \nsmall group counseling. One of his most substantial accomplishments \nduring this time was addressing the needs of students with cerebral \npalsy. Since many of these students use ``bliss boards'' to \ncommunicate, Woody developed a unit to be used by other students so \nthey could understand this communication device. This act of kindness \nearned Woody many public accolades, leading up to his 1993 nomination \nfor ``Educator of the Year.''\n  Woody's service and volunteerism permeated every aspect of his long \ncareer. Between organizing an annual slide show for graduating sixth-\ngraders, serving on both the Menasha school board as well as the City \nCouncil, sitting on numerous other community boards, coaching local \nathletics, and volunteering for the Salvation Army, he served his \ncommunity well. Woody's wife, Dale, worries that his new retirement \nwill keep him away from home even more because it will allow him more \ntime to volunteer.\n  Though his daily presence as an educator will be missed, we wish \nWoody all the best in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7481-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ENTRY-EXIT CONTROL SYSTEM AT CANADIAN BORDER\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of \nlegislation to repeal Section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and \nImmigrant Responsibility of 1996, I am pleased that this bill contains \nlanguage to prevent traffic delays at the Canadian border.\n  Section 110, which was scheduled to go into effect on September 30, \n1998, would have required the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n(INS) to document every alien's arrival in and departure from the \nUnited States through an automated entry-exit control system. The \nOmnibus appropriations act for FY1999 included a compromise provision I \ncosponsored to delay Section 110 for 30 months. I stated then that \nSection 110 should not be just delayed, but repealed, because the cost \nof any such entry-exit system would far exceed its benefits. The vote \ntoday replaces the requirements of Section 110 with a feasibility study \nto determine whether any such system could be developed without \nincreasing congestion or border crossing delays.\n  Section 110, if applied to Canadian nationals would place an \nunnecessary burden on the hundreds of thousands of motorists who cross \nthe border daily. In 1996, over 116 million U.S. and Canadian border \ncrossers traveled by land to the United States. Instituting a check for \neach one of these border crossers would create enormous delays at the \n250 points of entry, and would have an especially damaging impact on \nthe businesses, trade, and tourism in Michigan and other northern \nborder states. U.S. trade with Canada, our largest trading partner, \ngenerates approximately $1 billion of commerce and tourism daily. Any \nloss of this revenue would be devastating to my State.\n  This provision to repeal the Section 110 requirements at land border \nand sea ports is vital for Michigan communities and businesses, and I \nam very pleased that the Senate is addressing this important \nissue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7481-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN RECOGNITION OF MR. FRANK M. WADE\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nFrank M. Wade as he celebrates his retirement as the Executive Director \nof the New Jersey State Building and Construction Trades Council. Frank \nhas served in this capacity for the past ten years, and he has a long \nhistory of commitment to labor organizations in the State of New \nJersey. In fact, Frank has been a cornerstone for labor rights in New \nJersey. It is a pleasure for me to be able to honor his \naccomplishments.\n  Since he started as a member of the Iron Workers Local #480 in 1954, \nthrough his election as Executive Director in 1989, Frank has fought \nhard to protect the rights of working men and women in New Jersey. His \ndedication to the New Jersey State Building and Construction Trades \nCouncil, and to labor causes in general, is widely known and admired \nthroughout the State of New Jersey.\n  In addition to his position with the New Jersey Building and \nConstruction Trades Council, Frank has played a very active role in \nstrengthening the political and economic life of New Jersey. He has \nserved on a number of civic organizations including the New Jersey \nSociety for Environmental, Economic Development (NJSEED), the New \nJersey Employment Security Council, and on the Advisory Committee on \nthe Prevailing Wage Act.\n  Frank has never lost sight of the need to serve his community. \nDespite his responsibilities he has still found the time for charitable \ncauses. Deborah Hospital Foundation is just one of the organizations \nthat has benefitted from Frank's involvement.\n  So it gives me great pleasure to recognize a leader of great stature \nin New Jersey's labor community, but also a great friend. Through all \nour years together, fighting for the cause of working men and women, I \nhave always known Frank to stand on principle, loyalty, and hard work. \nWhile he may be leaving this post, I know I can always rely on him to \nhold true to that standard in every endeavor he undertakes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7481-4", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7481-S7482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN RECOGNITION OF DR. LIONEL SWAN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to honor a legendary figure \nin the civil rights movement in Michigan, Dr. Lionel Swan. Dr. Swan \ndied last Wednesday at the age of 93, leaving behind a reputation as an \nextraordinarily effective leader in the struggle for civil rights.\n  Dr. Swan was a living example of the great things that can be \naccomplished when you combine determination, courage and dignity. Dr. \nSwan put himself through college and medical school by working during \nthe day. He often related a story of an incident which strengthened his \nresolve to continue on this hard path to his goal of becoming a doctor. \nOne day, a white man called Dr. Swan ``boy'' and threw a cigarette butt \non a floor he had just finished mopping. Dr. Swan is said to have \nresponded, ``Mister, I want to thank you. I've been debating whether I \nshould leave this job for college and you just convinced me I've got to \ndo it so the next time I see somebody like you, he can't call me boy.''\n  Dr. Swan was able to ignore ugly slights and concentrate on what is \nmost important in life. Dr. Swan went on to graduate from Howard \nUniversity Medical School and practice medicine in Detroit. He was \nelected President of the National Medical Association and the Detroit \nMedical Society, where he led the effort to allow African-American \nphysicians to practice medicine at the former Harper and Grace \nhospitals. Dr. Swan was also a longtime, active\n\n[[Page S7482]]\n\nmember of the NAACP, helping found the Detroit NAACP's Freedom Fund \nDinner which raises money annually for its many worthwhile goals and is \none of the largest gatherings in the country.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Swan was always firm in principle and gentle in \ndemeanor. He let his actions serve as an example to others in the fight \nfor equality and civil rights. I was a great personal fan of his. I \nknow my Senate colleagues join me in honoring Dr. Swan on his life's \nmany outstanding achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7482-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Could I \nask unanimous consent that I be recognized at 9:30 for the purpose of \noffering an amendment; if we could get agreement on that perhaps?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think we would be right back in the \nposition in the morning where we are now on the agriculture \nappropriations bill.

Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader has \nresponded to my unanimous consent request. He and I have been \nconsulting about how to proceed over the last hour. He has indicated to \nme that he is working with a number of his colleagues and with staff to \nattempt to fashion a way with which we might proceed on the Patients' \nBill of Rights. He has indicated they will be continuing those \ndiscussions tonight.\n  In the interest of moving that process along and with some hope that \nwe could reach some agreement, I will withdraw my unanimous consent \nrequest to be recognized. We will be on the bill, and we will certainly \nbe inclined to be as supportive of reaching agreement as we can.

Once that is completed, of course, \nother issues may be considered, but we could consult with both sides of \nthe aisle before we move to the next bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if the majority leader will yield on just \nanother question, today the Summers nomination was reported out of the \nFinance Committee unanimously. There appears to be very strong \nbipartisan support. Is there any intention on the part of the majority \nleader to address that nomination sometime in the near future?\n  Mr. LOTT. The Finance Committee did report it out today. I did vote, \nalong with everybody else, for the nomination. It will be on the \ncalendar tomorrow.\n  I had indicated I assumed that before we went out for the Fourth of \nJuly recess, which is a week from Friday, that would be taken up. It \nvery well could be taken up before then. But we have not gotten it on \nthe calendar, and we have not made a definite determination as to when \nwe will call it up.\n  I assume other nominations will be on the calendar tomorrow from \nother committees, and I hope we have the same approach as we have had \nthis year--including three nominations last week--to move these \nnominations through pretty quickly after reaching the calendar, barring \ncomplications that do sometimes come up, of course.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/22/senate-section/article/S7482-4", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
