Mr. President, I ask that you listen again. I am going to \npick up on the incredible but true story of the Clinton \nadministration's betrayal of national security and the scandalous \ncoverup that continues as we speak. In doing so, I fully realize that \nthe majority of Americans will not believe me. They have continued to \nbelieve our President even after he has demonstrated over and over that \nhe has no regard for the truth.\n  Though you would never realize it by listening to the national media \nor the Clinton spin doctors, the recently released Cox Report has \nrevealed a wealth of information on how the Clinton administration has \nundermined national security to simultaneously pursue its misguided \nforeign policies and self-serving domestic political agendas.\n  On the one hand, there is the mind-boggling story of how the Clinton \nadministration deliberately changed almost 50 years of bipartisan \nsecurity policies--relaxing export restrictions, signing waivers to \nallow technology transfers, ignoring China's violation of arms control \nagreements, and its theft of our nuclear secrets, opening up even more \nnuclear and high technology floodgates to China and others--thus \nharming U.S. national security.\n  On the other hand, there is the continuing coverup--the effort to \nhide from Congress and the American people the true damage that has \nbeen done to national security and the Clinton administration's central \nrole in allowing so much of it to happen on their watch.\n\n[[Page S7484]]\n\n  Over three months ago--on March 15--I spoke on this floor about \nChina's theft of the W-88 nuclear warhead. To remind you, this is the \ncrown jewel of our nuclear arsenal. It is the warhead that has 10 times \nthe explosive power of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima and yet \njust a fraction its size. I spoke about how serious this was to our \nnational security--how it was a story with life and death implications \nfor millions of Americans.\n  I told how President Clinton was directly responsible for downplaying \nthe significance of and covering up this story. While the information \non the W-88 design--the crown jewel of our nuclear arsenal--was stolen \nin the late 1980's, the theft was first discovered in 1995 by this \nadministration. So people remember, it was the Chinese walk-in \ninformant to the CIA that gave us all this information. I told how it \nwas this administration and this President who deliberately covered up \nthis vital information from Congress and the American people and, at \nthe same time, lulled our people into a false sense of security by \nrepeating the lie that there were no nuclear missiles targeted at \nAmerica's children.\n  At that time, I spoke of six proven incontrovertible facts, and let \nme repeat them now:\n  1. President Clinton hosted over 100 campaign fundraisers in the \nWhite House, many with Chinese connections.\n  2. President Clinton used John Huang, Charlie Trie, Johnny Chung, \nJames Riady, and others with strong Chinese ties to raise campaign \nmoney.\n  3. President Clinton signed waivers to allow his top campaign \nfundraiser's aerospace company to transfer U.S. missile guidance \ntechnology to China.\n  4. President Clinton covered up the theft of our most valuable \nnuclear weapons technology.\n  5. President Clinton lied to the American people over 130 times about \nour nation's security while he knew Chinese missiles were aimed at \nAmerican children.\n  6. President Clinton single-handedly stopped the deployment of a \nnational missile defense system, exposing every American life to a \nmissile attack, leaving America with no defense whatsoever against an \nintercontinental ballistic missile.\n  On March 15, I began my speech by asking the American people to \nlisten as I told them ``a story of espionage, conspiracy, deception, \nand cover-up--a story with life and death implications for millions of \nAmericans--a story about national security and a President and an \nadministration that deliberately chose to put national security at \nrisk, while telling the people everything was fine.''\n  In the three months since I made these statements, none has been \nrefuted.\n  Now, I come before you to tell some of the rest of the story that we \nhave learned since March 15. And it is a truly astounding story. We \nthought the W-88 story was bad--and it is. But with the release of the \nCox Report last month, the American people have been presented with \ndocumented evidence that the harm President Clinton has done to U.S. \nnational security is enormously worse than we thought.\n  On March 15, I said that, as damaging as the W-88 breach was, I \nbelieved we had not yet scratched the surface of the national security \nscandal exposed by this one revelation. I must say that I was right--\neven beyond my own worst fears.\n  Let's not be distracted by the self-serving Clinton spin: that \neverybody does it; that it all happened during previous \nadministrations; that this is only about security at the nuclear \nweapons lab; that there is equal blame to go around on all sides; that \nPresident Clinton acted quickly and properly when he found out; and \nthat the only problem is now being fixed.\n  I am here today to tell you that all of this is wrong. The Clinton \nspin is nothing more than a dishonest smokescreen designed to divert \nattention from the real issues. It is also, I believe, an attempt to \ndissuade people from actually reading the Cox Report and discovering \nfor themselves that the Clinton spin is a snare, a delusion, and a lie.\n  This is why I want to take some time to walk through some of the more \nimportant revelations in the Cox Report and to remind my colleagues \nthat we have an obligation to tell the American people the truth--the \ntruth that the media is inexplicably ignoring and that the President \nseems to hope the people will never find out on their own.\n  First, let us begin with a simple fact: Sixteen of the 17 most \nsignificant major technology breaches revealed in the Cox Report were \nfirst discovered after 1994. With the lone exception of the W-70 \ntechnology that was discovered back in the 1970's during the Clinton \nadministration, all the rest of them were discovered since 1994. Again, \nthat is when they had the individual who came into the CIA and exposed \nall of those.\n  Let me repeat--sixteen of the 17 most significant major technology \nbreaches revealed in the Cox Report were first discovered during the \nClinton administration. Those who tell you otherwise are willfully \nlying to you.\n  Second, of the remaining 16 technology breaches, one definitely \noccurred during the Reagan administration--the W-88 Trident D-5. Seven \noccurred sometime before 1995, though it is unclear exactly when. And \neight occurred--without question--during the Clinton administration.\n  Let's take a closer look at these. The seven that occurred before \n1995 included breaches of information on all of the currently deployed \nnuclear warheads in the U.S. intercontinental ballistic missile \narsenal: the W-56 Minuteman II; the W-62 Minuteman III; the W-76 \nTrident C-4; the W-78 Minuteman Mark 12A; and the W-87 Peacekeeper. In \naddition, there was the breach of classified information on reentry \nvehicles, the heat shield that protects warheads as they reenter the \nEarth's atmosphere when delivered by long-range ballistic missiles.\n  Let me repeat that all of these technology breaches were first \ndiscovered in 1995. They were discovered when a Chinese ``walk-in'' \nagent actually approached the CIA at a location outside of China and \nhanded them a secret Chinese government document containing state-of-\nthe-art classified information about the W-88 and the other U.S. \nnuclear warheads. We still don't know why he did this, but he did.\n  The Cox Report also tells us that the Energy Department and FBI \ninvestigations of this matter have focused exclusively on the loss of \nthe W-88, which we know happened around 1988. There have been no \ninvestigations undertaken about the loss of the other warheads, the \ntiming of whose loss cannot be as clearly pinned down.\n  Next, we move to the other eight major technology breaches revealed \nin the Cox Report. All of these were not only first discovered during \nthe Clinton administration, they also happened during the Clinton \nadministration:\n  No. 1, the transfer of the so-called Legacy Codes containing data on \n50 years of U.S. nuclear weapons development including over 1,000 \nnuclear tests;\n  No. 2, the sale and diversion to military purposes of hundreds of \nhigh performance computers enabling China to enhance its development of \nnuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, and advanced military aviation \nequipment;\n  No. 3, the theft of nuclear warhead simulation technology enhancing \nChina's ability to perfect miniature nuclear warheads without actual \ntesting;\n  No. 4, the theft of advanced electromagnetic weapons technology \nuseful in the development of anti-satellite and anti-missile systems;\n  No. 5, the transfer of missile nose cone technology enabling China to \nsubstantially improve the reliability of its intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles;\n  No. 6, the transfer of missile guidance technology (by President \nClinton to China) enabling China to substantially improve the accuracy \nof its ballistic missiles--these same missiles that are targeting U.S. \ncities;\n  No. 7, the theft of space-based radar technology giving China the \nability to detect our previously undetectable submerged submarines; and\n  No. 8, the theft of some other ``classified thermonuclear weapons \ninformation'' which ``the Clinton administration'' (not the Cox \ncommittee) ``has determined . . . cannot be made public.''\n  We used to think China was decades behind us in terms of building a \nmodern advanced nuclear arsenal. Now we learn that, later this year, \nChina is planning to test its new JL-2 long range ICBM, a submarine \nlaunched ballistic missile with MIRV capability--meaning multiple \nindependently targeted warheads on each missile--almost a replica of \nour Trident ICBM.\n\n[[Page S7485]]\n\nThis missile will have a range of over 13,000 kilometers and could \nreach anywhere in the United States from protected Chinese waters.\n  In addition, we know that China has been helping North Korea, among \nothers, with weapons and technology. North Korea is also expected to \ntest its long range Taepo Dong II missile later this year.\n  I am reminded of something that happened last August when I made a \nrequest to sort of see where we were and where North Korea was in terms \nof a threat to the United States.\n  In a letter that I received from General Shelton, who was depending \non our intelligence system for his response, he said it would be at \nleast three years before the North Koreans would have a multiple-stage \nrocket. That was August 24. Seven days later, on August 31, they fired \na multiple-stage rocket.\n  I remind my colleagues we have no defense against either of these \npotential threats, because of the policy decisions of the Clinton \nadministration. Someone very smart back in 1983 determined that we \nwould need a national missile defense system in place by Fiscal Year \n98. We were on track to meet the deadline until 1993 when President \nClinton, through his veto power, stopped this missile defense system.\n  But as the Cox Report points out, nuclear espionage by China is only \none part of the problem. China's efforts to acquire U.S. military \nrelated technology is pervasive. Operating through a maze of government \nand quasi-government entities and front companies, China has \nestablished a technology gathering network of immense proportions.\n  The Congressman from Pennsylvania, Congressman Curt Weldon, has done \nextensive research in putting this together, and other charts to show \nexactly what capacity China has to collect our nuclear secrets.\n  When there is time to look at it, it shows you operational entities \nof the Chinese military in red, the Chinese military entities and those \nin contact involving financial entities in green, and you have the \nChinese military front companies in blue.\n  You can see that this is well thought out. It took many years to put \nit together to make it effective.\n  They are willing and able to trade, bribe, buy, or steal to get U.S. \nadvanced technology--all for the purpose of enhancing their long-term \nmilitary potential. Their success is often determined largely by our \nwillingness to make it easier for them to get what they want.\n  The Cox Report has shed light on the fact that the Clinton \nadministration has actually helped China in its technology acquisition \nefforts or made it easier for them to commit thefts and espionage. You \nknow the truth is always difficult and controversy is difficult. It is \neasier to take polls and tell people what they want to hear. But I have \nto make a decision--who do I love more--this President or America.\n  I find that to be very easy in this case.\n  The following are just some of the things that the Clinton \nadministration has done. And I want to applaud Congressman Weldon for \nhelping to bring many of these things to light.\n  No. 1, in 1993, the Clinton administration removed the color-coded \nsecurity badges that had been used for years at Energy weapons labs \nclaiming they were ``discriminatory''--as if that makes any sense \nwhatsoever. Now just a few weeks ago, in the wake of all these \nrevelations, the Energy Department has reinstated the color-coded \nbadges.\n  But during the time that these thefts took place, they were not able \nto wear these badges.\n  No. 2, in 1993, the Clinton administration put a hold on doing FBI \nbackground checks for lab workers and visitors, an action which helped \nto dramatically increase the number of people going to the labs who \nwould previously have not been allowed to have access.\n  No. 3, in 1995, the Clinton administration took the extraordinary \naction of overturning its own agency's decision to revoke the security \nclearance of an employee found guilty of breaching classified \ninformation. When this happened, it sent a message to employees \nthroughout the Department, that this administration was not serious \nabout countering breaches of classified information.\n  No. 4, the Clinton administration deliberately, and many would say \nrecklessly, declassified massive amounts of nuclear-related information \nin what the Clinton administration touted as a new spirit of openness.\n  No. 5., in the W-88 investigation, the Clinton administration turned \ndown four requests for wiretaps on a suspect who was identified in 1996 \nand allowed to stay in his sensitive job until news reports surfaced in \n1999.\n  No. 6, in 1995, someone at the Department of Energy gave a classified \ndesign diagram of the W-87 nuclear warhead to U.S. News & World Report \nmagazine which printed it in its July 31 issue that year. \nRepresentative Curt Weldon is still trying to get answers about how \nthis leak was investigated and what was determined. He has good reason \nto believe the investigation was quashed because it was going to lead \nstraight to President Clinton's Energy Secretary.\n  No. 7, career whistle-blowers at the Department of Energy who tried \nto warn of serious security breaches--including Notra Trulock, the \nformer Director of Intelligence for the Energy Department, and Ed \nMcCallum, the former Security and Safeguards Chief--were thwarted for \nyears by Clinton political appointees who refused to let them brief \nCongress and others about what they knew. Trulock was demoted but will \nnow get to keep his job. McCallum appears to be on his way to being \nscapegoated and perhaps fired for trying to tell the truth.\n  Members will remember we had extensive hearings. Notra Trulock \ntestified under oath that he thought that the theft of the W-88 was so \nsignificant, he wanted to give it to Congress. He was refused being \nallowed to do that by the then-Acting Secretary of the Energy \nDepartment.\n  No. 8, rejecting advice from his Secretaries of State and Defense, \nPresident Clinton approved switching the licensing authority for \nsatellites and other technology from the State Department to the \nCommerce Department, making it easier for China to acquire U.S. missile \ntechnology.\n  No. 9, President Clinton granted waivers making it easier for U.S. \ncompanies to transfer missile and satellite technology to China during \nthe launching of U.S. satellites on China's rockets.\n  No. 10, in 1994, President Clinton ended COCOM, the Coordinating \nCommittee on Multinational Export Control, the multinational agreement \namong U.S. friends and allies that they would not sell certain high-\ntechnology items to countries like China. When this happened, it opened \nthe commercial floodgates. Ever since, there has been a wild scramble \nfor competition to sell more and more advanced technology to China. As \na result, the proliferation has never been worse than it has been in \nthe last 6 years.\n  No. 11, in a series of decisions throughout his Presidency--and many \nsurrounding the 1996 election--Clinton has consistently relaxed export \nand trade restrictions on various forms of high technology of interest \nto China.\n  Again, I applaud Congressman Weldon who put this chart together. This \ntimeline was not put together because President Clinton took office in \n1993, but that is when all the compromises took place. This timeline \nshows categories including machine tools, telecommunications, \npropulsion. All were compromised, or as we normally say stolen.\n  No. 12, President Clinton has ignored or downplayed numerous Chinese \narms control violations by not imposing sanctions required by law. \nWhile we are selling more and more high tech to China, China is sending \nprohibited military technology to countries such as Pakistan, Iran, \nNorth Korea, Syria, Libya and Egypt.\n  What does the Clinton administration do? They do nothing. What are \nthe motives for all this? Why did the Clinton administration act the \nway it did, with almost total disregard for any traditional concern for \nU.S. national security?\n  The Cox Report did not answer these questions because it was only \nconcerned with the facts of the security breaches themselves, not what \nwas behind it.\n  But FBI Director Louis Freeh did assign one man to look into this. \nHis name was Charles LaBella, who became head of the Justice \nDepartment's China Task Force. He and his investigators\n\n[[Page S7486]]\n\nspend months looking into the connections, trying to connect the dots \nwith campaign contributions, foreign influences and administration \nactions. What he found is laid out in a 100-page memo he prepared for \nJanet Reno. We know this memo argues in favor of the appointment of an \nindependent counsel to carry on the investigation.\n  But the memo itself has reminded secret, even through it has been \nsubpoenaed by Congress. Janet Reno, who rejected its recommendation for \nan independent counsel, has refused to release the memo to the Congress \nor to the public. It is time for that memo to be released.\n  FBI Director Freeh has testified that the public knows only about one \npercent of what the FBI knows about the Chinagate scandal. It is time \nfor the truth to come out. It is time for the public to get some sense \nof the other 99 percent which is contained in the LaBella memo.\n  Mr. President, over the last six years, President Clinton and his \nadministration have shown a pervasive disregard for national security. \nIn both actions and inactions, this President has broken ranks with the \nbipartisan consensus about national security that helped us win the \ncold war.\n  His policies and attitudes-towards export controls, nuclear weapons, \nmilitarily important high technology, and dealing with our adversaries \nin the world--have been strikingly different from those of all of his \npredecessors in the modern era.\n  His administration has acted as if the end of the cold war gave them \ncarte blanche license to open the commercial and technology floodgates \nto countries like china simply because it was good for business, or \ngood for getting campaign contributions, or good for other domestic \npolitical reasons.\n  The traditional concern about national security--about protecting our \nnuclear secrets, about maintaining our military and technological \nsuperiority, about sanctioning those in the world who engaged in \nflagrant and hostile espionage and proliferation--all that went out the \nwindow, replaced by other priorities this President somehow thought \nwere more important.\n  President Clinton claims he has ``redefined'' national security. In \nfact--as the Cox Report conclusively documents--he has ``harmed'' \nnational security. This is the message that every American must \nunderstand.\n  My hope is that we never again have a President who is so \ndisrespectful of, and inattentive to, traditional national security \nconcerns.\n  Yesterday at the joint hearing of the Armed Services, Energy and \nIntelligence Committees, I asked whether or not it would be possible to \nput in place some safeguards so that no future President could ever \nagain so successfully undo the country's national security defenses as \nthis President has. We are working on an answer.\n  Some of us will continue to speak, out--seeing it as our highest duty \nof public service. As I said on March 15--and repeat again here today--\nI only hope America is listening. We have a nation to save.\n  The truth will get out. Winston Churchill said:\n\n       Truth is incontrovertible: Panic may resent it, ignorance \n     may deride it, malice may destroy it, but there it is.\n\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/23/senate-section/article/S7486-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7486-S7489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last evening Senator Daschle was prepared \nto offer an amendment to the agricultural bill that was at the heart of \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. I believe that will be offered shortly on \nbehalf of the Senator from California, Senator Feinstein. We will have \nan opportunity to get into that discussion and debate.\n  I am hopeful, as are others, that we can work out a process and \nprocedure by which we can have a full discussion and debate on this \nissue, and where we can have an orderly way of disposing of various \namendments on the Patients' Bill of Rights. I am, however, somewhat \ndistressed and disturbed by some of the comments I have read this \nmorning on the AP relating to my friend from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, \nthe Republican assistant majority leader.\n  He said he was willing to vote on the issue if the Democrats would \nagree to limit debate, but he said he was worried that Democrats will \npressure some Republicans into supporting amendments that will increase \nthe cost of health care, and therefore the number of Americans without \nany insurance. He also said he was worried the Democrats will force \nvotes that can be misconstrued for political purposes. He would rather \nallow a yes or no on the entire package with only a handful of \namendments.\n  I have more confidence than the assistant majority leader in our \ncolleagues' ability to make discerning decisions about the merit of \nthese various amendments, and that having been elected by the people, \nwe are charged to make judgments on these measures. This is a new \nreason for not bringing legislation to the floor. Apparently, one of \nthe leaders is concerned the members of their party would not be able \nto exercise a balanced and informed judgment in the best interests of \nthe particular States the Senators represent. Of course, if that is \ngoing to continue to be the position of the leadership, it does not \nbode well for a full discussion and debate on this issue.\n\n  We have seen for the last 2 years a policy of delay and denial of the \nability to debate the issues that we referred to yesterday and on other \noccasions, and which we will have an opportunity again to debate today. \nBut it is out of frustration that Senator Daschle has used the unusual \nprocedure of offering this legislation on an appropriations bill, in \nthe hopes we can work out an orderly process or procedure. I certainly \nsupport that process, since we have effectively been closed out from \nany opportunity to debate this issue.\n  It is a simple, fundamental, basic issue: whether decisions relating \nto the health of patients in this country are going to be decided by \nthe health care professionals who have the training and skill and \ncompetency to make those judgments and decisions, or whether the \ndecisions will be made by accountants in the insurance companies or the \nHMOs. That is really the basis of this whole debate and discussion. \nThat is why virtually every leading health care organization, virtually \nevery major professional health organization--the spokesmen and \nspokeswomen for children, for women's health, for the disabled, and for \nthe patients' coalitions--has universally supported our proposal.\n  It is not, certainly, because it says ``Democrat'' on it. These \norganizations support measures on the basis of the merits, whether they \nare proposed by Democrats or Republicans.\n  There is uniformity among the various groups and organizations that \nthe basic, fundamental issue of who decides what is medically necessary \nis really at the heart of the whole debate. It is reflected in \ndifferent ways, as we illustrated in the course of the discussion over \nthe past few days and today, but that is basically what is at the core \nof this proposition.\n  The Democratic leader indicated that if we took up the Republican \nproposal that was passed out of committee on a party-line vote--even \nthough we had more than 20 amendments at that time dealing with the \nsubstance of the issues--we would limit our side to 20 amendments. He \nindicated he would be willing to limit discussion of these various \namendments to a reasonable time period, expecting the opposition would \nhave similar amendments.\n  Frankly, though, if the Republicans have the opportunity to put their \nbill before the Senate, I do not understand why they would need a great \nmany more amendments. They already have their bill. If we had our bill \nbefore the Senate, we would not have to have a great many amendments \nbecause it is our bill. I think we can all understand the logic of \nthat. If we have a particular proposal before us, we ought to be able \nto debate the changes that may be offered from the other side.\n  The other side has the right, their right as the majority, to lay \ntheir bill down. So when we say we need 20 amendments and they say they \nwill need 20 as well, I do not quite follow that. But so be it.\n  I think we will find from the discussions taking place at the \nleadership\n\n[[Page S7487]]\n\nlevel, and I heard the exchanges last evening, I heard from our leader \nhe was prepared to move ahead. He urged there be cooperation by all \nMembers. That certainly would be the case, I know, for those who are \nmost involved in the Patients' Bill of Rights. They would be willing to \nexpedite consideration of various appropriations bills with the \nunderstanding we will have an opportunity to debate this issue in a \nreasonable period of time with a chance to offer amendments.\n  We will hold the Senate accountable to answer the questions that \nparents have about their children and medical care: Will you will be \nable to get specialty care when a child has special needs, or just be \ngiven access to a general pediatrician? Will you get a pediatric \noncologist if the child has cancer? What about access to new \nprescription drugs? Will children and others have access to the \nclinical trials?\n\n  The opposition fails to mention that gap in their program. The most \nthey do about it is to include a study about clinical trials. I think \nmost American families understand the importance of clinical trials in \ntheir family's life experience or their health care. They may not have \nbeen part of a clinical trial themselves--although my family has, my \nson has, and very successfully, I will add. But I doubt if there is a \nfamily that does not have a member of their extended family who has not \nbeen involved in those programs.\n  Patients need to have access to necessary prescription drugs. This is \nso important to many different groups in our society: those challenged \nwith mental illness, those with disabilities or other chronic \nconditions. There are many in our communities who require those \nessential prescriptions drugs. We do not see those guarantees in the \nRepublican plan. There was reference to those: They will get access to \nthose--but at exorbitant prices. They didn't mention that. They said: \nWe'll make sure they have access to those drugs--but the plan can \ncharge exorbitant prices.\n  We will have an opportunity to come back to the issue on prescription \ndrugs, though probably not on this piece of legislation. But there are \nimportant guarantees which we provide in our Patients' Bill of Rights. \nWe will come back to those measures. They are important.\n  I will say a few words now about the subject matter that will be \nincluded in the amendment offered by the Senator from California. It \nwill deal with medical necessity. This is an interesting concept, \nbecause it reaches the heart of this issue, this debate. When consumers \nsign up for health care coverage, they assume, I think--it is not \npresumptuous to assume this--they assume they will be able to get from \ntheir doctors and their health care facilities the best care that the \nmedical profession has to offer. Right? Wrong. Our bill will ensure \nthat the best care is given. Their bill does not.\n  You say: I do not understand that. Let me clarify it. The Republican \nlegislation that was reported out of the Health committee permits the \nHMO to decide what is medically necessary. They let the HMOs decide \nwhat is medically necessary. Then, when you have a certain illness and \nyour doctor believes you should receive X, Y, or Z treatment, but the \nHMO defines ``medical necessity'' in a particular way, your doctor is \nrestricted in the kind of treatment they can give you to whatever it \nsays in the particular contract.\n  I do not think most consumers, when they sign up for health \ninsurance, look into or read the various definitions in those \ncontracts. You have scores of different definitions, each allowing for \nabusive actions that can have devastating effects on the health of \npatients across the country.\n  We have one included in here from a HMO that happens to be in \nMissouri. This is what it says: X company, I will not mention the name \nhere, will have the sole discretion to determine whether care is \nmedically necessary. Here it is--a small provision in the contract that \nan individual may never see.\n  If they came in and said: The doctor says you may very well need to \nhave this kind of treatment.\n  And then the HMO says: Oh, no, they do not need that treatment, it is \ntoo expensive.\n  And the patient says: Why? Is that in my best interests of my best \nhealth?\n  Maybe the doctor will say: Yes.\n  Then the person says to the HMO: My doctor says it is in the best \ninterest of my health to have that treatment.\n  Then the HMO says: Let me tell you something. Our definition of what \nis medically necessary for you is in the sole discretion of our HMO. We \nsay you don't need that treatment. You signed that contract, and that \nis what you are going to get.\n  Then the person says: I appeal. I appeal this. I appeal. I want the \nbest.\n  Under the Republican proposal--listen to this--the HMOs will decide \nwho will listen to that appeal. They will also decide that appeal on \nthe basis of what the contract says. That person gets an appeal, and \nthen it goes to their HMO. The appeal officer looks at this and says: \nHere it is, it is their sole discretion whether care is medically \nnecessary. And that is it; you are out.\n  Then that person says: Maybe I will bring a case. Let's get this out \ninto the courts. This is absolutely outrageous. It is violating the \nbasic, common law of good medical treatment.\n  The patient does not get to the courts. It is nonappealable under the \nRepublican proposal. You are stuck there, your child is stuck there, \nand your wife may be stuck there. A member of your family is stuck \nthere.\n  What does our bill do? It says that plans must use the best evidence \nand practices to determine what is medically necessary. It uses the \nbest up-to-date scientific information or, if that is not available, \nclinical practices.\n  At a hearing in our committee earlier this year, there was some \nquestion about the definition and the use of various words in our \nproposal. We said: You develop the words. We have tried to take those \nwords, which have been recommended by the best practitioners and by the \nmedical associations, and put those in the bill. If the opposition has \nbetter words, we welcome them, we will embrace them, we will include \nthem. Work with us, and we will work with you. Do they understand what \nwe are trying to get at? We want to ensure that any individual who \nsigns up with a plan is going to get what professionals in a particular \nfield believe is in their best interest.\n  I have in my hand 30 definitions of what is medically necessary, \ndepending on the HMO. Why should American citizens play roulette, and \nallow their health care to depend on which HMO they are a member of? \nThat is what is happening.\n  Is this such a revolutionary idea? It is not. This basic concept has \nbeen supported not only by the medical societies, the medical \nassociations, nurses associations, but countless other patient groups \nand others. The only people who oppose it are those who seek to \npreserve the status quo. It is similar to what is used to treat our \nparents and our grandparents under Medicare, and we do not hear any \ncomplaints about it.\n  I ask any Member on the other side to bring in a single letter which \ndemonstrates how that best standard of medically necessary is either \nbeing abused or not effective for those people under Medicare. Bring \nthem in. Shouldn't that be the answer? Mr. President, 39 million \nAmericans are being treated that way. Bring in the examples. I will \ngive my colleagues examples on the other side. Let's debate that issue. \nLet the Senate decide. I will give my colleagues examples.\n  If my colleagues want to take a little time, I will go right through \nthese and let the Senate hear this debate.\n  They may say on the other side: Is that some new idea, some crazy \nDemocratic concept? We know it is being used today to treat our \nparents. They welcome it. It is good and sound.\n  We want to make sure people are protected. That is what we are \nconcerned with. That is why this issue reaches the heart of the whole \ndebate and why the whole question of medical necessity is of such \nimportance.\n  If that is not a core factor, if we do not have the best judgments \nguiding what is medically necessary, and if we do not have the \nassurance this is going to protect the doctor to make that judgment, \nthen this legislation is not worth the paper on which it is written.\n\n  We can name any bill a Patients' Bill of Rights. But if it has a \nmedical necessity definition that is so construed as to deny people \nadequate protection or that and they are able to question the doctor \ngiving the best information on the best medical process and procedure,\n\n[[Page S7488]]\n\nwe are not giving those assurances that the consumers of this country \nneed and deserve, and we will not avoid the human tragedies which we \nhave heard mentioned day after day in the Senate. We hear instance \nafter instance where timely treatment is being denied because doctors \nare not able to practice what is medically necessary.\n  This is the heart of this debate today. I can mention some other \ndefinitions. I see other colleagues in the Chamber who want to address \nthe Senate. I am going to come back and review with the Senate some \nother definitions that have been included in the HMOs and how they have \nworked in ways which have been tragic to the medical profession.\n  I have a definition from another major HMO, one of the largest in the \ncountry. I am not interested in using names, but I will be glad to if \nMembers are questioning this issue. This is their definition in use \ntoday:\n\n       Health care services that are appropriate and consistent \n     with the diagnosis in accordance with accepted medical \n     standards and which are likely to result in demonstrable \n     medical benefit and which are--\n\n  Listen to this--\n\n     the least costly of alternatives.\n\n  There it is, ``least costly of alternatives.'' Not what is in the \nbest interest of the patient, not what can save that person's life, not \nwhat can reduce pain and suffering and offer the best hope and \nopportunity for the future but which is least costly.\n  Here is another HMO. This is the definition of medical necessity in \nanother very prominent HMO:\n\n       . . . the shortest, least expensive or least intensive \n     level of treatment, care or services rendered or supplies \n     provided.\n\n  How many Americans, when they go in to look at their HMOs and sign \nthat contract, say: Look, I have a health insurance proposal. Look what \nit's going to do. It's going to cover me and going to cover my family \nand going to cover my children, and going to cover my wife. This is \nwhat it's going to cost. This is what the drug benefit is.\n  How many are going to look at the fine lines and look into ``medical \nnecessities'' and are going to wonder whether they are using the most \nmodern and comprehensive care for ``medical necessity.'' Virtually none \nof them are going to. That is why we have so many examples of the kinds \nof tragedies that have been mentioned. We will talk about those later \nin the day.\n  I see my friend and colleague from California. We all look forward to \nhearing from her on the amendment she will be proposing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. How much time is remaining for Senator Kennedy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 7 minutes \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Massachusetts has 7 minutes. There are \nthree of us. Will the Senator yield his time to the three of us to \ndivide equally?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield it to the leadership here, Senator Reid, to \nallocate in whatever way he desires.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Chair advise the Senator when he has used 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would be delighted.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the question always arises as to whether we \nhave sufficient time in this body to take care of all the business \nbefore us, especially the appropriations bills, and still have time to \nproperly handle the Patients' Bill of Rights? The obvious answer is \nyes.\n  We have had a number of bills brought before this body this year. We \nhave had, for example, the military bill of rights with 26 amendments, \nthe Education Flexibility Act with 38 amendments, the supplemental \nappropriations bill with 66 amendments, the first budget resolution \nwith 104 amendments, and the budget process reform bill with 11 \namendments. We are asking for 20 amendments. Certainly we have the \nopportunity to do that.\n  I agree with my friend, the Senator from Massachusetts, that we are \ntalking about real people's problems. He has spent a great deal of time \nemphasizing the importance of the access to specialists.\n  I have a letter from a girl from Minden, NV, by the name of Karrie \nCraig. She wrote:\n\n       . . . my mother found out she had cancer [in] November \n     1997. After about two years of going in circles with her \n     primary care physician, she was [finally] admitted to a \n     urologist.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\nExcerpt of a Letter to Senator Reid Dated 1/11/99 From Karrie Craig of \n                               Minden, NV\n\n       . . . my mother found out she had cancer November of 1997. \n     After about two years of going in circles with her primary \n     care physician, she was admitted to a urologist. Her primary \n     care doctor had prevented this visit with a specialist until \n     my mom was very sick. I believe that the HMO company looked \n     down upon specialized doctor visits, as they are more \n     expensive. What my mother found out was she needed an \n     operation for a small growth, left in her bladder from birth. \n     Actually, after surgery they realized she had advanced \n     bladder cancer that only a sooner visit to urologist would \n     have prevented. Within five months my mother died.\n       The only good thing about the HMO services was they \n     provided us with Hospice services the last week and a half of \n     my mom's life. I feel that HMO's policies of primary care \n     physicians and the negative feelings they portray about \n     specialists causes more problems that it solves. In the end, \n     my mother cost the company more money than if she would have \n     been permitted to see a specialist earlier.\n\n  Mr. REID. In short, this letter says that after the 2 years passed, \nit was too late. Had her mother received permission to see a specialist \nearly on, she may still be alive today. By the time she was referred to \nthe specialist, a tumor had developed. It was later determined that she \nhad advanced bladder cancer that a sooner visit to the urologist could \nhave prevented. Her mother died. This is a real-life case that \nillustrates the importance of access to specialty care.\n  I hope the majority will allow us to go to the Patients' Bill of \nRights at the earliest possible date. This is something we need the do.\n  I yield to my friend from Illinois 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada for yielding to me.\n  This debate really gets down to some very fundamental and basic \nquestions about whether, when you go into your doctor's office and \npresent yourself with an illness, you can trust that your doctor is \ngoing to be honest with you, tell you what is best for you or your \nfamily, or whether you have to worry about the fact that there may be \nsome insurance company bureaucrat involved in this decision.\n  When it comes down to these basic life or death situations for a \nmember of a family, there is enough emotional strain on an individual \nin trying to keep their wits about them, trying to keep their family \ntogether; but to think that you not only have to battle those things in \nyour own mind but then, on a daily basis, battle the insurance company \nbureaucrats, that, to me, is the worst part of what we are debating.\n  I want to show you a photograph of a great little boy. He is 11 \nmonths old. His name is Roberto Cortes. He is from Elk Grove Village, \nIL--a cute kid, but a kid who has a serious problem, spinal muscular \natrophy. He is currently on a home ventilator, as you can see in this \nphotograph.\n  That is enough of a strain on any family--to try to make sure this \nlittle fellow has a chance to live a good life. But the sad part of \nthis debate is that the parents of this little boy are self-employed. \nThey have a little business.\n  The Republican Patients' Bill of Rights provides no protection \nwhatsoever to self-employed people. Roberto Cortes and his family would \nnot be protected at all by the Republican version of the Patients' Bill \nof Rights.\n  The Democratic version, supported by over 200 groups, representing \ndoctors and hospitals and consumers and labor and businesses across \nAmerica, would provide protection to the Cortes family. That is how \nbasic this is.\n  When the Republicans tell us: We don't have time to debate this \nissue; we don't have time to debate whether or not you have a fighting \nchance when it comes to your health insurance, they are just wrong.\n  You are going to hear a lot about this issue from Members on the \nDemocratic side. We are not going to quit until we get a chance to have \nthis debate.\n\n[[Page S7489]]\n\n  Since I see my colleague from California is here, and I know she has \nan important contribution to make to this discussion, I yield the floor \nback to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that this side be granted an \nadditional 15 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Acting in my capacity as an individual Senator from the State of \nKansas, I object.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the minority be granted 15 \nminutes of additional time in morning business and the majority be \ngranted 15 minutes additional time in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Acting in my capacity as an individual Senator from the State of \nKansas, I object.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time is left for the Senator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. President, when we return to the bill, it will be my intention to \noffer an amendment to the agriculture appropriations bill. I think that \nmy amendment will deal with one of the most fundamental concerns in \nhealth care today; that is, the restoration to the physician of the \nbasic right of patient care, patient treatment, and to be the \ndeterminator of patient care and the length of hospital stay.\n  I think one of the things we have seen emerge in health care \nthroughout the United States in the past 2 to 3 years is the \ndevelopment of the so-called green eyeshade of an HMO determining what \nis appropriate patient care, regardless of the physical condition of an \nindividual patient.\n  The amendment I will offer essentially says that a group health plan \nor a health insurance issuer, in connection with health insurance \ncoverage, may not arbitrarily interfere with or alter the decision of \nthe treating physician regarding the manner or setting in which \nparticular services are delivered, if the services are medically \nnecessary or appropriate for treatment or diagnosis to the extent that \nsuch treatment or diagnosis is otherwise a covered benefit. In other \nwords, if you have coverage for a treatment in your plan, the physician \ndetermines that treatment based on you, based on your needs, based on \nyour illness--not based on the calculation of a green eyeshade in a \nhealth insurance plan.\n  My father was a surgeon. He was chief of surgery at the University of \nCalifornia. My husband, Bert Feinstein, was a neurosurgeon. I grew up \nand lived a good deal of my life in a medical family. In all of that \ntime, the doctors determined the appropriateness of care, the doctors \ndetermined the length of hospitalization, the doctors determined \nwhether a particular treatment was suitable for an individual--not an \narbitrary HMO, not physicians out of context of an individual physician \nand patient.\n  Every person sitting in this gallery today is different, one from the \nother. They are different in how they react to drugs. They are \ndifferent in how they react to radiation--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allotted to the distinguished Senator \nfrom California has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may finish my sentence.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If I might just interrupt. I apologize. I was not on the \nfloor earlier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/23/senate-section/article/S7489-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7489-S7491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent that each side have 20 minutes \nof additional time for morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired in regard to the Senator \nfrom California.\n  Hearing none, without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask through the Chair to the Senator from \nCalifornia, how much additional time does the Senator need?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I could have another 7 to 10 minutes at this time, \nI would appreciate it very much.\n  Mr. REID. How about 7 minutes?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will do my best with 7 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Okay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  At an appropriate time, I will submit that amendment.\n  Let me tell you some of the things we are increasingly told: That is, \nthat doctors have to spend hours hassling with insurance company \naccountants and adjusters to justify medical necessity decisions--why a \nperson needs another day in a hospital, why a patient needs an MRI, why \na patient needs a blood test, why a patient should get a particular \ndrug, this drug rather than that drug. Doctors increasingly say they \nhave to exaggerate or lie so their patients can get proper medical \ncare.\n  In USA Today, an article was run saying that 70 percent of doctors \ninterviewed said they exaggerate patients' symptoms to make sure HMOs \ndo not discharge patients from hospitals prematurely. Seventy percent \nof doctors indicate that they do not tell the truth about a patient's \ncondition so they can be assured that that patient gets adequate \nhospital care.\n  Now, is this what we want? I don't think it is. I think the doctor's \ndecision, based on an individual's condition, should be the overriding \ndecision that determines medical necessity. The amendment I will \nintroduce will ensure that that happens.\n  In the HHS inspector general's report of June 1998, the following \nfinding was made: Most doctors think working in a Medicare HMO \nrestricts their clinical independence and that HMOs' cost concerns \ninfluence their treatment decisions. Mr. President, every patient is \ndifferent and brings to a situation his or her own unique history and \nbiology. Only a physician who is trained to evaluate the unique needs \nand problems of a patient can properly diagnose and treat an \nindividual.\n  A Los Angeles doctor by the name of Lloyd Krieger said:\n\n       Many doctors are demoralized. They feel like they have \n     taken a beating in recent years. Physicians train years to \n     learn how to practice medicine. They work long hours \n     practicing their field. Under this health care system, that \n     training and hard work often seems irrelevant. A bureaucrat \n     decides how doctors are allowed to treat patients.\n\n  Dr. Krieger says:\n\n       When I tell someone he is fit to leave the hospital after \n     an operation, I am often given an accusing stare. Sometimes \n     my patient asks: Is that what you really think or are you \n     caving in to HMO pressure to cut corners on care?\n\n  Here's another example: A California pediatrician treated a baby with \ninfant botulism, a toxin that spread from the intestine to the nervous \nsystem so the child really couldn't breathe well. The doctor prescribed \na 10- to 14-day hospital stay. That doctor thought that length of stay \nwas medically necessary for that particular baby. The insurance plan \ncut it short, saying the maximum that baby could remain in the hospital \nwas 1 week. That shouldn't happen.\n  The amendment I will introduce at the appropriate time, and that I so \nhope this body will agree to, will ensure that medically appropriate \nand necessary treatment is prescribed by the physician and not \ncontradicted by a green eyeshade.\n  I very much hope this body will accept it. I have introduced this \nkind of amendment now with Senator D'Amato as a cosponsor and with \nSenator Olympia Snowe as a cosponsor. Perhaps the time has come to have \nthe opportunity to pass this amendment and to get it done once and for \nall.\n  I thank the Chair, I thank the Senator from Nevada, and I thank the \nSenator from Massachusetts as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, is there an order for the conduct of \nbusiness at this point?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is now in morning business, with\n\n[[Page S7490]]\n\nthe majority having 25 minutes remaining and the minority having \napproximately 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the Presiding Officer, we were \ngiven 20 minutes and we have approximately how much time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes 59 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Has the Senator from California completed her statement?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have completed it. I could go on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The question is: Are we going to be able to go forward with \na debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights?\n  It seems to me that would be the right thing to do. I am a member of \nthe Appropriations Committee. I recognize that we are working under \nvery difficult budget constraints because of the budget we have now in \nthis body. I think it is important we move forward on the appropriation \nbills. We have done fairly well thus far.\n  We have already passed four appropriation bills. The agriculture \nappropriations bill is currently pending. Yesterday, we reported the \ninterior appropriations bill out of the subcommittee. Tomorrow, we will \ntake up three appropriation bills in full committee. I agree that we \nneed to continue to move these bills forward.\n  I think we could complete all debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights \nin 3 legislative days. If we had 3 long, hard days, we could do that. \nIf we use the majority's bill as a working model, they should not \nrequire any amendments, because it is their bill.\n  We have acknowledged that we need 20 amendments. As we have stated on \na number of occasions, we have had other bills that have been brought \nbefore this body, in this Congress, that have had a lot more than 20 \namendments. The military bill of rights had 26 amendments; the \nsupplemental appropriations bill had 66 amendments; and the first \nbudget resolution had 104 amendments. Twenty amendments is a reasonable \nrequest.\n  We could agree, as far as this Senator is concerned, on having time \nlimits on these amendments. We could do that. We could have good \ndebates on what should be done on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We \nshould do that.\n  We are not going to allow this legislation to move forward until we \nhave the opportunity to debate our amendments. As I indicated, in this \nCongress, the Y2K bill had 51 amendments; DOD authorization, 159; \ndefense appropriations, 67; juvenile justice, 52; the first budget \nresolution, 104; Education Flexibility Act, 38; supplemental \nappropriations, 66. Relative to these bills, 20 amendments is nothing.\n  We should proceed to the Patients' Bill of Rights as quickly as \npossible. We are, in effect, wasting time by having to come here and \ntalk about why we need the opportunity to consider this legislation. It \nis not a question of whether we are going to debate the Patients' Bill \nof Rights, but when we are going to do it. We are going to offer our \nPatients' Bill of Rights as an amendment to every vehicle moving \nthrough this body. Under Senate rules, we can't be stopped from doing \nthat.\n  We believe it is important that Americans have access to specialty \ncare. We are talking about the real life stories of real people who \nhave been and will continue to be denied access to specialty care until \nwe pass a meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Karrie Craig from Minden, NV, wrote me a \nletter. In her letter, she explained to me that her mother is dead \nbecause she was not able to see a specialist, even when her primary \ncare physician recommended that she see one. She was denied specialty \ncare because her managed care organization, not her physician, did not \nthink it was necessary.\n  We believe that patients should not be subjected to a one-size-fits-\nall brand of health care. We believe there are situations where the \ndoctor and the patient--not some bureaucrat--should decide what care is \nnecessary. The American people also believe that. We think there are \nsome real problems with the majority's so-called ``Patients' Bill of \nRights''. We are willing to debate this issue and to determine whether \nor not our legislation is better than that of the majority. Clearly, we \nare willing to set time limits on our debate.\n  We are allowing a limit on the number of amendments we offer, but the \nmajority should allow this bill to go forward. The most striking \nloophole in the majority's plan--and it is hard to say what this is \nbecause there are so many of them--is that it doesn't cover most \nAmericans. In fact, the Republican bill leaves out almost 120 million \nAmericans. Their bill would only cover a small number of people. Only \none-third of the 161 million people protected by our bill would be \ncovered by the Republican proposal.\n  All Americans who have insurance should be protected. That is what \nour legislation is all about. The Republican bill uses our title, \n``Patients' Bill of Rights,'' but that is all it uses. It does not \nextend coverage to the people who deserve to be covered.\n  All Americans deserve guaranteed access to specialty care, and we \nbelieve that we should at least be able to debate this issue. There are \nmany different areas we need to talk about regarding the Patients' Bill \nof Rights.\n\n\n                       National Rifle Association\n\n  Mr. President, while my friend from the State of Illinois is present, \nI would like to shift and talk about something else that is certainly \nimportant. As I have indicated, we are going to spend whatever time is \nnecessary making sure that we have the right--I should not say the \nright, but that we have a debate on our Patients' Bill of Rights. We \nhave the right, and that is why we are here today talking about this. \nSo we are going forward until we have the debate on it.\n  I would like to discuss with my friend from Illinois another issue \nthat seems to have been lost in the shuffle, which is the debate \nrelated to guns. I say to my friend from Illinois that I have here a \nletter from a man from Reno, NV, by the name of David Brody. I would \nlike my friend to comment on this.\n  He writes:\n\n       I am writing in regards to the enclosed National Rifle \n     Association membership that was mailed to my 13-year-old \n     daughter. I am not a gun advocate and have never voiced an \n     opinion and I certainly believe in our Constitution and the \n     right to bear arms, but I am rather astonished that the \n     membership application is addressed to my 13-year-old \n     daughter.\n\n  I say to my friend from Illinois, do you think the NRA should be \nsending applications to 13-year-old children to join the NRA? This \nisn't something that is made up. I have here the National Rifle \nAssociation 1999 membership identification. It gives her a number, and \nthe letter is addressed to Brittany Brody. The NRA also sent this 13-\nyear-old girl a survey wanting to know how she feels about opposing \nPresident Clinton on his gun issues. Does the Senator think this is \nappropriate to send to a 13-year-old girl?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague for raising this issue. This really \ngets to the heart of the debate we had a few weeks ago on the floor of \nthe Senate. Remember how America reacted to Littleton, CO, and the \nColumbine High School shooting? I think it fixed the attention of this \nNation unlike any other event I can remember. We felt we needed to come \nto the floor of the Senate to try to find a way to reduce the \nlikelihood that guns would get into the hands of children and \ncriminals. The debate went on for a full week, and it ended finally \nwhen we had six Republican Senators join the overwhelming majority of \nDemocrats for a tie vote, 50-50, at which point Vice President Gore \ncame to the floor and cast the tie-breaking vote and sent a good, \nsensible gun control bill over to the U.S. House of Representatives \nwhere, unfortunately, the same organization, the National Rifle \nAssociation, tore it to pieces, leaving nothing.\n  So we have our Senate bill, but the National Rifle Association \nprevailed over in the House. I say to the Senator from Nevada, I wish \nthat I could tell you that I was shocked that the National Rifle \nAssociation would be so careless as to send a membership application to \na 13-year-old. But when I look at what they did in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives to a good bill, a bill that would have said we are \ngoing to have background checks at gun shows so we know that we are not \nselling to criminals and kids, and Senator Feinstein's amendment that \nwould have prohibited importing these big magazine clips that are just \nused by gangbangers--they have no value in sport or hunting--and to \nmake sure we\n\n[[Page S7491]]\n\nhave trigger locks so when kids find a gun in the house, they won't \npull the trigger and kill themselves, the NRA opposed that.\n\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Illinois, that kind of reminds me \nof our debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. They call their bill a \n``Patients' Bill of Rights'', but it does not give patients any rights. \nOn the gun issue, they say they had in the House bill protection \nagainst gun shows because they had a 24-hour time limit, but they know \nthat most gun shows are on weekends and they can't research on the \nweekends, so basically nothing would happen; is that right?\n  Mr. DURBIN. They are very similar, and the Senator is correct. The \nNational Rifle Association is trying to put up some figleaf and say \nthey are really for gun control. America knows better. We have been \nlistening to these folks for a long time. They were opposed to the \nprohibition against cop-killer bullets--special bullets that would \npenetrate the bulletproof vests worn by policemen--because it infringed \non people's constitutional rights. Give me a break. There isn't a right \nin the Bill of Rights that isn't limited for the common good.\n  Mr. REID. I would like the Senator from Illinois to comment on the \nsecond and third paragraphs of this letter from Mr. Brody:\n\n       As we strive in our community to ensure that our schools \n     are safe for our children, one of the biggest fears that \n     parents have is a gun at school. We have been able to turn \n     her particular school around from a very violent and non-\n     academic oriented institution to one that we are all very \n     proud of and where the students are doing extremely well.\n       I am absolutely amazed that the National Rifle Association \n     would have the audacity to mail membership applications to \n     children. At some point, I believe this must be part of our \n     government regulations. Will my youngest 11-year-old daughter \n     be contacted next with another outrageous suggestion that is \n     only supporting violence?\n\n  Would the Senator say that Mr. Brody is out of line in writing this \nletter and crying out for help that his 11-year-old daughter and 13-\nyear-old daughter aren't given a membership--I mean, they got it; she \nhas a card here that looks like a credit card. It says 13-year-old \nBrittany Brody is a member of the NRA.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to my colleague, I know he is a father and he is \nproud of his family, and I am, too. Think about this. This father saw \nthis come through the mail. Think of the world we live in, with the \nInternet and the webs. How many others are trying to lure kids into the \npurchase of weapons or a membership in a National Rifle Association and \nthe like? I really think when we talk about responsibility and \naccountability, it applies to parents and it applies to organizations \nsuch as the NRA as well.\n  I say to my friend from Nevada that he raises an excellent point. If \nwe are going to make sure our kids have a fighting chance, we have to \nkeep guns out of their hands. When the Senator from Nevada and I were \nboth growing up a few years ago, there were always troubled kids in the \nschools. We called them bullies in those days. You feared getting \npunched in the nose on the playground. I wish that is all our kids had \nto fear today. Now they have to fear that the bully will get a gun and \nshow up in school, as it happened in Conyers, GA; at Columbine High \nSchool; Jonesboro; West Paducah; Springfield, Oregon; Pearl, \nMississippi. Those unfortunate incidents are the reality of the dangers \nour kids can face.\n  Mr. REID. My time is about to expire, but I am here today to alert \nthis body that we are going to make sure that when there is a call for \nconferees to be appointed on the juvenile justice bill, that we act \nappropriately, that we send a message to the conferees that we don't \nwant business as usual, that we want the National Rifle Association to \nunderstand that the vast majority of Americans do not agree with them.\n  The Senator from Illinois would agree that when the conferees are \ncalled, we are going to ask for a resolution to send to the conferees \nthat they should follow what is already taking place in the Senate \nthat, in effect, says a majority of the people of this country are in \nagreement with the Senate; is that true?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Nevada that the Democrats may \nbe in the minority in the Senate. I believe our position for sensible \ngun control to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and kids is a \nmajority opinion in America. I think our position for the Patients' \nBill of Rights, so doctors make decisions and not insurance companies, \nis a majority opinion in America. We are going to fight for that.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 12 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. I yield that time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Maryland just arrived. I \nask unanimous consent that she be allowed to speak as if in morning \nbusiness for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Acting as an independent Senator from Kansas, \nI object.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Maryland be \nallowed to speak in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The acting Presiding Officer informs the \nSenator from Nevada that the majority has 25 minutes and that there is \na Senator expected on the floor at any moment. Would the Senator like \nto repeat his request?\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Maryland be \nallowed to speak 10 minutes and that the morning hour be extended for \n35 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Acting as an independent Senator from Kansas, \nI object.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak in morning business for no more than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator repeat the request?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak as \nif in morning business for no more than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If I might engage my colleague from Nevada, are there \nadditional Senators requesting time on his side?\n  Mr. REID. No.\n  Mr. NICKLES. This Senator has no objection to the request. I was \ngoing to suggest that we give an additional 15 minutes on both sides.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/23/senate-section/article/S7491-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I come here today to talk about \nsomething that is very compelling to the women of this country; that \nis, the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights is a women's issue, because it is the \nwomen of America's families who often make the decisions that are very \nimportant in terms of the health care of their family. They are the \nones who often read the fine print of insurance documents. They fill \nout the paperwork in order to make sure their children have access to \nthe health care they need. They are often the ones on the front line \neither trying to get health insurance for their families or also \nensuring they have the best benefit package.\n  But, guess what. When it comes down to them getting the health care \nthey need, they are often denied it. They are often denied having \naccess to an OB/GYN who is the primary care provider for most American \nwomen, because they are called ``a specialist.''\n\n[[Page S7492]]\n\n  Also, when they face a tremendous problem in their lives, such as a \nmastectomy, they are often denied the time they need to get the care \nthey need because of the insurance gatekeepers. We call this the drive-\nby mastectomy situation. We call it a drive-by mastectomy, because a \nprocedure is performed on a woman, she is driven to the hospital, and \nshe is driven out of the hospital--sometimes within hours.\n\n  What is a mastectomy? Make no mistake, the term ``mastectomy'' is a \ntechnical term. But what it really means to a woman is that it is a \nbreast amputation with all of the horror, terror, and trauma that an \namputation brings out. When one faces such a horrific procedure, \ncertainly you should have the kind of care you need. And that should be \ndecided by the doctor and the patient--not by an insurance gatekeeper.\n  What does a mastectomy mean? For every woman in the United States of \nAmerica, the one phrase that she is terrified to hear is: You have \nbreast cancer. The next phrase that she is terrified to hear is: It has \ngone so far that we have to do a mastectomy.\n  It is traumatic for her, because it is not only body altering, but it \nis family altering, and it is relationship altering. When one looks at \none woman facing a mastectomy, she needs to discuss this with her \nspouse. He is as scared as she is. He is terrified that she is going to \ndie. He is terrified about how he can support her when she comes home \nfrom the hospital. And then they know they have to sort out a \nrelationship under such difficult situations.\n  When a woman has a mastectomy, they need to recover where they \nrecover best. That is decided by the doctor and the patient. Women are \nsent home still groggy from anesthesia and sometimes with drainage \ntubes still in place, with infection, and are not sure if that is the \nright place.\n  Make no mistake. We can't practice cookbook medicine. Insurance \ngatekeepers can't give cookbook answers. An 80-year-old who needs a \nmastectomy needs a different kind of care than a 38-year-old woman.\n  We go out there, and we race for the cure. I think it is wonderful. \nWe do it on a bipartisan basis. But if we find the cures, we need \naccess to the clinical trials. It is being denied in the Republican \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We need to be able to talk to our own OB/GYN. \nThat is called ``a specialist''; we can't do that.\n  We need to have access to the care. This is the United States of \nAmerica. We have discovered in this century more medical and scientific \nbreakthroughs than any other century in American history. It is in \nAmerica where we found how to handle infectious diseases. It is in \nAmerica where we have come up with lifesaving pharmaceuticals. It is in \nAmerica where we have had lifesaving new surgical techniques only to \nfind that in America, though we invented something to save your life, \nwe also invented insurance gatekeepers that prevent you from having \naccess to those lifesaving mastectomies. This can't be so.\n  If we are going to really take America into the 21st century, we must \ncontinue our discovery. We must continue our research, and we have to \nhave access to our discoveries.\n\n  The Republicans, through Senator D'Amato, offered legislation on \ndrive-by mastectomies. When the Republicans offered their bill in the \ncommittee, it was strikingly absent. Senator Murray and other Members \noffered the D'Amato amendment. However, along party lines it was \nrejected, 10-8. Certainly what was good for D'Amato a year ago should \nbe good now, at least to have the opportunity to debate this year.\n  The Democratic alternative Senator Murray and other Members want to \noffer simply says that decisions should be made by the doctor in \nconsultation with the patient.\n  A few months ago I had gallbladder surgery. I could stay overnight \nfor my gallbladder surgery because it was medically necessary and \nmedically appropriate. Surely if I can stay overnight for gallbladder \nsurgery, a woman should be able to stay overnight if she has had a \nmastectomy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time does the minority have \nremaining for morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The minority has 8 minutes 30 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. REID. While the assistant leader for the majority is on the \nfloor, I ask unanimous consent we be allowed to extend on an equal \nbasis the time for morning business until 12 noon.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object, and I probably will not, \nhow much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. My colleague would be asking for an additional 10 \nminutes on each side?\n  Mr. REID. I think that would be appropriate.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, if my colleague would modify his request \nand ask for an additional 10 minutes on each side, there would be no \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I extend my appreciation to my friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, my counterpart on the majority.\n  Mr. President, I think it is time we did a little comparison as to \nwhat we really mean when we talk about the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  The majority has something called the Patients' Bill of Rights, but \nit is this only in name. For example, does the majority's bill protect \nall patients with private insurance? No. It covers about 40 million; \nours covers about 170 million.\n  What about the majority's ability to hold plans accountable? Does \ntheir bill hold plans accountable? No. Does ours? Absolutely, yes.\n  What about arbitrary interference from the management, from the \nbureaucrats? In the minority's bill, our Patients' Bill of Rights, \nthere is no arbitrary HMO interference; in the majority's bill, of \ncourse there is.\n  We have heard so much about guaranteed access to specialists. The \nDemocrats' Patients' Bill of Rights guarantees access to specialists; \nthe majority's does not.\n  That is important. We have heard so much today about the need for the \nability to see a specialist when needed. I spoke earlier about the \ndaughter from Minden, NV, who writes to me:\n\n       If my mother had been able to get to the urologist earlier, \n     she would be alive today, but she had to wait for 2 years. \n     The tumor had grown, she died five months afterwards.\n\n  She also said in the letter it was such a waste of resources, because \nthe HMO did spend money putting her mother in a hospice while she died. \nThat was very expensive.\n  That is the whole point of our legislation. There is talk about it \nbeing so expensive. It is not expensive. In the long run, it saves the \ncountry money to have people taken care of when they need medical care.\n  Guaranteed access to specialists is what our legislation is all \nabout. It is important we understand that.\n  What about access to out-of-network providers? They are needed on \noccasion. Ours gives that access; the Republicans', the majority's, \ndoes not.\n  How about specialists who need to work together to coordinate care? \nOurs guarantees that; the Republicans' does not.\n  What about prohibition of improper financial incentives? Some of the \nplans have incentives. The more you keep people out of hospitals, the \nmore money you make. A doctor has an incentive to keep people out of \nthe hospital. That is wrong. That is absolutely wrong. Our legislation \nprohibits improper financial incentives; the Republicans', or the \nmajority's, does not.\n  Access to clinical trials. This really isn't anything fancy, or \ncomplicated. There are certain diseases--cancer is the one that comes \nto mind--where people have no standard therapy left. Should they be \nallowed to go to the most modern programs that are lifesaving in \nnature? We don't know for sure they work, but we think they will work. \nHowever, we need experiments, clinical trials, to determine if these \nnew procedures work. Our legislation allows these clinical trials to go \nforward. Our legislation says we don't give up on someone and simply \nsay we have used all standard procedures, we will not allow these great \nscientists, these medical researchers who have found new ways they \nbelieve can cure a disease--we will not allow your mother, father, \nbrother, or sister to have cutting-edge treatments.\n\n  Under our program, we say patients should have access to clinical \ntrials.\n\n[[Page S7493]]\n\n People's lives are saved every day because of these clinical trials.\n  Access to OB/GYN--obstetrician/gynecologist. This is absolutely \ncritical for women. It is guaranteed under our legislation that women \nwould have access to OB/GYN physicians. That is extremely important. \nUnder the Republican version, there are certain instances, certain \ntimes--very minute, very limited--that women can see an OB/GYN \nphysician. We believe this should be a matter of routine. A woman \nshould be able to see a gynecologist or obstetrician when she believes \nit appropriate.\n  We know in America today, when women see a gynecologist, often these \nphysicians become the primary care physician for women. We believe our \nlegislation is what women deserve and what they need in America today.\n  What about access to doctor-prescribed drugs? We have had a problem \ndevelop around the country and in Las Vegas when one of our providers \nfound a new way to dispense drugs. If someone needs one 50-milligram \npill, the provider sends them a 100-milligram pill and tells them to \ncut it in half, giving them the instrument to cut it in half.\n  That is not the way medicine should be practiced. Just because the \nHMOs get a good deal on a bunch of medicine, on a bunch of drugs, does \nnot mean that patients should be subjected to that kind of treatment. \nShouldn't they be given the prescribed drugs the doctor says they need?\n  How would you feel if you went to a pharmacist and the prescription \nordered a 50-milligram pill and the pharmacist said: I will give you \nhalf as many, but they are twice as powerful, so just cut them in half?\n  That is what is going on in America today with managed care. Our \nlegislation would prohibit these practices.\n  There are significant numbers of people who are fired from managed \ncare entities for telling the truth, for being advocates, for saying: \nThis is not the way you should be treated. Go talk to your doctor. Go \nback to someone else. They get fired.\n  In our legislation, we have protections for patient advocates. If a \nnurse, for example, says, this is not the way I believe you should be \ntreated, you should go talk to your doctor, or you should appeal a \ndecision, under our legislation, this nurse would be protected for \nadvocating on behalf of her patient. Under the proposal of the \nmajority, there is no similar protection.\n  Another problem is that managed care facilities put their physicians \non an index. They go out every year and hustle doctors in order to get \ngood deals. They find a doctor who will do an appendectomy cheaper than \na doctor did last year, so that doctor gets put on their list. All of a \nsudden, the patient no longer has the right to see the doctor who has \nbeen treating him or her for 10 years, because the doctor is not on the \nHMO's list.\n  What we say in our legislation is that you can keep your doctor \nthroughout treatment, that you need not change even though the managed \ncare entity, in effect, has fired that doctor. The doctor is fired not \nfor doing anything wrong as far as rendering bad treatment, but simply \nbecause they no longer want them on their approved list. Maybe they had \nan argument with one of the administrators. Maybe they think they \ncharged too much. Maybe they can get a better deal. That is usually \nwhat it is, a better deal from other physicians.\n  Under our Patients' Bill of Rights, we, as I have said, allow patient \nadvocacy. But we also prohibit gag rules. Under the majority's \nPatients' Bill of Rights, and I use that term very loosely, you will \nfind they have language prohibiting gag rules but it is relatively \nmeaningless. It is not enforceable.\n  We also believe there should be external appeals. There was a speech \nmade here yesterday that the majority's legislation does allow \nindependent external appeals. That is simply not true. They have words \nthat say that occurs, but it really has no merit. Under our \nlegislation, there is a guarantee of an independent external appeal. \nAnd it is done quickly.\n  There are also very important considerations as to whether or not a \nperson who is part of a plan has the right to go to an emergency room. \nWe have heard numerous examples of people denied payments after going \nto an emergency room. One of my favorites was a young woman who was out \nhiking, fell off a cliff, broke her pelvis and leg, was taken to an \nemergency room, and the cost was over $10,000. It was denied by the \nmanaged care entity because she did not get prior approval to go to the \nemergency room.\n  If that were only one case where that happened, maybe we would not \npay much attention to it. But this happens all the time. People are \nconstantly denied the right to go to an emergency room. Under the \nmajority's legislation, they have a little bit of language that gives a \nlittle bit of protection for emergency room access, but this is not \nenough.\n  One of the key provisions in our legislation is that we have an \nombudsman. What is an ombudsman? An ombudsman is a person you can go to \nwho works for the managed care entity, so if there is a complaint, ``I \nwas denied care and I should not have been,'' it is that person's job \nto get to the bottom of it. An ombudsman can take a look at that and \nfind out what went wrong. There is someone to go to if there is a \nproblem with the managed care entity. Under our legislation, it is a \nrequirement. It is not even mentioned in the majority plan.\n  Plan quality--isn't it just right that there be somewhere where a \npatient, a member of a plan, can go to find out what happens when \ncertain procedures are done in this managed care entity? Are they \nsuccessful? Are they not successful? Our legislation provides that \npeople who are members of a plan can get information on the quality of \ntheir plan. That is critically important.\n\n  As I have asked before, why are we here today talking about the \nPatients' Bill of Rights? We are here because we believe there should \nbe a debate taking place in the greatest debating society in the world, \nas the Senate is often referred to, on this issue. What should be done \nwith these managed care entities around the country as far as providing \ninformation, protecting all patients? Do we want a debate on whether \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights should cover 40 million Americans or \nwhether it should cover 60 million? Do we want to debate on whether we \ncan hold plans accountable? Do we want a debate on whether there can be \narbitrary HMO interference in the practice of medicine? Do we want a \ndebate on guaranteed access to specialists? Do we want a debate on \naccess to out-of-network providers? Do we want a debate on specialists \nbeing able to coordinate care? Do we want a debate on standing \nreferrals to specialists? Do we want a debate on improper financial \nincentives given to doctors who are part of these entities? Do we want \na debate on access to clinical trials? Do we want a debate on having an \nobstetrician and gynecologist for women when they want one? Do we want \na debate on access to doctor-prescribed drugs? Do we want a debate on \npatient protection advocacy? Do we want a debate on keeping a doctor \nthroughout your entire treatment? Do we want a debate on prohibition of \ngag rules? Do we want a debate on how the guaranteed network meets the \nneeds of a patient? Do we want a debate on access to nonphysician \nproviders? Do we want a debate on choice of provider point-of-service? \nDo we want a debate on emergency room access? Do we want a debate on \nwhether or not these plans should have an ombudsman?\n  The answer to every one of these questions is yes, we do. That is why \nwe are here in this body. This great debating society says: Yes, let's \ndebate these issues. If the majority is putting forth this bill that \nthey call a Patients' Bill of Rights--and we submit it is only in name \na Patients' Bill of Rights--we say we are willing to debate this \nbecause the American people are protected under our Patients' Bill of \nRights. People need protection. They have been taken advantage of.\n  In America today there are only two groups of people who cannot be \nsued: foreign diplomats and HMOs. I was at dinner in Nevada Saturday \nwith a friend who is one of the chief administrative officers for a big \nmanaged care entity in northern Nevada. She said to me: I kind of like \nyour plan, except these lawyers.\n  I said to her: Every other business in America has to deal with \nlawyers. Why shouldn't people who take care of me, people who take care \nof my daughter, people who take care of my son, my\n\n[[Page S7494]]\n\nwife, if they do something wrong, why should they not also have to \nrespond in the legal system? That is really invalid. People are saying \nthis is going to make all this litigation. That is simply not true. \nLawyers, especially when they deal with people's health, have to be \nvery careful litigating. In the entire history of the State of Nevada, \nwhich is now not the smallest State in the Union, although certainly \nnot one of the largest, it is about 35th in population, in the entire \ntime we have been a State, there have only been a handful of cases, \nmedical malpractice cases that have gone to a jury. So this is a \nbogeyman that does not exist.\n  What we are saying is we want a debate on the Patients' Bill of \nRights. We think ours is certainly one in keeping with the standards \nthe American people want. In the light of day, we are willing to debate \nwhat the Patients' Bill of Rights on the other side has, which is \nnothing. It is a Patients' Bill of Rights in name only. We want to come \nto this body and have a reasonable number of amendments. That is a \nconcession on our part, a reasonable number of amendments. We should be \nable to offer all the amendments we want, but we believe so strongly \nabout this issue that our leader has said to the majority leader we are \nwilling to limit our amendments to 20 and to set a time for completing \nthis bill.\n  That certainly seems fair and reasonable when one considers that in \nthis Congress, we already have taken up bills which have not taken a \nlot of time but had far more amendments.\n  Y2K problem, 51 amendments; DOD authorization, 159 amendments. We \nspent 4 days on that bill. On the Y2K problem, we spent 13 days on it \nand many of those were very short days.\n  Defense appropriations, 67 amendments. We were able to finish that \nbill in 1 day. We debated the juvenile justice bill for 8 days, and we \nwere able to dispose of 52 amendments.\n  We are saying, with something as important as people's health care \nand well-being, we are willing to take 20 amendments. We feel we can \nfinish the bill in 3 days with 20 amendments. Certainly, we are \nentitled to that time. We had 8 days on juvenile justice. In that \nregard, we came up with some good legislation.\n  On the budget resolution, which is a guide for this body and which I \nbelieve was not a very good piece of legislation--I voted against it as \ndid most everyone on this side of the aisle--there were 104 amendments, \nand we disposed of that bill in 2 days.\n  In short, we certainly should have this debate, and we should do it \nright away. We recognize we are only going to have one more legislative \nday this week and then we go back to our States to do other things. \nLet's do it next week. Let's begin this bill next week, and after the \nFourth of July break, we can come back and work on the appropriations \nbills. We are not going to complete any of the appropriations bills \nuntil we have a meaningful debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights, one \nwhere we are not gagged and we are allowed to offer the amendments we \nwant to offer as to the substantive merits of this legislation.\n  I hope the majority will allow this debate to take place. It will \ntake place. It is only a question of when it will take place. We will \nsave a great deal of time and anxiety if we just get to it. As Mills \nLane, the famous fight referee, now the TV judge says: Let's get it on.\n  We are willing to get it on with this debate. We feel so strongly \nabout the merits of our case, we are willing to debate it in the dead \nof night or early in the morning. We do not care when we do it, but \nlet's do it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/23/senate-section/article/S7494-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7494-S7496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AMENDMENTS TO AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I had intended to come over and talk on \nthe ag appropriations bill. I am not going to talk about the ag \nappropriations bill since we are not on it. I am going to talk about a \ncouple of amendments I intend to offer, if we ever get to that point. I \nwill put us back into a quorum call when I am through.\n  There are many important things in this ag appropriations bill that I \nstrongly support. I have a great deal of respect and appreciation for \nthe work that both Senator Cochran and Senator Kohl have done on this \npiece of legislation. Every appropriator, every Senator who has the \nresponsibility of working on the Appropriations Committee, understands \nwe are seeing a decline, a deterioration in our capacity to invest in \nour future as a result of a growing problem we have with our budget; \nthat is, a larger and larger share that is going to mandatory programs \nand a smaller and smaller share available for these long-term \ninvestments, whether it is in soil, whether it is in research, all the \nother things that are in this particular piece of legislation. The \nproblem is only going to get worse.\n  I didn't come to talk about that, but I did feel obliged to say I \nunderstand that all these men and women who serve on the Appropriations \nCommittee are under an awful lot of pressure, and that pressure is \ngoing to grow.\n  We currently take from the American people about 20.5 percent of GDP \nto spend on Federal programs. That one-fifth of total GDP that we have \nbeen taking for the last 50 or 60 years has remained relatively \nconstant, though at 20.5 it has not been at that high level since \n1945. I say that only because there is an upper limit as to what we can \ntake. I think we are there. Indeed, I support cutting taxes right now; \nI believe we can cut taxes. Indeed, part of the reason I am for it is \nthat, at 20.5, in order to send a signal, we need to understand there \nis an upper limit. Otherwise, we are apt to spend it on a variety of \nthings, and all the fiscal discipline we have had throughout most of \nthis decade will be evaporated in a hurry.\n\n  But as to this bill itself, whenever it becomes appropriate, I intend \nto offer a couple amendments. As I said, while this piece of \nlegislation does support a number of very important aspects of \nagriculture spending, from agriculture research to food stamps, in \nfact, it can't, given its mission, address the enormous amount of \nchanges sweeping across rural Nebraska. I get calls all the time from \nfarmers who ask me: Does anybody in Washington understand what is going \non? I answer, genuinely, yes. I think both Republicans and Democrats \nare scratching their heads trying to figure out what we can do.\n  I was encouraged by the chairman's comments during the markup of the \ndire emergency supplemental bill for Kosovo; he does understand that \nboth Republicans and Democrats understand there is a need to do an \nadditional supplemental appropriations bill at some time for emergency \npurposes to help agriculture. But this merely underscores the problem \nwe are experiencing in rural America today. Unfortunately, what is \nhappening is that family farmer, who very often has a job outside of \nagriculture, is not certain there is any opportunity left.\n  I want to say to my colleagues, though, I am very much a free market \nperson; I support free trade. I believe we ought to have rules and laws \nthat support the free enterprise system.\n  In agriculture, we do a lot more on these family farms than just \nproduce food. The food is important, a vital part of our export \nstrategy, and it has economic value that one cannot deny. But these \nfarms produce human beings. All of us who have had the pleasure of \nworking with boys and girls who are working for the 4-H organization, \nor the Future Farmers of America, when you see these young men and \nwomen, you see kids with unusually good character and values that are \nacquired as a result of living in an environment where you understand \nthat this biblical motto that says you can't reap what you don't sow is \ntrue; where you live constantly in an environment of understanding \nthat, though you may have a good or a bad farm program, and like or not \nlike what is going on in Congress, still the most important act you \nhave is the act that occurs when you are on your knees in the morning, \nor in\n\n[[Page S7495]]\n\nevening, or you are bowing your head at lunch or supper and praying and \nbeing grateful for what you have but hoping that Mother Nature delivers \nenough and the right amount of rain, enough and the right amount of \nother conditions that are necessary in order to produce this product.\n  As the distinguished occupant of the Chair knows, being from \nArkansas, food production is unusual because, unlike manufacturing \nbusinesses, it is produced out of doors. It may seem like an obvious \nfact, but in my businesses I regulate the environment. I have an air \nconditioner; I have a heater; I have a furnace that produces heat in \nthe winter; and I have an air conditioner that produces cool air in the \nsummertime. I can control that environment 365 days a year. I did get \nwiped out once by a tornado in 1975, but I don't, in the normal course \nof business, worry about hail or about not getting enough rain. I don't \nhave a growing season where I can be wiped out with a single event, and \nI don't have all my annual sales gone just like that as a result of \nsomething way beyond my control.\n\n  So we understand that we have basics that we are dealing with. I hope \nwe understand that agriculture produces people with values. There is a \nrural policy aspect of our farm program that is not really economic. We \nwant people to live in rural America. We understand that our program \nhas to provide them with some hope of economic prosperity, and we \nunderstand that these farms produce more than just some thing, some \ncommodity that has economic value.\n  The question is how to do that. We had a great debate in 1995 over \nFreedom to Farm. Though I didn't vote for it, let me say that I was \nvery sympathetic to the idea that the Government should not be out \nthere regulating every single thing the farmer does. Under the old farm \nprogram, that happened. Farmers were saying to me: I am not making \ndecisions anymore. All my decisions are made down at the Farm Service \nAgency. I have to go down and find out from USDA and Soil Conservation \nService and other people what I can do before I make plans.\n  They wanted those handcuffs taken off. They were also very \nuncomfortable and not happy with the Government's performance in owning \ngrain reserves. They watched the Government operate those reserves at \ntimes that caused the price to go low and subsidies to go up, and then \ntheir neighbors were saying to them: You are farming for your welfare \ncheck.\n  They didn't like being on welfare. I am not here this morning to \nattack Freedom to Farm, but I do think there are a number of things \nabout our underlying law that deserve attention and deserve \nmodification.\n  First of all, we are spending way more than we thought we were going \nto spend. Last year, we spent $20 billion. It is estimated we will \nspend more than that this year. We have an Uruguay Round commitment not \nto spend more than $19 billion on production or price-related support. \nWe are already at $12 billion to $13 billion, and there is an \nanticipation that there will be additional spending, especially for \nloan deficiency payments under the soybean program.\n  The Commodity Credit Corporation is out of money for the first time \nsince 1987. CCC borrowing has an authority of $30 billion, so this is \nnot what we considered to be too low of a ceiling but with the \ncombination of direct payments, loan deficiency payments, dairy price \nsupports, and export programs, we have already exhausted what we \nthought was a generous amount of money to provide the Commodity Credit \nCorporation. These are all technicalities.\n  (Mr. BURNS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. KERREY. Now we have a new ``Mr. President'' in the Chair with \nslightly different agriculture interests but still substantial \nagriculture interests. So I feel that I am speaking to a kindred \nspirit. I notify anybody who happens to be watching this on television \nthat the occupant of the Chair is the only person here listening to me \nother than the pages and the staff. I appreciate very much that he is \nnow looking at me. I appreciate that.\n  Freedom to Farm was supposed to cost $43.5 billion over 7 years. It \nhas cost more than that already. That is before we have an additional \npayment, which is likely to occur. We have 2 more years to go. I said \nearlier I am not attacking either Freedom to Farm or those who support \nit. I understand exactly why it was there. There are many aspects of it \nthat I like a great deal. But I will offer, when it is an appropriate \ntime, two amendments to this appropriations bill that I hope get due \nconsideration by both supporters and opponents of Freedom to Farm.\n  First of all, I will offer an amendment that will reestablish the \nfarmer-owned reserves. I will offer it, as I said, as an amendment to \nthe bill at the appropriate time. The farmer-owned reserve is a proven \ntool; it works. I will not offer documentation this morning, but I will \nif the debate becomes a serious debate. It is a tool that will increase \nmarket prices; it will decrease expenditures by the Government. History \nhas shown that for feed grains every 100 million bushels removed from \nthe immediate market stream increases prices 3 to 5 cents. Wheat is \ndouble that, 8 to 10 cents a bushel. This sets very strict release \ntrigger points based upon existing loan rates, and though critics have \nsaid this puts a ceiling on the market price, a market price of $2.78 \nfor corn and $4.12 for wheat looks rather appealing, I argue, both \ntoday and in the foreseeable future for any family out there producing \neither one of those two commodities.\n  Increased market prices, not Government payments, are the most \nequitable way to provide income to farmers. The farmer-owned reserve is \nembraced in Nebraska as a commonsense way to help farmers without \nthrowing out Freedom to Farm. The idea originally came to me in \ntestimony that was offered by the Nebraska corn growers at a hearing \nthat was conducted by Congressman Bill Barrett in Nebraska.\n  The corn growers and the wheat growers have endorsed this idea. They \nunderstand that it has worked in the past. It is a way to decrease the \npayments that are being made by taxpayers and increase the margin of \nthe price the farmers are receiving at the market. I hope when I have \nan opportunity to offer that amendment we can get by some of the normal \nideological fears about the farm program itself and put this reasonable \nchange into law.\n  I also intend to offer an amendment to put the antitrust authority \nfor agriculture on a par with the antitrust authority over other \nindustries; that is, to remove it from Packers and Stockyards and take \nit under the law over to the Antitrust Division of the Department of \nJustice. I would love for the jurisdiction to stay at USDA. By it \nstaying at USDA, I retain authority as a result of being on the \nAgriculture Committee. I am not on the Judiciary Committee. I \nunderstand that I am surrendering some jurisdiction when I do that. But \nthe fact is that the USDA will never have the resources to be as \naggressive as Justice, and producers, in my view, who want competition, \nwho want the marketplace to work now more than ever, need to know that \nsomebody in Washington, DC, is going to be making certain that that \nmarketplace is, indeed, competitive.\n  The appropriations bill provides no new funding for Packers and \nStockyards. Indeed, the recommendation is to provide $2.5 million less \nthan last year's appropriations. I understand that last year's \nappropriations provided for a one-time revolving GIPSA. I criticize the \ncommittee for cutting GIPSA's budget. However, the fact still remains \nthat Packers and Stockyards will have no additional resources next \nyear.\n  In the meantime, the Antitrust Division appropriations in Commerce-\nState-Justice is $14 million more than we had in 1999.\n  To his credit, the President asked for an additional $600,000 to \ninvestigate packer competition. But not to his credit, the President \nproposed to pay for it with additional user fees, which the committee \nquite appropriately refused to do. It leaves us with the status quo. \nWhat I am hearing from Nebraska producers is, that is not enough.\n  I pause to say that last year during debate in the Agriculture \nAppropriations Committee, I offered an amendment that would increase \ncompetition, that would provide for a change in the law so prices that \nwere offered under contract or formula had to be reported. The \ndistinguished occupant of the Chair, with his great courage, great \nwisdom, and great leadership, enabled that amendment to be agreed to in \nthe\n\n[[Page S7496]]\n\nagriculture appropriations. Unfortunately, it was stuck in the murky \nprocess that led to $500 million or $600 million being spent. It was \ndropped, unfortunately. We will be back to revisit that issue again.\n  This is very much an issue that dovetails with mandatory price \nreporting. Earlier this year, Americans who went to motion pictures \nshows, who went to movie theaters to watch a movie, were concerned \nbecause in their communities they didn't have access to movies that \nwere nominated for Academy Awards. They feared, quite correctly, that \nthe theater owners were not allowing them to see movies that they \nwanted to see. There is a concentration of ownership in the theater \nbusiness. So where did they go? They went to the Antitrust Division of \nJustice. Guess what. The Antitrust Division of Justice opens an \ninvestigation against concentration of ownership, trying to ask the \nquestion, Do we have competition in the marketplace, and is the lack \nof competition having a negative impact upon people who are consuming \nmotion pictures, who go and spend 6 or 8 bucks--whatever it costs--in \ntheir local communities to see the movies that they wanted to see? They \nhave the law on their side. People who go to motion picture shows have \nthe law on their side.\n\n  Our packers are out there saying, my gosh, if the Federal Government \nis willing to forcefully intervene on behalf of those consumers, why \nare they not willing to forcefully intervene on our side?\n  We met with Joel Klein. We have met with other agencies of \ngovernment. They say to us--especially Antitrust--that they simply lack \nauthority.\n  The Federal Trade Commission said the same thing to us--that the only \nthing we have on our side is the Packers and Stockyards Administration. \nBut Congress constantly underfunds this agency. As a consequence, they \nhave been either unable or unwilling, since this law has been enacted, \nto file any antitrust action against individuals who are out there in \nthe business.\n  I believe in the American way. I don't want anybody to be prevented \nfrom becoming as big and as prosperous as they want. These larger \ncompanies, in my view, are organizing for success. They contribute an \nenormous amount of tax revenue to the Federal Government. They \ncontribute by building jobs. They are doing lots of really good things.\n  But if you are going to have the United States of America be the land \nof opportunity, you have to have the rules written so that a man or \nwoman who wants to start a small business has a chance to compete and \nhas a chance with an operation with a small amount of resources. They \nare not going to have anybody lobby the Government. They are not likely \nto have the money to hire an accountant, or lawyer, or all of the other \nsorts of people you can hire when you became a larger entity. They are \nnot likely, as a consequence of commanding fewer resources, to be able \nto survive by pricing their product under their cost for very darned \nlong. As a result, they are vulnerable.\n  That is why we have antitrust laws. The laws are there to protect not \njust the small businessperson but to protect the United States of \nAmerica so that we are the land of opportunity. That is where the jobs \nare created. That is where the innovation occurs.\n  I will offer this amendment transferring authority from Packers and \nStockyards, regrettably, because, as I have said, I have jurisdiction \nover that, being a member of the Agriculture Committee, and I don't \nlike to surrender jurisdiction. But the evidence to me is overwhelming. \nConsumers have somebody on their side in the Antitrust Division at \nJustice. Consumers and producers, when it comes to Packers and \nStockyards, do not.\n  In conclusion, as I said earlier, when it comes to the agriculture \ncrisis, I intend to work in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I know the distinguished occupant of the Chair is very concerned \nabout what is going on in rural America today. I hope we are able to do \nmuch more than just talk. I don't intend to try to command an issue. I \nprefer to produce results.\n  My hope is that either on this piece of legislation or at some later \ntime we can take action and have the farmers in Nebraska and the \nfarmers in Montana and the farmers in Oklahoma and throughout the \ncountry say they believe the Congress understands what is going on in \nrural America today and is making a concerted effort to finally do \nsomething about it.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Nebraska, for his statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/23/senate-section/article/S7496-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of all of our \ncolleagues, we have been negotiating with the minority leader. I say \n``we.''

Hopefully, we \nwill have an agreement in the not too distant future as far as the \ntiming to take up the bill.\n  With that in mind, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate continue \nin morning business until the hour of 1 o'clock with the time to be \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will take just a few moments to share \nwith my colleagues where we are with regard to our negotiations, and \nthen talk a little bit about the bill itself, the Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  Senator Lott and I have had a number of discussions this morning. We \nare trying to find a way to proceed. I think it is fair to say that we \nare continuing to lose precious time in an effort to try to resolve our \nprocedural differences. I am hopeful we might be able to reach some \nagreement. I am not wedded to the latest proposal I have shared with \nthe majority leader, but we do need a time certain for consideration of \nthis bill in the very near future. We certainly need to have the \nassurance that the amendments we will offer will be considered and \nvoted upon by the Senate.\n  Those are our two principles: No. 1, a time certain for consideration \nof this bill; No. 2, some assurance that we will have the opportunity \nto debate amendments and have votes.\n  We recognize that with 45 Democrats we may not have the necessary \nvotes to win a contest with our Republican friends on a comprehensive \nbill. However, we do know there are a good number of Senators who have \nexpressed their support for various issues in our bill. We hope we can \nwork through those issues and have the assurance we can have a good \ndebate and good votes.\n  We cannot agree to any time certain for final passage if we cannot \nagree that we will have at least an opportunity to debate these \namendments and have votes.\n  Again, our two principles: A date certain, and an opportunity to have \nup-or-down votes, or even tabling votes, on the amendments we want to \noffer.\n  I am hopeful we can work through those two principles and find a way \nthat is mutually acceptable. The majority leader, as always, is \nattempting to be as responsive as he can. I appreciate the cooperative \nspirit with which we have been undertaking these discussions over the \nlast 24 hours.\n  One of the reasons we feel so strongly about amendments is that they \ncause the Senate to focus on what it is we are talking about when we \nsay the words ``Patients' Bill of Rights.'' I don't know that a lot of \npeople fully understand the magnitude of those words. What does \n``Patients' Bill of Rights'' actually mean? We want to be able to spell \nout what it means.\n  I want to give one example, because it will be an amendment if we \ncan't get an agreement. Our first amendment will deal with medical \nnecessity. Medical necessity simply suggests that\n\n[[Page S7497]]\n\nmedical decisions ought to be made by medical professionals, not \nbureaucrats. Our amendment would prevent arbitrary interference by \ninsurers regarding treatment decisions such as hospital length of stay. \nIt also would establish a fair definition of medical necessity. Medical \nnecessity, in our judgment, should simply be an opportunity to use \ngood, professional, medical judgment about the course of action \ninvolving a patient. That is what we mean by medical necessity.\n  I will read for our colleagues two other definitions of medical \nnecessity that are currently in insurance policies for HMOs. I must \nadd, I am not making this up. The first is from a Missouri insurance \ncontract. I will read the definition of medical necessity taken right \nfrom the insurer's policy.\n\n       The company will have the sole discretion to determine \n     whether care is medically necessary. The fact that care has \n     been recommended, provided, prescribed or approved by a \n     physician or other provider will not establish that care is \n     medically necessary.\n\n  Let me just make sure everybody understands what this says. It says \nwe do not care whether a doctor or a nurse or any kind of provider has \nrecommended, provided, prescribed, or approved a given treatment. We \nare going to be the ones to make the decision about medical necessity, \nnot them. Could it be any more blatant than that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question on that, just to \nmake sure I understand it? And I am so happy to hear my leader on the \nfloor on this issue.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy too.\n  Mrs. BOXER. For example, a doctor examined a child and determined \nthat child had a rare form of cancer. I had a constituent with this \ncircumstance. It was a rare form of cancer, say, of the kidney, which \nhappened to be the case, and she needed immediate surgery by a \nspecialist who had done this operation before, because, by the very \nnature of it, it is a very dangerous operation, and the doctor said \nthis is the only way this child could live.\n  Is my friend saying in that particular situation the bureaucrats and \nthe businessmen in the HMO could essentially say: That is very \ninteresting, but the child will have to go see the cancer doctor who is \nin our plan, and she may not go and see this specialist who actually \ncould, in fact, save her life because he or she has done this operation \nbefore? Is that the essence of it?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is the essence of it. The Senator from California \nhas put her finger on it precisely. What it is saying is, we as an \ninsurance company or we as a HMO will override whatever decisions are \nmade by doctors, by nurses, by nurse practitioners, by any kind of \nprovider, if we find it is in our financial interest to do so.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What my friend is saying, further, is that in the \nDemocratic Patients' Bill of Rights, we were going to offer an \namendment as soon as we could on this--and that would be our first \namendment--to ensure that the definition of what is medically necessary \nis made by the physician and health care professionals, not by the \nbusiness people with the green eyeshades who have no degree in \nmedicine. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely right. Let me just say, she \nasks exactly the right question because there is a followup requirement \nhere which we will deal with in another amendment. What happens if \nthere is a dispute? Right now, the insurance company holds all the \ncards.\n  The insurance company says: In the case of a dispute, we will make \nthe decision about whether the patient is right or wrong. Our bill \nsays: No, wait a minute; we are going to have a fresh review of the \nfacts by an outside authority. They will make the decision as to \nwhether the procedure was medically necessary or not. There has to be \nsomebody outside the insurance company making that decision, or what \ngood is it for us to guarantee these very important rights to all \npatients?\n  But I really appreciate the Senator from California making that \npoint.\n  I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the minority leader for coming to the floor.\n  For those who have been following this debate for the 10 days or more \nnow that we have tried to focus the attention of the Senate on this \nPatients' Bill of Rights, this is the health insurance issue which \nAmerican families are focused on already. We have talked about a lot of \nthings on Capitol Hill, but it is time to talk about the things that \nare important to them.\n  In the example the Senator from South Dakota and the Senator from \nCalifornia addressed, about a doctor being overruled, is it not also \nthe case that in some of these same insurance policies the doctor \ncannot even tell the patient that he has been overruled by an insurance \ncompany, that, in fact, it is not his best medical judgment, but, in \nfact, the judgment of some bureaucrat in an insurance company that is \ngoing to dictate the treatment the patient receives?\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely right. In fact, in response to \nthe good question posed by the Senator from Illinois, let me read the \nsecond statement of policy by another insurance company regarding this \nvery question. Here is the statement of policy relating to medical \nnecessity of a second insurance company.\n  Again, my colleagues, I am not making this up. We did not write this. \nThis is written by the insurance company:\n\n       Medical necessity means the shortest, least expensive or \n     least intense level of treatment, care or service rendered, \n     or supply provided, as determined by us, to the extent \n     required to diagnose or treat an injury or sickness.\n\n  This is actually out of the policy:\n\n       Medical necessity means the shortest, least expensive or \n     least intense level of treatment, care or service rendered, \n     or supply provided, as determined by us. . . .\n\n  Do we need a Patients' Bill of Rights, when you take this right out \nof a health insurance manual: Medical necessity is determined by the \nshortest or least expensive way with which to provide service to a \npatient?\n  It doesn't end there:\n\n       The service or supply must be consistent with the insured \n     person's medical condition at the time the service was \n     rendered, and it is not provided primarily for the \n     convenience of the injured person or doctor.\n\n  No wonder people go nuts when they talk about insurance policies \ntoday and what is going on out there, when they combat an insurance \ncompany that includes a provision like this. They may not have read all \nthe fine print, but when a company says we are going to determine \nmedical necessity by what is the shortest or least expensive--the \nSenator from Illinois is exactly right --this overrides everything.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from South Dakota, the Democratic \nleader, to yield for this question. This is clearly an interesting and \nimportant debate on health insurance and protection for American \nfamilies. What is stopping the Senate from engaging in this debate?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I must say, some of our colleagues on the other side \ntell us they would rather not have to vote on this. They do not want to \nhave to vote on amendments about medical necessity. That is what is \nstopping it right now. We are at an impasse because we believe this is \nsuch an important issue that votes and amendments on questions like \nmedical necessity ought to be a part of any legitimate debate on a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. That is why we are not in agreement today. We \nfeel those amendments are required if we are going to have a good \ndebate. Our colleagues have at least today refused to allow them.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from South Dakota will yield?\n  When he talks about medical necessity, I am reminded of two specific \nissues. One, the doctor who testified at a hearing before the Congress \nwho worked for a managed care organization, who said: I caused the \ndeath of a man. She said it to a near-empty hearing room when the \ntelevision cameras were gone. She was the last witness of a day.\n  I caused the death of a man, she said. I wasn't reproached for that. \nI wasn't issued any sanctions. In fact, my employer really felt quite \ngood about it. I was rewarded for it. I withheld treatment that could \nhave saved that person's life.\n  She was dealing at that point as an employee of an HMO, and a patient \napparently needed some kind of heart procedure that was very expensive. \nThe HMO said it was not a medical necessity. The patient died. This \nlady left her employment and later testified before the Congress and \nsaid it was a matter of dollars and cents. I caused the death of a man, \nbut I was lauded for that by my employer because, to\n\n[[Page S7498]]\n\nthem, it was a matter of dollars and cents. So that relates to medical \nnecessity. What is necessary?\n  The second item I was thinking about, I know the Senator from South \nDakota was at an event one day; the Senator from California, Mrs. \nBoxer, was at the same event. Dr. Ganske, a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, who is a Republican and has been a strong supporter of \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights, held up a poster, a colored picture of a \nyoung boy. That young boy had no upper lip and no structure beneath his \nnose--a giant gaping hole. He was born with a very severe birth defect. \nIt looked awful. One was hardly able to look at that young boy's face \nand not immediately say what incredible disfigurement this young boy \nhas.\n  Dr. Ganske, who was speaking that day, said: The HMO said there was \nnot a medical necessity for this young boy to receive repairs. In \ndollars and cents, the repair of that horrible disfigurement did not \nmake any sense to the HMO. But then he showed a picture of this young \nboy having gone through reconstructive surgery, and you saw a face, a \nwonderful face of a young boy which had been repaired and now that \nyoung boy had hope. One could sense the smile in that picture, and that \nis what medical necessity is.\n  It is not convenience. It is not just dollars and cents. It is \ninvestments in human beings, giving hope to a young boy.\n  I have one other person, if I may, whom I want to mention and whom I \nhave mentioned before. He is a young boy born with horrible problems. \nThe doctors said he would have a 50-percent chance of walking by age 5 \nif he had a certain kind of therapy.\n  The HMO said: A 50-percent chance of walking by age 5 is \n``insignificant,'' which means that in dollars and cents they withhold \nthe therapy and the young boy is not able to walk. He doesn't have the \nchance to learn to walk.\n  That is dollars and cents versus medical necessity. That is what is \nat issue. What is at issue is the ability to empower patients with the \nopportunity to get needed medical treatment, not necessarily the \ncheapest treatment, but the best treatment, not necessarily the \ntreatment that someone in an insurance office a thousand miles away \nthinks might or might not be necessary, but what the doctor in the \ndoctor's office thinks is necessary for that young boy's life, such as \nthe reconstructive surgery of that boy's face.\n  That is what I think about when the Senator speaks about medical \nnecessity. This is not theory. It is not some abstract term. It is an \nimportant part of lives, and that is why the Patients' Bill of Rights \nis so critically important and why the difference between what we are \ntalking about and others are talking about is so stark.\n  We adopt the title, Patients' Bill of Rights, and then they say: We \nhave one, too. Sure you have one. It is like picking up a turtle shell \nwithout a turtle in it. It is a shell. It does not mean anything. It \ndoes not provide the guarantees for people. That young boy would not \nhave had his reconstructive surgery. The other young boy would not have \nhad a chance to walk. And the list goes on. That is why these \ndifferences are so important.\n  Medical necessity, guaranteed emergency room treatment, the gag rule, \nunderstanding all your medical options for treatment, not just the \ncheapest--all of these things are critical differences, and it is why I \nbelieve they do not want to allow the Senator from South Dakota to \nbring the bill before the Senate. We need to vote on these things, if \nnot in total, then one by one, to find out where do my colleagues stand \non it. Do they stand for the right of emergency room treatment? Do they \nstand for the right of reconstructive surgery for that young boy? Where \ndo they stand on these specific issues?\n  That is what is going to happen in the coming days. Like it or not, \nwe are going to force them to face that, because the American people \ndeserve the opportunity to have a Patients' Bill of Rights passed by \nthis Congress empowering them.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for 30 seconds before he responds?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. In 30 seconds, I want to put a bigger picture on it. I \nhad the pleasure of being at a press conference with the Senator from \nMaryland, Ms. Mikulski, and she made a point. She said this century has \nbeen the greatest century known to humankind for finding new options \nfor care, new research, gene research. We know more now than we ever \nknew before, and how ironic it is that at a point in time, going into \nthe next century, when we know more than any other nation in the world, \nin this country HMOs are denying our people access so they cannot \nbenefit from this research.\n\n  As the Senator from South Dakota talks about medical necessity, if he \ncan weave that into his comments, I will be very interested in his \nresponse.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from California makes a very important \npoint. It is our research and the extraordinary benefits that have come \nfrom it that have made a difference in people's lives all over the \nworld. How ironic, after the American people spend valued tax dollars \nin support of research which is changing the quality of life for \nmillions of people, that there are insurance companies denying patients \nthe opportunity to benefit from research today.\n  What happens? The benefits of that research goes abroad. It goes to \nEurope. It goes to Asia. It goes to Latin America. Thank goodness it \ndoes. But why should it go there and not be allowed here?\n  We use the term ``clinical trials.'' It is a technical term. I like \nto get away from it, because I am not sure people understand what \nclinical trials are. Basically, when we talk about clinical trials, we \ntalk about the right to ensure we benefit from innovative research. We \nshould encourage experimental treatments when they are in the interest \nof the patient, and the doctor recommends them. That should be part of \na Patients' Bill of Rights. But there is a chasm between Republicans \nand Democrats on that issue. Our Republican colleagues said: No, oh, \nno, that ought to be a decision the insurance company makes, not the \ndoctor, not the patient.\n  I hope we keep talking about research and who benefits and how \npreposterous it is that in this country, even though we have these \nfundamental and extraordinary new possibilities to improved lives, \nthere are insurance companies at this very moment that have just denied \nsomebody access to that research.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is always so eloquent and so compelling \nin his comments. Again this morning he demonstrated why he enjoys the \nextraordinary respect of Senators on both sides of the aisle. One \ncannot talk in human terms, in personal terms very long, as he did, and \nnot understand the importance of this issue. You can talk legalisms all \nyou want. But if you put it in human life terms, as the Senator from \nNorth Dakota did--he put it in terms of life and death; he put it in \nterms of helping a young child--all of a sudden the light comes on and \nyou understand why, when an insurance company actually has the audacity \nto write, ``Medical necessity means shortest, least expensive, or least \nintense level of treatment,'' why that young boy did not get his facial \nproblems fixed. It certainly did not fit ``shortest, least expensive, \nor least intense level.''\n  That case probably is expensive. It is not a short recovery. It is \nintense. It is the absolute reverse of the definition this particular \ncompany uses for medical necessity. Of course, it was medically \nnecessary if that young boy's life meant anything. Of course, it was \nrequired if our society is going to be responsive at all. But for any \ncompany to say, we don't care what the doctor says, we don't care how \ninappropriate it may be to override a decision made by a doctor and his \nor her patient, we are going to decide the medical necessity of a \ntreatment based on how short it is, how inexpensive it is or how much \nit lacks intensity, that says in spades why this debate is important. \nIt says why we will not give up our rights to offer amendments to \nensure that issues like this are properly addressed. We will not walk \naway from this debate.\n  We must have an opportunity to have a good debate with good \namendments on issues as important as this, and we can do it. There is a \nway to work through this procedure. This can be a win-win situation. I \nwant to find a way with which to ensure we can get a lot done in the \nnext 10 days, and yet accomplish what we believe so strongly\n\n[[Page S7499]]\n\nmust be a part of the Senate's agenda in this session of Congress.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to compliment \nthe prompt action of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in sending a \nforensic team to gather evidence in Kosovo for the prosecution of those \nindicted under the War Crimes Tribunal in the former Yugoslavia, which \nwould include President Milosevic.\n  Earlier this morning, FBI Director Louis Freeh announced that some 59 \nagents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, working with the Armed \nForces Institute of Pathology, have been dispatched to Macedonia--will \nbe in Kosovo--and will be, starting tomorrow, preserving evidence for \nthe prosecution of those under indictment by the War Crimes Tribunal.\n  This is a very important step because we have already had a series of \nreports about tampering with evidence, about the removal of massive \ngrave sites. The prompt action by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \nmoving to the scene of the crimes to gather evidence for use in court, \nis of the utmost importance.\n  For some 12 years, as an assistant district attorney and later as \ndistrict attorney in Philadelphia, I had experience in the gathering of \nevidence for use in the criminal prosecution process. I can personally \nattest to the importance of prompt action.\n  If you do not get the evidence while it is fresh, it may disappear; \nits quality may change unless it is preserved. So the very prompt \naction of the FBI in moving on this is very important. It is especially \nimportant as the evidence is unfolding of the crimes against humanity \nby the Serbian Armed Forces under the direction of President Milosevic.\n  President Milosevic has already been indicted. The acquisition of \nthis evidence will be key in preparing for the trial of the case. The \nlong arm of the law extends very far. It is my prediction that one day \nPresident Milosevic will be in the dock at the Hague in the criminal \ncourt there, as will be Radovan Karadzic, the former head of Bosnia, \nGeneral Mladic, and the others who are under indictment.\n  As I have noted before on the floor of the Senate, I believe that a \ncondition of the cease-fire should have been having Milosevic turned \nover to the NATO forces. We learned from the bitter experience in \nIraq--20/20 hindsight--we would have been wiser to have taken the steps \nnecessary to take Saddam Hussein into custody. Our failure to do so has \ncaused enormous problems. We have seen with Milosevic that he has \nstarted some three wars, and if he is at liberty, who knows what he may \ndo in the future. That action has already been taken.\n  It is vitally important that the evidence be preserved so that when--\nand I do not say if--but when Milosevic and the other indictees are \ntaken into custody, we will be in a position to have the prosecutors at \nthe War Crimes Tribunal present that evidence.\n  I have had the honor to visit the War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague on \na number of occasions. The prosecutors there are a very fine team. They \nhave received support from a variety of Federal agencies. The CIA has \nbeen helpful with the overhead satellites. The Department of State has \nbeen of continuing assistance. The Department of Defense has been of \nassistance. Now the action by the FBI, with the approval of the \nAttorney General, is very important.\n  This is unprecedented for the FBI to undertake this kind of \nacquisition of evidence. There are precedents in the field where the \nFBI has worked overseas on the Khobar Tower bombing in Saudi Arabia and \nwith the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The FBI was deployed to \nEl Salvador for the investigations of murders that occurred in 1983. \nThe FBI was involved in the investigation of war crimes in the former \nYugoslavia in 1993, and involved in a polygraph examination in a murder \ncase in Guatemala in 1995, and supported the investigation of a murder \nin Haiti in 1995.\n  The authority for the FBI to act on these premises is set forth in \nthe Federal statute in 28 United States Code, section 533. The \nregulations which have been promulgated under that statute make a \nspecific reference as follows:\n\n       As provided for in procedures agreed upon between the \n     Secretary of State and the Attorney General, the services of \n     the Federal Bureau of Investigation laboratory may also be \n     made available to foreign law enforcement agencies and \n     courts.\n\n  The War Crimes Tribunal would fit within that qualification as an \ninternational court.\n  The FBI will be undertaking a variety of evidence-preserving matters \nin Kosovo. They intend to establish the exact location of the crime \nscenes. They will photograph the scenes, the deceased victims, the \nevidence, map the crime scenes, collect the physical evidence related \nto indictments, examine victims for indications of the cause of death, \nindications of restraint and physical abuse, and preliminary \nidentifications. They will collect appropriate samples from victims for \npossible future identification using DNA techniques. They will work on \nforensic and scientific investigations with the Armed Forces Institute \nof Pathology. I think this is very good news, acting as promptly as \nthey are, moving in with very substantial equipment and personnel to \nundertake this important work.\n\n  The gathering of this evidence is indispensable for the trials. We \nhave an opportunity here at the War Crimes Tribunal to establish an \ninternational precedent of tremendous importance for the future. It is \nthe establishment of the rule of law in international matters to let \nany future Milosevics, who might be inclined to commit crimes against \nhumanity, know they will be brought to justice, that there is an \ninternational rule of law. I believe the apprehension and trial of \nMilosevic himself is very important, because it will be the first time \nthat a head of state will have been subjected to the criminal process.\n  I applaud what the Department of Justice is doing here. I applaud \nwhat the FBI is doing. I had an opportunity to discuss this matter \nyesterday with Director Freeh; I have talked to him from time to time. \nI think this very prompt action will be enormously important and \ninstrumental in securing justice for the convictions of the people who \nare now under indictment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of our distinguished majority \nleader, I ask unanimous consent that the period for morning business be \nextended until the hour of 2 p.m. under the same terms as previously \nsubmitted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. Again, in the absence of any Senator \nseeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This morning, as chairman of the Democratic Policy \nCommittee, I convened a hearing on the farm crisis. About 10 to 12 of \nmy colleagues came to the hearing. We had a number of family farmers \nfrom across the country testify.\n  We had Woody Barth, a farmer from Solen, ND, testify; Rob Lynch, a \nfarmer from Zillah, WA; Glenn Brackman, a\n\n[[Page S7500]]\n\nfarmer from Lafayette County, AR. We had some folks from Illinois, \nIowa, and Kentucky. We talked about the farm crisis and about public \npolicies that ought to be employed by this Congress to respond to the \nfarm crisis.\n  I pointed out that a lot of people are not aware of the farm crisis. \nIt is probably a circumstance that farmers working in quiet \ndesperation, many of them threatened with losing their farms, are going \nthrough a period that most Americans do not understand and don't know \nabout.\n  Every day we hear the stock market is up or down, mostly up--the \nstock market has gone to 11,000, now back down a bit. But the fact is, \nthis country generally hears good economic news about where the stock \nmarket is going, about new information technology, about the progress \nof new companies, about the new day, about the global economy. Yet the \nfolks who stay at home and produce America's food on our family farms \nare in desperate trouble.\n  Wendell Barry, a farmer from Port Royal, KY, testified today. He is \nalso an author, a wonderful guy, kind of a philosopher-writer type. He \nwrote some things. In fact, he has written a book called ``Another Turn \nof the Crank.''\n  I will read a couple things he has written that I think really bear \non this issue. I do it in the context of the bill that is to be on the \nfloor. We did have the agriculture appropriations bill on the floor of \nthe Senate. It will come back, hopefully, as soon as an agreement is \nreached with respect to the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  When it comes back to the floor, Senator Harkin and I intend to offer \nan amendment similar to the amendment we offered during the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill. That amendment lost on a 14-to-14 tie \nvote in the conference.\n  We also offered a proposal in the agriculture appropriations \nsubcommittee. But this is the time, when the agriculture appropriations \nbill is on the floor, for the Congress to decide what it will do with \nrespect to emergency responses to the farm crisis.\n  There are some who might counsel we should do nothing, that it \ndoesn't matter whether there are farmers in this country. They would \nsay: Food will be produced anyway, and it doesn't matter much who \nproduces it. We can farm America from California to Maine with \ncorporate farms, and that is just fine.\n  I do not happen to share that view. I think that is a view that is \ndevoid of all common sense. It suggests there is no worth and no value \nat all to the culture of family farming, that family farming doesn't \ncontribute to our country, that the fact there are people living out on \nthe land is irrelevant. The fact that those people combine to make \nsmall communities and build our main streets and build our churches and \ncreate good neighborhoods is irrelevant; that kind of investment and \nthat kind of creation in our country doesn't count.\n  I guess those who think that way look through the lens of perhaps \nWall Street or others who see only dollars and cents, only rows of \ncolumns. You add them up or you subtract them. You reach a balance, and \nthat is the cost. It just eliminates, of course, the question of what \nis the value. Are family farmers contributing value to this country? \nWill the loss of family farmers matter to our country? The answer is \nyes on both counts.\n  Mr. Wendell Barry from Port Royal, KY, writes:\n\n       As we all know, we have much to answer for in our use of \n     this continent from the beginning, but in the last half \n     century we have added to our desecrations of nature a \n     deliberate destruction of our rural communities. The \n     statistics I cited at the beginning are incontrovertible \n     evidence of this.\n\n  He cited statistics about the loss of farms, the depopulation of our \nfarm belt, and so on.\n\n       But so is the condition of our farms and forests and rural \n     towns. If you have eyes to see, you can see that there is a \n     limit beyond which machines and chemicals cannot replace \n     people; there is a limit beyond which mechanical or economic \n     efficiency cannot replace care.\n       I am talking here about the common experience, the common \n     fate of rural communities in our country for a long time. It \n     has been, and it will increasingly be, the common fate of \n     rural communities in other countries. The message is plain \n     enough, and we have ignored it too long: the great, \n     centralized economic entities of our time do not come into \n     rural places in order to improve them by ``creating jobs.'' \n     They come to take as much value as they can take, as cheaply \n     and as quickly as they can take it. They are interested in \n     ``job creation'' only so long as the jobs can be done much \n     more cheaply by humans than by machines.\n\n  Mr. Barry writes, about liberals and conservatives, an interesting \nadmonition:\n\n       Long experience has made it clear--as we might say to the \n     liberals--that to be free we must limit the size of \n     government and we must have some sort of home rule. But it is \n     just as clear--as we might say to the conservatives--that it \n     is foolish to complain about big government if we do not do \n     everything we can to support strong local communities and \n     strong community economies.\n\n  He is right about that.\n  We must decide as a Congress whether we are going to support \nAmerica's family farms. I spoke at the hearing today, when I questioned \nthe witnesses, about where I come from. I have told colleagues often \nabout that. I come from a rural county in southwestern North Dakota \nthat is the size of the State of Rhode Island. That county had 5,000 \npeople when I left, and there are now 3,000 people living in that \ncounty. The county next to it is about the same size and there are 900 \npeople living in that county.\n  We are fast depopulating rural America. Rural economies in small \ntowns are shrinking like prunes. We now have prices for commodities, \nwhen the family farmer raises a crop and hauls it to the market, that \nare deplorable. The family farmer is told when he or she takes a \ntruckload of wheat to the country elevator--the grain trade says: This \ndoesn't have value. The food you produce is not of great interest to \nus. It is not worth very much.\n  At the same time, we have people who come and testify before the \nCongress that the Sudan, for instance, old women climb trees to try to \nfind leaves to eat. We know much of the world is hungry, and we also \nknow that while much of the world is hungry, the grain market tells our \nfarmers their food isn't worth very much.\n  Something is not connected there, and this Congress must try to \nreconnect it.\n  We only have two choices, it seems to me. One is an opportunity, on \nan short-term emergency basis, to pass an emergency farm bill. It seems \nto me the question for this Congress is: Are we going to pass a short-\nterm emergency bill to try to help family farmers? Second, are we going \nto repair the farm program, and the trade agreements, and other things \nthat conspire to injure family farmers?\n  On the first issue, Senator Harkin and I intend to offer an amendment \nfor $5 billion to $6 billion to try to provide short-term emergency \nhelp for family farmers on this agriculture appropriations bill when it \nis brought back to the floor. We will have a fight about that. I don't \nknow how that will turn out. I hope Congress will say that family \nfarmers matter.\n  It was interesting to me that when the President sent a request down \nfor military aid to restore and refresh the accounts in the Pentagon \nfor conducting airstrikes in Kosovo, Congress said to the President: \nNo, you are wrong about that, Mr. President, you didn't ask for enough \nmoney. We insist that you give $6 billion more. Mr. President, you \nshortchanged us in your request for defense, so we are going to give \nyou what you ask for and we are going to add $6 billion more to your \nrequest for defense.\n  Well, gee, that came from conservatives. I hope those same \nconservatives will agree that the effort to save America's family \nfarmers is as important. Don't tell me there is not money. There was \nmoney to say to the President we want to add $6 billion above what the \nPentagon said it needed. If there is money to do that, there is surely \nmoney to invest in family farmers in rural America. So my hope will be \nthat we are able, on a short-term basis, to pass an emergency bill; \nand, second, having done that, we will then revisit the question of the \nunderlying farm program.\n  This farm program is not working. It ought to be apparent to \neveryone. The farm program that the Congress passed essentially said \nlet us do whatever the marketplace says ought to be done. But there is \nnot a free market in agriculture. There is not now, and has not been, a \nfree market in agriculture. Our farmers look at trade, and what they\n\n[[Page S7501]]\n\nfind is that markets are closed to them in many corners of the world. \nSo we raise a product we want to sell overseas and the markets are \nclosed. Or if you raise, for example, beef, you will discover not only \nare the markets closed in some areas, but in other areas, such as \nJapan, you will pay a 45-percent tariff to get American beef into \nJapan, only to find out that the Canadian beef --both live cattle and \nhogs, and slaughtered beef and hogs--coming down is increasing at a \nvery rapid pace. So we have grain and livestock coming in undercutting \nour markets. We find foreign markets are not open to us, and we have \nall of these trade negotiators running around doing trade agreements \nthat have undercut our agriculture producers.\n\n  We need a farm program that works and trades policies that make more \nsense than the current policies. I voted against NAFTA and the United \nStates-Canada free trade agreement, and I voted against the GATT \nagreement. I did all of that because I think that, while we need \nexpanded trade, we do not, and should not, embrace trade agreements \nthat are fundamentally unfair to rural America.\n  I recall when I was on the House Ways and Means Committee and the \nUnited States-Canada free trade agreement came to the committee, and \nthe Trade Ambassador, who I won't name--Clayton Yeutter--said to us \nthat the trade agreement itself would not result in a massive flood of \nCanadian grain coming across our border. I said, well, I think it will, \nand you know it will. ``Put it in writing,'' I said. The Trade \nAmbassador wrote to us on the committee guaranteeing that it would not \nhappen. It wasn't worth the paper it was written on.\n  It happened, and it happened quickly. Not only did it happen--massive \nquantities of durum and spring wheat came across our border flooding \nour market, undercutting the market for American farmers--but we were \nthen neutered in our ability to respond to it because he also traded \naway the remedies. So we didn't have a remedy for it.\n  That was in the United States-Canada free trade agreement. That \npassed the House Ways and Means Committee 34-1. I was the one. I didn't \nfeel lonely a bit because I knew exactly what was going to happen with \nthe agreement. Farmers' interests were traded away. In my judgment, we \nought not accept trade agreements like that, whether it is United \nStates-Canada, NAFTA, or GATT.\n  Speaking of NAFTA, after the United States-Canada free trade \nagreement, they negotiated NAFTA. The economists were telling us what a \ngreat deal it was. After the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, \nthe trade surplus we had with Mexico turned into a big deficit in a \nshort time. The trade deficit with Canada doubled in a short time. \nInstead of creating new jobs in this country, we lost massive numbers \nof jobs. All these economists who were predicting 300,000 jobs were \njust fundamentally wrong. We lost a lot of jobs as a result of that.\n  They said if we just pass these agreements, we will get from Mexico \nthe product of low-skill wages. Do you know what we got? The three \nbiggest products coming in from Mexico are automobiles, electronics, \nand automobile parts--all products of high-skilled labor. We now have \nmore automobiles imported into this country from Mexico than the United \nStates exports to all the rest of the world. That is what we got with \nNAFTA--again, undercutting our interests, hurting a lot of producers in \nthis country, and especially injuring family farmers.\n\n  Well, the point I am making is this: We had testimony this morning \nfrom folks who came from across the country to say we have a very \nserious problem in rural America. We can't fix that problem on a \npartisan basis. We need Republicans and Democrats together to agree \nthat, No. 1, there is a farm crisis, and, No. 2, they are willing to do \nsomething about it, to respond on an emergency basis, and then to \nrepair a farm program that is fundamentally deficient, which doesn't \nvalue family farming, a farm program that says it doesn't matter who \nfarms. That, in my judgment, misses a lot of what is important in \nAmerican life.\n  My hope is that in the next couple of days, as we offer amendments--\nSenator Harkin, myself, and others--on an emergency basis, we will be \nable to strike a bipartisan agreement to do the right thing on behalf \nof family farmers. I know that it is a message that some get tired of \nhearing, perhaps, but I come from farm country and I care a lot about \nwhat is happening out in our part of the country.\n  North Dakota is a wonderful State. It has a lot of rural counties, \nand the fact is that not just family farmers but machinery and \nequipment dealers, Main Street businesses, and so many other people are \nsuffering so much through this economic distress, even at a time when \nthe rest of the country seems to be doing so well.\n  I had a letter from a young boy who talked about the distress his \nfolks were going through while trying to hang onto their family farm. \nHe said: My dad can feed 180 people, and he can't feed his family. He \nwas talking about the fact that the family farm is so productive in \nthis country, and they are losing so much money. You hear this over and \nover again.\n  This Congress, it seems to me, must respond. We are going to try to \nforce that response, first with respect to the underlying agriculture \nappropriations bill with an emergency package, and, second, hopefully, \nto revisit and readdress the entire structure embodied in the \nunderlying farm bill.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nbody for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/23/senate-section/article/S7501-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7501-S7505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am here, of course, to discuss what \nmany of my colleagues have discussed in the past--the need for us to \ndebate totally and openly the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is an issue \nof great concern to the people of my State. Everywhere I go--urban, \nrural, suburban--people are asking: What is happening to the Patients' \nBill of Rights?\n  This is an issue many of us have discussed. I know this body debated \nit for a little while last year, but, unfortunately, things were left \nunresolved. It has not been left unresolved for the millions of \nAmericans who are now having their medical policies dictated, not by \ntheir doctor, not by their nurse, not by their family, but rather by \nsome unknown bureaucrat who has no medical education but is simply part \nof an HMO.\n\n  When you go to hospital after hospital throughout the State of New \nYork and sit with doctors, you see the frustration in their eyes as \nthey tell you story after story. They have been negotiating with these \nactuaries. They say to the actuary: Are you a medical doctor? How can \nyou tell me the patient does not need this type of operation or this \ntype of medication? They get no good medical answers. To them, it is \nsimilar to going to medical school and spending years of internship and \nresidency and it makes very little difference.\n  For that reason, our health care system--by the way, I give good \nmarks to our health care system. It has been overwhelmingly successful. \nThe average age of Americans is higher than ever before. Not only do we \nlive longer but we live healthier longer.\n  I look at my parents. Thank God. Praise God. Just last week each of \nthem had a birthday. One is 76 and one is 71. My dad has had a few \nhealth mishaps, but he is in good health. It is in part because of our \nmedical system. But we have been losing so many of these benefits in \nthe last several years, because the pendulum has swung too far in the \ndirection of the HMOs. We find more people who have had no training in \nmedicine overruling doctors in medical procedures, because the book of \nstandard operating procedures dictates the limited number of options. \nWe don't want that. Most Americans don't want it.\n  That is why we need to debate this Patients' Bill of Rights. We need \nto debate its scope: Should it cover only 50 million Americans, or \nshould it cover\n\n[[Page S7502]]\n\ncloser to 150 million Americans? We need to debate its provisions: How \nlong a review process should there be? Should it be internal or \nexternal? Should an HMO be allowed to have the last word on a life-or-\ndeath procedure that the physician believes is very much needed? Should \nthere be a gag rule? Should physicians be ordered not to tell their \npatients about certain procedures or certain medications that are \navailable? Should women have the right to choose their obstetrician and \ngynecologist who is often their primary care physician?\n  These are all important issues. I know there are Members on the other \nside who talk about freedom of choice. People talk about costs. I don't \nagree with those arguments, but I would certainly like to debate them \nin this distinguished Chamber.\n  I ran, as I know you did, Mr. President, and many others, for the \nSenate from the House because I thought that we would have the \nopportunity to debate the great issues. There was certainly no \nguarantee that we would win. There was certainly no guarantee that my \nbeliefs would prevail. But I thought there was something of a \nguarantee--that the wide open debate the Senate has been known for for \nover 200 years would be guaranteed even to somebody who sits way over \nin this corner of the Chamber, which means you are a freshman at the \nbottom of the seniority pecking order. It hasn't happened.\n  The reason this floor is silent right now, and the reason we are not \ndebating other bills, is that many of us believe strongly we should \ndebate the Patients' Bill of Rights. But we also believe the ability to \ndebate issues of importance to us--that has been a hallmark of this \nbody--should not be extinguished, should not be snuffed out.\n\n  I would like to know answers to certain things. I would like to know \nanswers to the kinds of examples I have heard about in my State and \nthroughout the country.\n  I would like to know, for instance, what happened to a woman who had \nterrible back pain and required two surgeries to repair her spine. The \nHMO denied coverage for the $7,000 for the second surgery. The doctor \nthen stated to the woman that he would be committing malpractice if he \ndidn't perform the second operation, because the whole procedure \nentailed two of them; the HMO said one. The patient offered to pay out \nof pocket. Both surgeries were done. But in this case the surgeon--a \nvery generous person--declined to take the money from the woman. Why \ndid that happen? Why did this physician believe so strongly that the \nwoman needed the second surgery that was denied by the HMO?\n  How about an incident where a New York man slipped and cracked his \nskull as he was getting out of the taxi? The taxi driver called 911. \nThe victim was rushed to an emergency room for treatment. But this \nepisode did not have prior authorization as an emergency, so the HMO \nrefused to pay the bill.\n  Again, what has happened here? Have we become so bureaucratic and so \nnarrow in the way we practice health care in America that common sense \nhas been thrown out the window?\n  Another example: An HMO denied another New Yorker who suffered from \nmultiple sclerosis physical therapy despite the opinion of the doctor \nand the neurologist that this was the only way this patient could \nrecover.\n  Another example: A mother called her HMO at 3:30 a.m. to report that \nher 6-month-old boy had a fever of 104 degrees and was panting and was \nlimp. The hotline nurse told the woman to take her child to the HMO's \nnetwork hospital 42 miles away, passing several closer hospitals. By \nthe time the baby reached the hospital, he was in cardiac arrest and \nhad already suffered severe damage to his limbs. As a result, both his \nhands and legs had to be amputated. The court found the HMO at fault. \nThe family received a large financial settlement. As sure as we are \nhere, that family would give back every nickel and pay more for that \nnot to have happened.\n  These are not isolated examples. There are so many that it is hard to \ngo through our jobs as Senators of the 50 States without hearing when \nyou go to a town hall meeting, or when you go to a veterans hall, or \nwhen you go to a chamber of commerce meeting that somebody makes their \ncomplaint about this issue.\n\n  These examples need answers. I believe the answers in this bill, the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, are the right answers. I may be dissuaded \nfrom all or parts of that answer by my colleagues. If we don't debate \nthe issues, we are never going to be able to determine that. If we \ndon't debate the issues, we are not going to be able to move forward on \na Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  If we continue in a pro forma fashion--we vote our bill; the other \nside votes their bill; then the issue is forgotten because we know the \nbill on the other side will not become law--we are not helping our \nconstituency.\n  The bottom line is simple: I believe strongly we need the Patients' \nBill of Rights or something close to it. My colleagues and I want to \ndebate. We want the opportunity to debate these issues. If the other \nside changes our mind, so be it; if we change their mind, great.\n  Without debate, we will have no progress, and we will continue to \nhear the stories we are hearing, much to the detriment of the health \ncare of the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank my colleagues for their efforts on the floor to \nhighlight the Patients' Bill of Rights, a bill to empower people around \nthe country who rely on HMOs and other managed care programs for their \nhealth care needs. I join them today in enthusiastic support for badly \nneeded legislation that will expand protections for patients who are at \nthe mercy of managed care practices.\n  I strongly support the principles of improving access, quality, and \naccountability in the delivery of managed care. I believe we can \nachieve valuable patient protections by passing a bill that ensures \nsome commonsense protections, access to emergency care, access to \nspecialists, and a strong internal as well as external appeals process.\n  We need to keep medical decisions in the hands of doctors. We have to \nensure that managed care entities are held legally accountable for \nadministrative decisions that affect patient care and well-being. \nProtections are extremely important to restoring a sense of security \nand control to managed care enrollees and their doctors.\n  The protections in this bill are being debated on the Senate floor, \nbut they are also being lobbied furiously in the halls of Congress. \nSome of the most powerful and influential interest groups in this \ncountry have a huge stake in seeing this bill fail, while others want \nit to succeed.\n  Last week, I announced on the floor that from time to time I will \npoint out the role of special interest money in our legislative \nprocess. I call it the 800-pound gorilla sitting in this Chamber every \nday that nobody talks about, but that cannot be ignored. I said I will \nstart calling attention to this gorilla more often through an effort \nthat I have dubbed, ``The Calling of the Bankroll,'' where I discuss \nhow much money different interests lobbying a particular bill have made \nin campaign contributions in order to influence our work in this \nChamber.\n  I can't think of a better issue than managed care and the future of \nmanaged care to once again call the bankroll.\n  Let me give four quick examples. One, the managed care industry: What \ndoes it want? The managed care industry wants to prevent any further \nregulation of the industry, and it doesn't want to be held liable when \nadministrative decisions and policies affect the health, or even the \nvery lives, of patients.\n  What did managed care give? During the last election cycle, managed \ncare companies and their groups made more than $3.4 million in soft \nmoney, PAC and individual contributions. This is roughly double what \nthey spent during the last mid-term election cycle of 1993-1994. Their \ncontributions keep increasing.\n  A second example is the pharmaceutical industry. What do they want? \nThey have a big interest in the kind of drugs managed care patients \nhave access to.\n  What did they give? Behind their point of view is the weight of at \nleast $10.6 million in PAC and soft money contributions. That is how \nmuch the pharmaceutical and medical supplies industries gave during \n1997 and 1998.\n  A third example: The doctors, the AMA, what do they want? Of course,\n\n[[Page S7503]]\n\ndoctors have an interest in seeing managed care reform. They want to \neliminate restrictions on doctor-patient communication. More broadly, \nthey want to prevent managed care companies from exerting further \ncontrol over the way they practice medicine.\n  What did they give? The AMA made significant PAC and soft money \ndonations during the last election cycle, more than $2.4 million worth.\n  A fourth example: Organized labor, what does it want? It is a strong \nsupporter of the Patients' Bill of Rights. Unions are also major \ncampaign contributors.\n  What did they give? The AFL-CIO alone gave parties and candidates \nclose to $2 million in 1997 and 1998.\n\n  I am sure there are other interests that should be included on this \nlist. I urge my colleagues to come to the floor and add to this list so \nthere will be as full a picture as possible of the money behind and \nagainst this piece of legislation. I think it is relevant to what is \nhappening on the Senate floor.\n  Why should Americans care? While many Americans rightly worry about \nthe quality of their health care, I believe the quantity of campaign \ncontributions that may affect that care should also be of serious \nconcern. The huge quantity of campaign contributions influences the \nvery terms of the health care debate itself, how health care is \ndiscussed, and whether some health care issues are even discussed at \nall.\n  Wouldn't it be better if the public could have confidence that we are \ndeciding crucial issues such as the rights of Americans covered by \nmanaged care, without the shadow cast by campaign contributions, \nwithout the 800-pound gorilla sitting here on the floor?\n  I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to call the bankroll on \nthis issue. Information about campaign contributions should be easily \navailable to my colleagues and to the public to clearly demonstrate the \nconnection between what the wealthy interests want in Washington and \nwhat the average American gets on Main Street.\n  It is time to debate, amend, and come to conclusion on a Patients' \nBill of Rights. These are health care issues with real consequences for \nordinary Americans at the doctor's office, the pharmacy, the emergency \nroom, and the admitting desk.\n  We have to ask: When your critically ill child needs to see a \nspecialist, do you want to think that laws affecting decisions on care \nare influenced by campaign contributions or have been made based on a \nthoughtful, reasoned debate.\n  I think the American people deserve better than this. Until we have \ncampaign finance reform, our debate on crucial issues such as health \ncare is going to be carried out under the shadow of these huge amounts \nof money and the influence that so many Americans are convinced they \nwield.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin, the Senator from New \nYork, and so many others who have come to the floor this morning and \nearly this afternoon to talk about the Patients' Bill of Rights. For \nthose who may not be familiar with the term, it is an effort to pass \ninto law protections for individual Americans and their families when \nthey have to deal with an insurance company.\n  The Rand Corporation tells us that 115 million Americans have had a \nbad experience with a health insurance company, or they know someone \nwho has--perhaps someone in their family. Those bad experiences run the \ngamut of being denied access to the doctor you want to go to, being \ndenied access to a specialist in a case where you think one is \nnecessary, or medically necessary in the view of another doctor, being \nunable to go to the emergency room closest to your home because your \npolicy said no, you have to go across town or perhaps to another \nlocation for the emergency room in another hospital, dealing with a \ndoctor who may not be able, under the terms of his contract, to even \ntell you what is best for you medically, having doctors who are losing \nout in the debate with bureaucrats at health insurance companies.\n\n  One doctor in Joliet, IL, frustrated with the voice on the other end \nof the telephone at the insurance company who kept saying no, no, no, \nevery time this doctor told the insurance company what the insured \npatient needed, finally said to this voice: Wait a minute, are you a \ndoctor?\n  And the voice said: No.\n  Well, are you a nurse?\n  No.\n  Are you a college graduate?\n  Well, no.\n  Are you a high school graduate?\n  Yes.\n  What gives you the authority in this insurance company to overrule my \nmedical decision?\n  She said: I go by the rules--the rules of the insurance company.\n  Rules, frankly, that are driven not so much by the need for quality \ncare but by the bottom line.\n  The health care system in this country is in a state of crisis. The \nquestion is whether this body, the Senate, which is supposed to be the \nmost deliberative body in American politics, will even consider the \nissue. We are now tied up in knots over whether we can debate this \nissue. Isn't it ironic. The argument made by the Republican side is, we \ndo not have time to debate this issue. Time? It is 1:30 in the \nafternoon. We spent the entire morning talking about this issue. Why \ndon't we spend this time actually debating the issue? Let the \nRepublicans put their best plan forward, let us put our plan forward, \nand let's vote. That is what this body is supposed to be about--not \nducking and weaving and avoiding the issue but facing it. That is what \nit is about.\n  I stand by the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights. I think our \napproach is a better approach. It includes a lot of provisions that, \nfrankly, just make sense to most people.\n  First, doctors should make medical decisions, not insurance company \nbureaucrats.\n  Second, if you need a specialist and your doctor says that is the \nbest thing for you or your baby, you have access to that specialist.\n  Third, if you are a woman and believe your primary care physician \nshould be your OB/GYN, whom you are confident in dealing with, you have \nthat right.\n  Fourth, if the insurance company makes a bad decision--if the \ninsurance company denies you care, overrules your doctor, sends you \nhome--you have a right to hold that insurance company accountable.\n  Let me be honest about what that means. It means the possibility the \ninsurance company might have to go to court. The Republican side of the \naisle just says, oh, you are not for health care; you are for more \nlitigation; you want more people in court.\n\n  No. But I can tell you, every American, every American company, is \nsubject to that same rule except health insurance companies. They have \nan exception in the law. You cannot sue them for anything more than the \ncost of the procedure.\n  This Senator and everyone in the gallery and all listening will be \nheld accountable for their actions. If I did something so foolish as to \ndrink and drive and hurt someone, I would be hauled into court. I \nshould be. That is something you expect in America. If you ask \nbusinessmen, they say: Yes, if we sell a product that is defective and \nwe hurt someone, we are going to be held accountable. But health \ninsurance companies are not held accountable. They make life-and-death \ndecisions, and the Republicans in their so-called Patients' Bill of \nRights do not want them to be held accountable. They think insurance \ncompanies should be above the law, the only businesses in America above \nthe law. I don't think that is right.\n  The provisions in the Republican version, as opposed to the \nDemocratic version, leave 115 million Americans behind. Who is involved \nin that? If you happen to be a farmer--and I come from an agricultural \nState, Illinois--you are not going to get a protection from the \nRepublican version of the bill, only the Democratic version. If you \nhappen to be a small businessperson, self-employed, you have no \nprotection in the Republican bill. There is protection in the \nDemocratic bill. State and local employee? Same story.\n  Why would we do that? Why would we write a law saying we respect the\n\n[[Page S7504]]\n\nrights of individual Americans in dealing with their health insurance \ncompany--unless they happen to be small businesses, unless they happen \nto be farmers, unless they happen to be the local policemen we rely on \nfor safety in our community? This is worthy of a debate.\n  I think the Republicans would want to stand up and defend their point \nof view and let us defend our point of view. Then vote. But that is not \nwhat has happened. For 2 weeks we have talked about debating. For 2 \nweeks we have been here day after day asking for recognition on the \nfloor to talk about this issue, because the Republican leadership does \nnot want to face a debate and does not want to face tough votes, votes \nthat may be hard to explain back home.\n  I have quoted him before and he is worthy of another quote, a former \nCongressman from Oklahoma named Mike Synar, who used to say to \nsqueamish Congressmen when a tough vote was coming: If you don't want \nto fight fires, don't be a fireman. If you don't want to cast tough \nvotes, don't run for Congress.\n  That is what we are here for, to do the best we can, debate this, and \ncome up with a law that is good for America. Maybe we should bring in \nsome of the better provisions from the Republican side, some of the \nbetter provisions from the Democrat side, and put forth a bill that \nwill help the families in this country. But we have been stopped in our \ntracks. The leadership on the Republican side refused to give us that \nopportunity.\n  We tried yesterday, incidentally. We had an effort to amend the \nagriculture appropriations bill. You say, What does that have to do \nwith health care? Well, people who live in rural areas are concerned \nabout health care, but it was an available bill on which to try to \nbring up this issue. When we tried, we were stopped again. A vote to \ntable that effort, to stop the debate, to stop the amendments \nprevailed.\n\n  I have here a story, which I am sorry I will not have time to tell \nyou, about Michael Cahill who lives in my home State, in Chicago, IL. \nIt is a long, sad story. Michael had dizzy spells and went to a doctor \nwho thought it might have been an inner ear problem. He was sent back \nand forth. Finally, he was referred to a neurologist who performed a \nCAT scan, and 3 years after the symptoms began, they determined he had \nmultiple sclerosis, and then the insurance company said: You have to go \nback to the original doctor who did not diagnose it properly.\n  He went through a period--this goes on for pages--of fighting his \ninsurance company. This is a man who comes to realize in his adult life \nthat he has a serious medical illness, one he worries about. He worries \nabout its effect on him and his family and his future. Instead of just \nfighting the illness, he is fighting the insurance company at the same \ntime.\n  I wish this were an isolated story. It, unfortunately, is a story \nthat has been repeated time and again. It is a story which reflects the \nreality most Americans now face when it comes to health insurance.\n  We only have a limited time left this week and next before we break \nfor the Fourth of July. I am sure there will be many important issues \nwe will consider. But I will bet if I went back to Chicago or any part \nof Illinois, my hometown of Springfield, and started asking people: \nWhat really concerns you? What could we do on Capitol Hill that might \nhave an impact on your life?--if I brought up the issue of health \ninsurance, my guess is a lot of those people would say, Can you do \nsomething about this? Are your hands tied? Can the Senate really act on \nit?\n  The answer is, we can do a lot. There was a press conference this \nmorning by the women Senators who came forward and talked about some of \nthe terrible things that have occurred in the treatment of women \nreceiving these so-called drive-by mastectomies, where women literally \nhave mastectomies and, under the insurance policies, cannot stay in the \nhospital overnight. A lot of State legislatures are changing the law in \ntheir States, but federally this should be a standard we all agree to, \nthat people can stay in the hospital long enough for a good recovery.\n  Clinical trials are another real concern. Clinical trials are \nopportunities for medical researchers to come up with new cures. But, \nof course, they are not the most cost-efficient things. It takes extra \ntime to try to find the patients who are appropriate for the test, get \ntheir permission, go through the testing and procedure, and a lot of \nhealth insurance companies say: We cannot be bothered by that. It is \nthe bottom line. The longer they stay in the hospital, the worse for \nus.\n  But think about it. How can we expect to develop the cures we need in \nthis country, the important things that challenge us and our families, \nif we do not have that? So we want to make certain clinical trials can \nstill go on as a result of health care in this country.\n  Let me return for a moment to one of the basic frustrations that \nseems to attack the medical profession. I spoke to the Illinois State \nMedical Society a few weeks ago. It was an amazing experience, because \nas they started to ask questions afterwards, a lot of the questions \ncircled around the question whether or not, as doctors, they could form \na union. You know, there was a time if you said the word ``union'' in \nthe presence of doctors, they would say: Wait a minute, we have nothing \nto do with that; that's some other group of people.\n  Why are doctors talking about forming unions or associations now? \nBecause they have to have the power to bargain with the health \ninsurance companies. Otherwise, they are being treated as employees and \ndenied their professional rights, rights which they have earned with \ntheir education and their licensure.\n  It is an indication, too, of a concern I have that unless we change \nthe way health care is managed in this country, fewer and fewer women \nand men will go to medical school. They will opt out of the opportunity \nof being health insurance company employees or servants and try \nsomething else. That is something that is not good for America if it \noccurs.\n  I can tell you if I am on a gurney in a hospital needing medical care \nand I look up into the eyes of that doctor, I want to see the best and \nthe brightest. I will be praying that doctor was top of the class, the \nNo. 1 graduate. I do not want someone who thought about this as a \nsecond option in their life, if they ever could.\n  I am afraid if this debate does not take place, if health insurance \ndoes not change, we could jeopardize the possibility of having the kind \nof men and women we want going to medical school and certainly \njeopardize our ability, as individuals and members of families, to have \nhealth insurance and health care that we really can count on.\n  When Americans are asked across the board about their concerns, what \nthey would like to see us work on, they tell us over and over: Take the \ndecisions out of the hands of the health insurance companies and give \nthem back to the doctors and medical professionals.\n  That is what this debate should be about. This empty Chamber should \nbe filled with 100 Senators, Democrats and Republicans, debating this \nmost important issue. Instead it is empty. We give these speeches \ncalling for the issue to come before the Senate, and we are told by the \nother side we cannot; it would take too much time. And the clock \ncontinues to tick.\n  We have the time. The question is whether or not we can summon the \ncourage to address an issue which, frankly, is controversial. On one \nside, the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights has some 200 different \norganizations endorsing it. Doctors and hospitals, consumer groups, \nchildren advocacy groups, labor, business--all endorsing the Democratic \nplan. On the Republican side, their plan is endorsed by only one group, \nbut it is a big one--the insurance companies. They do not want to see \nthis changed. They are making a lot of money.\n  It goes beyond money. It goes to a question of quality of life for \nAmerica's families. We had a similar debate just a few weeks ago, a \ndebate that really followed the tragedy in Littleton, CO, when families \nacross America and individuals stopped to ponder whether or not it was \nsafe to send their kids to school anymore. It wasn't just Littleton, \nCO. It was Conyers, GA; West Paducah, KY; Pearl, MS; Springfield, OR; \nJonesboro, AR; and maybe your hometown is next.\n  Finally, after a week of pointless debate, we came down to a sensible \ngun\n\n[[Page S7505]]\n\ncontrol bill that was enacted only when Vice President Gore cast the \ndeciding vote. Six Republicans and 44 Democrats voted for this \nbipartisan plan. It was sent to the House of Representatives and, \nunfortunately, there the National Rifle Association prevailed. The bill \nwas basically defeated, and the opportunity for sensible gun control \nwas lost.\n  I hope we have another chance in this session. I hope we have a \nchance to address not only gun control but the Patients' Bill of \nRights, an improvement in the minimum wage in this country, and doing \nsomething about the future of Medicare--these things I believe are the \nreason we are here. It is the agenda with which most American families \ncan identify--doing something about our schools to improve education. \nInstead we seem to be caught up in a lot of other issues that are at \nbest only secondary. It is time to move to the primary agenda and the \nprimary agenda is the Patients' Bill of Rights and that is what this \nSenate should be considering.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak in morning business. I \nhope that as I end my remarks and we go into a quorum call, which is \nreally a time out in the Senate, that all those who watch this quorum \ncall will ask the same question: Why then, during that moment in time, \nisn't the Senate even talking about or debating the Patients' Bill of \nRights? Why isn't that bill on the floor? Why aren't the Senators of \nboth parties offering their best suggestions on how to improve health \ninsurance in America?\n  Sadly, that has not happened. I hope it happens soon, and the sooner \nthe better. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand we are in morning business until the hour \nof 2 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is there a limitation of 5 minutes or 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no limitation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/23/senate-section/article/S7505-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7505-S7506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join with my friend from Illinois and \nothers who have spoken before the Senate on the issue of the Patients' \nBill of Rights, which, translated into layman's terms, means \nlegislation that will give assurance to all Americans who are fortunate \nenough to have health insurance policies that medical decisions are \nbeing made by trained professional medical personnel and not by \ninsurance company agents.\n  That is the underlying concept of this legislation, as has been \npointed out during the course of the morning with the examples that \nhave been given, and there are scores more. If we get the chance during \nthe debate on the provisions, hopefully later in the afternoon, we will \nbe able to review the various protections that we are attempting to \nachieve and why they are important to the children and families of this \ncountry.\n  Under the Republican program, there is a guarantee of getting direct \naccess to a pediatrician for a child, but if that child has cancer, \nthere is no guarantee the child will see a pediatric oncologist. Or if \none has a disability, there is no guarantee that person will have \naccess to the needed specialists. The guarantee they will have the best \ncare available is important to patients, and there is no country which \nhas better quality health care.\n  We have a challenge nationwide regarding access to health care, and \nwe have a challenge nationwide in terms of the cost of health care, \nparticularly in a number of different areas. One that comes to mind now \nis the issue of prescription drugs. We are going to have an \nopportunity, hopefully in this Congress, to address that issue.\n  On the issue of what we call quality, meaning that patients are going \nto get the best health coverage in terms of recommendations made by the \nprofessionals who have been trained and who have a wealth of experience \nin this area, we are trying to make sure that every medical decision \nwill be based upon sound and meaningful medical teaching and \nexperience.\n  That is the heart of this legislation. It is very important we get \nthis kind of protection. Otherwise, we will continue to have today, \ntomorrow, and the day after tomorrow the tragic circumstances we have \nexperienced and are being experienced in communities and towns all over \nthis country.\n  Earlier in the day, we had some important statements and speeches by \nour colleagues. Senator Feinstein talked about a provision making sure \nevery health insurance proposal has as its basis of treatment the best \nin terms of medical necessity. The best that is available will be the \nstandard used in providing treatment for individuals.\n  I took some time earlier today and illustrated how different health \ninsurance programs have different definitions. Sometimes a definition \nworks to the advantage of the HMO and works to the advantage of the \ninsurance company but to the disadvantage of the individual. Such a \ndefinition can even threaten the life of that individual.\n  It may be favorable to the HMO regarding its bottom line financially, \nbut it certainly is not favorable to the patient. We ought to be about \nthe business of doing what is important for the patient.\n  Senator Feinstein has talked about this issue very eloquently and \npersuasively today. That certainly would be an area that we ought to be \nable to debate and discuss. I do not believe we have that kind of \nstandard with the language which is included in the provision being \nadvanced by our Republican friends.\n  It is not only my opinion that this is important, but it is the \nopinion of the health practitioners in this country--the doctors, the \nAmerican Medical Association, the nurses, the various specialists. They \nare concerned that the Republican proposal does not provide a good \nstandard to protect the health and safety of children, of women, of \npatients in our country.\n  We ought to be able to debate that issue. It is a very important \nissue. Senator Feinstein has spoken eloquently about that particular \nproblem. But we cannot. We are virtually prohibited from being able to \ndo so. We cannot even get this measure up. We were told yesterday to \neither take the whole package or we were not going to get anything at \nall. That has been repeated time in and time out. There appears to be \nthe continuation of that policy now by the Republican leadership--delay \nand deny, delay and deny.\n  Then later we had the excellent statement that was made by our \ncolleague and friend, Senator Mikulski, who was talking about the \nimportance of the kinds of protections that are guaranteed in our \nPatients' Bill of Rights, particularly with regard to women and \nchildren.\n  She very eloquently pointed out how these gatekeepers who are part of \nthese HMOs--the gatekeeper being the person who ultimately dictates to \nthe doctor what they can effectively prescribe in terms of treatment \nand in terms of medicines--makes those medical judgments and decisions. \nThat is what is happening out there; and that is startling.\n  People can say, well, that really isn't happening in America. It is \nhappening. We have given examples of the devastating results that occur \nas a result of that kind of interference. She illustrated the \nimportance of having those kinds of specialists who are particularly \ntrained and understand the particular needs of women and children.\n  She talked from her own personal experience in a very significant and \nimportant way about how she had a gallbladder operation and was able to \nstay in the hospital in order to recover. But if a woman had a \nmastectomy--and she used the word ``amputation'' because she said that \nis what a mastectomy is --she would still be required to leave the \nhospital that same day. She reminded us about the unsuccessful efforts \nwe made in the committee to try to alter and close that gap in the \nRepublican bill. It makes no sense how those efforts were defeated.\n  It seems to me we ought to be able to have some debate. I do not \nthink that issue would take a long period of time. I thought that \nSenator Mikulski, in about an 8- or 10-minute presentation, made a \npresentation that was powerful and convincing and compelling.\n  Maybe there is a good argument on the other side. We certainly have \nnot\n\n[[Page S7506]]\n\nheard it yet. We never heard it in the committee when we were marking \nthis bill up. We did not hear one. So maybe there is an argument on the \nother side that we haven't heard yet. A woman who is going to have a \nmastectomy ought to be under the care of the doctor, and the doctor and \nthe patient ought to decide whether that person can leave the hospital \nthat day or ought to be there 1 or 2 or 3 more days. Leave it up to the \ndoctors and their recommendations. That is not permitted under the \nmajority's bill.\n  We heard a great deal of talk about that. That is not in the bill \nthat is the Republican proposal. The specific amendment that the \nSenator talked about on the Senate floor would be an amendment that we \nought to be able to debate. We ought to be able to debate why it is not \nin the Republican bill that will eventually, hopefully, be laid down \nbefore the Senate.\n\n  There is not that protection for women in this country. There is not \nthat protection that will permit the doctor to make a judgment about \nhow long it will be medically necessary to keep that woman in the \nhospital if she has a mastectomy. That protection is not there. It was \ndefeated when it was offered.\n  Let's have a brief debate on that issue, and let's have the call of \nthe roll. Why is it we are being denied that today? Why is it we are \nbeing foreclosed from that kind of an opportunity? Why is it we cannot \nhave the kind of debate in relation to the excellent presentation that \nthe Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, made, the excellent \npresentation that the Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, made on \ntwo different kinds of phases?\n  Yesterday we talked with our Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, \nabout the importance of clinical trials and the necessary aspects of \nincreasing the clinical trials. Historically, the insurance companies \nof this country have basically supported clinical trials. There is a \nvery good reason why they should, because--besides the medical reason \nthat it is important for the patient--if the person gets better they \nwill not need as many services, and that means the insurance company \nwill pay out less in the long run. That is something that should be a \nfinancial incentive for the insurance companies; and it is.\n  Let me repeat that. While clinical trials make sense in terms of the \ntreatment for the patient, they make sense for the insurance companies, \ntoo. But what we are seeing, under the health maintenance \norganizations, is the gradual squeeze and decline in terms of the \ninsurance companies' payments for routine health needs of the \nparticular patients.\n  Under our proposal, they would only pay for routine costs, as they \nhave historically. The research regime pays for the special kinds of \nattention, treatment, and tests that are necessary in order to review \nwhether that particular pharmaceutical drug or other therapy is useful \nor not. That is not paid for by the insurance companies. So they only \nhave to pay for the routine health needs--the costs that they would pay \nfor even in the absence of a clinical trial. The regime, the testing \ngroup or organization or pharmaceutical company that is having that \nclinical trial, pays for the rest.\n  But what we are seeing is virtually the beginning of the collapse of \nclinical research taking place. I will just make a final point on this \nissue. The group that has had the greatest amount of clinical research \ndone on them in this country has been children. The greatest progress \nthat has been made in the battle for cancer has been--where?--with \nchildren.\n  Most of the clinical researchers who have reviewed this whole \nquestion of our efforts on cancer would make the case that one of the \nprincipal reasons that we have made the greatest progress in the war on \ncancer in children, in extending their lives and improving their human \ncondition, is because of these clinical trials.\n  We want to continue to encourage participation in clinical trials. \nThey offer hope for the future. If the doctor says this is what is \nnecessary for the life and the health of a woman who has cancer, that \nthis is the one way she may be able to save her life, and there is a \nclinical trial available, we want to be able to say she ought to be \nable to go there. The opposition says: Let's study it. I say: Let's \nvote on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg).

Is there any chance we might have that on the floor this \nafternoon?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am happy to respond. Our colleagues \nfrom California may want to join our bill; we have doctors make the \ndecisions. To answer the Senator's question, we are negotiating in good \nfaith. We are getting closer, I believe, to coming to an agreement that \nwould have consideration of the Patients' Bill of Rights be the pending \nbusiness when we return from the Fourth of July break.

Mr. President, I am on the floor because I \nanticipated that at 2 o'clock we would be returning to the agriculture \nappropriations bill. I indicated this morning that I would be proposing \nan amendment to that bill that has to do with giving the physician the \nright to provide medically necessary services in a setting which that \nphysician believes is best for the patient. I now see that this has \nbeen postponed an hour, so I would like to speak to the amendment now \nand then introduce it at 3 o'clock. I hope there will be no objection \nto that.\n  Let me begin by saying, once again, what this amendment does. \nEssentially, the amendment says that a group health plan or a health \ninsurance issuer, in connection with health insurance coverage, may not \narbitrarily interfere with or alter the decision of the treating \nphysician regarding the manner or the setting in which particular \nservices are delivered if the services are medically necessary or \nappropriate for treatment or diagnosis, to the extent that such \ntreatment or diagnosis is otherwise a covered benefit.\n  I read that specific language because it is important to understand \nthat because most people buying a health insurance plan believe that \ntheir doctor is, in fact, going to be prescribing the treatment that is \nbest for them, not the treatment that is the least cost effective, not \nthe treatment that might run a risk to the patient but be good for \nsomebody else, but the treatment or the procedure, in an appropriate \nsetting, that is right for that patient. What is right for a patient \nwho is 18 years old may not be right for a patient who is 75 years old, \nand so on. I will read from the legislation the definition of ``medical \nnecessity'' or ``appropriateness'':\n\n       The term ``medical necessity'' or ``appropriate'' means, \n     ``with respect to a service or a benefit, a service or \n     benefit which is consistent with generally accepted \n     principles of professional medical practice.''\n\n  That is something that everyone expects, that everyone is accustomed \nto in this Nation, and I believe that is the way medicine should, in \nfact, be practiced. I am very pleased to say the language of this \namendment, from the\n\n[[Page S7507]]\n\nlarger Patients' Bill of Rights (S. 6) is supported by some 200 \norganizations all across the United States, including the American \nAcademy of Emergency Medicine; the American Academy of Neurology; \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics; American Association of University \nWomen; American Cancer Society; American College of Physicians; \nAmerican Heart Association; American Lung Association, and the American \nMedical Association, which is the largest association of practicing \nphysicians in the country.\n  Then there is the American Psychological Association; the American \nPublic Health Association; the American Society of Clinical Oncology; \nvirtually every breast cancer organization; the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica; the Epilepsy Foundation; the Leukemia Society; the National \nAlliance of Breast Cancer Organizations; the National Association of \nChildren's Hospitals; the National Association of People with AIDS; the \nNational Council of Senior Citizens; the National Black Women's Health \nProject; the National Breast Cancer Coalition; the Older Women's \nLeague; the Paralyzed Veterans of America--on and on and on.\n  This is a widely accepted amendment that virtually has the support of \nevery professional and patient organization that deals with health care \nanywhere in the United States.\n  Let me read a statement from the American College of Surgeons, \ncertainly the most prestigious body for surgeons, and one to which my \nhusband, Bert Feinstein, belonged:\n\n       We believe very strongly that any health care system or \n     plan that removes the surgeon and patient from the medical \n     decisionmaking process only undermines the quality of that \n     patient's care and his or her health and well-being.\n       Similarly, the American Medical Association has said, \n     ``Medical decisions should be made by patients and their \n     physicians, rather than by insurers or legislators.''\n\n  I have worked on this now for 3 years. In the last Congress, I \nintroduced legislation to allow doctors to decide when to discharge a \nwoman from the hospital after a mastectomy. I did this with Senator \nD'Amato in the last Congress and with Senator Snowe in this Congress. \nAnd I introduced a bill that would allow doctors to decide when to \ndischarge a person from the hospital after any procedure or treatment, \nwith Senators D'Amato and Snowe.\n  Why do we need these bills? Senator Mikulski from Maryland this \nmorning made a very impassioned case about mastectomies. And we learned \nin 1997 that women were being pushed out of the hospital on the same \nday after a mastectomy.\n  I was amazed to hear from a woman named Nancy Couchot of Newark, CA, \nwho wrote me in 1997 that she had a modified radical mastectomy at \n11:30 in the morning and was released from the hospital by 4:30 that \nafternoon. She could not walk to the bathroom without help. She said in \nher letter:\n\n       Any woman, under these circumstances, should be able to opt \n     for overnight stay to receive professional help and strong \n     pain relief.\n\n  Victoria Berck of Los Angeles wrote that she went in at 7:30 a.m. and \nwas released at 2:30 p.m. with drains attached to her body. She said, \n``No civilized country in the world has a mastectomy as an outpatient \nprocedure.''\n  It was a very large health care network in California that was doing \nthese ``drive-through'' mastectomies on the same day.\n  I believe ``drive-through'' mastectomies have been largely stopped, \nbut patients had to rise up, and patients had to say you can't do this \nto me. You can't push me out a few hours after an anesthetic with \ndrains in my body, having had a radical mastectomy and not being able \nto take care of myself.\n  What if the woman is 75 instead of 25? It makes no sense.\n  We also learned that insurance plans were insisting one-night \nhospital stays if you had a child.\n  We learned that babies--infants--were going home with jaundice, and \nthey had to come back to the hospital for treatment once, twice, or \nthree times. There was a lot of ``tsk-tsking.'' What a terrible \nprocedure. How could they do this? Now it has changed because Congress \nacted, requiring a minimum of two days for childbirth, for a normal \ndelivery. What if you need 5 days for care, or 6 days for care?\n  The point is that it should be a decision made by the physician. It \nshould not be countermanded by someone unqualified to make that \ndecision.\n  A California neurologist told us about a 7-year-old girl with an ear \ninfection who went to the doctor with a high fever which developed into \npneumonia, and she was hospitalized. The HMO insisted that she be sent \nhome after 2 days. She ended up returning to the hospital three times, \nsicker each time to the point where she developed meningitis. The \ndoctor said that if she had stayed in the hospital for 5 to 7 days the \nfirst time that she could have been given antibiotics, been monitored, \nand would not have gotten meningitis.\n  What is the problem?\n  Let me read the definition of medical necessity in an insurance \ncontract provided to me by the American Medical Association. This is \nfrom the Aetna/U.S. Healthcare standard Texas contract. I quote: \n``Health care services that are appropriate and consistent with the \ndiagnosis in accordance with accepted medical standards and which are \nlikely to result in demonstrable medical benefit,'' and here is the \npoint, ``and which are the least costly of alternative supplies or \nlevels of service.''\n  It is not ``and/or.'' It is ``and which are the least costly.''\n  So if you belong to that plan and there is a drug that is the least \ncostly, perhaps not as effective or perhaps not good for you with your \npresent condition, or because of your age, that is the drug you are \nforced to take because the insurance plan says so, despite what the \ndoctor says. If there is a diagnostic process that may be less \neffective than an MRI, that MRI is very often prohibited for you.\n  What is happening out there? What is the problem?\n  The problem is that doctors are finding insurance plans overriding \ntheir decisions, dictating their decisions, second-guessing their \ndecisions about what is medically necessary.\n\n  We aim in this amendment to give that basic right of medical practice \nback to the physician.\n  In fact, today doctors all across this Nation will tell you that they \nspend hours hassling with insurance company accountants and adjusters \nto justify medical necessity decisions --why a person needs another day \nin a hospital, why a person needs an MRI, why a patient needs a blood \ntest, why a patient should get this drug instead of that drug.\n  Seventy percent of doctors across this great Nation say they are \nforced to exaggerate a patient's symptoms to make sure HMOs don't \ndischarge patients from hospitals prematurely.\n  Is this the kind of medical care that we want to see HMOs press us \ntoward where a doctor has to lie, fabricate, or exaggerate the \ncondition of the patient to be sure that patient gets what is medically \nappropriate for that particular patient? I truly think not.\n  Every patient is different. Every patient brings to a situation his \nor her own unique history and biology. Doctors should be able to use \ntheir best professional judgment in each individual case based upon the \nneeds or condition of the patient.\n  Pneumonia in a 30-year-old patient is different from pneumonia in a \n70-year-old patient. Doctors know the difference, and most of us do, \ntoo.\n  A Maryland nurse said: I spend my days watching the care in my unit \nbe directed by faceless people from insurance companies on the other \nend of the phone. My hospital employs a full-time nurse whose entire \njob is to talk to insurance reviewers.\n  I myself in 1989 had to have a hysterectomy. I was extraordinarily \nanemic. As I was in the hospital for a blood transfusion, the phone \nrang. I picked up the phone. It was my insurance company. What they \nsaid to me is: Why are you still in the hospital? You are supposed to \nbe out of there by now.\n  My only response was: I am here because I am currently having a blood \ntransfusion.\n  A patient shouldn't have to go through this. It happened to me. You \ncan be sure it is happening all across this country.\n  Doctor Robert Weinman told the San Jose Mercury News that a doctor \nprescribed a brain wave test for a convulsing epileptic child. The HMO \nboard--consisting of one accountant, the chief financial officer, and \none doctor--refused coverage, depriving the\n\n[[Page S7508]]\n\ndoctor of the necessary diagnostic information.\n  On June 14, just a couple of weeks ago, a California nurse \npractitioner told my staff that insurance plans will allow people with \nulcers to take Prilosec for only 4 to 6 weeks, even though the \ngastroenterologists say that it is needed for a longer period. Plans \nsay patients can take Tagamet, which is cheaper but not as effective \nfor this particular condition.\n  This is what this amendment seeks to avoid.\n  The doctor should be able to prescribe based on medical necessity \nwhat is appropriate to each patient--a hallmark of good medical care.\n  A California doctor told us about a patient who needed a total hip \nreplacement because her hip had failed. The doctor said that patient \nshould remain in the hospital for 7 days. The plan would only authorize \n5 days.\n  Let me quote once again from a Los Angeles physician.\n\n       Many doctors are demoralized. They feel like they have \n     taken a beating in recent years. . .physicians train years to \n     learn how to practice medicine. They work long hours \n     practicing their field. Under this health care system, that \n     training and hard work often seem irrelevant. A bureaucrat \n     dictates how doctors are allowed to treat parties. . . \n     When I tell someone he is fit to leave the hospital after \n     an operation, I am often given an accusing stare. \n     Sometimes my patients even say: ``Is that what you really \n     think or are you caving in to HMO pressure to cut corners \n     on care?''\n  Medicine shouldn't have to be practiced this way in the United States \nof America.\n  Over 80 percent of the people of my State are in some form of managed \ncare. California has been a laboratory for managed care. Californians \nare speaking out on the issue. Over one half of Californians say that \nmajor changes are needed in our health care system. Californians say \nthey have to wait for care longer, they are rushed through \nappointments, they have to navigate impersonal systems when they are \ntrying to get care.\n  A survey of 900 doctors in California found that 7 out of 10 were \ndissatisfied with managed care organizations. Insurance companies have \ninvaded the examining room, the emergency room, and the hospital room. \nThe ``care'' is rapidly going out of health care. Getting good health \ncare should not be a battle.\n  I think everyone in this body understands HMOs can be effective good, \nthey can reduce costs in a medically acceptable way. And that is the \nkey--in a medically acceptable way, without adversely impacting the \npatient. The way to do this is not to countermand the physician, not to \ntell the physician what drug he or she can or cannot give a patient \nbased on the cost, not to tell a physician he has to conduct a radical \nmastectomy at 7:30 in the morning, removing sometimes both of a woman's \nbreasts and lymph nodes, and push her out on the street with drains in \nher chest and pain coursing through her body. That isn't good health \ncare for anyone.\n  This is a simple amendment. It is supported by virtually over 200 \nhealth organizations.\n  Some might say why not wait until we work out an agreement so a \nPatients' Bill of Rights--whether it be Democrat or Republican--can \ncome to the floor. I have waited for 3 years for an opportunity to move \nthis kind of legislation. We cannot wait any longer. Senator D'Amato \nand I, 3 years ago, held a press conference urging this kind of \nlegislation. Senator Snowe and I, in this Congress, have introduced \nsimilar legislation.\n  The beauty of this amendment, that I want to bring before the Senate \nfor a vote, is that it states very simply that health insurance \ncoverage may not arbitrarily interfere or alter the decision of the \ntreating physician regarding the manner or setting--hospital, emergency \nroom, outpatient clinic, whatever it is--in which particular services \nare delivered, if the services are medically necessary or appropriate \nfor treatment or diagnosis.\n  Every single patient in managed care anywhere in the United States of \nAmerica will be better off the sooner this amendment becomes law.\n  I believe to wait is wrong. I believe to wait will cost lives. I \nbelieve to wait will increase morbidity. I believe to wait is unfair to \nthe physicians who are trained, able, and ready to carry out their \nprofession.\n  I am hopeful I will have an opportunity, in 25 minutes when the \nagricultural appropriations bill is on the floor, to offer this \namendment which is broadly and widely supported all across the United \nStates. Once and for all, the physician and the patient will together \nmake the medical decisions--not a green eyeshade somewhere in a remote \nHMO office.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. The Chair notes \nthe Senator has 2 minutes 2 seconds.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to talk about the \nPatients' Bill of Rights in one particular area. That is the area of \nappeals, both internal appeals and external appeals.\n  Both versions of this legislation, both the Republican proposal and \nthe Democratic proposal, purport to have provisions for appeals of \ndenial of service to consumers of health care in HMOs. Looking closely \nat the proposals, we find that the Republican process is significantly \ndeficient.\n  We will hear discussions about these various proposals, but I will \nhighlight a couple of the areas which suggest the deficiencies that are \ninherent in the Republican proposal versus the Democratic proposal.\n  First, under the Republican plan, an internal review--one that is \nbeing conducted by the HMO itself--that reviewer is restricted from \nlooking at all the evidence in a case.\n  For example, if a patient thought they were not receiving appropriate \ncare, they might go to another physician outside of their network and \nask for an opinion. That type of information cannot be used by the \ninternal reviewer to make a judgment about the decision rendered by the \nHMO. This narrowly restricted access to information prejudices the \nreview process against the patient. It also leads to something I think \nis evident today and would be even more pronounced in the future, a \ngrowing cynicism that the managed care companies simply want to protect \nthe bottom line, not the health of the patient.\n  I strongly suggest the internal review process in the Republican \nlegislation is deficient since it will not allow, essentially, a de \nnovo review of the case by the reviewing authority.\n  The second weakness with respect to the Republican proposal is with \nregard to external reviews. External reviews are reviews which are \nconducted by an outside party. Under the Republican plan, a review \ncould only be conducted if there is a claim that some type of medical \nnecessity has been violated, or the proposed treatment is \nexperimental--again, two very narrow grounds.\n  A patient cannot have an external review if the claim is about \ncontractual rights. In the world of HMOs, it is so easy for the HMO to \nclaim: This is not really an issue of medical necessity. It is not an \nissue even of innovative treatment. This treatment is just not covered \nunder your plan.\n  These contracts are pages and pages of small print. When the average \nconsumer or family tries to figure out what the contract says, they are \nno match for the reviewing authorities and spokespeople for the HMOs.\n  As a result, there is a very real possibility an aggrieved party will \nnever get an external review. They will be buried in a barrage of \nverbiage indicating ``it is not covered in the contract'' or it \n``doesn't meet our definition of medical necessity.'' I refer to the \ntext provided by my colleague from California where part of the \ndefinition of ``medical necessity'' included the low-cost alternative \nin the provision of services.\n  All of this, in my view, is an invitation to endless argumentation \nabout legalisms at a time when people need a prompt response to a \nhealth care crisis in their family.\n  There is another deficiency with respect to the external review \nprovisions. Under the Republican proposal, the HMO actually picks the \nreviewing authority. Now that just does not sound fair. If it does not \nsound fair to us, it will certainly not sound fair to the families of \nAmerica.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n\n[[Page S7509]]\n\n  Mr. REED. Certainly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Because the Senator has made a point that is rather \nstunning to me. In other words, he is saying that in the Republican \nproposal which purports to be a Patients' Bill of Rights, if a patient \nbelieves he or she has not received the appropriate treatment and there \nis an internal review--and let's pass over that--and then there is an \nexternal review; in other words, people are coming in from the outside \nto take a look at whether or not you should have had a different \ntreatment for your cancer, let's say, the Senator is saying to me that \nunder the Republican proposal, the very organization that denied you a \ncertain kind of treatment gets to pick the people who are going to \ndecide if that HMO was wrong? So if they pick their friends, naturally, \nwhat chance does the patient have? I say to my friend, this seems like \na kangaroo court if I have ever heard of one. Does he not agree?\n  Mr. REED. I agree completely. The Senator is absolutely right. Both \nthe perception of an unfair, unbalanced procedure, and I would also \nargue the reality, ultimately, will be such that you are not going to \nget a fair evaluation of your claim.\n  I cannot conceive of a company--and the HMOs are famous now for their \nconcern for the bottom line--that would go out of its way to retain \npeople who are sensitive to the needs of patients versus the needs of \nthe company and its bottom line. They will pick reviewing authorities \nwho will invariably decide that this expensive procedure, or this \ninexpensive procedure, is not needed by a patient.\n  What you are doing also is creating a degree of cynicism about the \nwhole process of appeals. As a result, rather than making a sound, \nobjective, external evaluation of the merits of the case with all the \nevidence and telling the patient, no, this is not necessary for you, \nor, yes, it is, a huge legal, bureaucratic labyrinth is created, at the \nend of which you find yourself facing somebody who basically works for \nthe HMO.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wonder, in comparing these two bills, if my friend has \nmade an analysis of the way the Democratic bill treats the appeals \nprocess? And can he tell us the difference here?\n  Mr. REED. The Democratic legislation tries to create, and I think \nsucceeds in creating, a situation where there is an external review \nwhere a party who is not beholden to the HMO, an individual reviewing \nauthority outside of the company will review external appeals. It would \nbe truly independent and there would not be a conflict of interest, and \nthat, I believe, is the appropriate way to proceed.\n  By creating an independent external review procedure, it will, No. 1, \nstrengthen the confidence of consumers that they are getting a fair \nshake and, No. 2, it will lead to better judgments about the type of \nhealth care that should be necessary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I understand the Republican proposal, if you had a \nchild, for example, with cancer, and you had a pediatrician, but what \nyou needed was an oncologist for that child, one who is a specialist in \npediatrics, and the HMO denied you that, and you believed this was \nenormously important for the treatment for the child, under the \nRepublican proposal you have no right to appeal that particular \ndecision. I understand that the right to an independent appeal applies \nonly to certain decisions, and a denial of access to a specialist is \nnot one of them. I believe I am correct.\n  We heard our wonderful friend, Dr. Frist, yesterday talk about how \nany child who had cancer would be guaranteed a specialist and everybody \nsaid: Doesn't that do the trick? No.\n  We know you need not just a pediatrician, but as the Senator from \nRhode Island knows--as one who has been a leader in the Senate on \nchildren's issues regarding access, and has introduced special \nlegislation on this--that child needs a pediatric oncologist. That kind \nof specialist is absolutely crucial, if that child is to have a \nfighting chance; but denial of access to that particular specialist \nwould not be eligible for appeal under the majority's program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Rhode Island has \nexpired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for 6 more minutes evenly divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was just asking whether the Senator's understanding is \nthe same understanding as mine? If the Senator would just reflect on \nthe significance of that, I would appreciate it. How important, really, \nis specialty care access, I ask the Senator, as an expert on this issue \nfor the treatment of a child?\n  Mr. REED. The Senator is exactly correct. The way the appeals process \nis drafted in the Republican legislation, a child who has a serious \ncancer might be offered the services of an oncologist for adults. In \nthe view of the plan, that would be adequate, sufficient for the \npurposes of the medical necessity. As a result, the parents of the \nchild, who want access to a pediatric oncologist, may not even get the \nchance to even protest internally, externally, or in any way.\n  That is wrong. Frankly, I have been trying to learn as much as I can \nabout pediatric specialties. I, like so many people, once thought an \noncologist is an oncologist is an oncologist like a rose is a rose is a \nrose. It turns out pediatric oncology is a very specialized part of \nmedicine.\n  I was talking to a specialist recently who pointed out the case of a \nyoung child who was discovered with a particular type of cancer and was \ntreated by an adult's oncologist using what is standard procedure for \nan adult. In fact, using the adult procedure produced additional \nproblems for the child and only further complicated the situation. As a \nresult, the child has to have an additional regime of chemotherapy. All \nof this could have been avoided, of course, had that child seen a \npediatric oncologist immediately.\n  The provisions in this legislation do not give a fair chance to \nappeal a denial of access to a specialist like the case I have just \noutlined. They do not give Americans, but particularly children, a fair \nchance to get good health care. That is what we want to do and should \ndo.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield just for another moment? It is \nnow approaching 3 o'clock. To the best of my recollection, the good \nSenator from California, Senator Feinstein, has been here since 10 \no'clock this morning, prepared to go ahead and introduce her amendment \nand has still not been able to do it. There has been an extension of \nthe time limits, evidently because of some negotiations about which all \nof us are hopeful. But I think we probably could have disposed of the \namendment of the Senator and probably the proposal of the Senator from \nRhode Island also. I do not know whether the Senator would agree with \nme or not.\n  Mr. REED. I do agree. I have been listening to Senator Feinstein's \nvery eloquent and thoughtful comments about the need for access to \nspecialists and the need to have a physician make a decision about your \nhealth care and not an accountant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Rhode Island has \nexpired.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I hope we can work out an agreement, but \nI rise today really to express my frustration and outrage with the \ninability of the Republican leadership to allow a fair and open debate \non the real Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I do not like the idea of tying up must-do appropriations bills to \ntry and force a fair and open debate on access to health care services. \nHowever, due to the inability to find a reasonable compromise on the \nnumber of amendments, we have been forced to bring this issue to every \npossible vehicle.\n  I hope we can work out an arrangement with the majority party to do \nthis and to have our opportunity to offer amendments that we think are \nvery important.\n  Sometimes we spend far too much time on issues of little significance \nto the American people. One of the majority's showcase pieces of \nlegislation in 1999 was to change the name of National Airport to the \nRonald Reagan Washington National Airport. We spent more time talking \nabout the name change than we have on debating the Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  When it comes to access to emergency room treatment, or access to \nexperimental lifesaving treatments, we cannot seem to find 3 days for \nits consideration on the Senate floor. This is the kind of legislation \nthat really does impact American working families. I would argue that \nit deserves a full and open debate on the Senate floor, allowing us to \noffer our amendments.\n  The Republican reform legislation reported out of the HELP Committee \nis not--and let me repeat, is not--a patients' bill of rights. Oddly \nenough, it excludes most insured Americans and, in many cases, simply \nreiterates current insurance policy. It does not provide the kinds of \nprotections and guarantees which will ensure that when you need your \ninsurance, it is there for you and your family.\n  Let's face it. Most people do not even think about their health \ninsurance until they become sick. Certainly, insurance companies do not \nnotify them every week or month, when collecting their premiums, that \nthere are many services and benefits they do not have access to. It is \namazing how accurate insurance companies can be in collecting premiums, \nbut when it comes time to access benefits, it becomes a huge \nbureaucracy with little or no accountability.\n  The Republican leadership bill is inadequate in many areas. Let me \npoint out a couple of the major holes that I see in this legislation.\n  During markup of this legislation in the HELP Committee, I offered \ntwo important amendments. The first one was a very short and simple \namendment to prohibit so-called drive-through mastectomies.\n  My amendment would have prohibited insurance companies from requiring \ndoctors to perform major breast cancer surgery in an outpatient setting \nand discharging the woman within hours. We saw this happen before when \ninsurance companies decided it was not medically necessary for a woman \nto stay more than 12 hours in a hospital following the birth of a \nchild. They said there was no need for followup for the newborn infant \nbeyond 12 hours. There was no understanding of the effects of \nchildbirth on a woman and no role for the woman or physician to \ndetermine what is medically necessary for both the new mother and the \nnew infant.\n  I offered the drive-through mastectomy prohibition amendment only \nbecause an amendment offered earlier in that markup would continue the \npractice of allowing insurance personnel to determine what was \nmedically necessary--not doctors, not patients, but insurance \ncompanies. I offered my amendment to ensure that no insurance company \nwould be allowed to engage in drive-through mastectomies.\n  My amendment did not require a mandatory hospital stay. It did not \nset the number of days or hours. It simply said that only the doctor \nand the patient would be able to determine if a hospital stay was \nmedically necessary. The woman who had suffered the shock of the \ndiagnosis of breast cancer, the woman who was told the mastectomy was \nthe only choice, the woman who faced this life-altering surgery, \ndecides, along with her doctor.\n  Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side did not feel \ncomfortable giving the decision to the woman and her doctor. They did \nnot like legislating by body part; and neither do I. But I could not \nsit by and be silent on this issue. Defeating the medically necessary \namendment, offered prior to my amendment, forced me to legislate by \nbody part. And I will do it again to ensure that women facing a \nmastectomy are not sent home prematurely to deal with both the physical \nand emotional aftershocks.\n  For many years, I have listened to many of my colleagues talk about \nbreast cancer and breast cancer research or breast cancer stamps. When \nit comes to really helping breast cancer survivors, some of my \nRepublican colleagues voted no. I hope we are able to correct this and \ngive all of my colleagues, not just those on the HELP Committee, the \nchance to vote yes.\n  The other amendment I offered in committee addressed the issue of \nemergency room coverage. The Republican legislation falls short of \nensuring that when you have a sick child with a very high fever, and \nyou rush them to the emergency room in the middle of the night, the \nchild will receive emergency care as well as poststabilization care. \nThe Republican bill simply adopts a prudent layperson standard on \nemergency care, not care beyond the emergency.\n\n  That means that a child with a fever of over 104 degrees may not \nreceive the full scope of care necessary to determine what caused the \nfever to prevent the escalation of a fever once the child has been \nstabilized. As many parents know, simply controlling the fever is not \nenough; you have to control the virus or infection to prevent the fever \nfrom escalating again.\n  I tried in committee to address the inequities in the Republican bill \nregarding emergency room coverage. Unfortunately, my amendment was \ndefeated. Let me point out to my colleagues, if they think their \nlanguage will protect individuals seeking emergency care, they are \nsadly mistaken.\n  The insurance commissioner's office in my home State of Washington \nrecently initiated a major investigation of insurance companies that \nhad denied ER coverage based on a prudent layperson's standard. The \ncommissioner's office discovered that despite a\n\n[[Page S7511]]\n\nState regulation requiring a prudent layperson standard, there were \nnumerous examples of individuals being denied appropriate care in the \nemergency room.\n  In Washington State, a 15-year-old girl with a broken leg was taken \nby her parents to a hospital emergency room. The claim was denied by \nthe family's insurer, which ruled that the circumstances did not \nconstitute an emergency.\n  A 17-year-old victim of a beating suffered serious head injuries and \nwas taken to an ER. A CAT scan ordered by the ER physician was rejected \nby the insurer because there was no prior authorization. This 17-year-\nold child was stabilized, but the physician knew that only through a \nCAT scan would they know the full extent of the child's injuries. Yet \nthe insurance company denied payment because they had not approved the \nprocedure. They obviously did not think that a CAT scan was part of ER \ncare.\n  These are examples of gross misconduct by insurance companies in the \nState of Washington that are supposed to meet the same standard that is \nincluded in the Republican bill. As the insurance commissioner learned, \na prudent layperson standard still allows for a loophole large enough \nto drive a truck through.\n  I also want to remind many of my colleagues who support doubling \nresearch at NIH that we are facing a situation where we have all of \nthis great research we are funding, and yet we allow insurance \ncompanies to deny access. Yesterday we heard testimony at the Labor-HHS \nSubcommittee hearing about juvenile diabetes. It was an inspiring \nhearing. We had more than 100 children and several celebrities testify. \nYet as I sat there listening to the testimony from NIH about the need \nto increase funding for research and how close we are to finding a \ncure, I was struck by the fact that the Republican leadership bill \nwould allow the continued practice of denying access to clinical \ntrials, access to new experimental drugs and treatments, access to \nspecialties, and access to specialty care provided at NCI cancer \ncenters.\n\n  It does little good to increase research or to find a cure for \ndiabetes or Parkinson's disease if very few people in this country can \nafford the cure or are denied access to that cure. We need to continue \nour focus on research, but we cannot simply ignore the issue of access.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting a real Patients' Bill \nof Rights that puts the decision of health care back into the hands of \nthe consumer and their physician, that doesn't dismantle managed care \nbut ensures that insurance companies manage care, not profits.\n  I don't want to increase the cost of health care. I simply want to \nmake sure people get what they pay for, that they have the same access \nto care that we, as Members of the Senate, enjoy as we participate in \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefit Program. The President has made \nsure we have patient protections. Our constituents deserve no less.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have a couple comments. Again, we are \ntrying to come up with an arrangement. I think all my colleagues are \naware of the fact that we have been negotiating on this most of the \nday. Hopefully, we will come up with an arrangement that is mutually \nsatisfactory to all participants in the debate.\n  I will respond to a couple of the comments, because maybe they \nhaven't been responded to adequately. There has been a lot of \ndiscussion about the Republican package doesn't do this or the Democrat \npackage does so many wonderful things. The Democrat package before the \nSenate increases health care costs dramatically.\n  I stated, maybe 2 years ago: When the Senate considers legislation, \nwe should make sure we do no harm. By doing no harm, I stated two or \nthree propositions. One, we should not increase health care costs; that \nmakes health care unaffordable for a lot of Americans. Unfortunately, \nthe package proposed by my colleagues on the Democrat side--the Kennedy \nbill--increases health care costs 4.8 percent, according to the CBO, \nover and above the inflation that is already estimated for this next \nyear, estimated to be about 8 percent.\n  If you add 5 percent on top of 8 percent, that is a 13-percent \nincrease in health care costs. The result is, probably a million and a \nhalf Americans will lose their health care if we pass the Democrat \npackage.\n  I have heard a lot of my colleagues say: We need to pass the Kennedy \nbill; it is going to do all these wonderful things, because we are \ngoing to protect, we have a prudent layperson. It is just a great idea. \nWe have emergency care. It is a wonderful idea. We are going to \nguarantee everybody all this assortment of benefits. We are going to \nmandate all kinds of little coverages that all sound very good.\n  But they do have a cost. If we make insurance unaffordable and move a \nmillion and a half people from the insured category to the uninsured \ncategory, I think we are making a mistake; I think we are making a \nserious mistake.\n  There are some costs involved, and there is a little difference in \nphilosophy. Some of our colleagues said the Republican package doesn't \ncover this or doesn't do this, doesn't do that. What we don't try to do \nis rewrite health care insurance, which is basically a State-controlled \ninitiative. We don't have the philosophy that Washington, DC, knows \nbest. There is a difference in philosophy.\n  The Kennedy bill says: States, we don't care what you are doing. We \nknow what is best. We have a package, an emergency care package, that \nyou have to have ER services under the following scenarios. We don't \ncare what you are doing, States.\n  I just looked at a note. Forty States have emergency care mandates. \nThe Kennedy bill says: We don't care what you are doing, States. Here \nis what we say, because we know what is best.\n  I wonder if the State of Massachusetts has it. The State of \nWashington has it. I heard my colleague from Washington, Senator \nMurray, talk about emergency care. The State of Washington has \nemergency care mandates in their health care packages for State-\nregulated health care plans. I heard the Senator from Washington talk \nabout ``prudent layperson.'' The State of Washington has a prudent \nlayperson mandate. Maybe that is not adequate. Maybe somebody in the \nState legislature in the State of Washington said: We need to \nstrengthen this; we need improvement.\n\n  There is a difference of philosophy. We, on our side, are saying we \nshouldn't try to rewrite health care plans all across America. We don't \nbelieve in national health insurance, that the Government in \nWashington, DC, is the source of all wisdom, has all knowledge, can do \nall things exactly right, and we should supersede the governments of \nevery State.\n  We don't have that philosophy. There is a difference of philosophy. \nThe Kennedy bill says: States, you have emergency room provisions. We \ndo not think they are adequate. We know what is best.\n  Then the health care plans say: Wait a minute, we have been regulated \nsince our inception by the States, as far as insurance regulation. Now \nwe have the Federal regulation. Whom should we follow? They are \ndifferent.\n  Who is right? Do we just take the more stringent proposal, or are we \nnow going to have HCFA regulate not only Medicare and Medicaid, but are \nwe now going to have HCFA regulating private insurance? I do not think \nwe should.\n  I will tell my colleagues, HCFA has done a crummy job in regulating \nMedicare. HCFA has not complied with the mandates we gave them in 1997 \nfor giving information to Medicare recipients on Medicare options. They \nhaven't done that yet. They haven't notified most seniors of options \nthat are available to them that this Congress passed and this President \nsigned. They haven't notified people of their options. They have done a \ncrummy job of complying with the regulations that they have now. They \nhaven't even complied with--some of the States--the so-called Kennedy-\nKassebaum legislation that passed a few years ago. There are some \nStates, including the State of Massachusetts, which don't even comply \nwith the Kennedy-Kassebaum kid care formulations. HCFA is supposed to \ntake that over. They haven't done it.\n  My point is, people who have the philosophy, wait a minute, we need \nto\n\n[[Page S7512]]\n\nhave this long list of mandates, we are going to say it, and we are \ngoing to regulate it and dictate it from Washington, DC, I just happen \nto disagree with.\n  It may be a very laudable effort. Some of the horror stories that \nwere mentioned--this person didn't get care, and it is terrible--are \ntough stories. But we have to ask ourselves, is the right solution a \nFederal mandate? Is the Federal mandate listing here of what every \nhealth care plan in America has to comply with, dictated by Washington, \nDC, dictated by my friend and colleague from Massachusetts, is that the \nright solution? I don't think so.\n  Is there a cost associated with that? Yes, there is. I mention that \nto my colleagues and to others who are interested in the debate.\n  We will have this debate. I think there will be an agreement reached \nthat we will take this up on July 11, and we will have open \navailability for individuals to offer amendments with second-degree \namendments, and hopefully a conclusion to this process.\n  I did want to respond to say that this idea of somebody finding a \nhorror story or finding an example of a problem and coming up with the \nsolution, or the fix being ``Washington, DC, knows best,'' I don't \nnecessarily agree with.\n  I do think we can make some improvements. I do hope, ultimately, we \nwill have bipartisan support for what I believe is a very good package. \nI am not saying it is perfect. It may be amended. It may be improved. I \nhope we will come up with a bipartisan package.\n  We do have internal/external appeals which are very important and, I \nthink, could make a positive contribution towards solving some of the \nproblems many of the individuals have addressed earlier today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EDWARDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. May I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 5 minutes 10 seconds. The \nmajority still has 15 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to address the \nimportant issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. I will respond briefly \nto a couple of issues raised by my colleague, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, when the bulk of his argument and response to our \nPatients' Bill of Rights has to do with the issue of cost. I just want \nto point out that the most reliable studies done by the GAO indicate \nthat the increased costs across America will be somewhere between $1 \nand $2 per patient per month, which I think is less than a cup of \nStarbuck's coffee. My suspicion is that most Americans would be willing \nto bear that cost to have real and meaningful health care reform.\n\n  There is a lot of rhetoric about national health insurance, and they \nare not for that. This bill has absolutely nothing to do with national \nhealth insurance. What it has to do with is creating rights for \npatients that provide them with protections against HMOs and health \ninsurance companies that are taking advantage of them on a daily basis.\n  There is another huge difference between these two bills. I prefer \nnot to talk about them as the Democratic or Republican bill because, \nfor me at least, this is not a partisan issue; it is a substantive \nissue. If we have a bill that is a real, meaningful Patients' Bill of \nRights, whether it is Democratic or Republican, or a compromise between \nthe two, I would support it. It makes no difference to me who authors \nthe bill. I came here to talk about an issue that is critical to the \npeople of North Carolina, to the people of America.\n  The people of America are not interested in partisan bickering on the \nfloor of the Senate. They are not interested in that; they don't care \nabout it. What they do care about, and what I care about, is addressing \nthe issue of health care and the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights \nin a real substantive and meaningful way.\n  I want to talk briefly, if I can, about a real case I was involved in \npersonally--at least my law firm was involved in--before I came to the \nSenate this past January. The case involved a young man named Ethan \nBedrick. Ethan was born with cerebral palsy. As a result of his \ncerebral palsy, he needed a multitude of medical treatments, including \ntherapists--physical and speech--to help him with mouth movement and \nhis limbs. The physical therapy was prescribed specifically for the \npurpose of being able to pull his limbs out and back and out and back, \nso he didn't develop what is called muscle contractures, so that he \ndidn't get in a condition where he could not move his arms and legs any \nlonger.\n  Ethan is from Charlotte, NC. Ethan's doctors who were seeing him--a \nmultitude of doctors, including physical therapists, a general practice \nphysician, a pediatric neurologist who specialized in making \ndeterminations about what children in his condition needed--all of \nthose physicians, every single one of them, everybody treating him came \nto the conclusion that Ethan needed physical therapy.\n  When the family went to their health insurance company to try to get \nreimbursed for the physical therapy, the health insurance company \ndenied paying for the physical therapy. Basically, they decided it \nbased upon an extraordinarily limited and arbitrary reading of the term \n``medical necessity.'' They basically found the most limited definition \nand they looked around and found a doctor who was willing to support \nthat position. So they denied the claims.\n  I want the American people to understand that every doctor who was \ntreating Ethan said he needed this care. It was absolutely standard \ncare for a young child with cerebral palsy. But there was some doctor \nworking for an insurance company somewhere in America who was willing \nto say: No, I don't think he needs it. Therefore, they denied coverage, \nregardless of what all his treating physicians said.\n\n  We filed a lawsuit on behalf of Ethan against the insurance company. \nWe had to jump through extraordinary hoops because it is so difficult \nto bring any kind of action against a health insurance company or an \nHMO. The case was decided, ultimately, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Fourth Circuit, which covers a number of States in the southeastern \nUnited States. That court, which is well known for its conservative \nnature, issued an opinion on Ethan's case. I will quote very briefly \nfrom that opinion. The court addressed in very stark terms what they \nsaw as the problem. I am reading now from the opinion of the Fourth \nCircuit:\n\n       . . . The precipitous decision to give up on Ethan was made \n     by Dr. Pollack, who could provide scant support for it. The \n     insurance company boldly states that she [Dr. Pollack] has a \n     ``wealth of experience in pediatrics and knowledge of \n     cerebral palsy in children.'' We see nothing [in the Record] \n     to support this. . . . In fact, she was asked whether, in her \n     twenty years of practice, she ever prescribed either speech \n     therapy, occupational therapy, or physical therapy for her \n     cerebral palsy patients. Her answer: ``No, because in the \n     area where I practiced, the routine was to send children with \n     cerebral palsy to the Kennedy Center and the Albert Einstein \n     College of Medicine. We took care only of routine physical \n     care.\n       So much for Dr. Pollack's ``wealth of experience.''\n\n  This was a physician who had absolutely no experience with \nprescribing physical therapy for children with cerebral palsy. Yet this \nphysician was the sole basis for the insurance company denying this \nvery needed care for this young boy with cerebral palsy.\n  It gets worse. Dr. Pollack was then asked whether physical therapy \ncould prevent contractures, which is what is caused when children with \ncerebral palsy don't get this. Their arms and legs become contracted \nand they can't be pulled out.\n  This was her answer: No.\n  She was asked: Why not?\n  Answer: Because it is my belief that it is not an effective way of \ntreating contractures.\n  This is the insurance company doctor.\n  She was asked: Where did this belief come from?\n  She says: I cannot tell you exactly how I developed it because the \ntruth is I haven't thought about it for a long time.\n  The nadir of this testimony was reached soon thereafter because the \nbaselessness for this insurance company doctor's decision became very \napparent. The Fourth Circuit quotes from the questions and answers to \nDr. Pollack:\n\n       Question: . . . If Dr. Lesser and Dr. Swetenburg were of \n     the opinion that physical therapy at the rate and \n     occupational\n\n[[Page S7513]]\n\n     therapy at that rate were medically necessary for Ethan \n     Bedrick, would you have any reason to oppose their opinion?\n       Answer: I am not sure I understand the question. Using what \n     definition of medical necessity?\n       Question: Well, using the evaluation of medical necessity \n     as what is in the best interests of the child, the patient.\n       Answer: I think we are talking about two different things.\n       Question: All right. Expand, explain to me what two \n     different things we are talking about?\n       Answer: I'm speaking about what is to be covered by our \n     contract.\n       Question: Is what is covered by your contract something \n     that's different than the best interests of the child as far \n     as medical treatment is concerned?\n       Answer: I find that's a little like ``have you stopped \n     beating your wife?''\n       Question: That's why I ask it. If Doctor Swetenburg and Dr. \n     Lesser recommended physical therapy and occupational therapy \n     at the rates prescribed, do you have any medical basis for \n     why this is an inappropriate treatment that has been \n     prescribed [for this boy]?\n\n  Remember, this is the insurance company doctor on the basis for which \nthe insurance company had denied all coverage for this care.\n\n       Answer: I have no idea. I have not examined the patient. I \n     have not determined whether it is appropriate or \n     inappropriate. But that isn't a decision I was asked to make.\n\n  So what happened is, we have an insurance company doctor with no \nexperience, never examined the child, who has decided this care is not \nmedically necessary or medically appropriate, based on nothing and the \ninsurance company denies coverage in the face of every single health \ncare provider saying this child with cerebral palsy needs to be \ntreated.\n  This is a perfect example of what is wrong with the system. It is why \nwe need real external review. It is why we need an independent body \nthat can look at a decision made by an insurance company and decide--it \nwould be obvious in this case--that the decision was wrong and that a \nchild is suffering as a result.\n  When I say an independent review, I mean a really independent review, \nnot an independent review board made up of people chosen by the \ninsurance company. That is an enormous difference between one of the \nbills being offered by our opponents and the bill being offered by us. \nWe would set up a real and meaningful independent review board so that \nwhen something like this happens to Ethan Bedrick, a child with \ncerebral palsy, there would be a way to go to an independent board \nimmediately and get a review, the result of which the decision would be \nreversed and in a matter of weeks, at the most, this child would get \nthe therapy he so desperately needs.\n  The long and the short of it is, even after we won this case in the \ncourt of appeals, it was over a year before Ethan Bedrick began to \nreceive the care he deserved.\n  This case illustrates perfectly why this is such an acute problem and \nwhy we need to address it. We need desperately to address it in a \nnonpartisan way. We need to do what is in the best interests of the \nAmerican people; that is, to pass a real and meaningful Patients' Bill \nof Rights.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, are we still in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business. The \nRepublican side has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent we stay in morning business under \nthe current restriction and continue until 4 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for the last several days this Senate has \nbeen engaged in a fascinating exercise. I say that because last \nThursday evening before I left the Senate I was approached by an \nindividual in the media, a press person on Capitol Hill, who said: I \nunderstand the Democrats are about to slow the process down.\n  I said: What do you mean?\n\n       They think the Republican Senate is on a roll, you have \n     accomplished a good many things this week, and they are about \n     to slow you down.\n\n  I said: What is the strategy here?\n  That person said: We think they are going to offer the Patients' Bill \nof Rights to the agriculture appropriations bill.\n  Of course, we now know that is exactly what happened. Their tactic is \nto slow the process down. I am not sure why. Obviously, they are going \nto get ample opportunity to make their statements and to have their \nvotes on the issue of a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Whether Democrat or a Republican, we can mutually agree that there is \na very real problem in the health care community of our country \nspecific to Americans and health care coverage. I am not sure we get \nthere by punching American farmers in the face, or by acting as if they \nare of little to no importance and placing other national issues ahead \nof them.\n  That is what has happened. I am amazed some of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle from dominant agricultural States and who have \noftentimes led the agricultural debate on the floor would use these \ntactics to move their national agenda well beyond agriculture.\n  What is important is that we deal with the ag appropriations bill, \nthat we deal with it in a timely fashion to address those concerns of \nthe American agricultural community within the policies of our \ngovernment but also recognize we have a problem in the agriculture \ncommunity today. We have turned to the Secretary of Agriculture and to \nthe President to work with us to identify and shape that issue; we will \ncome back with the necessary vehicle to address it beyond the current \nappropriations bill.\n\n  We are waiting for their response.\n  Agriculture issues have never been partisan. They shouldn't be \npartisan. I am amazed my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nused this dilatory tactic that all but ``partisanizes'' an agriculture \nappropriations bill, almost saying it doesn't count; our political \nagenda is more important than the policies of the government handled in \nan appropriate and timely fashion.\n  Our leaders are negotiating at this moment to determine the shape of \nthe debate over a Patients' Bill of Rights. I hope they are able to \naccomplish that. The clock ticks. American agriculture watches and \nsays, there goes that Congress again, playing politics with a very \nimportant issue for our country.\n  I will be blunt and say, there goes the Democrat side of this body \nplaying politics with a very important appropriations bill that I hope \nwe can get to.\n  I see Senator Feingold on the floor. Our staffs have been working \ntogether on a very critical area of this bill, as I have been working \nwith the Presiding Officer, to make sure that we shape the agriculture \nappropriations bill and deal with dairy policy in a responsible \nfashion.\n  I come to the floor to associate patients' rights and health care \nwith an agriculture policy. Is that possible to do? Well, it is. My \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have attempted to do that. I \nhope my colleagues will listen as I shape this issue. There is a very \nimportant connection.\n  It will not be debated on the agriculture appropriations bill, but we \nall know that American agriculture--farmers and those who work for \nfarmers--is within the sector of about 43 percent of all workers in \nAmerica who are not working for an industry that insures them. As a \nresult, they must provide for themselves. They must self-insure and \nprovide for their individual workers within their farms or ranches.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights that my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle want to bring to the floor--and I trust their sincerity in \nwanting it to become law--will very much change the dynamics of the \nself-insured in this country. They do so in a very unique way. The \naverage family premium in the individual self-insured market--I am \ntalking about American farm families --is about $6,585 today. That is \nwhat it costs for them to insure themselves. Under the Democrat Kennedy \nbill, they are going to pay at least another $316.\n  Figure this one out: As my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ntalk about the worst depression in farm country in its history, with \ndepression-era prices for commodities, in\n\n[[Page S7514]]\n\nthe same breath they stop the agriculture appropriations bill and say: \nHey, farm family, on our Patients' Bill of Rights, because we are about \nto increase your medical costs by an average of $316 a year, that is \nmoney you don't have, but we will force you to do it anyway. Your \npremiums will go up by the nature of the bill we want to fashion.\n  Some have stated this bill will cause over 2 million Americans to \nlose their health care insurance. This chart demonstrates a problem \nthat all Members are sensitive to but a problem that we don't want to \ncause to be worse.\n  A phrase that has been used on this floor in a variety of debates in \nthe last couple of months is ``unintended consequences.'' If we pass \nthe Kennedy health care Patients' Bill of Rights, there is a known \nconsequence. You can't call it ``unintended.''\n  By conservative estimates it would add one million uninsured \nAmericans to the health rolls. That is the conservative estimate. I \nsaid 2 million a moment ago. That is the liberal estimate. It is \nsomewhere in that arena. The other side knows that America's farmers \nand farm families will have to pay $300 to $400 more per year in health \ncare premiums because they are self-insured.\n  That is the nexus with the farm bill and the agriculture \nappropriations bill in its strange and relatively obscure way. But it \nis real. I hope our leaders can be successful in shaping the debate \naround the Patients' Bill of Rights that says we will have that debate, \nhere is the time line, and here are the amendments that can be offered.\n  It is going to be up or down. We will all have our chance to make our \npoints, but let's not play the very dangerous game of tacking it onto \nany bill that comes along that stops us from moving the appropriation \nbills in a timely fashion. We will debate in a thorough nature why \ntheir legislation creates a potential pool of between 1 to 2 million \nAmericans who will become uninsured because of an increase in premiums.\n  On the other side of the equation is the Patients' Bill of Rights \ncrafted by the Republican majority in the Senate. We go right to farm \nfamilies. We say to farm families, we are going to give you a positive \noption in your self-insurance, and that is, of course, to create a \nmedical savings account.\n  In States made up of individual farms--Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, \nIllinois, and Iowa--already the meager efforts in creating medical \nsavings accounts we have offered in past law have rapidly increased the \ncoverage for health care at the farm level.\n  So if we want to create a true nexus between an agriculture bill and \na Patient's Bill of Rights, it is the Republican version that says \nlet's expand medical savings accounts, let's give small businesspeople, \nfarmers, ranchers, the option of being able to self-insure in a way \nthat will cost them less money and have insurance to deal with, of \ncourse, the catastrophic concerns in health care that we would want to \ntalk about.\n  The reason I have always been a supporter of medical savings accounts \nis that it really fits the profile of my State. Farmers, ranchers, \nloggers, miners--small businesspeople make up a dominant proportion of \nthe population of my State. Increasingly, many of them would become \nuninsured if the Democratic version, the Kennedy bill, were to pass \nthis Congress and become law. The unintended, or maybe the intended, \nconsequence would be to push these people out of private health care \ninsurance and therefore have them come to their Government begging for \nsome kind of health care insurance.\n  Why should we set up an environment in which we force people to come \nto the Government for their health care instead of creating an \nenvironment, a positive environment, that says we will reward you for \ninsuring yourself by creating for you the tools of self-insurance and \ntherefore create also a tax environment we want, where today health \ncare premiums for the self-employed are fully deductible, as they are \nfor big businesses which offer health care plans to their employees.\n  There is a strange, unique, and somewhat curious nexus between \nDemocrats blocking an agriculture appropriations bill coming to the \nfloor and the politics of the Kennedy bill on health care. It is that \nthey would cause even greater problems in the farm community by raising \nthe premiums, by forcing certain costs to go into health care coverage \ntoday. Our Patients' Bill of Rights would go in a totally opposite \ndirection, creating an environment in which people could become more \nself-insured at less money, at a time in American agriculture when it \nis estimated the average income of the American farmer, having dropped \n15 percent last year, could drop as much as 25 to 30 percent this year, \nwith commodity prices at near Depression-era levels.\n  We need to pass the agriculture appropriations bill. We will then \nwork with the Department of Agriculture and the Clinton administration \nto examine the needs, as harvest goes forward, to assure we do address \nthe American farmers' plight, as we did effectively last year. But it \nshould be done in the context of agriculture appropriations and a \npotential supplemental, if necessary, to deal with that. It does not \nfit, nor should it be associated with, a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I hope the end result today is to clear the track, provide a \ndesignated period of time for us to debate the Kennedy bill and a true \nPatients' Bill of Rights, as has been offered by the Republican \nmajority here in the Senate, and then to allow us to move later today, \nthis evening, and on tomorrow, to finish the agriculture appropriations \nbill and get on with the debate on that critical issue.\n  American agriculture is watching. I hope they write my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle and say: Cut the politics. Get on with the \nbusiness of good farm policy. Do not use us as your lever.\n  I hope that message is getting through to my colleagues on the other \nside. Let us deal with agriculture in the appropriate fashion.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I join what I suspect are one or two \nDemocratic colleagues of mine who have come out to the floor to speak\n\n[[Page S7515]]\n\nabout the Patients' Bill of Rights and the need to move forth with \nthat. I think I am correct, but in listening to National Public Radio \nthis morning, I heard that the American Medical Association was meeting \nand that one of the matters under discussion was the right of \nphysicians to unionize. Since you cannot replay NPR, or ask for a \nrepeat, I had to just hear what I heard; I think I heard it correctly. \nThat is an amazing thing. I know physicians have been unionizing in \nArizona and places where one would expect it. But to have the American \nMedical Association actually considering that, and the President, Dr. \nDickie, a woman, discussing the frustration of physicians with their \nability to give health care to their patients in a way that they \nbelieve and, in fact, were trained to do is extraordinary.\n  I could name any group in the world that would be looking for a place \nto find a union and I would put physicians among the very last. But, \nevidently, it is not that way. That in itself is an extraordinary call \nfor this Congress to move forward with health care. The call comes from \nthe American people also. They are calling for action on our part \nbecause of their sense of deep dissatisfaction.\n  Last year, we were told there wasn't enough time to take up a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. I don't think that could be the case this \nyear, since time seems to be mostly what we have, and therefore one \nmight conclude there might be a lack of willingness to take up a \nPatients' Bill of Rights this year. So we have to keep our priorities \nstraight. I intend to, and I think a lot of my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle feel that way.\n\n  Every single day that passes without enactment of patient protections \nis another day that millions of Americans, and thousands of the people \nI represent from West Virginia, are subject to the denial of needed \ntreatments because of the instinct of insurance companies to go to \ntheir bottom line and stay there. Every single day that we, as a \nCongress, fail to act on the Patients' Bill of Rights is another day \nthat Americans are left vulnerable to health care decisions that are \nmade perhaps not by their doctors, as they wish, but by business \nexecutives, or by boards, or people at the end of 1-800 numbers. We \nused to talk about this years ago, and we agreed it was a terrible \nthing and it had to stop. We were all going to do that, except that we \nhave not. We just haven't.\n  Every day we don't act, Americans are refused, No. 1, the specialty \ntreatments they need and deserve; No. 2, the ability to use any \nemergency room.\n  Imagine that. The Senator from Illinois is here. This Senator \nremembers being in Chicago a number of years ago, for whatever purpose, \nand I was told that six emergency rooms in the city of Chicago were \nclosed, and there were relatively few left. That is one of the largest \ncities in all of America. Emergency rooms are the most expensive form \nof health care, and they are always the things closed down when \nbusiness decisions are dominating hospitals.\n  On the other hand, the only way, having 43 million, 44 million, 45 \nmillion uninsured Americans, they can get health insurance is by going \nto emergency rooms. They have to have that right. It has to be \naccessible to them, not just somewhere out in the next State, or on the \nother side of the Mississippi River but accessible so they can get to \nit.\n  Third, they have to have the right to appeal the decision of their \nhealth care plans. It is a basic right. I will talk more about it.\n  Fourth, they should have the ability to ensure that medical decisions \nare made by their doctors, not by a board of executives.\n  We all know that managed care has changed the way health care is done \nin this country. We started saying that in the Finance Committee 10 or \n12 years ago. The question was, Does managed care save money for 1 year \nor 2 years? The general consensus was that managed care would save \nmoney for about 2 years, then it would come up against a hard wall and \npeople would have to start cutting. That was the general consensus \nthen. It is clearly showing itself to be even more the case now. That \nis for both delivery and the payment of health care in our country.\n  Obviously, a lot of problems have been created along the way. \nAmericans are very dissatisfied with the quality of their health care. \nThey make their feelings about that very clear. They don't like their \nlack of choice. They don't like the indiscriminate nature of insurance \ncompany decisionmaking.\n  Meanwhile, physicians often have, from their point of view --and from \nmy point of view--much too little input into health care decisions, and \nhence the NPR story this morning. They believe so strongly that they \nare doing something, which is an anathema, it would seem to me, to any \nphysician. But they are evidently doing this, or they are voting on \nthat as a matter of ``doctor rights,'' or whatever, at the American \nMedical Association meeting.\n  I think doctors think they face too much interference from the \ninsurance companies. Patients and doctors alike see health care \ndecisions driven by the financial concerns of something called health \nplans. What do we have to do? We have to guarantee access to specialty \ncare. I hear it all the time. We all hear it all the time in our homes \nand wherever we go.\n  Under managed care plans--most of them, not all of them--the \npatient's primary care physician may refer a patient to a specialist if \nthey determine that specialty care is necessary. However, things may \nchange, if the specialist is not on the list of the plan.\n  Then you come to this amazing situation of trying to ask a consumer \nof health care to understand that they are allowed to go to a \nspecialist, but they cannot because that specialist is not on their \nplan. Even the much criticized Clinton health care plan allowed that. \nYou could always go outside your HIPAA. You could always go to your \nspecialist, no matter where your specialist was. You could always go to \nyour specialist. Under the present system of health care, you can't do \nthat.\n  Then somebody from the ``administrative office,'' or some other \ndivision, takes over this whole question of whether you can or whether \nyou can't. Suddenly, the patient asks to see a specialist and finds out \nthat the executives in charge are not doctors. They are not medical \npeople. They refuse the right to go see a specialist. They refuse \npayment for the specialist who in fact was recommended by the patient's \noriginal primary care physician. That is wrong.\n  We must put an end to insurance company ``gag rules.'' That is \nanother point.\n  Patients need to trust the providers--that they are acting in the \nbest interests of the patients. There cannot be a situation where HMOs \npreclude doctors from prescribing necessary treatments or making \nreferrals to a specialist in the name of preserving the company's \nbottom line.\n  There is a sacred trust between a patient and a doctor. I don't have \nto elaborate on that. It is Norman Rockwell stuff. In fact, there are \nmany, many. He did many pictures of it. It is the classic American \nsituation--the trust between, the bond between, the patient and the \ndoctor.\n\n  For the doctor to be second-guessed by an insurance company \nbureaucrat just doesn't make sense.\n  I have listened to literally hundreds of patients and doctors \ncomplain that managed care plans are making decisions about care, about \nwhat types of procedures are allowed and are not allowed, and this \ndecision just creates a division between the patient and the doctor. \nThe patient is confused. The doctor is angry. It is not right.\n  Another point: Real access to emergency room care 24 hours a day has \nto be. It has to be 7 days a week. Wherever they are, it has to be. \nThey cannot be concerned about their insurance company second-guessing \ntheir health concerns.\n  Americans must be able to go to the nearest emergency room without \nthe fear that they will not be able to afford it, and they must be able \nto receive all necessary care in that facility to take care of their \nsituation.\n  In the United States of America we have been through this before. We \nare the only country in the world that doesn't have universal health \ninsurance. If we don't have that, at least let's allow a Patients' Bill \nof Rights so that people can have--including those who are not \ninsured--certain rights.\n  Another point: We must let people challenge the decisions made by \nHMOs\n\n[[Page S7516]]\n\nand seek retribution when HMO decisions lead to harm.\n  Is that radical? No. That is a standard part of American life, except \nit is more important in a lot of American life because of the actual \nhealth and physical safety of a patient. When Americans go to a doctor, \nthey should get the care they need. If they don't get it, they should \nhave the means and the right to address disputes. They should not have \nto worry about insurance companies cutting that off.\n  A central element of the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights is that \npoint--the ability to hold health care plans accountable for the \nmedical decisions that lead to harm.\n  The Republican plan fails to hold HMOs accountable. Under the \nRepublican plan, the only remedy available when a patient is harmed by \nan HMO decision is recovery of the actual cost of a denied procedure, \neven if the patient is already dead or disabled for life.\n  Make no mistake. If we don't respond quickly and forcefully enough, \nmore and more Americans are going to lose confidence in our system and \nin us. Already 90 percent of Americans are unhappy with their plan. \nShocking, shocking. We can do something about it. I think we have a \nmoral obligation to take up the Patients' Bill of Rights. We certainly \nhave the time because we are not doing a whole lot of other things \naround here that I can put my hands on. I think it is time that \nCongress take up and pass these patient protections this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/23/senate-section/article/S7516-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague from West \nVirginia.\n  Let me try to talk about this in a more blunt way, not in a bitter \nway, but let me be direct about it.\n  I think it is just outrageous. Mr. President, you are a friend. I \nhate to have such angry words. But we should be debating. Personally, I \nwish we were talking about universal health care coverage. The \ninsurance industry took it off the table. They dominate too much of \nthis political process.\n  I think Senator Feingold and I, before this debate is over, will come \nout and just talk about the contributions from all the different \nparties that are affected by this health care legislation. We should be \ntalking about universal health care coverage. But we certainly also \nshould be talking about patient protection.\n  We have a system where the bottom line is becoming the only line. It \nis becoming the incorporated and industrialized system.\n  The Republicans say they have a plan--the Republican ``patient \nprotection plan''--which I think really is an insurance company \nprotection plan. It covers about 48 million people. The people who \naren't covered, because of the risk--they can't be covered, because \nthey are in self-insured plans because of what the States do.\n  Our plan covers 163 million people.\n  No wonder my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't want to \ndebate this.\n  Second point: Who defines ``medical necessity''?\n  Our plan makes it clear that the providers decide what the care \nshould be for the consumer, for our children, for ourselves, for our \nloved ones. The Republican plan is not so clear on this question.\n  No wonder my colleagues don't want to have any debate.\n  Point of service option: I remember having an amendment in committee \nwhen we wrote this bill which at least would let people, if they are \nwilling to pay a little more, be able to purchase care outside of the \nnetwork, outside of the plan. If they need to go to see a specialist \nthey hear about who would make such a difference and would give them \nthe care they need, or for their loved one, we provide for that. The \nRepublican plan--the insurance-company protection plan--doesn't.\n  No wonder they don't want to debate this.\n  Who does the review?\n  When you want to make an appeal and you say you have been denied the \naccess to the physician you need to see, or your family can't get the \ncare they need, do you have an external review process? Is there an \nombudsman program back in our States? Make it grass roots. Do not talk \nabout centralized public policy. Make it happen back in our States. An \nombudsman program with external review, somewhere consumers can say: I \nhave been denied the care I need.\n\n  The Republican insurance company protection plan doesn't provide for \nthat. Our legislation does. We have a difference, America, between the \ntwo parties, that makes a difference in your lives.\n  With all due respect, I understand why my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle don't want to debate. The Senate is supposed to be \nthe world's greatest deliberative body. Our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle don't get the right to tell us that we won't be able \nto bring amendments to the floor, we won't be able to have a full-scale \ndiscussion, and we won't be able to have a thorough debate.\n  I can't wait for this debate. I introduced the patient protection \nbill 5 years ago, half a decade ago. This will be a great debate. I \nthink the country will love this debate. The people in Minnesota and \nthe people in our different States will say they are talking about a \nset of issues that are important to their lives.\n  The pendulum has swung too far in the direction of the big insurance \ncompanies that own and control most of the managed care plans in our \ncountry. Consumers want to know where they fit in. Ordinary citizens \nwant to know where they fit in. The caregivers, the doctors and the \nnurses, want to know where they fit in. When they went to nursing \nschool and when they went to medical school, they thought they would be \nable to make the decisions and provide people with care. Now they find \nthey can't even practice the kind of medicine that they imagined they \nwould practice when they were in medical school.\n  Demoralized caregivers are not good caregivers. We have demoralized \ndoctors and nurses; we have consumers who are denied access to care \nthey need; we have corporatized, bureacratized bottom-line medicine, \ndominated by the insurance industry in this country.\n  We have a piece of legislation to at least provide patients with some \nprotection and caregivers with some protection, and our Republican \ncolleagues don't want to debate this. I am not surprised. I am not \nsurprised.\n  On the other hand, you can't have it all ways. We wrote this bill in \nthe Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee. We had a pretty \ngood markup where we sat down, wrote the bill, and had pretty good \ndebate. I was disappointed that a lot of important amendments \nprotecting consumers were defeated on a straight party vote.\n  Now it is time to bring this legislation to the floor. As a Senator \nfrom Minnesota, I say to Senator Daschle that I absolutely support what \nhe is doing. I absolutely support what we are doing as Democrats. In \nfact, I am particularly proud right now to be a Democrat because I \nalways feel a lot better when we are talking about issues that make a \nreal difference to people's lives.\n  As far as I can tell, most of the people in our country are still \nfocused on how to earn a decent living, how to give their children the \ncare they need and deserve, how to do good by our kids, to do good by \nour State and country, how to not fall through the cracks on decent \nhealth care coverage, how to make sure we have affordable, dignified, \ngermane, good health care for our citizens.\n\n  This doesn't even get us all the way there. It seems to me the \nSenate, by bringing this bill to the floor, by having the opportunity \nto offer amendments and having the debate, can do something very \npositive. We can do something to make an enormous difference in the \nlives of people we represent.\n  The Democrats aren't going to let up. We are going to keep bringing \nour\n\n[[Page S7517]]\n\namendments to the floor. We are going to keep talking about health care \npolicy. We are going to keep talking about consumer protection and \npatient protection. We are going to keep talking about how to make sure \nthe people we represent get a fair shake in this health care system. We \nare going to keep saying that it is not our responsibility to be \nSenators representing the insurance companies; we are supposed to be \nrepresenting the vast majority of people who live in our States. That \nis what we are going to do, as long as it takes.\n  I am ready for this debate. I am ready. Let's start it now.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just a footnote. Altogether, we had 16 \nDemocrats come to the floor to speak about the importance of patient \nprotection and we have had two Republicans.\n  In one way I am not surprised because I don't think my colleagues \nhave a defensible case. They don't want to bring this motion to the \nfloor. They don't want to have a debate. They don't want to vote on the \namendments. But that is what it is all about.\n  We are not here to dodge; we are not here not to make difficult \ndecisions. We are not here to not be willing to debate legislation that \nis important to people's lives.\n  I say to the majority leader and my colleagues on the other side, it \nis true; we will have amendments. I have some great amendments in my-\nnot-so-humble opinion. Others may have a different view.\n  The point is, that is what it is about. Bring the amendments to the \nfloor. As Democrats, we will discuss what we believe, we will talk \nabout the legislation and the amendments we have that we think will \nlead to the best protection for people we represent in our States. And \nRepublicans will come out and they can talk about why they think these \namendments are a profound mistake and why their amendments will do \nbetter. They can talk about their legislation and we can talk about our \nlegislation. Maybe we will have plenty of compromise and maybe we will \ncome up with a great bipartisan bill. Who is to say?\n  Right now, all we have on the other side is silence, an unwillingness \nto debate this issue. If I didn't think I was taking advantage of the \nsituation, part of me is tempted to keep talking and asking Members to \ncome on out and debate. I won't. I think I made my point about 20 \ndifferent times in 20 different ways.\n  Since the Senator from Alabama is presiding, I do want to say this \nfor people who are watching: The Senator from Alabama can't debate \nbecause he is the Presiding Officer. He would. I know him well enough.\n  I say to Senator Sessions, we will get a chance, and all the rest of \nthe Senate will have a chance, to come out and debate patient \nprotection legislation. Let's have a good, substantive, serious debate. \nI know the Senator from Alabama loves a debate and he is good at it. So \nare many other Senators. It will not be debate for the sake of debate. \nIt will not be fun and games. It will be a very serious issue.\n  Honest to gosh, I came here as a Senator from Minnesota to do good \nfor people in my State. I can't do good for people in my State when I \nhave a majority party that wants to block patient protection \nlegislation. I didn't come here to represent the insurance industry. I \ndidn't come here to represent the pharmaceutical industry. I came here \nto represent people in Minnesota.\n  I want us to debate this legislation. I certainly hope Republican \ncolleagues will come out here and we will get going on this. Otherwise, \nfor as long as it takes, I think we are committed to using every bit of \nleverage we have to force a debate on this question.\n  Mr. President, if there are other colleagues on the floor, and it \nlooks as if maybe there are, I will yield the floor. I see my colleague \nfrom Tennessee. I say to my colleague from Tennessee, I am delighted he \nis out here. I hope this is the beginning of a discussion. Then we will \nhave this legislation on the floor soon. Let's have the debate. Let's \npass good legislation that will help people in our States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/23/senate-section/article/S7517-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7517-S7521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that morning \nbusiness be extended to 5:30, as under the previous agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in part to respond to much of the \ndiscussion that has gone on this afternoon. But really, I think more \nimportant, to put in perspective where we are today with this issue of \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights and what we can do as a legislative body \nto address some very real problems, very real challenges that face the \nhealth care system, that face individuals, that face patients, and face \npotential patients as they travel through a health care structure that \nin some ways is very confusing, in some ways is conflicting but \nunderneath provides the very best care of anyplace in the world.\n  Many of the challenges we face today are a product of an evolving \nhealth care system where we have Medicare, which treats about 39 \nmillion seniors and individuals with disabilities. We have real \nchallenges in Medicare because it is a government-run program that is \ngoing bankrupt. It is a program that has a wonderful, over 30-year \nhistory of treating seniors, people over the age of 65, and individuals \nwith disabilities. These are people who probably could not get care \nanywhere near the degree of quality they can get today. Yet we have \nhuge problems and we have tried to address them through a Medicare \nCommission. Unfortunately, even though we had a majority of votes \nsupporting a proposal there called Premium Support, the President of \nthe United States felt he could not support that proposal and thus, \nright before the final vote, pulled back and said I will provide a \nsolution to Medicare in the next several weeks.\n  To date we have not heard from the President of the United States. \nYet we have a program with 39 million people in it going bankrupt. It \nis going bankrupt in--now the year is 2014. That is about 39 million \npeople. About 30 million people are in Medicaid. That is another \ngovernment-run program, the joint Federal-State program, funded \nprincipally, almost half and half, by Federal and State but run by the \nStates. That is directed at the indigent population, principally. There \nare just over 30 million people in it. It is a program that I think \nalso has been very effective.\n  As a physician in Tennessee, I had the opportunity, the blessed \nopportunity of taking care of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of \nMedicaid patients. But also, as you talk about States in the Medicaid \nprogram, there is a lot of discussion of how we can improve it, how we \ncan improve quality. That discussion needs to continue. It is going on \nin every courthouse in every State, every legislative body, every \nGovernor's office, every community townhall right now.\n  Then we have the third area, the nongovernmental area, where this \nwhole Patients' Bill of Rights issue is one we must address.\n  I should say, because we have heard so much to the contrary, we have \na bill, the Republican bill. It is called the Patients' Bill of Rights \nPlus. That was introduced in the last Congress. That was talked about \nalong with the Kennedy-Daschle bill from last year. Both of those bills \nwere brought into Congress. It was the Republican bill which was what \nwe call ``marked up.'' That means it was taken to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions, the Health Committee, the \nappropriate committee. In that committee, it was debated; it was talked \nabout. We probably had, I don't know--we started with about 40 \namendments in that committee about 3 or 4 months ago on the Patients' \nBill of Rights Plus. They were debated. We had some good debate. Some \nthings we did not debate and they need to be taken forward and further \ndiscussed.\n\n[[Page S7518]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. No, I will not. For the last 2 hours I really had not had \nan opportunity to talk. If I can just finish my remarks?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thought the Senator would yield for a question.\n  Mr. FRIST. The issue is have we been able to debate or talk about or \ndiscuss this. Let's remember through the appropriate senatorial \ncommittee process we have debated this very bill. We have debated such \nthings as consumer protection standards. We have debated specialty \ncare, access to specialists, continuity of care, emergency care, choice \nof plans, access to medication, access to specialists, grievance and \nappeals. These were introduced and we talked about discrimination by \ninsurance companies using genetic information, medical savings \naccounts. These are all issues that have been debated.\n  I, for one, as a physician, as a United States Senator, as a chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Public Health, and as a member of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, have been involved in those \ndebates and in those discussions. So when we have people coming to the \nfloor again and again with so much rhetoric and so much fire saying \nthose bad Republicans out there really just do not care, do not want to \ntalk about it, do not want a debate, do not want to study the issues--\nlet me just say that is absolutely false. It is absolutely false. The \nAmerican people need to know that. I think the sort of rhetoric we have \nheard this afternoon and over the last several days is clearly \npolitical points they want made.\n  I would like us to come back and continue the debate, the important \ndebate on the issue of this nongovernmental sector, to make sure we \nconsider that individual patient. Again, I have had the opportunity to \ntreat thousands, probably tens of thousands, of these patients. Those \nissues need to be addressed, but I think they need to be addressed in a \nmore mature, more sophisticated, more thoughtful way. And we have done \njust that. The Republican leadership bill is a bill that has been \ndebated in committee. It has been discussed. It is called the Patients' \nBill of Rights Plus Act. It basically has six components to address \nthis whole issue of health care and Patients' Bill of Rights and a few \nother things.\n  One is strong consumer protection standards. No, it does not include \neverybody. Why does it not just include everybody? Because about half, \na little over half of those people are already protected under State \nlaw. The States are doing a good job. I guess people can bash the \nStates and say the States don't care, the Governors don't care, State \nlegislatures don't care, but I think they do care. We do not have any \ngreat ownership of concern in this body, being the only ones who care. \nOur Governors do care and they have made great strides.\n  So when it comes to emergency care, prohibition of gag clauses, \ncontinuity of care, access to obstetricians and gynecologists and \npediatricians, access to specialists--such as me, as a heart surgeon--\naccess to medications, consumer protections, we say let's apply those \nto the unprotected, the people who are not protected now by State law. \nThat is about 48 million people.\n  We address issue No. 2, of comparative information. It is very \nconfusing today. It is confusing because we had this evolution of \nmanaged care, which is a new concept. Mr. President, 15 or 20 years ago \nthere was no such thing as managed care. Yet right now, 80 percent of \nall care delivered is through managed care through networks and through \ncoordinated care. But nobody has the answer yet. We are not smart \nenough to know exactly what is the best way to manage that care.\n  Some people think all managed care is a staff model health \nmaintenance organization, and there is a lot of anger by the American \npeople against health maintenance organizations. But let me at least \nintroduce the concept that coordinated care, or organized delivery of \ncare so there is an appropriate input of resources, has a very good \noutcome today. That is because of the great dynamism of our health care \nsystem. Because this is America, because we encourage innovative \nthought and creativity, we are still searching for the model, and we \nare probably not going to come up with a one-size-fits-all cookie-\ncutter model. We will probably come up with a range of ways in which \nthat coordinated care can be delivered.\n\n  As we go through that process, it is very confusing to the consumer, \nto the patient, to the individual, what is the best plan. Is it a \nparticular HMO? Is it a point-of-service plan? Is it a provider-\nsponsored organization?\n  In the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, we address that. Basically, \nwe say comparative information about health insurance coverage, not \njust for 48 million people but for all 124 million Americans covered by \nself-insured plans and fully insured group plans, must be made \navailable. That comparative information is important, because that is \nthe only way an individual can really know whether plan A or plan B or \nHMO A or managed care C or fee for service is best for them.\n  Internal and external appeal rights: This is the third component of \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act. Again, it is a very important \naspect, because it says let's fix the system, instead of what some of \nthe other proposals have introduced, which is let's put lawyers and \ntrial lawyers in there and let's threaten to sue and that is going to \nchange the system.\n  What we say is, let's fix the system. An example is, if as a member \nof a health care plan I have a question on coverage and I think a \nparticular procedure should be covered, yet there is some question \nabout it, I can go to a person in that plan and say: Is this covered or \nnot? They will say yes or no. If I disagree, I can contest that, and \nthere is an internal appeals process where that questioning can be \ntaken care of in a timely fashion.\n  Our bill says, if that is the case in this internal appeals process \nand you still disagree, you do not have to stop there; there are \noptions, and that is the so-called external appeals process.\n  The external appeals process is set up in our Patients' Bill of \nRights Plus Act to be independent, to be outside the plan--that is why \nit is called external appeals--to be a physician or a medical \nspecialist reviewing that coverage decision in the exact same field \nwhere the coverage decision is in question.\n  Internal appeals, external appeals. Let's say you have gone through \nthe internal appeals process and the external appeals process, and a \ndecision is made by that independent medical reviewer that the \nindividual patient is right and the health care plan is wrong. That \ndecision in our plan is binding, and therefore you have to receive \ncoverage under that plan.\n  I walked through that because it is an important part of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights Plus Act and because that is the component \nwhich fixes the system. It fixes the system instead of having this \nthreat of lawsuits trying to put a system back into place but with no \nguarantee.\n  A fourth component of the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act that has \nbeen talked about, that passed out of the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions and has been sent to the floor, is a ban \non the use of predictive genetic information. This particular aspect of \nthe bill does apply to 140 million Americans who are covered by self-\ninsured and fully insured group health plans, as well as the individual \nplans. I say 140 million people. I talked about the 39 million people \nin Medicare and over 30 million people in Medicaid, and for the \nnongovernmental aspect, the ban on the use of predictive genetic \ninformation applies to all 140 million people.\n  Why is that important? That is in the Republican bill. It is not in \nthe Kennedy bill. I believe it is an important aspect, because what it \nrecognizes is that technology is changing, new tests are being \nintroduced almost daily with a genetic basis, in large part because of \nthe Human Genome Project which has introduced about 2 billion bits of \ninformation that we simply did not know 4 or 5 years ago and because of \nthe investments the Federal Government had made in medical science.\n  The real problem is, with all of this new testing coming on board, \nthere is the potential for an insurance company to discriminate against \na patient, either to raise premiums or to basically say, ``We are not \ngoing to cover you.'' Therefore, in this Patients' Bill of Rights Plus \nAct, we put a ban on the use of predictive genetic information, which \nis a very important part of this bill.\n\n[[Page S7519]]\n\n  A fifth area that is in our bill, that has passed through the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions under Senator \nJeffords' leadership, is a real quality focus. The impression is, we \nknow what good quality of care is and we know what bad quality of care \nis. All of us, after we see a doctor, like to think we have good \nquality of care. For the most part, the quality of care in our country \nis very high. In truth, how we measure quality of care in this country \nas a science is in its infancy. We are just learning about it. When I \nwas in medical school, there was no such field as outcomes research, \nwhat is the outcome after a particular procedure.\n  Mr. President, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, as we have \nheard, has been debated in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee and passed successfully by a majority of members and sent to \nthe Senate. It is a bill that has really six different components.\n  It addresses, I believe, the fundamental challenge that we have; that \nis, to improve the quality of health care, real quality of health care \nfor individuals; to improve access to health care, something that I \nbelieve is very important. The Kennedy bill does the opposite. Instead \nof improving access, diminishing the number of uninsured, his bill does \njust the opposite. It drives people to the ranks of the uninsured, \nincreasing the number of uninsured people today by as many as a \nmillion. Nobody has refuted that.\n  The third very important part of the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus \nAct that passed through the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee successfully is that of consumer protections. Again, I keep \nhearing that the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act does not do this for \nspecialists, does not do this for emergency care, does not offer true \npoint of service, and does not offer true continuity of care. I have to \ntake a few minutes and run through it.\n  Emergency care: Under our bill, plans will be required to use the so-\ncalled ``prudent layperson'' standard for providing in-network and out-\nof-network emergency screening exams and stabilization. This prudent \nlayperson standard simply means, if you are in a restaurant and \nsomebody begins choking, that makes sense as an emergency service. If \nyou think you are having a heart attack and it may be indigestion, or \nit may be a heart attack and you go to the emergency room and you find \nit is indigestion, the initial screening exams and stabilization would \nbe taken care of. That is a very important component of our bill.\n  No. 2, we have heard about pediatricians, obstetricians, \ngynecologists. Under our bill, health plans would be required to allow \ndirect access to obstetricians, to gynecologists, and to pediatricians \nfor routine care without gatekeepers, without referrals.\n  Why is that the case? The reasons are obvious. The pediatricians, \nobstetricians, and gynecologists are in the business of doing what we \ncall in the medical field ``primary care.'' You don't need a \ngatekeeper. You shouldn't have a gatekeeper. No managed care company, I \nbelieve, should require a gatekeeper in terms of access for \nobstetricians, gynecologists, and pediatricians for routine care.\n  Thirdly, this issue of continuity of care: I have heard it again and \nagain. In our bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, plans who \nterminate physicians or do not renew physicians from their networks \nwould allow continued use of that physician, of that provider, at the \nexact same payment or cost-sharing arrangement as before in the plan \nfor up to 90 days. If the enrollee is receiving any type of \ninstitutional care or is terminally ill, or if they happened to be \npregnant and there is termination or nonrenewal of your physician with \nthat plan, you would be covered through the pregnancy through that \npostpartum care. That gives security to the patients. That is why it is \nimportant to have this very important consumer protection standard.\n  Access to specialists: I have heard all day long and over the last \nseveral days that the Republican bill doesn't give you access to \nspecialists. Let me tell you what it does. Health plans would be \nrequired, under our bill, to ensure that patients have access to \ncovered specialty care to a heart surgeon, to a pulmonologist, to an \narthritis specialist within the network or, if necessary, through \ncontractual arrangements outside of the network with specialists. It is \nin the bill.\n  People say it is not in the bill. It is in the bill. What more can \none say. That is why it is important to get rid of the rhetoric and go \nto the heart of the matter--how we improve quality of health care and \naccess to health care, and put strong consumer protections in so that \nthe patients can work with the health care plan to not sue somebody, \nnot empower trial lawyers, not to have angry, rhetorical sort of \ncomments but to improve health care, the quality of health care.\n  This access to specialists, again, the other side seems to ignore \nwhat is in the bill. I know they probably haven't had a chance yet to \nread the bill, even though it has gone through the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee. It has been debated. Scores of \namendments were introduced there. Well over a dozen, I know, were \ndebated and voted upon.\n  In this access to specialists component, if the plan, under our bill, \nrequires authorization by a primary care provider, it must provide for \nan adequate number of referrals to that specialist--I think that is an \nimportant component--not just one referral where you have to go back to \na gatekeeper, back and forth, but if you are going to have treatment by \na specialist, that an adequate number of referrals are made.\n  Choice of plans: How many times have we heard: Our plan provides real \nchoice and that Republican plan doesn't provide choice?\n  Let me tell you what our plan does. Plans that offer network-only \nplans would be--I use the word ``required'' again--required to offer \nenrollees the option to purchase real point-of-service coverage. And \nthere can be an exemption for the small employer out there. Other \nhealth plans could potentially be exempt if they offered two or more \noptions.\n  People may say, why would you exempt somebody from offering a point-\nof-service plan if they have two other health care plans? The reality \nis, if you offer health care plan A and plan B, and they are different \nproviders, with different physicians and different nurses in plan A \nthan there are in plan B, then you do have a choice among plans. \nTherefore, you don't have to require a very specific out-of-network, \npoint-of-service option.\n  This whole consumer protection field is an important component, and \nthis was actually improved in what we call markup in the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee--access to medications, to \nmake sure if you are in a health care plan that offers certain \ncoverage, you have access to the appropriate medicines.\n  What is in our plan is as follows:\n  Health plans that do provide prescription drugs through a formulary \nwould be required to ensure the participation of people who understand \nclinical care--physicians and pharmacists--in developing and reviewing \nthat formulary.\n  That is important. As a physician, you don't want bureaucrats putting \nformularies together, but people who understand clinical care. \nTherefore, that bill was improved to say that physicians and \npharmacists must be involved.\n  In addition, in our bill, plans would also be required to provide for \nexceptions from the formulary limitation when a nonformulary \nalternative is medically necessary and appropriate. I think that is an \nimportant part of the bill because, as you can imagine, in a formulary \nyou can't predict and put on every single medicine for every single \ndisease. Therefore, there must be enough flexibility to give \nalternatives if what is in that formulary is not--I use these words \nbecause it is in the bill --medically necessary and appropriate.\n  These are just some of the consumer protections that are part of the \nbill. I think it is important to stress those. Others that are in the \nbill include issues surrounding behavioral health, issues surrounding \ngag clauses. Again, it is inexcusable that a managed care company would \ncome forward to a physician and say: Physician, for you to be a member \nof our HMO or our managed care, you cannot and should not discuss the \nfull range of alternatives of treatment and care with the patient. That \nhas to be prohibited.\n\n[[Page S7520]]\n\n  In our bill, in terms of gag rules, plans would be prohibited from \nincluding any type of gag rules in doctor contracts, physician \ncontracts, provider contracts, or restricting providers from \ncommunicating with patients about treatment options. No more gag rules.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act is a piece of legislation that \nwe have all worked very hard on over the last year, year and a half. It \nhas gone through the process that has been set up in terms of debate \nand in terms of improving the bill in the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee. It is a bill that I look forward to having on the \nfloor so we can debate it and improve it over time, and make sure that \nwe have a real balance between the rights of a patient versus the \nrights of managed care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Tennessee, \nif my colleague believes this legislation the Republicans introduced in \ncommittee--and I am on the same committee--is such a great piece of \nlegislation protecting patients' rights, then what in the world is the \ndelay in bringing it before this body?\n  Again, what I am saying is self-evident. If my colleagues on the \nRepublican side think this is such good legislation, why the delay? Why \nthe delay and the delay?\n  The only reason we are fighting it out on an ag appropriations bill \nis that we want to make it crystal clear we are here to represent the \npeople in our States. This piece of legislation which my colleague from \nTennessee has talked about--I was in the markup on that bill, which is \nwhen we write a bill in committee--has holes like Swiss cheese. No \nwonder they do not want to bring this bill to the floor.\n  They have about a third of the people covered. I will start out with \nthe question of who is covered and who is not covered. Their bill \ncovers 48 million people. The Democratic bill covers 163 million \npeople.\n  My colleague says it is the States. Why should a child or a family in \none State, i.e. like Mississippi, not have any protection because he or \nshe lives in Mississippi but have protection in Minnesota or Wisconsin? \nDoes that make any sense? Why should a small businessperson in \nMississippi or a farmer in Mississippi not have any coverage whatsoever \nbut have some kind of protection in Wisconsin or Minnesota?\n  I would love to have that debate. I would love to have my Republican \ncolleagues talk about why they only want to cover about a third of the \npeople in the country.\n  I would love for them to defend the proposition that many families \nwill receive no protection whatsoever, vis-a-vis these large insurance \ncompanies that practice this bottom-line medicine which basically say, \nwhen people want access to specialists they need, specialists for their \nchildren, specialists for women, they are not going to have access and \nthere is not going to be any protection for them, because they do not \nlive in the right State. Let's debate that.\n\n  There are 200 consumer, patient, and provider organizations that \nsupport the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights legislation; not any \nthat I can identify, except for the insurance industry, that support \nthe Republican plan.\n  Surely these consumer organizations and the providers, the \ncaregivers, know something about this topic. Surely they have a \nposition that is important. But I do not see any support for this \nRepublican plan.\n  The Democratic plan protects all patients with private insurance; the \nRepublican plan, no.\n  The Democratic plan holds these health insurance plans accountable; \nthe Republican plan, no.\n  In the Democratic plan, we make sure that the physicians, the \ndoctors, the nurses, define ``medical necessity.'' We do not have the \ninsurance industry's managed care plans dominate--unlike the Republican \nplan.\n  In the Democratic plan, we do have a real point-of-service option \nwhere people are given a choice. It drives people crazy when their \nemployer shifts plans and all of a sudden--they had been taking their \nchild to a family doctor--they can no longer take that child to that \ndoctor. Does the Republican plan assure they will be able to do so? No.\n  When are we going to make sure that consumers really do have some due \nprocess? I heard my colleague from Tennessee talk about an internal \nappeals process. That is within the managed care plans, most of which \nare dominated, owned, by these large insurance companies.\n  We are talking about a strong external appeals process. I say to my \ncolleague from Wisconsin, we are talking about somewhere that a \nconsumer can go and make an appeal. We are talking about an ombudsman \nprogram where you have an office, you have a telephone number, you have \nadvocates to call. Do my Republican colleagues want to do this? No.\n  Specialists who can coordinate care. Your child needs to see a \npediatrician who specializes in oncology because your child is \nstruggling with cancer. Do we make sure you have access to that \nspecialist? Yes. Does the Republican plan make sure that you--a family \nin Minnesota or Michigan--have access to that specialist you so \ndesperately need for your child? No.\n  My colleagues come out on the floor--again, with the Senator from \nTennessee that makes four Republicans who have been out here today--16 \nDemocrats. They can come out, and they can give a speech and say: Well, \nwe have a bill, and it's a very good bill. But you know what. If it is \nsuch a good bill, bring it out to the floor. If you have such a good \nproposal, bring it out to the floor. Let's debate this. We have had \nenough delay. That is all we have had--delay, delay, delay.\n  Emergency room access is really important. I heard my colleague talk \nabout that. But I say to the American people, Minnesotans, when you get \na chance to carefully examine the ``Republican Insurance Company \nProtection Act''--that is what I call it--you will find out there is a \nlittle bit of protection for emergency room access but it is not really \nstrong. Our plan does not equivocate at all. We make sure you have that \naccess. We make sure it is covered. You get to keep your doctor \nthroughout treatment. The Republican plan gives you a little bit of \nprotection. We think you should have complete protection.\n\n  I tell you, this has gone on long enough. My challenge to my \nRepublican colleagues is, if you think your plan is so good--and I \ncertainly believe you operate in good faith; you have to believe it is \na good plan or why would you write it--then bring it out here. We have \nto have the debate. We have amendments. We are committed to making sure \nthere is good patient protection legislation passed by this Senate. We \nare ready for the debate.\n  We would love to debate a plan that covers only one-third of the \nAmericans in our country. We would love to debate a plan that does not \nassure a family with a child who is gravely ill that that child will \nhave access to the best care available, to the best care that is there. \nWe would love to debate that plan. We would love to debate a plan that \ndoes not provide consumers with a real choice to be able to go out and \nget the very best care they need for their loved ones. We would love to \ndebate a plan that does not give consumers the right to really \nchallenge some of these bean counters, some of these managed care plans \nowned by these large insurance industries. We would love to debate the \n``Republican Insurance Company Protection Plan'' versus our patient \nprotection plan.\n  But, again, I am on the floor, and now another speech has been given; \nbut I have nobody to debate. I asked if anyone wanted to yield for \nquestions. They do not want to yield for questions. Let's debate this. \nIt will not be a bitter debate. It will not be a debate with hatred. \nBut you know what. It is going to be serious. It is a pretty important \nquestion for families in our country. It is pretty important to people.\n  In case anybody has not noticed--I imagine every Senator has; all you \nhave to do is spend 1 minute in your State--people are really getting \nfed up with this. They do not much like the way in which the insurance \nindustry dominates health care. They do not much like the fact that \nthey believe they have just been left out of the loop. You know what \nelse. The caregivers--the doctors and nurses--feel the same way.\n  It is time that we pass legislation with teeth. The Republican plan, \nthe\n\n[[Page S7521]]\n\n``Insurance Company Protection Plan,'' pretends that it is a patient \nprotection act. It is full of loopholes. It is Swiss cheese \nlegislation. It is hard to defend it.\n  I can understand why my colleagues do not want to defend it. I can \nunderstand why they do not want to debate. I can understand why they \nhave blocked our efforts, so far, to bring patient protection \nlegislation to the floor. But I am telling you something: People in the \ncountry are demanding that we pass this legislation.\n  We are on a mission. The Democrats are on a mission. We are going to \nbring these amendments to the floor. We are going to insist there be a \ngood, strong, honest debate; and we are going to do well by the people \nwe represent.\n  I would be pleased to debate anybody, but in the absence of anyone to \ndebate, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak for just a few minutes.\n  What is the status of business in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico should be informed \nwe are in morning business and there are 4 minutes remaining under the \ncontrol of the Democratic side.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Robert \nMendoza, a fellow in my office, be granted floor privileges during my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I would like to use those 4 minutes to say a few things \nabout the Patients' Bill of Rights and the importance of the issue to a \ngreat many people in my State and around the country.\n  I think it is clear, from surveys I have seen, the American people \nwant reform of this system of managed care and health maintenance \norganizations. There are a great many instances that have been called \nto our attention in our home States. I have heard of them in New \nMexico, where people think the quality of care and the adequacy of care \nthey are being provided with is not what it should be.\n  Without passage of some type of meaningful managed care reform, \ncritical health care services will continue to be denied to many of the \npeople we represent. One of the issues I believe is very important is \nwhat is referred to as provider nondiscrimination. We need a managed \ncare health system that does not permit health plans to leave out \nnonphysician providers. I am talking about groups of health care \nproviders such as nurse practitioners, psychologists, nurse midwives, \nleaving those people out of the network so that patients of these \nhealth maintenance organizations, customers of these health maintenance \norganizations are denied the ability to obtain their health care from \nthose types of individuals.\n\n  In New Mexico, this is a critical concern. We have a shortage of \nphysicians in our State. It is, in many parts of our State, very \ndifficult to get health care, if you are required by your HMO to obtain \nthat health care through a physician.\n  What we would like to do as part of the bill, which we hope to get to \nvote on in the next week or so, is to ensure that health maintenance \norganizations, where these people are qualified and certified, permit \nnonphysician health care providers to participate in these networks.\n  This is a critical concern in my State. I am sure it is a critical \nconcern in many States.\n  Another issue that clearly needs to be addressed here is access to \nspecialists. That is an issue I know came up when we had the debate in \nthe Health and Education Committee. An amendment was offered to correct \nthat. I believe Senator Harkin offered that amendment; it was not \nsuccessful. I believe it is a very important issue that needs to be \nrevisited on the Senate floor.\n  There are many people who need the care of a specialist. Whether it \nis a pediatrician, whether it is an oncologist, whatever the specialty \nis, those people should not have to go through a family practitioner \nprior to going to that specialist. We would try to correct that in the \nlegislation as well.\n  There are many other concerns we have with the bill that came out of \nthe Health and Education Committee. I hope very much we get a full \ndebate in the Senate on the deficiencies of that bill. I hope we get a \nchance to amend that bill.\n  The American people have been anxious to see reform in this area now \nfor two Congresses that I am aware of. I think for us to continue to \ndelay and put off and evade this issue is not the responsible course \nfor us to follow. Our constituents, the people we represent in our \nStates, expect better of us.\n  The people I represent in New Mexico expect me to do something about \nthese very real problems they believe exist. In New Mexico, under the \nRepublican bill that was reported out of the Health and Education \nCommittee, there are almost 700,000 people who will not have \nsubstantive protections. In my State, there are 350,000 people who will \nnot be covered at all if we pass the bill that came out of committee.\n  Mr. President, I see my time is up. I appreciate the opportunity to \nmake comments, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/23/senate-section/article/S7521-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, yesterday on vote No. 180, \nwhich was the State Department authorization bill, in that legislation \nwas $819 million in U.N. back payments that the United States would pay \nto the U.N. In addition, there was $107 million the U.N. owed to the \nUnited States that was forgiven.\n  I was unaware that those provisions were in the legislation, and I \nvoted yea. Had I been aware of this, I would have voted nay.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to change my \nvote. This will in no way change the outcome of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, in the June edition of Leatherneck \nmagazine, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Charles Krulak, \nquotes his father as saying: ``The American people believe that Marines \nare downright good for the country.''\n  Mr. President, I agree with the Commandant's father. And I am pleased \nGeneral Krulak also holds that well founded opinion. The U.S. Marine \nCorps is collectively good for this country, and the services of \nindividual marines such as General Krulak are a big part of that \npositive contribution made by the corps.\n  Unfortunately, the title of the article in which General Krulak \nquoted his father was ``A farewell to the Corps.'' General Krulak will \nbe retiring after 4 years from his position as Commandant at the end of \nthis month.\n  I would like to thank him for his service and efforts on behalf of \nhis corps and his nation.\n  Although I have been on the Armed Services Committee a short 6 \nmonths, I\n\n[[Page S7522]]\n\nhave had several good experiences with the Commandant.\n  I think the most notable was in May of this year, when a large group \nof my constituents were taking a tour of the Pentagon, and the \nCommandant invited them into his office. He said then that he usually \ntries to do something similar--bring tourists into his personal \noffice--everyday. I do not think Krulak was fully aware of what he was \ngetting himself into, but all 50 or so crowded their way into his \noffice, and listened while he spoke about the corps, the moving of his \noffice down from the `barbed wire surrounded hill of the Naval Annex' \nto the corridors of the Pentagon, and the corps' efforts and ability to \nturn young men and women into marines.\n  Let me tell you, they were impressed. They were impressed with his \nposition, they were impressed with his efforts, they were impressed \nwith his commitment, and they were impressed with the man.\n  I have also had correspondence with General Krulak relating to our \nwork on S. 4, and for the process of preparing the defense \nauthorization. He consistently strikes me as a man who is well aware of \nthe challenges his position holds, and works to meet them.\n  He has been straightforward and dependable. Hearing testimony from \nhim at committee hearings is always a pleasure. He does not rattle off \nbland platitudes. I felt that I could always rely on his opinion to be \nthe truest possible interpretation of the situation, and one that held \nthe best interests of the country at the foremost.\n  Mr. President, let me end by repeating: General Krulak has been \nfundamentally good for this country. I wish him well in whatever new \ncourse he sets for himself.\n  Also, I would like to welcome Gen. James Jones into his role as the \n32d Commandant of the Marine Corps. I have met with him only very \nbriefly, but I look forward to working with him. I am sure he will \nfollow in the able footsteps of all the past U.S. Marine Corps \nCommandants, and serve the Marines and America admirably.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/23/senate-section/article/S7522-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7522-S7523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION AGREEMENT EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President. I take the opportunity today to call to \nthe attention of Members of the Senate and to the American people a \nvery important event that took place last week but was not widely \npublicized. On Wednesday, June 16, representatives from the Department \nof Defense and Russia's Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Yuri \nUshakov, signed an agreement extending the Cooperative Threat Reduction \n(CTR) program sponsored in 1991 by our distinguished colleagues, \nSenator Sam Nunn and Senator Richard Lugar. The agreement signed last \nweek extends the Nunn-Lugar threat reduction programs for 7 years until \n2006. That extension will build upon the critical work already \naccomplished that has reduced Russia's military threat to the United \nStates and our allies more effectively than any other measures \nundertaken since the end of the Cold War. In the context of these \nuncertain times and Russia's uncertain future, the investments made \nthrough Cooperative Threat Reduction programs promise to yield \ndividends that are essential to long-term peace and stability \nthroughout the world.\n  Indeed, the accomplishments of CTR are a more cost effective means to \nenhancing national security than any I know. Between 1992 and 1999, the \nNunn-Lugar programs have eliminated the potential for nuclear threats \nfrom former members of the Soviet Union including Kazakhstan, Ukraine, \nBelarus, and Uzbekistan. For $2.7 billion that the United States has \nspent on CTR since 1992, a bit more than the cost of a single B-2 \nbomber, there are now 1,538 fewer nuclear warheads available for use \nagainst the U.S. or our allies. The Russians have eliminated 50 missile \nsilos and 254 intercontinental ballistic missiles. In addition, we are \nin the process of dismantling some 30 strategic ballistic missile \nsubmarines that formerly threatened the United States from deep ocean \nsites. So far, U.S. and Russian teams have dismantled 148 missile \nlaunch tubes on those submarines and 30 sea-launched ballistic \nmissiles. CTR programs have eliminated more than 40 Russian strategic \nbombers that used to be within hours of American military and civilian \ntargets. Collectively, those actions under CTR have ensured that Russia \nhas met and continues to meet its treaty obligations under the \nStrategic Arms Reduction Treaty, START. More important, they have \nsignificantly cut back on the potential threat posed by those weapons \nto the United States, our allies, and our worldwide security interests.\n  The Cooperative Threat Reduction program extends beyond the \nelimination of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery. Funds for \nthis program are allocated to ensure the safe transportation, storage, \nsecurity, accounting, and monitoring of strategic and tactical nuclear \nweapons scheduled for destruction and for weapons grade nuclear \nmaterials from weapons that have been dismantled. I have visited Russia \nand personally observed implementation of the Department of Energy's \nMaterials Protection, Control, and Accounting program which enhances \nday-to-day security at dozens of nuclear sites across Russia. I remain \ndeeply concerned that without that assistance, the possibility of \nsmuggling nuclear materials into the wrong hands is a serious \npossibility that could threaten the entire world.\n  Looking toward the future, funds from CTR are helping to convert \nRussia's reactors that produce plutonium to eliminate that capability. \nUltimately, the cutoff of production of fissile materials is the tool \nby which we can help prevent the proliferation of nuclear materials \nfrom becoming an even greater problem than it is today. Conversion of \nRussia's nuclear production capability is a key part of addressing that \nproblem.\n  The Cooperative Threat Reduction program also assists the Russians in \nmeeting obligations assumed under the Chemical Weapons Convention we \nratified in the Senate two years ago. Under this program, the United \nStates has assisted Russia in planning the construction of a chemical \nweapons destruction facility needed to destroy the large volume of \naging chemical munitions in their inventory. Funds are essential to \nkeep this program moving forward in order to ensure that we can reduce \nthe threat of proliferation of chemical weapons and their use against \nour security interests. I am aware that some in the Congress believe \nthat Russia has not shouldered its responsibilities under this and \nother CTR programs, but I prefer to consider such matters from our own \nselfish security point of view. To the extent that we are able to \npurchase or finance reductions to Russian military capabilities that \ndirectly threaten us, those are funds well spent. When Russians are \nable and agree to provide funding or support in kind for CTR programs, \nso much the better.\n\n  I would like to point out an additional benefit to the Nunn-Lugar \nprograms that is not often recognized or understood. I am certain that \nthe Members of this body can recall the perceptions shared by many \nAmericans concerning the government and people of the Soviet Union \nduring the Cold War. I need not remind us of the unbridgeable gap that \nexisted between our governments, our political systems, and our \ncultures. In the wake of the Cold War, however, many of those gaps have \nbeen bridged and important bonds have been forged between our two \ncountries and citizens. Thousands of American and Russian technical and \nsupport personnel have built a foundation of trust and understanding \nthrough their cooperative efforts under the CTR program. I firmly \nbelieve that those bonds will pay dividends and serve the long-term \ninterests of peaceful relations between our two countries--particularly \nif we in the United States continue to hold the course in supporting \nCTR and other cooperative programs such as the Initiative for \nProliferation Prevention, the Nuclear Cities Initiative, and the \nRussian American Cooperative Satellite program. Key Russian personnel \nin implementing those programs have come to know Americans with whom \nthey frequently meet and vice versa. I have spoken personally with many \nRussians and Americans who are directly involved in these programs all \nof whom share the same conviction that cooperation is the key to a \npeaceful future.\n  These are very uncertain times. We are at a crucial juncture in our \nrelations with Russia that could determine\n\n[[Page S7523]]\n\nthe direction of the global political climate for many years to come. \nNo one is certain what the future of Russia will bring once President \nYeltsin leaves office. Everyone is aware that a deep reservoir of \ndistrust and fear exists among Russian citizens, officials, and \nmilitary personnel concerning the United States and NATO. We have done \nmuch in the past couple of years to feed those fears and anxieties, \nthereby generating hostility that could threaten to reawaken Cold War \ntensions. On the other hand, we have established critical relationships \nthat could weigh against such a reprise through programs such as CTR. \nThe impending post-Yeltsin debate within Russia regarding its future \ndirection must include the voice of cooperation rather than \nconfrontation as the way to peace and stability. The Cooperative Threat \nReduction program has built a constituency in Russia to articulate that \nvoice. I salute its sponsors, Senators Nunn and Lugar for their \nvisionary contribution, and celebrate its extension into the next \nmillennium. I strongly encourage my colleagues to continue to support \nCTR and related programs through the ebbs and flows of U.S.-Russian \nrelations. The prospects for long term global peace and stability will \nbe the better for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/23/senate-section/article/S7523-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE INACTION ON THE COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

A resolution adopted by the House of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relative to the \n     municipal waste; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 192\n\n       Whereas, The United States Supreme Court has issued a \n     series of decisions holding that the Commerce Clause of the \n     Constitution of the United States prohibits states from \n     restricting the importation of solid waste from other states; \n     and\n       Whereas, Over the past ten years, owners and operators of \n     solid waste landfills located in the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania have significantly increased the amount of \n     unwanted municipal waste they accept from other states; and\n       Whereas, New York City released a long-term waste \n     management plan on December 2, 1998, that allows New York \n     City to close the Fresh Kills Landfill as planned on December \n     31, 2001, and calls for the exportation of approximately \n     13,000 tons of solid waste a day now disposed of at the Fresh \n     Kills Landfill to Pennsylvania and other states; and\n       Whereas, The states of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, \n     Virginia, New Jersey and Maryland notified the Mayor of New \n     York City that the recently released plan to manage waste \n     displaced by the closure of the Fresh Kills Landfill did not \n     adequately address limiting the exportation of waste or other \n     viable waste management alternatives; and\n       Whereas, The present and projected future levels of \n     unwanted municipal waste that owners and operators of \n     landfills and incinerators located in this Commonwealth \n     import from other states pose environmental, aesthetic and \n     traffic problems and are unfair to citizens of this \n     Commonwealth, particularly citizens living in areas where \n     landfills and incinerators are located; and\n       Whereas, In 1988 the Commonwealth enacted a law designed to \n     reduce the need for additional landfills and incinerators by \n     requiring and encouraging recycling of certain materials; and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania has met its recycling goal of 25% and \n     has established a new goal of 35% by the year 2003; and\n       Whereas, It is within the power of the Congress of the \n     United States to delegate authority to the states to restrict \n     the amount of unwanted municipal waste they import from other \n     states; and\n       Whereas, Legislation has been introduced in Congress which \n     will regulate and restrict the amount of unwanted municipal \n     waste imported from other states; and\n       Whereas, Governor Thomas J. Ridge and the governors of the \n     Great Lakes States of Ohio, Michigan and Indiana wrote to \n     Congress expressing their desire to reach an accord on \n     authorizing states to place reasonable limits on the \n     importation of solid waste; and\n       Whereas, The failure of Congress to act will harm this \n     Commonwealth by allowing the continued unrestricted flow of \n     solid waste generated in other states to landfills and \n     incinerators located in this Commonwealth; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorialize the President and \n     Congress of the United States and the states to support \n     legislation authorizing states to restrict the amount of \n     solid waste being imported from other states and creating a \n     rational solid waste management strategy that is equitable \n     among the states and environmentally sound; and be if further\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorialize the President and \n     Congress of the United States to support legislation that \n     gives communities hosting landfills and incinerators the \n     right to decide by agreement whether to accept waste from \n     other states and that creates a rational municipal waste \n     management strategy that is equitable among the states and \n     environmentally sound; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the presiding officers of \n     each house of Congress and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-213.

A bill to require that health care providers inform their \npatients of certain referral fees upon the referral of the patients to \nclinical trials; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n                 clinical trials disclosure act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Clinical \nTrials Disclosure Act of 1999. As the Senate debates important health \ncare issues such as Medicare, prescription drug access, and managed \ncare reform, I want to call our attention to another important health \ncare matter: doctors and other health care providers accepting payments \nfrom drug companies and their contractors to refer patients to clinical \ntrials. Each of us understands that by providing a forum for medical \nresearch, clinical trials play a vital role in our health care system. \nUnfortunately, some providers are violating the patient-doctor \nrelationship by not informing patients of the fees they receive for \nreferrals to the clinical trials.\n  Recent media reports have highlighted this growing trend that \nthreatens the important relationship between doctor and patient. In one \ncase in California, a doctor received over $1,600 to refer a patient to \na prostate cancer drug trial despite the fact that the patient's \nprostate was healthy. Other drug companies offer bonuses to physicians \nwho refer numbers over and above a certain quota. Providers benefit in \nother ways, too. A cooperative doctor may get his or her name attached \nto an academic study authored by a ghost writer based on the drug \ncompany's data. No matter how the doctor benefits, however, he or she \nis not compelled to inform the patient of his or her relationship with \nthe drug company. This is why today I introduce the Clinical Trials \nDisclosure Act of 1999.\n  This bill simply requires that if a health care provider receives \npayments or other compensation for referring a patient to a clinical \ntrial, the provider must inform the patient both orally and in writing. \nThe measure is not intended to discourage patient participation in \nimportant medical research. Instead, it will strengthen the \nrelationship between doctor and patient and help ensure that clinical \ntrials attract patients who will benefit from their important work.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1267\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nsupport for the modernization and construction of biomedical and \nbehavioral research facilities and laboratory instrumentation; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n[[Page S7528]]\n\n             21st century research laboratories act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nTwenty-First Century Research Laboratories Act of 1999. I am joined in \nthis effort by Senators Frist, Kennedy, Chafee, Reed of Rhode Island, \nMack, Mikulski, Murray, Cleland, Helms, Warner, Sarbanes, Schumer, \nCochran, Durbin, Moynihan, Boxer, Roberts, and Reid of Nevada. I want \nto thank my colleagues for cosponsoring this legislation.\n  First though, let me say how pleased I was that we were able to \nprovide the biggest increase ever for medical research last year. The \nConference Agreement of the Fiscal 1999 Labor, Health and Human \nServices, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, \nprovided a $2 billion, or 15 percent, increase for the National \nInstitutes of Health. And this year, I and Senator Specter will \ncontinue our work to make sure that Congress stays on course to double \nfunding for the NIH over the next five years, a target that was agreed \nto by the Senate, 98 to 0, in 1997.\n  However, as Congress embarks on this important investment in improved \nhealth, we must strengthen the totality of the biomedical research \nenterprise. While it is critical to focus on high quality, cutting edge \nbasic and clinical research, we must also consider the quality of the \nlaboratories and buildings where that research is being conducted.\n  In fact, Mr. President, the infrastructure of research institutions, \nincluding the need for new physical facilities, is central to our \nnation's leadership in medical research. Despite the significant \nscientific advances produced by Federally-funded research, most of that \nresearch is currently being done in medical facilities built in the \n1950's and 1960's, a time when the Federal Government obligated from \n$30 million to $100 million a year for facility and equipment \nmodernization. Since then, however, annual appropriations for \nmodernization of our biomedical research infrastructure have \ndramatically declined, ranging from zero to $20 million annually over \nthe past decade. As a result, many of our research facilities and \nlaboratories are outdated and inadequate to meet the challenge of the \nnext millennium.\n  In order to realize major medical breakthroughs in Alzheimer's, \ndiabetes, Parkinson's, cancer and other major illnesses, our Nation's \ntop researchers must have top quality, state-of-the-art laboratories \nand equipment. Unfortunately, the status of our research infrastructure \nis woefully inadequate.\n  A recent study by the National Science Foundation finds that academic \ninstitutions have deferred, due to lack of funds, nearly $11.4 billion \nin repair, renovation, and construction projects. Almost one quarter of \nall research space requires either major renovation or replacement and \n70% of medical schools report having inadequate space in which to \nperform biomedical research.\n  A separate study by the National Science Foundation documents the \nlaboratory equipment needs of researchers and found that 67 percent of \nresearch institutions reported an increased need for laboratory \ninstruments. At the same time, the report found that spending for such \ninstruments at colleges and universities actually declined in the early \n1990's.\n  Several other prominent organizations have documented the need for \nincreased funding for research infrastructure. A March 1998 report by \nthe Association of American Medical Colleges stated that ``The \ngovernment should reestablish and fund a National Institutes of Health \nconstruction authority. . . .'' A June 1998 report by the Federation of \nAmerican Societies of Experimental Biology stated that ``Laboratories \nmust be built and equipped for the science of the 21st century . . . \nInfrastructure investments should include renovation of existing space \nas well as new construction, where appropriate.''\n  As we work to double funding for medical research over the next five \nyears, the already serious shortfall in the modernization of our \nNation's aging research facilities and labs will continue to worsen \nunless we take specific action. Future increases in NIH must be matched \nwith increased funding for repair, renovation and construction of \nresearch facilities, as well as the purchase of modern laboratory \nequipment.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today expands Federal \nfunding for facilities construction and state-of-the-art laboratory \nequipment through the NIH by increasing the authorization for this \naccount within the National Center for Research Resources to $250 \nmillion in FY 2000 and $500 million in FY 2001. In addition, the bill \nauthorizes a ``Shared Instrumentation Grant Program'' at NIH, to be \nadministered by the Center. The program will provide grants for the \npurchase of shared-use, state-of-the-art laboratory equipment costing \nover $100,000. All grants awarded under these two programs will be \npeer-reviewed, as is the practice with all NIH grants and projects.\n  We are entering a time of great promise in the field of biomedical \nresearch. We are on the verge of major breakthroughs which could end \nthe ravages of cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's and the scores of \nillnesses and conditions which take the lives and health of millions of \nAmericans. But to realize these breakthroughs, we must devote the \nnecessary resources to our Nation's research enterprise.\n  The Association of American Universities, the Association of American \nMedical Colleges and the Federation of American Societies of \nExperimental Biology have all expressed their support for this \nlegislation.\n  I hope the rest of my colleagues will soon sign on as cosponsors to \nthis important effort to improve the research capacity of this country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1269. A bill to provide that the Federal Government and States \nshall be subject to the same procedures and substantive laws that would \napply to persons on whose behalf certain civil actions may be brought, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                        litigation fairness act\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nLitigation Fairness Act of 1999. This common sense legislation says \nthat whenever the government sues private-sector companies to recover \ncosts, the government plaintiff gets no more rights than the ordinary \nplaintiff. If the law is good enough for the average citizen, then it's \ngood enough for the government.\n  This legislation to codify rules of fair play for government-\nsponsored lawsuits is necessary for three reasons:\n  First, the Litigation Fairness Act is necessary to prevent an \navalanche of lawsuits against law-abiding companies. Let me say at the \noutset: this legislation is not about tobacco. Tobacco was just the \nbeginning--the Model Act for hungry and enterprising trial lawyers.\n  After tobacco, there was speculation that the government would sue \nthe men and women who manufacture and sell guns in America. The \nspeculation was right. And now that we've got government-sponsored \nlawsuits against gun companies, the speculation turns to other legal \nindustries, such as automobile manufacturers, paint manufacturers, \nand--yes, even the fast food industry.\n  Before some of you begin to shake your head about this widespread \nspeculation, let me share some recent theories I've heard that verify \nthat the theater of the absurd continues to move ever closer to legal \nreality. As reported recently by the Associated Press, a Yale professor \nis espousing a theory that, ``There is no difference between Ronald \nMcDonald and Joe Camel.'' Both market products that are--and I quote \nthis Professor from a recent seminar--``luring our children into killer \nhabits'' ultimately increasing healthcare costs for the public--so the \ntheory goes. And I promise that I'm not making this up. This Ivy League \nprofessor was in Washington just yesterday discussing this emerging \ntheory.\n  Second, this legislation ensures basic fairness for individual \ncitizens. Under established principles of tort law, private plaintiffs \nare often barred from recovering damages based on a failure to prove \ndirect causation. For example, if a person is injured in an automobile \naccident, but cannot prove that his or her injuries were caused by a \ndefect of the\n\n[[Page S7529]]\n\nautomobile then that person cannot recover from the manufacturer. This \nlegislation simply says that if the injured party couldn't recover from \nthe auto manufacturer, then the government should not be able to sue \nthe manufacturer to recover the health care expenses incurred by the \ngovernment on behalf of the injured person.\n  In short: Government plaintiffs should not have rights superior to \nthose rights of private plaintiffs.\n  Third, the Litigation Fairness Act is necessary to prevent taxation \nthrough litigation. The power to tax is a legislative function and \nthose who raise taxes should be directly accountable to the voters. \nFortunately, it is getting more and more difficult to raise taxes in \nthe Congress and the State legislatures--so money-hungry trial lawyers \nand big-government public officials are bypassing legislatures to \nengage in taxation and regulation through litigation. The Litigation \nFairness Act will discourage lawyer-driven tax increases being dressed \nup and passed off as government lawsuits.\n  In closing, I want to point out some things that the Litigation \nFairness Act does not do: it does not prohibit government lawsuits; it \ndoes not close the courthouse door to injured parties; it does not \nplace caps on recoveries or limits on lawyer fees. Further, the \nLitigation Fairness Act cannot be construed to create or authorize any \ncause of action for any governmental entity.\n  In fact, the Litigation Fairness Act does not even prohibit the \nunholy marriage between plaintiffs' lawyers and government officials--\nalthough it admittedly makes such a marriage of money and convenience a \nbit less desirable. My legislation will simply ensure that the \ngovernment plays by the same rules as its citizens.\n  This bill has broad support. I ask unanimous consent that the Record \ninclude statements in support of the bill from the United States \nChamber of Commerce, the American Tort Reform Association, and Citizens \nfor a Sound Economy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the U.S. Chamber of Commerce News, June 23, 1999]\n\n     U.S. Chamber Endorses McConnell Bill to Stop Governments From \n                  Undermining Business Legal Defenses\n\n       Washington, D.C.--The U.S. Chamber of Commerce today \n     endorsed legislation that would stop the growing trend of \n     governments stripping legitimate industries of their legal \n     defenses and rights and then suing them to raise revenue \n     outside the constraints of the political process.\n       The ``Litigation Fairness Act,'' sponsored by Senator Mitch \n     McConnell (R-KY), would prevent governments at any level from \n     changing laws to retroactively strip businesses of their \n     traditional legal rights and defenses in order to sue them.\n       ``The U.S. Chamber is greatly concerned this dangerous \n     trend of governments changing the laws to facilitate their \n     revenue-grabbing lawsuits,'' said Chamber Executive Vice \n     President Bruce Josten. ``This practice began in the state \n     lawsuits against the tobacco industry to recover Medicaid \n     funds and, just as the Chamber predicted, has now spread to \n     other industries. President Clinton's plan to use the Justice \n     Department to sue the tobacco industry is a prime example of \n     this problem.\n       ``Unfortunately, these lawsuits are becoming all too \n     common,'' Josten added. ``If this trend continues, economic \n     and social decisions affecting all Americans will be made not \n     by the democratically elected legislatures, but instead by \n     trial lawyers.\n       ``McConnell's legislation would help curtail this abusive \n     situation,'' Josten said, noting that the legislation does \n     not affect any individual's rights or ability to sue a \n     company that has caused them harm.\n       The bill simply says that a government entity filing suite \n     to directly recover funds expended by that government on \n     behalf of a third-party (such as a Medicare or Medicaid \n     patient) would only be entitled to the same rights as an \n     individual suing that defendant. In addition, such a \n     government plaintiff would be subject to the same substantive \n     and procedural rules and defenses as any other individual \n     plaintiff. The legislation recognizes that an indirectly \n     injured party should not have any greater rights than a \n     directly injured person.\n       ``This legislation will stop the erosion of the two hundred \n     years of tort law, while fairly protecting the rights of \n     American industries from the litigious trial lawyers \n     collaborating with federal, state and local governments,'' \n     Josten concluded.\n       Josten's comments followed a day-long conference, ``The New \n     Business of Government Sponsored Litigation: State Attorneys \n     General and Big City Lawsuits,'' sponsored by the Institute \n     for Legal Reform, the Chamber's legal policy arm, The \n     Federalist Society and The Manhattan Institute. The \n     conference featured Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, Alabama Gov. \n     Don Siegelman, attorneys general from New York, Alabama, \n     Delaware and Texas, and noted plaintiff's lawyers such as \n     Richard Scruggs and John Coale.

At \n     the federal level, President Clinton announced in his 1999 \n     State of the Union address that he has directed the \n     Department of Justice to prepare a litigation plan to sue \n     tobacco companies to recover federal funds allegedly paid out \n     under Medicare.\n       Future targets of federal and/or state or local cost \n     recovery, or ``recoupment,'' litigations could include \n     producers of beer and wine and other adult beverages, and \n     manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and automobiles. \n     Even Internet providers, the gaming industry, the \n     entertainment industry, and fast food restaurants could be \n     targeted.\n\n\n                  The Changes to Black-Letter Tort Law\n\n       Under traditional tort law rules, third party payors (e.g., \n     employers, insurers, and governments) have long enjoyed \n     subrogation rights to recover costs for healthcare and other \n     expenses that they are obligated to pay on behalf of \n     individuals.\n       For example, if a worker is injured in the workplace as a \n     result of a defective machine tool, tort law permits the \n     worker's employer to recover the cost of worker compensation \n     and other medical expenses paid on behalf of the employee. \n     Through the process of subrogation, the employer can join in \n     the employee's tort claim against the manufacturer of the \n     machine tool or put a lien on the employee's recovery, but \n     the employer cannot bring a direct action on its own.\n       Governmental cost recovery actions seek to radically change \n     the traditional subrogation rule. In the State tobacco cases, \n     the attorneys general argued that the States could bring an \n     ``independent'' cause of action against the tobacco \n     companies. Furthermore, the attorneys general argued, because \n     the States' claims were ``independent'' of the claims of \n     individual smokers, the States were not subject to the \n     defenses that could be raised against individual plaintiffs, \n     especially with respect to assumption of risk.\n       Despite the current unpopularity of the tobacco companies, \n     most courts have followed basic principles of law and \n     dismissed cost recovery claims against the tobacco companies. \n     One federal district court, however, bent the rules and \n     partially sustained a healthcare reimbursement suit in Texas \n     based on a unique expansion of the ``quasi-sovereign'' \n     doctrine. Before the Texas federal court's decision, the \n     quasi-sovereign doctrine had been limited to suits for \n     injunctive relief; it did not extend to suits seeking \n     monetary damages. Even the ``pro-plaintiff'' Minnesota \n     Supreme Court recognized this fact in a tobacco case. The \n     Texas decision produced an avalanche of claims that were \n     ultimately settled out of court.\n\n\n                      The Role of Outside Counsel\n\n       Another characteristic of the new ``era of regulation \n     through litigation'' is the partnering of governmental \n     entities and private contingency fee attorneys. This new \n     partnership raises a number of serious ethical and ``good \n     government'' issues:\n       Contingent fee retainers were designed to give less-\n     affluent persons (who could generally ill-afford hourly rates \n     and up-front retainers) access to the courthouse. \n     Governmental entities have their own in-house legal staff; \n     taxpayers should not have to pay\n\n[[Page S7530]]\n\n     excessive fees for legal work that could be done by the \n     government itself.\n       In the State tobacco litigation, it seemed that many of the \n     cases were awarded to private attorneys who had been former \n     law partners or campaign supporters of the elected official. \n     Furthermore, there appears to have been a lack of competitive \n     bidding in the attorney selection process. As a result, \n     experts estimate that some plaintiffs' attorneys were paid in \n     excess of $100,000 per hour.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Professor Lester Brickman, ``Want To Be a Billionaire? \n     Sue a Tobacco Company,'' The Wall Street Journal, December \n     30, 1998.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Should the prosecutorial power of government be brought \n     against lawful, though controversial, industries? ``As the \n     Supreme Court cautioned more than 60 years ago in Berger v. \n     United States, an attorney for the state, `is the \n     representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but \n     of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as \n     compelling as its obligation to govern at all'.'' \\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ Robert A.

Liability law should be neutral. Its principles \n     should apply in the same way to all defendants. A basic \n     principle of system of justice is equal justice under law.\n       Unfortunately, legal principles developed in a few tobacco \n     cases did not apply neutral principles. They gave power to \n     state governments under a fiction called the ``quasi-\n     sovereign doctrine,'' greater power in the law than was \n     possessed by an injured individual. New cases filed by cities \n     against gun manufacturers also may create new principles of \n     law that give those cities greater rights than injured \n     persons. There is little doubt that an engine behind these \n     new principles is the unpopularity of those defendants.\n       These principles may be limited to so-called ``outlaw \n     defendants''--people who make guns, tobacco, liquor, or other \n     products that significant segments of our society do not \n     like. On the other hand, the principles may apply equally to \n     others. If that is true, those principles can apply against \n     people who make fast foods, automobiles that can go over 100 \n     mph, motorcycles, hunting knives, and even the entertainment \n     industry.\n       The Litigation Fairness Act preserves the principle that an \n     injured person's right to sue is paramount over government \n     rights, where the government has suffered some indirect \n     economic loss because of that person's harm. It restores \n     equal justice under law and neutrality within our tort \n     system.\n       For those reasons, the Americans Tort Reform Association \n     supports the Litigation Fairness Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST:\n  S. 1270.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of \nthe Education Express Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 The Education Express Act (Ed-Express)\n\n\n                               objective\n\n       Funds would reaffirm our national commitment to state and \n     local control of education. The purpose of this Act is to \n     infuse significant new dollars into the hands of parents, \n     communities, and state and local governments to improve the \n     education achievement of students. This legislation unties \n     the burdensome and expensive federal strings on education \n     dollars by sending more money straight back to the states and \n     classrooms.\n       States may elect to receive elementary and secondary \n     education funding by ``Direct Check.'' Most importantly, it \n     requires that 98 percent of the funding be used directly at \n     the local level. Incentives such as replacing existing \n     burdensome federal categorical programs are provided to \n     encourage states to choose the Direct Check. However, states \n     may choose to remain in the categorical system.\n       The legislation creates three local/state programs to \n     enhance educational excellence: Challenge Fund, Teacher \n     Quality Fund, and Academic Opportunity Fund. These programs \n     will result in a substantial increase in federal education \n     assistance--$36.5 billion over five years.\n\n\n                              how it works\n\n       Those states that opt for the ``Direct Check'' flexibility \n     will receive their educational funding upon the adoption of a \n     state plan written by the governor or the governor's designee \n     that outlines the goals and objectives for the funds--how the \n     state will improve student achievement and teacher quality, \n     and the criteria used to determine and measure achievement.\n       Decisons on how funds will be used to meet state goals and \n     objectives will be made at the local level.\n\n\n                                programs\n\n       Challenge Fund ($17 billion over five years) to improve \n     education achievement. Direct Check states will receive an \n     additional 10% of their allotment.\n       Teacher Quality Fund ($14 billion over five years) to \n     improve education achievement. Direct Check states will \n     receive an additional 10%.\n       Academic Opportunity Fund ($6 billion over 5 years) to \n     reward student achievement, implement statewide reforms, and \n     reward schools and school districts meeting state goals and \n     objectives. Only Direct Check states will be eligible to \n     receive these funds. States may receive an additional 10% of \n     their allotment if they (1) devote 25% or more of their \n     Challenge Fund allotment for Special Education; (2) \n     demonstrate improved education performance among certain \n     disadvantaged populations; or (3) adopt or show improved \n     performance on state-level National Assessment of Education \n     Progress tests (NAEP).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 1271. A bill improve the drug certification procedures under \nsection 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                 most favored rogue states act of 1999\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nhelp clarify for the administration certain aspects of drug policy that \nseem to have caused confusion. The confusion seems to lie in how to \nthink about our friends and enemies when it comes to drug policy. There \nseems to be a willingness to overlook the actions and activities of \ncertain rogue states when it comes to their involvement in drug \nproduction and trafficking.\n  The purpose of our international drug policy is to establish a \nframework for achieving results that sustain the national interest. As \npart of that, the goal is to identify countries that are major \nproducers or transit zones for drugs. It is also to determine whether \nthose countries are committed to cooperate with the United States, with \nother countries, or are taking steps on their own to stop illegal drug \nproduction and transit. This goal is clearly in the national interest.\n  Most illegal drugs used in this country are produced overseas and \nsmuggled to this country. In accomplishing this, international drug \nthugs violate our laws, international laws, and, in most cases, the \nlaws in the source and transit countries. Those drugs kill and maim \nmore Americans every year than have all international terrorists in the \nlast 10 years. In addition, they have made many of our schools, \nworkplaces, our streets and our homes unsafe and dangerous.\n  There are few threats more direct, more immediate, and more telling \nin our everyday lives than drug use and the activities of those who \npush them on our young people. We pay the costs in our hospitals, in \nour jails, and in our families. It is a devastation that we share with \nother countries. And the problem overseas is growing worse. Not only is \ndrug production up but so is use. The source and transit countries are \nnow facing growing drug use problems. Thus, in addition to attacks on \nthe underpinnings of decent government from criminal gangs, many \ncountries now face epidemic drug use among young people.\n  What other countries do or do not do to confront this threat is of \ninterest to\n\n[[Page S7531]]\n\nus. The nature of the drug trade, production as well as transit, is an \ninterconnected enterprise with international reach. Many drug \ntrafficking gangs have contacts with each other. They share markets, \nexpertise, and facilities. In some cases, they can count on the \ncomplicity of foreign governments or of significant individuals in \nthose governments. This means that a serious policy to get at the trade \nand its connections must be international, coherent, and integrated. It \ncannot be piecemeal, episodic, and disjointed. But that is what we have \ntoday.\n  Congress has over the years repeatedly pushed for an integrated, \ncoherent approach, often over the reluctance of administrations. \nDealing with the drug issue is often messy and uncomfortable. It \ndisturbs the pleasantries of diplomatic exchanges. Progress is hard to \nachieve and difficult to document. And sometimes taking drug policy \nserious upsets other plans.\n  This seems to be the case in this administration's dealings with \nseveral major drug producing or transit countries. It seems the \nadministration would rather not know what these countries are up to on \ndrugs, lest knowing make it difficult to pursue other goals. In several \nof these cases, the countries involved are not friends of the United \nStates. One, Iran, is a sworn enemy. It has used terrorism and other \ntactics to attack U.S. interests and to kill Americans. it is also a \ndrug producing and transit country.\n  For many years, the lack of cooperation or reliable information of \nIranian counter drug efforts placed them squarely on the list of \ncountries decertified by the United States. Last year, however, the \nadministration removed Iran from the list. it did so on feeble \npretexts, with limited information, and in a less than forthright \nmanner. The administration used lawyerly interpretation of statute to \ndrop Iran from the so-called Majors' List. Doing this meant the \nadministration could then duck the question of whether to certify Iran \nas cooperating on drugs or not.\n  To accomplish this little sleight of hand, the administration had to \nignore the interconnectedness of drug trafficking, congressional \nintent, and the national interest. So far as I can determine, it did \nthis in the vague hope that a unilateral gesture towards Iran on drugs \nwould see a reciprocal gesture leading to detente. It is hard to \naccount for the change otherwise. And even so it is hard to comprehend. \nNever mind Iran's continuing hostility, its past and current support of \nterrorism aimed at the U.S. and American citizens. Never mind the \nfacts. Never mind drug production and transit. Never mind the national \ninterest. This is another case of the triumph of hope over experience \nthat seems to be the lodestar of this Administration's foreign policy.\n  What makes the case even more disturbing is the apparent subterfuge \nthe administration resorted to in order to evade explaining this major \nshift in policy. I say major because Iran had been on every drug list \nsince its inception and Iran has been decertified for that whole \nhistory. I say subterfuge because of the pettifoggery the \nadministration resorted to.\n  Given the facts of Iran's past, what is reasonable to assume would be \na responsible way of dealing with the issue? It is the clear intent of \nthe law on these matters that the administration would consult with \nCongress before making a major change in policy. But what did it, in \nfact, do? Not only did the administration not consult, it nitpicked. \nThe law requires the administration to submit the Majors List by \nNovember 1. Instead of complying with this known statutory requirement, \nthe administration delayed by over a week the submission of the list, \nconveniently waiting until after Congress had adjourned. Mere \ncoincidence? Well, the administration did precisely the same stalling \nroutine the year before when Syria was similarly spirited off the list. \nWithout any prior notice to Congress. Once is accidental, twice is \nbeginning to look like a pattern.\n  Weeks after this move, the administration finally provided an \nexplanation. It deserves a full retelling to appreciate. First, some \nbasic facts. Iran has a long history of drug production, most opium. It \nis a major transit country for opium and heroin from Afghanistan and \nPakistan. Major Iranian criminal gangs have been involved in the drug \ntrade for years.\n  Since the Iranian revolution, it has been difficult for any outsiders \nto determine what, if anything, the Islamic Government is doing to stop \nthis trade. It is also important to understand that Iran was on the \nMajors List as a producing country. The law requires that any country \nthat grows more than 1,000 hectares of opium poppy be put on the list. \nIran met this qualification. The standard for classifying a transit \ncountry is not so precise and it is this imprecision that the \nadministration exploited.\n  Here, in brief, is the administration's explanation for dropping Iran \nfrom the list: Iran no longer grows more than 1,000 hectares, and the \ntransited heroin does not come to the United States, so it does not \nqualify for the list.\n  This latter rationalization is based on the administration's own \nfavored way of reading the law. In this reading, a major transit \ncountry does not qualify for the list if current intelligence \ninformation does not show a direct flow to the United States. Since the \nunderground nature and fungibility of the international drug trade is \nhard to quantify precisely, this leaves a lot of room for interpreting \nthe facts to reach a politically correct conclusion. This, of course, \nleaves aside the question of whether such an exception was ever part of \ncongressional intent or is consistent with the law or the national \ninterest. The reasoning is shaky on both policy and information. It \nalso ignores the nature of international drug trade and criminal \norganizations and what must be done to get at them. And it relies on \nhow little we know about what goes on inside Iran.\n  In reality, the administration's approach is a resort to \ntechnicalities and convenient interpretations to dodge the real issues. \nBut as we have been instructed, it all depends upon what the meaning of \n``is'' is. But let's remind ourselves that what is being done here is \nto base a weighty policy decision involving serious issues of national \nsecurity and well being on lawyerly gamesmanship. And this on the \nunanchored hope that the gesture, and that's all it is, might get a \nfriendly reaction in Iran. What did Iran actually do in response? What \nyou would expect. It thumbed its nose in our direction. But let me \nillustrate a little further the way facts have been employed.\n  Recall that Iran used to be on the Majors List for producing over \n1,000 hectares of opium. Drop below this number, in the \nadministration's reasoning, and you automatically fall off the list. In \nthis very careful parsing of meaning, I would suppose that if a country \nproduced 999 hectares, no matter what other facts applied, it wouldn't \nqualify. But is this the case in Iran? The administration's explanation \nis that they could not find opium production in Iran in 1998, ergo, \nthey do not qualify on this criteria. But this so-called objective \nassessment needs a little closer look.\n  In most cases, we base our estimates of illicit crop production on \noverhead imagery and photo interpretation. While we are pretty good at \nit, this is not a precise science, whether we're talking vegetables or \nmissiles. And it is, by the way, even more difficult when it comes to \ncounting vegetables. Good analysis is dependent of weather, adequate \noverhead coverage, information from corroborating sources, and a track \nrecord of surveying that builds up a reliable picture over time. What \nwas the case in Iran? Before the so-called objective, imagery-based \nassessment in 1998, the last overhead coverage of Iran had been in the \nearly 1990s.\n  The 1998 decision was therefore based on a one-time shot after years \nof no informaiton. Corroborating information is also scant. But the \nsituation is even more dubious.\n  Based on the past estimates, Iran cultivated nearly 4,000 hectares of \nopium in various growing regions across the country. The 1998 survey \nconcentrated in only one of those traditional growing areas. Although \nin the early 1990s it was the major one, it still only accounted for \nsome 80 percent of total cultivation. The 1998 survey could find no \nsignificant growing areas in these areas. But if we are to believe \nIranian authorities, they have specifically attacked this cultivation \nwith vigorous eradication efforts. The imagery would seem to support \nthis claim. But we also know that growers\n\n[[Page S7532]]\n\nadjust to enforcement. It is not unreasonable, therefore, to assume \nthat drug producers might shift the locus of cultivation to less \naccessible areas and resort to measures to disguise production. The \n1998 survey did not examine other areas.\n  We cannot, of course, prove a negative, but that should not lead us \nto jump to conclusions, especially when those conclusions are what we \nwant. Let me illustrate the point. If 20 percent of Iranian opium \nproduction--a number based on earlier assessments--was in areas other \nthan those checked, that figure alone gives us close to 800 hectares. \nSince those other areas--which cover an immense amount of countryside--\nwere not checked, we cannot know if there was any production for sure. \nBut, it would only require a little effort on the part of growers to \nshift a small amount of production to get us to our 1,000 hectare \nthreshold. Also remember that opium is an annual plant. In some areas \nit has more than one growing season. Thus, a region that only had 500 \nhectares of opium at any one time but had two growing seasons, would \nhave an actual total of 1,000 productive hectares per year. I do not \nknow that this was the case in Iran, but neither does the \nadministration. It doesn't know because it didn't look. It didn't look \nbecause it was not convenient.\n  I would suggest, even if you agree with the assumptions the \nadministration is making about the intent of the law, that there are \nenough uncertainties in estimating Iranian opium production to counsel \ncaution in reinterpreting the data. And even more caution in using this \nto revise policy. All the more so, given the nature of Iran's past \nactions and attitudes towards the United States. But even if you buy \nall the rationalizations leading to a decision to drop Iran from the \nMajors List, we are left with this: Is it responsible or creditable to \nmake such a major shift in policy without even the pretense of \nconsultation with Congress? Without an effort to explain the decision \nand shift to the public?\n  If there are grounds for reconsidering Iran's counter narcotics \nefforts, why was it necessary to resort to gimmicks? Is there something \nwrong with presenting the facts publicly and reaching a reasonable \nconsensus consistent with the national interest? Not to mention that in \nthis decision on Iran and the earlier one on Syria that we did not \nconsult with Israel, our most consistent ally in the region? Was it \nnecessary? Was it wise?\n  Is this the way we conduct serious counter drug policy as part of our \ninternational efforts? But this is not the only disturbing case.\n  I earlier alluded to a similar situation with regard to Syria. I will \nnot review the details of that case. Suffice it to say, they are in \nkeeping with what was done about Iran. The case I would like to look at \nmore closely is that of North Korea. Here we have another rogue state \nand enemy of the United States that seems to get favored treatment when \nit comes to drugs.\n  There is credible and mounting evidence that North Korea is a major \nproducing country of opium and processor of heroin. Stories of these \nactivities have circulated for years, including details provided by \ndefectors. Information that is further supported by the arrests of \nNorth Korean diplomats in numerous countries for drug smuggling using \nthe diplomatic pouch. Defectors have indicated that illegal opium \nproduction and heroin sales have been used to fund North Korea's \noverseas activities and its nuclear program.\n  These reports also indicate that opium cultivation in North Korea far \nexceed the 1,000 hectare level, ranging from 3,000 to 7,000 hectares \ndepending on the climate and growing conditions. In a country plagued \nby famine, precious arable land has been turned to illicit opium \nproduction by the government to fund terrorism and the development of \nnuclear weapons. Until this year, however, the administration did not \nreport on these activities. It was not until Congress required such a \nreport that we have even a hint of all of this in official reporting. \nWhen I asked the administration two years ago to supply data on opium \ncultivation in North Korea, it responded by saying they did not have \nany detailed information. Why? Because the administration was not \nlooking for it. Under pressure, it is now beginning to look. While I \nwelcome this, I am concerned that this search for information will be \nhandled in the same manner as was used in the case of Iran. Information \nwill be collected, but it will be carefully scripted and narrowly \ninterpreted.\n  I find it puzzling that we should be willing to cut such corners. \nWhat is it about nations that are declared enemies of this country and \nmany of our allies that we look the other way when it comes to drugs? \nWhat do we gain from empty gestures? And why do we make these gestures \non an issue as basic to the national interest and well being of U.S. \ncitizens as drug policy? I am at a loss to explain it. So, rather than \ntrying to guess at motives, I am offering legislation to clarify the \nsituation and to require more overt explanations. I therefore send to \nthe desk the Most Favored Rogue States Act of 1999 and ask my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting it. It addresses a serious issue \nthat needs our immediate attention.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lott, Mr. \n        Abraham, Mr. Allard, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Enzi, \n        Mr. Hagel, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 1272.

Many \nof us have relatives, or know someone, who has grappled with grave and \nterminal illnesses. Doctors, caregivers, and family members work \ntogether in such situations, not just in an effort to save a loved \none's life, but to give them the comfort and palliative care they \ndeserve. However, love and concern can often come up against a \nconfusing and complicated set of Federal and state laws which govern \nand influence care and treatment decisions in such situations.\n  Today I, along with Senators Lieberman, Lott, Abraham, Allard, \nBrownback, Coverdell, Enzi, Hagel, Helms, Inhofe, and Craig, introduce \nthe Pain Relief Promotion Act of 1999. This comprehensive legislation \nwill restore the uniform national standard of the Controlled Substances \nAct (CSA) to all 50 states. The Pain Relief Promotion Act will:\n  Affirm and support aggressive pain management as a ``legitimate \nmedical purpose'' for the use of federally-controlled substances--even \nin cases where such use may unintentionally hasten death as a side-\neffect (``principle of double effect'').\n  Encourage practitioners to dispense and distribute federally-\ncontrolled substances as medically appropriate to relieve pain and \nother distressing symptoms, by clarifying that such conduct is \nconsistent with the Controlled Substances Act.\n  Provide that a state law authorizing or permitting assisted suicide \nor euthanasia does not change the federal government's responsibility \nto prevent misuse of federally-controlled, potentially dangerous, \ndrugs. The Federal government's responsibility to prevent such misuse \nin states which have not legalized assisted suicide is already conceded \nby the Attorney General and would not change.\n  Provide education and training to law enforcement officials and \nhealth professionals on medically accepted means for alleviating pain \nand other distressing symptoms for patients with advanced chronic \ndisease or terminal illness, including the legitimate use of federally-\ncontrolled substances.\n  Establish a ``Program for Palliative Care Research and Quality'' \nwithin the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) to \ndevelop and advance scientific understanding of palliative care, and \ncollect, disseminate and make available information on pain management, \nespecially for the terminally ill health professionals and the general \npublic.\n  Authorize $5 million for a grant program within the Health Resources \nand Services Administration (HRSA) to\n\n[[Page S7533]]\n\nmake grants and contracts for the development and implementation of \nprograms to provide education and training in palliative care. It \nstates that physicians entrusted by the federal government with the \nauthority to prescribe and dispense federally-controlled substances may \nnot abuse that authority by using them for assisted suicide; however, \nit strongly affirms that it is a ``legitimate medical purpose'' to use \nthese federally-controlled substances to treat patient's pain and end-\nof-life symptoms, even in light of the unfortunate and unintended side \neffect of possibly hastening a patient's death.\n  Recognize that this policy promoting pain control does not authorize \nthe use of federally-controlled substances for intentional assistance \nin suicide or euthanasia.\n  Restore the uniform national standard that federally-controlled \nsubstances can not be used for the purpose of assisted suicide by \napplying the current law in 49 states to all 50 states. This bill does \nnot create any new regulatory authority for the DEA.\n  This is a straight-forward, very positive bill that would merely \napply what is current law in 49 states to all 50 states, without \nincreasing the federal regulatory authority of the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration (DEA). The bill has been endorsed by organizations \nincluding the National Hospice Organization, American Society of \nAnesthesiologists, American Academy of Pain Management, and former \nSurgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop. And, today I was informed that the \nHouse of Delegates of the American Medical Association voted to support \nthe bill.\n  A variety of provisions in this legislation is in direct response to \nthe June 5, 1998, letter by the Attorney General, allowing Oregon to \nuse federally-controlled substances for assisted suicide, a decision \nthat was in direct opposition to an earlier policy determination by her \nown Drug Enforcement Administration.\n  It is significant to remember that in 1984 Congress passed amendments \nto strengthen the Controlled Substances Act, due to specific concerns \nregarding the use of prescription drugs in lethal overdoses. Congress's \nview was that while the states are the first line of defense against \nmisuse of prescription drugs, the federal government must enforce its \nown objective standard as to what constitutes such misuse--and it must \nhave the authority to enforce that standard when a state cannot or will \nnot do so.\n  Again, Congress clearly spoke on the issue of assisted suicide when \nit passed the Assisted Suicide Federal Funding Restriction Act of 1997 \nby a nearly unanimous vote. Signing the bill President Clinton said it \n``will allow the Federal Government to speak with a clear voice in \nopposing these practices,'' and warned that ``to endorse assisted \nsuicide would set us on a disturbing and perhaps dangerous path.''\n  It is time for Congress to speak again.\n  Federal law is clearly intended to prevent use of these drugs for \nlethal overdoses, and contains no exception for deliberate overdoses \napproved by a physician. The DEA currently pursues cases where a \nphysician's negligent use of controlled substances has led to the death \nof a patient, it was inappropriate for the Attorney General to allow \nfor the intentional use of controlled substances to cause the death of \na patient. The Pain Relief Promotion Act will clarify federal law, to \naffirm use of controlled substances to control pain and reject their \ndeliberate use to kill patients.\n  This legislation is overdue. Already physicians have used these \nfederally controlled substances to cause the death of their patients. \nThere is no role for the Federal government in providing assisted \nsuicide.\n  I urge my colleagues to support and enact this urgently needed \nbipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters, of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1272\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pain Relief Promotion Act of \n     1999''.\n\n TITLE I--USE OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CONSISTENT WITH THE CONTROLLED \n                             SUBSTANCES ACT\n\n     SEC. 101.

Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: The National Hospice Organization has \n     recently endorsed your bill, ``The Pain Relief Promotion Act \n     of 1999.''\n       Your legislation would provide a mechanism for health care \n     professionals to collect, review and disseminate vital \n     practice protocols and effective pain management techniques \n     within the health care community and the public. In addition, \n     increased educational efforts focused within the health \n     professions community about the nature and practice of \n     palliative care are important components of your initiative.\n       Our 2,000 member hospices provide what Americans say they \n     want if they were confronted with a terminal illness--to die \n     in their home, free of pain, and with emotional support for \n     themselves and their loved ones. For over 20 years, hospices \n     have been in the forefront of managing the complex medical \n     and emotional needs of the terminally ill. It is unfortunate \n     that we continue to see individuals living and dying in \n     unnecessary pain when the clinical and medical resources \n     exist but widespread education is lacking.\n       Your legislation is a step toward a better awareness of \n     effective pain management techniques and should ultimately \n     change behavior to better serve the needs of terminally ill \n     patients and their families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Karen A. Davie,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  American Academy\n\n\n                                           of Pain Management,\n\n                                        Sonora, CA, June 15, 1999.\n     Senator Donald Nickles,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: The American Academy of Pain \n     Management, America's largest multidisciplinary pain \n     organization, applauds your efforts to end the pain and \n     suffering for Americans. The Board of Directors of the \n     American Academy of Pain Management supports The Pain Relief \n     Promotion Act of 1999. We share your belief that opioid \n     analgesics should be available for those unfortunately \n     suffering from the pain associated with terminal illnesses. \n     The alternatives to assisted suicide and euthanasia are \n     compassionate and appropriate methods for prescribers to \n     relieve pain without fear of regulatory discipline.\n       The Pain Relief Promotion Act of 1999 provides for law \n     enforcement education, the development and dissemination of \n     practice guidelines, increased funding for palliative care \n     research, and safeguards for unlawful prescribers of \n     controlled substances. This bill appropriately reflects the \n     changing philosophy about pain control as a significant \n     priority in the care of those facing terminal illnesses.\n       The American Academy of Pain Management thanks you for your \n     effort to improve the quality of life for Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Richard S. Weiner, Ph.D.,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  American Society\n\n\n                                         of Anesthesiologists,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 16, 1999.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Assistant Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: In my capacity as President of the \n     American Society of Anesthesiologists, a national medical \n     association comprised of 34,000 physicians and other \n     scientists engaged or especially interested in the practice \n     of anesthesiology, I am pleased to offer our endorsement of \n     the Pain Relief Promotion Act of 1999, which I understand you \n     will introduce this week.\n       Many ASA members engage in a pain management practice, and \n     such a practice regularly includes the treatment of \n     intractable pain, experienced by terminally or severely ill \n     patients, through the prescription of controlled substances. \n     As you are aware, a major concern among these practitioners \n     has involved the possible that aggressive treatment of \n     intractable pain involving increased risk of death--however \n     medically necessary to provide the patient with the best \n     possible quality of life--could be the subject of criminal \n     prosecution as involving alleged intent to cause death.\n       ASA's House of Delegates has formally expressed the \n     Society's opposition to physician assisted suicide as \n     incompatible with the role of the physician. At the same \n     time, the Society believes anesthesiologists ``should always \n     strive to relieve suffering, address the psychological and \n     spiritual needs of patients at the end of life, add value to \n     a patient's remaining life and allow patients to die with \n     dignity''.\n       We find your bill to be fully consistent with these \n     principles, in that (1) it denies support in federal law for \n     intentional use of a controlled substance for the purpose of \n     causing death or assisting another person in causing death, \n     but (2) it includes in federal law recognition that \n     alleviating pain in the usual course of professional practice \n     is a legitimate medical purpose for dispensing a controlled \n     substance that is consistent with public health and safety, \n     even if the use of such a substance may increase the risk of \n     death.\n       ASA believes that the bill articulates an appropriate \n     standard for distinguishing between assisted suicide and \n     medically-appropriate aggressive treatment of severe pain. \n     Although we have some continuing concern whether law \n     enforcement officers will regularly recognize and honor this \n     critical distinction, we believe much can be accomplished \n     through the education and training programs contemplated by \n     section 102 of the bill. We look forward to the opportunity, \n     during congressional consideration of the bill, to work with \n     you and your staff to strengthen this provision to assure \n     that the these programs include input from medical \n     practitioners regularly engaged in a pain management \n     practice.\n       If we can be of further assistance, please ask your staff \n     to contact Michael Scott in our Washington office, at the \n     address and telephone number listed above.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         John B. Neeld, Jr., M.D.,\n     President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url":

Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity to \ncongratulate Payne Stewart for his recent victory at this year's U.S. \nOpen. Payne captured the championship with a dramatic 15-foot putt on \nthe 72nd hole, the final hole of the tournament. Originally from \nSpringfield, Missouri, Payne has continually brought an air of class \nand dignity to the game of golf that is a true inspiration to all \nAmericans, myself included. In fact, his recent performance has \ninspired me to hit the greens again.\n  For his triumph in the tournament, Stewart drew strength from the \nmemory of his late father, William Stewart, a two-time Missouri State \nAmateur Champion. On June 20, the final day of the U.S. Open and also \nFather's Day, NBC ran a special on the relationship between Payne and \nWilliam Stewart. Taking the time to watch the special, Payne was moved \nto tears. This time of reflection may have provided the inspiration \nneeded to make the difference in the tournament. I, too, had a father \nwho was a major influence on my life. I, too, find strength and \nguidance in the moments I take to remember.\n  Payne Stewart is a credit to the game of golf and an example for all \nMissourians of what dedication and perseverance bring forth. With his \nsecond U.S. Open championship, he has shown the entire world that with \nenough determination and faith--coupled with a crucial putting tip from \nhis wife--dreams really do come true. Again, I offer an enthusiastic \ncongratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/23/senate-section/article/S7538-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7538-S7539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATIONS TO THE BUFFALO SABRES, NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE EASTERN \n                           CONFERENCE CHAMPS\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to \nthe growing chorus of people congratulating the Buffalo Sabres for \ntheir outstanding performance in the Stanley Cup Finals. Led by team \ncaptain Michael Peca, and their indefatigable goalie, Dominik Hasek, \nthe entire team accomplished what was thought by many to be the \nimpossible. Their heartfelt play brought a level of excitement to the \nStanley Cup finals not seen in years. I am proud to stand with the City \nof Buffalo and Western New York to honor our team.\n  Considered underdogs in all of their playoff series, the Sabres \nplayed with pure heart and soul to sweep the Ottawa Senators in the \nfirst round, defeated the Boston Bruins and then the Toronto Maple \nLeafs to win the Eastern Conference and the Prince of Wales Trophy for \nthe first time in 24 years. The triple overtime loss in Game 6 of the \nStanley Cup finals showed the hockey community what a team with \ndetermination and true grit is. The controversial goal that ended the \ndreams of the Sabres will not dampen the spirits of the most devoted \nfans in the world--Buffalo Sabres fans.\n  As the Stanley Cup Finals end, I extend my deep appreciation to the \nKnox Family for bringing the Sabres to Buffalo 29 years ago, John J. \nRigas, owner and Chairman of the Board, Darcy Regier, General Manager, \nLindy Ruff, Head Coach, and the entire Buffalo Sabres team, their \ncoaching staff, their families and their fans for their great\n\n[[Page S7539]]\n\nefforts and support. I know next season will bring even more to \ncelebrate.\n  In this spirit, I ask that an article from The Buffalo News, be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                 [From the Buffalo News, June 23, 1999]\n\n         Rally for Sabres Proves Buffalo Has Something Special\n\n       It was noon Tuesday and they streamed into Niagara Square \n     from all directions. White-haired men and middle-aged ladies \n     and mothers pushing strollers made the pilgrimage down \n     Niagara Street, Franklin Street, Delaware Avenue.\n       They came, in all colors and sizes. Shirt-and-tie \n     businessmen, smooth-skinned teens wearing black-and-red \n     jerseys with Hasek or Peca stitched across the back, little \n     kids holding their mother's hand. They came in cares, on \n     bikes, on Rollerblades. They all came downtown, washed in the \n     summer sun, because this is Buffalo and sometimes you win \n     even when you lose.\n       They crowded in front of City Hall, more than 20,000 of \n     them. Men in business suits climbed atop the marble railings \n     of the McKinley Monument. Dozens stood on the roofs of the \n     Federal Court Building and the Buffalo Athletic Center and \n     the Turner Parking Ramp.\n       They do not have rallies for teams that lose in most \n     cities.\n       Most cities are not Buffalo.\n       A lot of people around the country would read that and say \n     ``Thank God.''\n       I ran into one of them on a plane to Dallas a couple of \n     weeks ago. She said she was going home and asked where I was \n     from. When I told her, she said, ``Why would anybody want to \n     live there?''\n       Lady, this is why.\n       Yes, there are things wrong with this place and I don't \n     just mean high taxes. A streak of negativity runs through \n     some folks. Our so-called leaders habitually put self-\n     interest ahead of our interest. We get told we're the pits so \n     often we sometimes forget this is a truly nice place to live.\n       But there's a sense of community here, a shared bond, you \n     don't find in most other places, at least not most other \n     places I've been. It's a hard thing to prove, but then a day \n     like Tuesday comes and there it is, 20,000 people for all the \n     world to see.\n       They didn't come to this rally for a hockey team that lost \n     in the Stanley Cup finals because Buffalo loves a loser or \n     likes to cry in its Genesee Cream Ale.\n       They came because this team carried the city's name on its \n     jerseys the way we want it to be carried.\n       They came not to lament what might have been, but to \n     celebrate what was.\n       The hockey team was a lot like the town, overlooked and \n     underappreciated. Yet they left team after supposedly better \n     team dazed and bleeding by the side of the road. They finally \n     got beat--with the help of officials too gutless to enforce \n     the rules--by a tough, character-laden Dallas team many \n     expected would swat them aside like a bothersome fly. \n     Instead, the Sabres took them to their limit, made them sweat \n     and ache and pay for every pass and shot and goal they got--\n     and even one they didn't.\n       At the end, after absorbing a mind-boggling 82 hits in the \n     final game, the Dallas trainer compare their locker room to a \n     M.A.S.H. unit. Some Dallas players took intravenous fluids \n     between the overtime periods of the 5\\1/2\\-hour game; a half-\n     dozen ended the series with torn ligaments or other damage.\n       You lay a team out like that and end up losing--losing on a \n     tainted goal--and it doesn't mean you're losers. It means \n     time ran out, fate didn't smile, the story is To Be Continued \n     next season. If these guys had any doubt about that, 20,000 \n     people Tuesday told them otherwise.\n       They didn't abandon a team that tried mightily and never \n     backed down and came up an illegally placed skate short. Just \n     like you don't stop loving your kid or your brother or best \n     friend. That's not the way it works around here.\n       Diana and Nicole Jarosz, 21 and 18, came down 90 minutes \n     early so they could be close to the stage. They have lived in \n     Buffalo all their lives and they could not imagine not coming \n     to this.\n       ``We're here to say we still love you and we're still proud \n     of you,'' said Diana. ``As hard as (Saturday night) was for \n     us, I can't imagine how hard it must have been sitting on the \n     (players') bench.''\n       We don't want to pick on Dallas, but it's a town of \n     shameless front-runners. Some folks were interviewed in \n     downtown Dallas a couple of weeks ago, before this series \n     started. One of them said, ``If this team starts losing, \n     people will drop them like a hot poker.''\n       Well, this Buffalo team lost early Sunday morning, and most \n     folks just held them closer.\n       The Stars won the Cup, and all of 150 people showed up to \n     meet their plane at the airport. Buffalo lost it, and 20,000 \n     came out to say, ``Thanks for the ride.''\n       The players seemed genuinely touched by it all, at times \n     nudging each other and grinning when the crowd went nuts, or \n     waving to the kids in Sabres jerseys sitting on their dads' \n     shoulders.\n       ``We really didn't expect that kind of excitement,'' said \n     team captain Michael Peca afterwards. ``This is not a city \n     that forgets (about) you, absolutely not.''\n       Dallas has a pewter Cup. We have something they'll never \n     have. Something not about towering glass skyscrapers and \n     money and jobs. It's a spirit, a feeling, a connection you \n     don't get in big cities.\n       It's something so many of those who move away from here, \n     usually in search of greener job pastures, never find again. \n     They go somewhere else, start a new life, but a piece of them \n     stays.\n       You can leave Buffalo, but you can never leave it behind.\n       Tuesday, we showed the world why.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/23/senate-section/article/S7539-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7539-S7540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO REVEREND HUBERT DONALD COCKERHAM\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe Rev. H. Donald Cockerham for 30 years of dedicated service to the \nmembers of Zion Missionary Baptist Church in Louisville. His devoted \ncongregation recently honored him by writing and performing a play \nabout his life, and I am proud to join in their celebration of this \nmilestone anniversary for both Rev. Cockerham and the church body.\n  Rev. Cockerham, born in McComb, Mississippi, first came to Louisville \nin 1969, to preach at a foreign missions rally. At that time, he was \nthe minister at Calvary Baptist Church in Chicago, but after filling-in \nas speaker at Zion one Sunday, Zion began to pursue Cockerham as a \ncandidate for pastor. Although he was serving another church, he said \nhe felt called to accept the invitation to lead Zion's congregation.\n  By all accounts, Zion flourished under Rev. Cockerham's leadership. \nDuring his 30 years as pastor, the church building changed \nsignificantly, with the construction of a new wing. Also, the addition \nof a new organ and piano have surely been a blessing to the church \nchoir when they perform their well-known presentation of the \n``Messiah'' each Christmas. During Rev. Cockerham's time as pastor, \nZion has also significantly increased opportunities for youth through \nadditional ministry programs.\n  Rev. Cockerham was not only deeply involved in his church, but was \nalso an integral part of the community. Over the years, he has been \ninvolved in the WHAS Crusade for Children, a project which raises funds \nto help with the care and treatment of handicapped children in Kentucky \nand southern Indiana. Reverend Cockerham has won numerous awards and \ndistinctions during the past 30 years, and was recognized most recently \nby the Louisville YMCA as a 1999 Adult Black Achiever.\n  I am certain that the legacy of commitment to faith that Rev. \nCockerham has left will continue on, and will encourage and inspire \nthose who follow. Reverend, best wishes for many more years of service, \nand know that your efforts to better Zion Missionary Baptist Church and \nthe Louisville community will be felt for years to come. On behalf of \nmyself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, thank you for \ngiving so much of yourself for so many others.\n  Mr. President, I also ask that an article which ran in Louisville's \nCourier-Journal on June 12, 1999, be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From The Courier-Journal, June 12, 1999]\n\n       Faith in Action--Church Honors Pastor's 30 Years With Play\n\n       At Zion Missionary Baptist Church, members are busy showing \n     their pastor how much they appreciate his hard work and \n     dedication.\n       The Rev. H. Donald Cockerham will celebrate 30 years as \n     pastor of the church tomorrow, and the congregation wants \n     this to be a celebration Cockerham will never forget.\n       ``It is rare for a pastor to have remained at a church for \n     30 years, so I wanted to know how I could make this \n     anniversary more special,'' said Beverly Jones, anniversary \n     chairwoman.\n       When Troy Bell, co-chairman of the anniversary committee, \n     suggested that they write a play as a tribute to Cockerham, \n     she couldn't resist.\n       Bell, who has a background in musical theater, wrote, \n     directed and starred in the play, which is based on the \n     Broadway musical ``Purlie Victorious.''\n       ``I changed the title to `Hubert Victorious' because it is \n     our pastor's first name, and I rewrote this play to correlate \n     with the pastor's life,'' Bell said. ``This adaptation was a \n     combination of fiction and non-fiction.''\n       For a month, Bell and others worked to make the play a \n     success.\n       ``I contacted actors and actresses . . . and we went to the \n     DAV to find clothes and wigs reminiscent of the 1960s,'' Bell \n     said.\n       They performed the play Monday night at Derby Dinner \n     Playhouse.\n       Cockerham cried and then he laughed and then he cried \n     again, Bell said.\n       ``It was a hilarious play,'' Cockerham said. ``Although I \n     had known about the play for\n\n[[Page S7540]]\n\n     weeks, I did not know that it would be about me. I was \n     surprised.''\n       Sheivel Johnson, publicity and program director for the \n     church, said faith explains why Cockerham is still pastor \n     after 30 years.\n       Cockerham said the congregation's love and compassion for \n     the community makes his job more pleasurable.\n       ``A love affair between the people and myself began, \n     almost,'' when he came to Zion, he said.\n       The 68-year-old pastor, a native of McComb, Miss., was \n     pastor of Calvary Baptist Church in Chicago when he was asked \n     to join Zion in 1969.\n       ``I came to Louisville to preach at a foreign-mission \n     rally. At the time, Zion did not have a pastor,'' he said. \n     ``Their candidate could not speak at their service because he \n     became ill. When the pulpit committee discovered that I was \n     in town, they asked me to speak and I accepted.''\n       Impressed by his sermon, the church body asked him to \n     become their pastor, but he declined initially.\n       ``I did not want to change churches because I was their \n     (Calvary's) first full-time pastor. I had dedicated myself to \n     building that congregation.''\n       But shortly afterward, Cockerham changed his mind, \n     believing that coming to Zion was his fate. ``It occurred to \n     me that Zion did not have to ask me to be their pastor simply \n     because they needed one. I believed that the Lord was moving \n     me in a different direction.''\n       In 1969, Cockerham received a unanimous vote by Zion's \n     governing body.\n       Under Cockerham's leadership, the church has greatly \n     expanded youth activities and made improvements to the \n     building including a new annex and a new organ and piano.\n       Over the years, he has received many awards, including \n     being named an Adult Black Achiever this year by the YMCA.\n       For Bell, Cockerham's many accomplishments and recognition \n     come as no surprise.\n       ``If there was ever a pastor that was loved unconditionally \n     by his church family, it is him,'' he said. ``He is the \n     father to the fatherless.''\n       Zion Missionary Baptist has been celebrating Cockerham's \n     anniversary with services all week. The grand finale will \n     begin at 11 a.m. tomorrow, with dinner served after morning \n     worship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/23/senate-section/article/S7540-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SANTA CLARA COUNTY HOUSING TRUST FUND\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of a remarkable public/private partnership in \nCalifornia's Silicon Valley that is moving aggressively to address a \nproblem which plagues many communities: the shortage of available and \naffordable housing.\n  In Silicon Valley, the fast-growing home to some of the Nation's most \ndynamic and innovative high technology firms, housing costs have risen \nas dramatically as the supply of available housing has diminished. \nSince 1992, Santa Clara County has created some 250,000 new jobs; \nhowever, only 50,000 new homes and apartments have been constructed. \nThis combination of rapid growth and scarce housing has created a \nvolatile situation in which renters and potential home buyers alike \nmust compete mercilessly for the few units that are to be found. To \naddress this challenge, a coalition of concerned businesses, nonprofit \ngroups and local governments formed the Santa Clara County Housing \nTrust Fund.\n  The Santa Clara County Housing Trust Fund is a broad-based working \ngroup consisting of the Community Foundation of Silicon Valley, the \nSilicon Valley Manufacturing Group, the Santa Clara County \nCollaborative on Housing and Homelessness, the Santa Clara County Board \nof Supervisors, the Housing Action Coalition and the Housing Leadership \nCouncil. Through donations from nonprofit organizations, commitments \nfrom local governments and financial backing from the business \ncommunity, the trust fund hopes to raise $20 million. With this money, \nthe trust fund plans to house more than 1,000 homeless individuals and \nfamilies, assist in building up to 3,000 new apartments and help nearly \n800 first-time home buyers.\n  I pay special tribute to five companies that recently pledged a \nremarkable $1 million to the trust fund, hopefully paving the way for \nother Silicon Valley businesses to follow suit. On June 10, Adobe \nSystems, Applied Materials, Cisco Systems, Kaufman & Broad, and the \nSolectron Corporation each stepped up to the plate with contributions \nsure to improve the quality of life in their communities. This is \nresponsible corporate citizenship at its best. I hope that these five \ncompanies represent only the first wave of firms that will rise to the \nchallenge of tackling the housing problems in Silicon Valley.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/23/senate-section/article/S7540-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO CELEBRATE NEW HAMPSHIRE CULTURE\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor Celebrate New Hampshire Culture, a nonprofit organization formed \nby the New Hampshire Commission on the Smithsonian Folklife Festival \nthat works in partnership with the New Hampshire State Council on the \nArts and the Department of Cultural Resources.\n  I commend the many dedicated volunteers and participants from my \nState for their hard work in planning, organizing, and demonstrating \nour New Hampshire culture through the exhibits for this year's \nSmithsonian Folklife Festival.\n  Since being elected to Congress 15 years ago, I have had the pleasure \nof sharing with my fellow Members of Congress why I believe New \nHampshire is such a special place in which to live. I am extremely \nproud that they, and countless others, will now have the opportunity to \nexperience firsthand all the wonderful things New Hampshire has to \noffer.\n  In 1994, Mervin Stevens of Walpole began working towards New \nHampshire's participation after attending the festival over the years. \nCurators Lynn Martin and Betty Beland have made Mervin's dream a \nreality. These two women, along with many volunteers, have worked \ntirelessly for months to make sure that the more than 1 million \nvisitors to the Folklife Festival on the Mall this week will have a \nmeaningful and memorable experience.\n  New Hampshire's diversity, vibrancy, and entrepreneurship will be \nportrayed through several themes: Music of New Hampshire; Town and \nCommunity; Ingenuity and Enterprise; Seasons of Work and Recreation; \nand Farm, Forests, Mountains, and Sea. The themes and displays will be \nenhanced through several hands-on examples of living traditions. These \nexhibits include a 35-foot-long by 15-foot-high covered bridge, a \ntimber-framed barn, a wrought-iron archway, and granite walls.\n  There will also be two music stages set up. One will be a replica of \na town hall and the other of a New England front porch with rocking \nchairs and benches. These fascinating displays of New Hampshire culture \nwill be celebrated in three ways: First, at this summer's Smithsonian \nfestival. Next, a reenactment will take place next summer during \nFestival New Hampshire at the Hopkinton State Fairgrounds in \nContoocook. Finally, an educational program for schools and communities \nwill be based on the extensive research of culture needed to launch the \nfestival.\n  Mr. President, I wish to offer my most sincere congratulations to \nCelebrate New Hampshire Culture and the countless volunteers. Their \nhard work and dedication will now help show the world what makes New \nHampshire the greatest State in America. It is an honor to represent \nCelebrate New Hampshire Culture and all the people of New Hampshire in \nthe Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/23/senate-section/article/S7540-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7540-S7541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING DOUG AURAND\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \nlongtime friend, Douglas R. Aurand of Rockford, IL. Doug has served as \nWinnebago County Treasurer for 28 years and Rockford Township Trustee \nfor 2 years. He retired earlier this month as treasurer.\n  Doug has been an Illinois resident his entire life, born in Dixon and \nraised in Pecatonica. He married the former Julie Moore and they have \ntwo children, David and Christine. Retirement will give Doug more time \nto spend with his grandchildren, Billy and Tommy Schwengels.\n  After graduating from Pecatonica High School, Doug served in the U.S. \nAir Force for four years. He was first elected to public office as \nWinnebago County Treasurer in 1970, at the age of 29. He held his \noffice for six consecutive terms, becoming the longest serving elected \nofficial in the same office in northern Illinois.\n  Doug has worked tirelessly for more than 28 years as a public servant \nand for the taxpayers of Winnebago County. During this time, he has \nreduced his staff by 60 percent.\n\n[[Page S7541]]\n\n  Responsible for funds exceeding $387 million year, he has earned over \n$44 million in interest for taxpayers in Winnebago County through his \nwise investments. He is responsible for the administration and \ncollection of 110,000 tax bills which bring in approximately $285 \nmillion for the 72 taxing districts in his county.\n  In short, Doug Aurand has given remarkable service as Winnebago \nCounty Treasurer, and I commend him for his achievements. His \nleadership and fiscal management skills have made a difference in \nWinnebago County and he will most certainly be missed.\n  I congratulate Doug Aurand and, once again, commend him for the last \nimpact he will leave on Rockford, Winnebago County, and the State of \nIllinois.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my hope \nfor the speedy recovery of someone who gave so many Illinoisans, \nincluding me, joy throughout his great career. Ron Santo, former third \nbaseman for the Chicago Cubs and the Chicago White Sox, suffered a \nheart attack Monday in Denver, and I wanted to take a moment to \nrecognize him and express my hopes for a speedy recovery.\n  Ron Santo played fourteen seasons for the Chicago Cubs from 1960 to \n1973 and one for the Chicago White Sox in 1974, during which time he \nappeared in nine All-Star Games and won five Gold Glove Awards at the \n``hot corner.'' He was also a member of the 1969 Chicago Cubs team \nwhich lost its chance at the playoffs because of the famous, or to \nIllinoisans, infamous, run of the ``Miracle'' Mets. When I was a boy, I \nwas lucky enough to have Santo autograph a Cubs' game program for me, \nwhich I still have.\n  His career statistics measure up well against those of anyone to ever \nplay the game. He finished his illustrious career with 2254 hits, 342 \nof which were home runs, 1331 Runs Batted In, and a .277 career batting \naverage. In 1964, Santo even led the league in triples with 13. He \nranks in the top 10 among players for the Chicago Cubs in games played, \nat bats, runs scored, hits, doubles, runs batted in, and extra-base \nhits.\n  Now that his playing days are over, Santo continues to make a \ncontribution to the Cubs and to Chicago as a broadcaster, and one of \nthe best and most energetic in the game at that. Mr. President, I would \nlike to call on the Senate to join me in wishing Mr. Santo, his wife \nVicki, and his four children the very best and expressing the sincere \nhope that he gets well soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/23/senate-section/article/S7541-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SISTER MARY REILLY\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Sister Mary \nReilly, an important figure in social progress and education in Rhode \nIsland for the past fifty years.\n  Since joining the Sisters of Mercy in 1948, Sister Mary Reilly's \nmission has always focused on helping individuals of modest means meet \ntheir basic needs and improve themselves through education. Whether in \nthe heart of Providence, or in the classrooms of Honduras and Belize, \nor in her forthcoming work in New York City, these are the constants of \nSister Mary Reilly's career ministry.\n  To be sure there have been many changes for Sister Mary Reilly. \nIndeed, she recently told the Providence Journal that her life has been \nfilled with beginnings.\n  Born in Providence, she began her career with the Sisters of Mercy as \na teacher there, first at St. Mary School and then at St. Mary Academy \nat Bay View. Later, she was able to fulfill one of her goals by \nbecoming a missionary and teaching in Central America.\n  Returning to Rhode Island in 1970, Sister Mary Reilly began \nestablishing the groundwork for institutions that have become a \nsignificant part of Rhode Island's landscape for social improvement. \nShe was among the founders of McAuley House, a soup kitchen serving the \nhomeless in Providence; the Good Friday Walk for Hunger and \nHomelessness; the COZ (Child Opportunity Zone), an innovative community \neffort to link schools with critical social service agencies and non-\nprofit organizations; and the Annual Walk for Literacy. Sister Mary \nReilly was also among those who began the Washington lobby, NETWORK.\n  However, the endeavor to which Sister Mary Reilly is most closely \nlinked is Dorcas Place, which she helped found nearly 20 years ago with \nher colleague Deborah Thompson. Dorcas Place began as a literacy center \nfor low-income young women. As Sister Mary Reilly and other leaders at \nDorcas Place saw the need to address a greater array of issues in the \ncommunity, the center grew to include women and men and took on a host \nof issues including literacy, employment and training, parenting, and \nadvocacy. It has reached out to other organizations from Salve Regina \nUniversity, with which Dorcas recently joined to create a certificate \nprogram for low-income and welfare dependent individuals, to Fleet \nBank, to Rhode Island Legal Services, to the Rhode Island Department of \nHealth, and many others. From a small corps of volunteers at first, \nDorcas Place has grown to include 65 volunteer tutors and nearly 50 \nmentors. While all of this is the result of a team effort, Sister Mary \nReilly certainly deserves the lion's share of the credit. She has \nindeed been the inspiration behind this wonderful organization.\n  Given Sister Mary Reilly's role in influencing the climate of social \nprogress in Rhode Island, it was with great sadness that many Rhode \nIslanders learned of her decision to resign her post as Executive \nDirector of Dorcas Place. She leaves to embark on a year's sabbatical \nin New York to work with other Sisters of Mercy who are following-up on \nthe historic 1995 United Nations' Beijing Women's Conference.\n  For Sister Mary Reilly, it is another beginning, and we know that she \nwill not be far from Rhode Island or from Dorcas Place. Her legacy of \ngood will and service to others will foster the continuation the work \nimportant work at Dorcas Place, and I join all of her colleagues in \nwishing her well in her newest adventure. We all hope to see her in \nRhode Island again before long.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/23/senate-section/article/S7541-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7541-S7542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Foreign \nRelations Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Con. \nRes. 39, and that the Senate then proceed to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 39) expressing the \n     sense of the Congress regarding the treatment of religious \n     minorities in the Islamic Republic of Iran, and particularly \n     the recent arrests of members of that country's Jewish \n     community.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I offer this resolution on behalf of Mr. \nBrownback of Kansas, Mr. Lieberman of Connecticut, and many other \ncosponsors.\n  Last March, 13 Iranian Jews from the southern cities of Shiraz and \nEsfahan were arrested on preposterous charges of spying for Israel and \nthe United States. These men have not been allowed visits by family or \nlegal counsel, nor has any evidence been produced to warrant their \narrest and imprisonment. For more than 2 months, leaders of the \nAmerican Jewish community and the U.S. Government officials have worked \nbehind the scenes for the release of these men.\n  Iran has done this sort of thing many times before, and they are \nusually just seeking some ransom money. Unfortunately, this situation \nis different. Iran went public with this issue first, meaning something \nfar more nefarious is at work.\n  It is clear that these 13 people are being used as unfortunate pawns \nbetween two warring political factions in Iran: moderate followers of \nPresident Mohammad Khatami and hardline ayatollahs who remain \nentrenched in high positions of power and seek to undermine Khatami's \ndomestic reforms and overtures to the West. These men may very well be \nhanged without a trial under preposterous and trumped-up charges. We \nmust not let that happen. Indeed, we must do all we can to secure their \nrelease.\n  We have a resolution before the Senate condemning in the strongest \npossible terms the arrest of these men and calling for their immediate \nrelease. I thank all my colleagues for supporting this resolution which \ndenounces the worst form of religious intolerance.\n  The notion that Iranian Jews, particularly those living hundreds of \nmiles from Teheran, even have the capacity to spy for Israel or the \nUnited States is laughable. What access would these individuals have to \nany valuable information whatsoever?\n  The truth is that since 1979, Iran has habitually utilized the term \n``spy'' for anyone it arrests for political reason. Schoolgirls and \nblind old men have been hanged as ``spies'' simply because they were \nreligious minorities.\n  Some say we should not come down too hard on Iran on this issue, lest \nwe play into the hands of the hardline ayatollahs and set back \nKhatami's reform movement. I say that is out of the question. We are \nnot going to sacrifice innocent lives to help one side in a political \nbattle of wills.\n  Khatami has the power to stand up to the hardliners on behalf of \nthese 13 pawns and for all of Iran's 30,000-member Jewish community, as \nwell as other religious minorities. He won the Presidency with a 70-\npercent landslide vote, and moderate candidates continue to score big \nvictories in local elections. He can choose the political battles he \nwishes to fight, and this resolution before us today makes it perfectly \nclear that this needs to be one of those battles.\n\n  In fact, any talk of a kinder, gentler Iran under the supposedly \nmoderate President Khatami is simply empty rhetoric as long as Jews and \nother religious minorities are victims of the most vicious forms of \nreligious intolerance.\n  The Koran in Islam treats justice like all the great religions, as \nsomething at the highest pinnacle of human values. If Khatami cannot \ndeliver on this issue, then what is his reform movement about in the \nfirst place? And if Iran seeks to do this in the name of Islamic \nfundamentalism, what about the teachings of the Koran in terms of \njustice and fairness?\n  The administration has spoken out strongly on this issue, but they \nhave to make this a top priority. President Clinton and Secretary of \nState Albright should immediately press influential regional states--\nSyria, Saudi Arabia, Russia--to help secure the release of the 13.\n  Iran must know from the United States, and the world, that should \nthese men be executed, as 17 other Jews have been since 1979, Iran will \nslip back into pariah status for decades.

Amendment No. 735\n\n     (Purpose: To provide for controlled public access to off-site \n                   consequence analysis information)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I understand that Senator Chafee has an \namendment at the desk, and I ask for the consideration of that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for Mr. Chafee, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 735 to the reported committee \n     amendment.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the managers' \namendment to S. 880, the Fuels Regulatory Relief Act. S. 880 was voted \nout of the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee on May 11. \nThe risk management program, RMP, created by Section 112(r) of the \nClean Air Act, was designed to focus companies and emergency response \npersonnel on reducing the change of an accidental chemical release and \non improving the response to releases when they happen. The RMP was \npartly a reaction to the Bhopal, India chemical disaster and is part\n\n[[Page S7545]]\n\nof a larger set of programs designed to reduce the likelihood of future \naccidental releases. In its regulation, EPA included propane and some \nother fuels in the program. This was seen as a problem because the RMP \nwas not intended to address traditional fuel use. Senator Inhofe \nintroduced S. 880 to relieve propane users from participation in the \nRMP.\n  During markup of S. 880, the Environment and Public Works Committee \nadopted an administration proposal to address public access to a part \nof a facility's risk management plan, known as off-site consequence \nanalysis. The EPA had intended to release this information on its \nwebsite, until the FBI raised concerns that posting this information on \nthe Internet would provide an attractive targeting tool for terrorists \nand criminals. The administration's proposal, which the managers' \namendment would modify, attempted to balance the benefits of public \naccess to this information with the legitimate safety concerns raised \nby its public availability.\n  At the May 11 business meeting, members of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee raised some concerns about the administration's \nproposal. We had received the proposal little more than a day before \nthe markup. Since then, committee staff from both sides of the aisle \nhave worked diligently to resolve the difference and crafted a \ncompromise that I believe improves upon the administration proposal. \nThis amendment ensures that state and local emergency response \nofficials have immediate and full access to this information. A greater \nmeasure of public access will be established within one year through a \npublic notice and comment rulemaking.\n  There are two important differences between this amendment and the \nadministration's proposal that the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee adopted. First, this amendment requires a rulemaking process, \nwith public notice and comment, in the final determination of the \nextent of public access. Second, the exemption from FOIA is only \ntemporary, rather than the permanent exemption proposed by the \nadministration. In this amendment, the FOIA exemption is waived unless \nthe rule is finalized within one year. The entire provision, including \nthe FOIA exemption, expires after six years. If it is appropriate at \nthat time, Congress could reauthorize the FOIA exemption.\n  Both the managers' amendment and the administration language attempt \nto address the safety concerns raised by the availability of a national \ndatabase of worst-case chemical accident information. To that end, the \nlanguage in this bill will preempt State and local law regarding public \naccess to government information. It makes little sense for us to limit \npublic access at the federal level but not at the State level. As a \nformer Governor, I believe the federal government must use the greatest \nrestraint in exercising a preemption of State law. With that in mind, \nthe managers' amendment makes clear that the preemption only applies to \nthat information collected by the federal government. In other words, \nif a State were to require the submission of similar--or even \nidentical--information about chemical releases, no federal restrictions \nwould apply to its distribution.\n  I believe most companies will want to work with community leaders and \nemergency response personnel to reduce the risks associated with their \nfacility. This amendment includes several tools to assist in the \nprocess of reducing risks. First, this amendment ensures that emergency \nresponse personnel get full and immediate access to this information. \nSecond, the regulation will allow access to a limited number of copies \nfor any member of the public so each of us can have the information \nabout facilities in our community. Third, this amendment will allow \naccess to a national database of this information that does not \nidentify the facilities. This will allow people to compare their local \nfacility with others around the country.\n  Finally, this amendment directs the administrator to create an \ninformation technology system that allows public access to off-site \nconsequence analysis information on a read-only basis. This database \nwould be centrally controlled by the federal government, much like the \nsystem the FBI uses to do background checks. Terminals to access the \ndatabase could be placed in libraries and government offices around the \nnation where users could assess the information for research purposes, \nbut not make copies of the information.\n  This product is not perfect, everyone had to make concessions in \norder to reach agreement, but what we have is a product that strikes an \nappropriate balance between public access to this information and the \nsafety concerns raised by posting it on the Internet. I want to thank \nSenator Inhofe and Senator Baucus for their efforts to achieve a \nreasonable and speedy solution acceptable to all parties.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 735) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendment, \nas amended, be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Fuels Regulatory Relief Act is a good \nmeasure. It has two major pieces. The first exempts flammable \nsubstances used as fuels, including propane, from the regulatory \nrequirements of the Clean Air Act's risk management program. The second \nis the matter of public access to worst case scenario data.\n  The committee and all of Congress has heard the concerns of propane \nusers and distributors. I have met with propane distributors from \nMontana on this subject. They feel that the burden imposed by the EPA's \nrisk management program is costly and provides little public health \nprotection. They have achieved some relief in court, but prefer, and \nthis bill provides, a clearer statement of Congress' intent.\n  In the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Congress directed EPA to \ncompile a list of at least 100 substances that ``pose the greatest risk \nof causing death, injury, or serious adverse effects to human health or \nthe environment from accidental releases.'' EPA was to consider the \nseverity of acute health effects, the likelihood of releases, and the \npotential magnitude of exposure associated with accidental releases of \na substance before putting it on the list.\n  I was a member of the conference committee on that bill. And, I \nbelieve that Congress did not intend that propane or flammables used as \nfuels would pass those tests and be listed. Congress was focused on \npreventing major toxic catastrophes, such as occurred in Bhopal, India, \nnot the type of accidents that are covered by existing Federal or State \nfire safety or transportation laws. Because it was not Congress' intent \nthat they be added, I am supporting removing them from the list.\n  As I mentioned during the committee's markup of S. 880, I wanted to \nbe responsive to concerns of the firefighters and fire chiefs. They had \nhoped to get information on flammables used as fuels as part of the \nrisk management program. But, as we discussed the matter further, it \nbecame clearer that their interests would be best served by the \ncomprehensive GAO study we have placed in the bill on their information \nneeds and the ability of Federal and State laws and programs to help \nthem do their jobs.\n  The bill also directs the GAO to do an additional study on the status \nof changes to the National Fire Protection Association Code for propane \n(NFPA 58). This voluntary industry standard was often cited by members \nof the propane industry as sufficiently protective of the public so \nthat no additional regulations were necessary. The GAO will report back \non changes to NFPA 58 that will hopefully provide at least the same \nlevel of public benefit as would have been provided by the listing of \npropane under the RMP requirements. I look forward to seeing progress \non NFPA 58 that is responsive to the fire fighting community.\n  I am pleased to note that we have been able to come to an agreement \non a managers' amendment which is a substitute for section 4 of the \nreported version of S. 880. That was largely the Administration's \nproposal for providing appropriate public access to the sensitive parts \nof the risk management plans. Our amendment will help the \nadministration continue implementing the accident prevention provisions \nof\n\n[[Page S7546]]\n\nthe Clean Air Act in a sensible way. The amendment balances the \npublic's right to know information about extremely hazardous substances \nwith the need to place some limits on access to that information to \nprevent terrorists and other criminals from misusing it.\n\n  Section 4 is a response to a potential threat identified by the \nadministration and industry. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \nhas testified before the Committee about its concerns that Internet \nposting of parts of the risk management plans (RMPs) required under \nsection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act could increase the threat of \ncriminal or terrorist actions. The FBI is particularly concerned about \nthe possible use of off-site consequence or worst case scenario \ninformation in the RMPs by terrorists to rank targets and maximize harm \nto the public. That section of the Act was created to help prevent \nincidents like the one in Bhopal, India, where 3,000 people died and \n200,000 were injured due to a chemical plant disaster.\n  I thank Senators Lautenberg, Chafee, Inhofe and representatives of \nthe Administration for their work in developing the managers' amendment \nand moving this process along. It represents a real bipartisan team \neffort. Senator Lautenberg and his staff were particularly helpful in \nachieving a balanced agreement on the risk management plan portions of \nthe amendment.\n  In early May, the administration sent up a legislative proposal to \ncreate a more secure system for handling sensitive RMP information. The \nadministration's hope was that Congress would act before June 21, 1999, \nbecause that is the statutory deadline under the Clean Air Act for \nsignificant users of extremely hazardous substances to submit their RMP \ninformation to EPA. The act directs EPA to make that information \navailable to local emergency responders, the States and the public. \nUnless this bill or similar legislation is passed soon, with a \nretroactivity clause included, the Administration cannot limit public \naccess to this sensitive information and would not be able to prevent \nit from getting on the Internet. The Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, \nrequires this kind of information be made available to the public, \nsince it is not classified or considered confidential business \ninformation. The RMP information is a truly new category of government \ninformation.\n  The committee approved the administration's proposal on May 11, 1999, \nwith the understanding that changes would have to be made before it \nwould be ready for the full Senate's consideration. Fundamentally, this \nmanagers' amendment is similar to the Administration proposal. They \nboth establish a system for accessing RMP information which is separate \nand distinct from the usual FOIA process. However, the approach in the \nmanagers' amendment provides a one-year exemption from FOIA while \nregulations are developed to govern the handling of and access to \nworst-case scenario information. This rulemaking period is a \nrecognition of the need to air the many issues rising from the creation \nof this new information access system. Concerns about it have been \nraised by the public, the States' Attorneys General, first responders, \nlibrarians and environmental groups, since the Administration proposal \nwas approved.\n  To encourage an expedited rulemaking process, the FOIA exemption \nwould be lifted if the rule is not completed within one year. In any \nevent, the FOIA exemption would be lifted six years after enactment. \nThis deadline ensures that Congress revisits and oversees the matter \nand is in keeping with the probable obsolescence of any information \ntechnology developed to satisfy the security concerns of the FBI and \nthe public access concerns of the EPA.\n\n  State and local government personnel and affiliated individuals who \nneed the worst case information for the official use of detecting, \npreventing, and responding to chemical facility accidents and their \noff-site consequences would be assured of getting it during the \nrulemaking period and after the rule is issued. However, to limit the \nchances that this information could get on the Internet, these people \nwould be required to exercise great care in their use and distribution \nof it. The same restrictions would be placed on qualified researchers. \nGuidance will be issued by EPA, as part of the rulemaking, describing \nthe official uses of the sensitive RMP information.\n  The amendment establishes penalties for those who knowingly or \nwillfully violate the restrictions on the dissemination of the \nsensitive parts of the RMP. There would be a two-tiered approach. \nPeople who knowingly misuse the information could be fined up to $5,000 \nfor each infraction. People who violate willfully, meaning that they \nknow what the law or regulations prohibit and proceed anyway regardless \nof potential consequences, could face fines up to $1 million per \ncalendar year.\n  The Clean Air Act's risk management program was created by Congress \nto help prevent chemical accidents that can harm our communities. \nPeople living near chemical plants do not care whether an accident \noccurs because of operator negligence or criminal activity. They want \nto feel and be secure from such threats. That is why we are taking this \nstep today. We want to reduce the opportunity that Internet \ndissemination of worst case scenario information could be used by \ncriminals to cause terror or destruction. We have even included an \nemphasis on preventing criminal releases of extremely hazardous \nsubstances, to make it clear that these should be an important focus of \nthe accidental release prevention program.\n  But, we also want to preserve the important incentive created by \npublic knowledge about chemical accidents and their consequences. That \nknowledge encourages manufacturers to improve the efficiency of their \nprocesses and plant safety. That is why we have provided the maximum \npossible public access to RMP information in this amendment and the \nClean Air Act.\n  The right-to-know effect has been very successful in reducing overall \ntoxic emissions to air, water and land. Knowing more about the off-site \nconsequences of these substances should encourage companies to build \nsafer facilities and look for alternative manufacturing methods. After \nall, it is part of the general duty under section 112(r) for owners and \noperators of chemical plants ``to design and maintain a safe facility \ntaking such steps as are necessary to prevent [accidental] releases.'' \nClearly, measures which entirely eliminate the presence of potential \nhazards, through substitution of less harmful substances or by \nminimizing the quantity of an extremely hazardous substance, as opposed \nto those which merely provide additional containment, are the most \npreferred and would be most effective in reducing the risk of \naccidental releases. The amendment specifically authorizes EPA and the \nDepartment of Justice to help owners and operators develop voluntary \nindustry standards to carry out the various objectives of the general \nduty clause.\n  Mr. President, we are prepared for final passage. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the measure, and I hope the House will take up \nthis matter and send it quickly to the President.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, after many weeks of intensive \nnegotiations, I am pleased the members of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee and the administration were able to come to an \nagreement on S. 880, the Fuels Regulatory Relief Act. I take this \nopportunity to clarify certain points of this important legislation.\n  One item that is of particular concern is the possibility for \ncircumvention by covered persons. New subparagraph (H)(xii)(II) states \nthat it ``does not restrict the dissemination of off-site consequence \nanalysis information by any covered person in any manner or form except \nin the form of a risk management plan.'' My concern is that this \nprovision would seem to allow a government official in possession of \nthis information to alter it in some minor, trivial way--like white out \nthe words ``Risk Management Plan'' at the top of the page--and then \ndistribute it with complete impunity. That possibility would obviously \nundermine the entire purpose of the legislation.\n  The purpose of this part of the bill is simply to clarify that \ncovered persons can talk generally to the public about off-site \nconsequence information--so that they can prepare documents that \ndiscuss the overall effect of OCAs in a particular state or locality, \nor so that they can prepare summaries like the executive summaries of \nrisk management plans. But this provision would not allow them to \nrelease OCA information about a particular facility, or\n\n[[Page S7547]]\n\nin a way that would tend to identify a particular facility, except to \nthe extent allowed by the regulations envisioned in the bill, or in the \nevent that the one-year moratorium expired without any regulations \nhaving been promulgated. The only exception would be where the covered \nperson came into possession of information that could be described as \n``off-site consequence information,'' but which was generated by some \ntotally different process than the Risk Management Program.\n  I am also troubled about the provision entitled ``Effect on State or \nLocal Law.'' On the one hand, subparagraph (H)(x)(I) states that the \nbill, and the regulations under it, shall supersede any inconsistent \nprovision of state or local law. But on the other hand, that preemption \nis ``subject to'' subparagraph (H)(x)(II), which says ``nothing in [the \nbill] precludes a State from making available off-site consequence \nanalysis information collected in accordance with State law.''\n\n  The issue of preemption of State laws is always a concern of mine, \nand I believe this legislation provides the proper balance of necessary \nprotection of information and the guidance for States to follow. The \nbill prevents States from disseminating any information that they \nreceive from a facility directly, or indirectly from any other person, \nthat was generated in the course of complying with Clean Air Act \nsection 112(r)(7). The only way a State can disseminate such \ninformation is pursuant to the regulations called for by the bill, or \nif the moratorium created by the bill expires without any regulations \nhaving been promulgated.\n  In plain language, what paragraph (H)(x)(II) does is say that where a \nState enacts its own, completely free-standing statute that calls for \nthe independent collection of information that fits the definition of \n``offsite consequence analysis information,'' then the State is allowed \nto release that information in accordance with State law. So far as I \nam aware, no such State law currently exists. Obviously, I would hope \nthat before a State enacted such a law, it would carefully consider the \nreasons that have led us to entertain this legislation today; the need \nto keep such sensitive information from being put on the Internet or \notherwise made widely available without adequate assessment of the \nsecurity risks created thereby.\n  Many responsible companies regulated by the RMP program realized a \nlong time ago that they needed to reach out and engage their local \ncommunities about the possible offsite consequences of releases from \ntheir facilities. Many companies started this dialogue process years \nago, and many more are engaged in it right now. Clearly this sort of \nvoluntary outreach is precisely the sort of behavior that we want to \nencourage, not discourage. I am worried about subparagraph (H)(v)(III), \nwhich says that where a facility ``makes off-site consequence analysis \ninformation relating to that stationary source available to the public \nwithout restriction,'' the prohibitions and sanctions created by the \nbill would no longer apply. I'm concerned that this provision will lead \nfacilities to be very hesitant to reveal any information about offsite \nconsequences, for fear that they will thereby be authorizing government \nagencies to put their OCA data on the Internet.\n  Under the legislation, ``offsite consequence analysis information'' \nis a defined term which is defined as ``those portions of a risk \nmanagement plan, excluding the executive summary of the plan, \nconsisting of an evaluation of 1 or more worst-case scenario or \nalternative scenario accidental releases * * *.'' So before a facility \nwould lose the protections provided by this bill, it would have to \nrelease its risk management plan, or at least the OCA portion of that \nplan, and do so without any restrictions whatsoever. They would be free \nto summarize or repackage the information in a different form without \ntriggering the provision in question. I think this creates a real \nbright-line test that should give facilities the kind of assurance they \nneed to allow them to continue doing the sort of outreach I also want \nto encourage.\n\n  Section (H)(ii) of the amendment requires, first, that the President \nassess the risks associated with posting off-site consequence analyses \non the Internet, and second, based on that assessment, to regulate in a \nmanner that minimizes the likelihood of both accidental and criminal \nreleases from covered facilities. At a minimum, these regulations \nshould accomplish the following goals in providing access to off-site-\nconsequence information:\n  Minimize the likelihood of accidental and criminal releases;\n  Allow limited access to paper copies of the analyses;\n  Allow other public access as appropriate; and\n  Provide access for official uses.\n  I note that the ``other public access'' contemplated under this \nprovision relates to the availability of summaries or other discussions \nof off-site consequence analyses that do not identify the specific \nfacility or location, and to mechanisms such as ``read-only'' \napproaches that preclude copying. Further, for the access by officials \nin contiguous states or localities indicated in (H)(ii)(II)(cc)-(ee), \nthe intention is to provide official access to off-site consequence \nanalyses in cases where the affected facilities have worst-case \nscenarios that impact the contiguous state or locality.\n  Mr. PRESIDENT, I thank the distinguished chairman, Senator Chafee, \nfor his guidance and also the tremendous cooperation by the ranking \nmember, Senator Baucus. Their work has ensured the passage of this \nimportant legislation. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          exempted substances\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks about S. 880, \nthe Fuels Regulatory Relief Act. This bill is designed to address the \nlisting of certain flammable fuels under section 112(r)(3) of the Clean \nAir Act. The Committee determined that propane and flammables used as \nfuels should not be listed as a regulated or extremely hazardous \nsubstances because they do not comport with the Act's criteria for such \nlisting. However, the National Association of Fire Fighters are \nconcerned that removing these substances from Federal regulation under \nsection 112(r) of the act will limit information regarding these fuels \nthat would have been available to the public through the Risk \nManagement Plans, RMP required by EPA's final rule implementing that \nsection.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Oklahoma \nfor his work on this piece of legislation. I think it is responsive to \nthe concerns that we heard from the fire fighters and the other first \nresponders. They are concerned about losing access to information that \nwould have been included in RMPs for those substances exempted by this \nbill. The RMP information was intended by Congress to aid emergency \nresponders and communities in the prevention of loss of life and \nproperty that might occur due to accidental releases of hazardous \nsubstances. The component of the RMPs of greatest interest to the \nemergency responders is the hazard assessment required by section \n112(r)(7)(B)(ii)(I).\n  Mr. INHOFE. I also thank my colleague from Montana for his work on \nthis bill. We are very aware of the dangers fire fighters and other \nemergency response personnel face every day protecting the lives of our \npeople and we want to provide them with the information they need to \nhandle threats posed by extremely hazardous substances. Nonetheless, \nthe substances generally addressed by S. 880, section 3, do not warrant \ncoverage by a Clean Air Act requirement to submit RMPs. A voluntary, \nnon-regulatory approach, such as the voluntary standards of the \nNational Fire Protection Association for Liquified Petroleum Gas (NFPA \n58), can better supply the information needed by fire fighters to \nprotect their and the public's health and welfare.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree with my colleague, but NFPA 58 does not currently \nrequire the development of hazard assessment or off-site consequence \nanalysis information. NFPA 58 also does not make specific provision for \ncommunicating or sharing this information with local emergency response \nauthorities or personnel. Another problem with the NFPA Code is that \nstate fire protection codes laws refer to NFPA 58 as of a certain date. \nTherefore, when the Code is updated, state laws do not automatically \nreflect subsequent changes to it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is true. There are two reports included in this \nlegislation designed to address those specific problems. The first \nreport will examine the status of amendments to NFPA 58 that\n\n[[Page S7548]]\n\nwill provide to local emergency response personnel information \nconcerning the off-site effects of accidental releases of those \nsubstances exempted from listing by section 3 of this legislation. We \nstrongly encourage all the parties involved in this NFPA amendment \nprocess to work together in good faith and in a timely manner. The \nsecond report is designed to examine the sufficiency of the information \nlocal emergency response personnel receive to help them respond to \nchemical accidents. Specifically, the report will address the level of \ncompliance with all federal and state requirements for submission of \nthis information to emergency response personnel. Also, the report will \nexamine the adequacy of the methods for delivering this information to \nemergency response personnel.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I believe these reports will be of great help to \nfirefighters and other emergency responders in looking at the adequacy \nof the information they need and get to do their jobs well. If the \nreports come back showing that the Federal government has not done its \nshare to make their job of protecting the public easier, then this \ncommittee and others should take quick action to address any gaps in \nthe system.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to this bill appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 880), as amended, was read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                 S. 880\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fuels Regulatory Relief \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that, because of their low toxicity and \n     because they are regulated sufficiently under other programs, \n     flammable fuels, such as propane, should not be included on \n     the list of substances subject to the risk management plan \n     program under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n     7412(r)).\n\n     SEC. 3. REMOVAL OF FLAMMABLE FUELS FROM RISK MANAGEMENT LIST.\n\n       Section 112(r)(4) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n     7412(r)(4)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) through (C) as \n     clauses (i) through (iii), respectively, and indenting \n     appropriately;\n       (2) by striking ``Administrator shall consider each of the \n     following criteria--'' and inserting the following: \n     ``Administrator--\n       ``(A) shall consider--'';\n       (3) in subparagraph (A)(iii) (as designated by paragraphs \n     (1) and (2)), by striking the period at the end and inserting \n     ``; and''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) shall not list a flammable substance when used as a \n     fuel or held for sale as a fuel under this subsection solely \n     because of the explosive or flammable properties of the \n     substance, unless a fire or explosion caused by the substance \n     will result in acute adverse heath effects from human \n     exposure to the substance, including the unburned fuel or its \n     combustion byproducts, other than those caused by the heat of \n     the fire or impact of the explosion.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.
