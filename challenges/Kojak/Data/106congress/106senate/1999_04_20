Mr. President, I note with great pleasure the prayer this \nmorning was given by Father Mackay, the rector of St. John's Episcopal \nChurch in Kirkland, WA. That is the church I most frequently attend \nwhen I am in my home State, and I attend it because of his great \nqualities as a pastor and a leader of his congregation. The magnificent \nspiritual guidance he gives both individually and collectively to that \ncongregation makes it one of the most satisfying and religiously \nexciting churches that it has ever been my privilege to attend during \na relatively long life.\n\n  He is here, however, not by my invitation but at the invitation of my \nfriend and colleague from Montana, Senator Burns. Father Mackay hails \nfrom Montana. His brother, I believe, is State director for Senator \nBurns, and it was his imagination and thoughtfulness that invited Don \nhere today. I thank him. I thank our regular Chaplain, Lloyd Ogilvie, \nand I thank Father Mackay for a wonderful and inspiring prayer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I join my friend from Washington in \nwelcoming Father Mackay. His family has deep roots in the State of \nMontana. If you ever hear of the brands TopHat and LazyEL, those are \nfamous brands in our State up in the Red Lodge country and Roscoe, MT. \nWe have bumper stickers saying, ``Where in the world is Roscoe?''\n  I welcome Father Mackay. He comes from a family of folks who have \ndonated resources and time to public service. He was also the pastor in \nBillings before going to Washington. We hated to lose him from the \nBillings community. But when you look at the family and his uncles and \ngoing back to his grandfather, they have a rich tradition and great \nAmerican values.\n  Of course, I thank Dr. Ogilvie for allowing this privilege today and \nwelcome Don to the Senate and to Washington, DC. I often call this 17 \nsquare miles of logic free environment, but knowing Father Mackay, he \nwill have it all figured out by the end of the day. So welcome.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I actually came to the floor to speak \nabout the crisis in agriculture and what is happening in the Midwest, \nbut I want to respond to some of the comments my colleagues have made, \nalthough I will be doing this extemporaneously, and I will be thinking \nout loud, but I hope I will be thinking deeply.\n  Mr. President, I agree with my colleague from Nebraska, I agree with \nall my colleagues who have spoken on the floor about the importance of \naccountability. I remember previously coming to the floor before we \ntook a recess where it looked as if we might be taking military action \nin Kosovo--it wasn't clear--and saying I thought we needed to have a \nfull debate and I would support that military action.\n  I agree with my colleague about the history and how it will judge us. \nI saw what Milosevic did in Bosnia. I saw enough misery and refugee \ncamps to last me a lifetime. And I certainly do not want to be in a \nposition to have our country, and other countries, turn their gaze away \nfrom the systematic slaughter and massacre and murder of people and \ndriving people out of their country, albeit, unfortunately, I think \nMilosevic, up to date, has been able to do much of that.\n  Here is where I just want to express a few concerns, although I think \nprobably later on we will have the debate. This debate probably does \nnot start today, but since I am on the floor I do want to raise a few \nconcerns.\n  First of all, in the here and now, I think--and I will get a chance \nthis afternoon to put some questions to Secretary Albright--as long as \nwe are talking about stopping the slaughter and given the headlines and \nthe stories in today's papers of Milosevic stopping people from being \nable to leave the country, we do need to think about these internally \ndisplaced refugees and how we can get some relief to them. I still, in \nmy own mind, do not quite understand why we are not doing airlifting, \nwhy we are not getting supplies to them. I think it is a difficult \nquestion, it could be loss of life. But, again, I say to my colleagues, \nI want to press very hard on the question of whether or not we should \nbe airlifting some humanitarian relief to people who are obviously \ngoing to starve to death otherwise. I am trying to understand why we \nare not doing that now.\n\n  Secondly, in the prosecution of this war, I voted that we conduct the \nairstrikes. I was hoping we would be able to do much more by way of \nstopping this slaughter, but I raise the question of why we are not \nconducting more of the airstrikes in Kosovo. I say this to my \ncolleagues on the floor. I really believe that. And I worry about this. \nI have to say it on the floor of the Senate. Pretty soon we run out of \ntargets in Serbia. And to the extent that we run out of targets and \ncontinue with an expanded air war, there are going to be innocent \npeople who will die, which is very difficult for me.\n  I think we get to a point where we don't want to undercut the moral \nclaim of what we are doing. I believe we are trying to do the right \nthing, but I do not understand why we are not prosecuting more of this \nair war and more of these airstrikes in Kosovo. We are talking about \nwhat we need to do now. I do not understand all of the decisionmaking, \nbut I guess in my own mind, I want to press on that question, because \nit seems to me there is a direct correlation between our being able to \ndo that and whether or not other means will be necessary, as I look at \nthis resolution, and, moreover, whether it doesn't make far more sense \nto do that. Again, I know there are risks involved, but at the same \ntime I worry about the sort of airstrikes focused on Belgrade and other \ncities as opposed to Kosovo.\n  Finally, I say today that I would prefer to hear more discussion. My \ncolleague from Nebraska--you don't know people well, but you just have \na feeling about them--is somebody I really like and respect. That is \njust all there is to it, period. Everything he says I take as being \nsaid in the very best of good faith, very much a part of good faith, \nwith complete sincerity and conviction and knowledge.\n  I would like to hear in this Chamber more discussion about diplomacy, \nabout where it fits in. I think it is far more important than has been \ndiscussed today that we really ask the Russians to be a part of a \ndiplomatic solution. I know we are talking to them about being part, \neventually, of some kind of peacekeeping force. I think, by the way, it \nwill not just be a NATO force. I heard my colleagues list that as an \nobjective. I do not think that is going to happen. I don't think it \nwill be a NATO force; I think it will be a very different peacekeeping \nforce.\n  More than just asking the Russians what they will be a part of, I \nbelieve the Russians are in a key position to help forge a diplomatic \nsolution as an alternative to an ever expanding war, consistent with \nwhat I believe should be our objectives which are stopping this \nslaughter of people and people having a chance to go back to their \ncountry. I want to see the emphasis on the military action we are \ntaking but also on the diplomatic front. I do not hear that today and \nit concerns me.\n  I say to my colleagues that when I see language which talks about \n``to use all necessary force and other means,'' it just sounds too \nbroad and too open-ended to me, as a Senator. I am skeptical of such \nlanguage. There are many answers to many questions that I will pose in \ndebate and discussion. There are many questions I have about this \ntoday. I have expressed some of my reservations about this resolution, \nand I do believe we should have Senator Hagel in the discussion and the \ndebate that is called for. I think it is important. Otherwise, I think \nwe do abdicate our responsibility, whatever decisions we arrive at. I \ncommend the Senator for it, but I have expressed some of my \nreservations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/20/senate-section/article/S3890-5", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, we had a gathering in the State of \nMinnesota on Sunday afternoon. It started about 1 p.m. Joel Klein, who \nheads the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department, was gracious \nenough to come. Mike Dunn, who is Assistant Secretary for Agriculture, \nwas gracious enough to come. This will just be 5 minutes' worth, \nbecause I am going to be calling on colleagues, especially\n\n[[Page S3891]]\n\nfrom the Midwest and the West, to start coming to the floor every day \nand talking about what is happening to farmers and what is happening in \nagriculture. We have to speak out, and we have to turn the pressure up \nfor action.\n  During spring planting season, Sunday afternoon--I think the Chair \nknows this as well as I do--to have somewhere around 800 farmers come \nwas unbelievable. It was an unbelievable turnout of farmers. And there \nis a very clear reason why. Many of them from Minnesota, but a huge \ndelegation from Missouri, South Dakota, North Dakota, Illinois, Iowa, \nKansas, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Colorado, these farmers came because they \nare confronted with the fierce urgency of now. They came because time \nis not neutral for them, time rushes on, and they can work 20 hours a \nday--and they do--and they can be the best managers in the world, and \nthey cannot survive.\n  There was a focus to this gathering, and it was basically about the \nwhole problem of conglomerates having muscled their way to the dinner \ntable to the point where there isn't the kind of competition we need. \nThere was a call for antitrust action. What farmers were saying was: \nThese conglomerates have muscled their way to the dinner table and they \nhave exercised their raw economic and political power over us as \nproducers and over consumers and over taxpayers. You have our grain \nfarmers going under, record low prices. Then a headline in the Star \nTribune on Saturday: ``Cargill profits from decline in farm prices, 53 \npercent jump in earnings expected''--how hog farmers are going under \nand yet the packers are in hog heaven. Everywhere the farmers look, \nthey have a few large firms, whether it be dairy, whether it be \nlivestock producers, whether it be grain farmers, a few large firms \nthat dominate well over 50 percent of the market. What the farmers were \ncalling for was strong antitrust action.\n\n  Joel Klein was honest. He said: I wouldn't be here if I didn't take \nthis seriously, and you will have to judge me by my deeds. I so \nappreciated his coming out. There was a lot of pressure on Mike Dunn \nand USDA and Secretary Glickman to do more by way of antitrust action.\n  It was much appreciated. But I say, Mr. President, that the farmers, \nwith considerable justification, want to put some free enterprise back \ninto the food industry. Farmers, with considerable justification, see a \ndirect correlation between monopoly power and a few large, giant firms \nthat are making record profits while they go under. They want to see \nantitrust action. All they are asking for is a competitive market. By \ngolly, government ought to be on their side. We ought to be seeing \nstronger antitrust action.\n  The other thing I have to say--we have one bill, S. 19, on which \nSenator Daschle is taking the lead, which talks about full public \ndisclosure of pricing, which is so important to livestock producers--we \nought to know what these packers are paying our livestock producers; we \nought to have public disclosure on pricing. In addition, we ought to \ndeal with the monopoly power and have some antitrust action taken so \nfarmers have a chance to compete.\n\n  I have to say to colleagues, yes, it is crop insurance reform that we \nare talking about. But the other thing we are going to have to do is \nrevisit this Freedom to Farm, which I have always called the ``freedom \nto fail'' bill. I don't even want to point the finger. We can talk \nabout what works with Freedom to Farm, but it seems to me that here the \nevidence is crystal clear that one thing has happened for sure--there \nis absolutely no stability anymore when it comes to farm income. And \nwhile the large conglomerates with huge amounts of capital can weather \nthese mad fluctuations in price, our family farmers can't. They aren't \ngetting anywhere near the cost of production. We have to focus on how \nwe can get the price up and have some farm income for family farmers, \nand how we can take on some of these conglomerates so family farmers \nhave a fair shake by way of getting a decent price.\n  As a Senator from the Midwest where we still have a family farm \nstructure in agriculture that we are trying to hold on to, it is so \nimportant for our rural communities, so important for family farmers, \nso important for safe, affordable food for consumers, so important for \nthe environment. This is a historic struggle.\n  I hope Senators from the farm states will be coming to the floor \nevery day to speak out about this until we have some strong action that \nwill be on behalf of family farmers. They need the support. They \ndeserve the support. And the Senate and the Congress ought to be taking \naction.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, recently I introduced S. 684, the \nFishermen's Bankruptcy Protection Act, a bill to provide family \nfishermen with the same protections and terms as those granted family \nfarmers under Chapter 12 of our bankruptcy laws. I would like to take \nthis opportunity to explain this legislation to my colleagues in \nanticipation of the Senate's upcoming debate on bankruptcy legislation.\n  Like many Americans, I'm appalled by those who live beyond their \nmeans, and use the bankruptcy code as a tool to cure their self-induced \nfinancial ills. I have supported and will continue to support \nreasonable reforms to the bankruptcy code that ensure the responsible \nuse of its provisions. All consumers bear the burden of irresponsible \ndebtors who abuse the system. Therefore, I believe bankruptcy should \nremain a tool of last resort for those in severe financial distress.\n  As those familiar with the bankruptcy code know, however, business \nreorganization in bankruptcy is a different creature than the \nforgiveness of debt traditionally associated with bankruptcy. \nReorganization embodies the hope that by providing a business some \nrelief, and allowing debt to be adjusted, the business will have an \nopportunity to get back on sound financial footing and thrive. In that \nvein, Chapter 12 was added to the bankruptcy code in 1986 by the \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, to provide for bankruptcy \nreorganization of the family farm and to give family farmers a fighting \nchance to reorganize their debts and keep their land.\n  To provide the fighting chance envisioned by the authors of Chapter \n12, Congress provided a distinctive set of rules to govern effective \nreorganization of the family farm. In essence, Chapter 12 was a \nrecognition of the unique situation of family-owned businesses and the \nenormous value of the family farmer to the American economy and to our \ncultural heritage.\n  Chapter 12 was modeled on bankruptcy Chapter 13 which governs the \nreorganization of individual debt. However, to address the unique \nproblems encountered by farmers, Chapter 12 provided for significant \nadvantages over the standard Chapter 13 filer. These advantages include \na longer period of time to file a plan for relief, greater flexibility \nfor the debtor to modify the debts secured by their assets, and the \nalteration of the statutory time limit to repay secured debts. The \nChapter 12 debtor is also given the freedom to sell off parts of his or \nher property as part of a reorganization plan.\n  Unlike Chapter 13 which applies solely to individuals, Chapter 12 can \napply to individuals, partnerships or corporations which fall under a \n$1.5 million debt threshold--a recognition of the common use of \nincorporation even among small family-held farms.\n  Chapter 12 has been an enormous success in the farm community. \nAccording to a recent University of Iowa study, 74 percent of family \nfarmers who filed Chapter 12 bankruptcy are still farming, and 61 \npercent of farmers who went through Chapter 12 believe the law was \nhelpful in getting them back on their feet.\n  Recognizing its effectiveness, my bill proposes that Chapter 12 \nshould be made a permanent part of the bankruptcy code, and equally \nimportant, my legislation would extend Chapter 12's protections to \nfamily fishermen.\n\n[[Page S3892]]\n\n  In my own state of Maine, fishing is a vital part of our economy and \nour way of life. The commercial fishing industry is made up of proud \nand fiercely independent individuals whose goal is simply to preserve \ntheir business, family income, and community. My legislation would \nafford fishermen the same protection of business reorganization as is \nprovided to family farmers.\n  There are many similarities between the family farmer and the family \nfisherman. Like the family farmer, the fisherman should not only be \nvalued as a businessman, but also for his or her contributions to our \nway of life and our economy. Like farmers, fishermen face perennial \nthreats from nature and the elements, as well as laws and regulations \nwhich unfortunately threaten their existence. Like family farmers, \nfishermen are not seeking special treatment or a hand-out from the \nfederal government, they seek only the fighting chance to remain afloat \nso that they can continue in their way of life.\n  Although fishermen do not seek any special treatment from the \ngovernment, they play a special role in seafaring communities on our \ncoasts, and they deserve protections granted others who face similar, \noften unavoidable, problems. Fishermen should not be denied the \nbankruptcy protections accorded to farmers solely because they harvest \nthe sea and not the land.\n  I have proposed not only to make Chapter 12 a permanent part of the \nbankruptcy code, but also to apply its provisions to the family \nfisherman. The bill I have proposed mirrors Chapter 12 with very few \nexceptions. Its protections are restricted to those fishermen with \nregular income who have total debt less than $1.5 million, the bulk of \nwhich, eighty percent, must stem from commercial fishing. Moreover, \nfamilies must rely on fishing income for these provisions to apply.\n  These same protections and flexibility we grant to farmers should \nalso be granted to the family fisherman.

Mr. President, I want to speak to a resolution that \nhas been introduced this morning regarding Congress taking an action \nabout our troops in Kosovo and the whole escalation of the operation in \nKosovo. The text of the resolution is that we would give the President \nall of the authority to use whatever force, take whatever steps he sees \nas necessary.\n  I certainly think we should have a debate on this whole issue of \nKosovo. I think it is certainly something that Congress is going to \nneed to weigh in on. But I think it would be vastly premature to take \nan action before the President has laid out a plan. The President has \nnot asked us for ``all force.'' The President has not asked us, \nactually, for anything except funding on an emergency basis to make \nsure we have the ability to fund the operation that is going on in \nYugoslavia without taking away from other national security interests. \nI am going to support the President in that request. The last thing I \nwant to do is have our troops in harm's way, along with our allies', \nand run out of money or run out of equipment or have any of our \nnational defense personnel anywhere else in the world be shortchanged. \nWe are not going to let that happen.\n  When the President gives us the specificity that is required for the \nappropriation, I think there will be a resounding vote in Congress to \ngive our troops and our military the leeway they need to spend the \nmoney to have the equipment they need to do this job. But I cannot \nimagine having a carte blanche given to an operation that clearly is \nescalating a mission and we have not seen a plan. We have not seen a \nplan. We have not seen a timetable. We have not seen a cost estimate \nfor the long term. So I hope we will take a step back here, and rather \nthan voting on the resolution that was put forward today we would be \ntalking among ourselves, that we will be debating at whatever point is \nthe right one, and that we would be having op-eds in newspapers, which \nI think certainly have added to the body of opinion on this issue. But \nCongress should not micromanage this war. The President should come to \nus and say what he needs, what he is going to do with the money, what \nkind of plan we have, what kind of troop commitment are we talking \nabout, what is it going to do to the rest of our national defense \noperation. We need to have a full plan.\n  One of the things that has concerned so many of us is that perhaps we \nstarted an operation before we had a contingency plan. Perhaps we \nstarted the operation before we knew what we would need for the long \nterm, before we knew the goal. I think the mission has actually changed \nseveral times.\n  We obviously have had a different result from this operation than we \nhad hoped. There is no question about that. Whether this is a success \nis yet to be determined, and I do not think we should be jumping in, \nsaying it has not been a success. But I think it is time for us to let \nthe President take the lead, to let him come to us with his requests. \nHe is the one who is supposed to be executing this operation. I do \nthink it would be a mistake for Congress to put the cart before the \nhorse. I do not think we should micromanage. I do not think we should \ntell the President what to do. I do not think we should put our \nopinions on top of his. And most certainly, when I hear our NATO allies \nsaying they would not consider ground troops, the last thing I think we \nshould do is encourage ground troops. I think the case has not been \nmade, the base has not been laid, and our allies are not in support.\n\n  So I think we need to take a step back. We need to be getting the \nadministration to give us briefings at every point, asking our \nopinions. Let's debate this, let's talk about what kind of commitment \nwe want to make. But I will not vote for troops on the ground in this \noperation as a carte blanche, a blank check, before I know what we are \ngoing to do. What will our responsibility be? What will our allies' \ncontribution be? What is the timetable? What is the mission? Is it \nachievable, and what is it going to cost? And what is it going to do to \nthe rest of our national defense?\n  These are questions that must be asked. We must get answers. We must \nhave a full briefing. For Congress to have a vote before we have all of \nthat would be irresponsible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I will address what is obviously the issue \nmost pressing on us as a nation and certainly on the Western World. \nThat is, of course, the issue of Kosovo and the war that is being \npursued there.\n  First, I think it is important to understand that we as a nation are \nobviously the sole major superpower in the world and that we have, as a \nnation, a significant obligation to use our strength in order to \npromote the betterment of the world and to promote interests around the \nworld which assist our national policy. We should not disengage from \nthe world, we should not be isolationist--just the opposite; we have an \nobligation to reach out and use our great wealth and our great good \nluck and our great good fortune to benefit as many people around the \nworld as we can.\n  But I think we must also be sensitive to the fact that we can't be \neverywhere all the time and that when we ask American troops, men and \nwomen, to put their lives on the line, we have to be very specific as \nto why we are doing it and what the purpose of that effort is, because \nthat, of course, is the most extreme request we can place on any \nAmerican.\n  We should have a process of putting forward a plan, a test, if you \nwill accept it, as to why we engage with American force. I have always \nfelt that test should have three elements. I have spoken about it \nbefore.\n  The first is, is there a definable American interest? In many \ninstances this could be international interests which impact us \nsignificantly, such as the gulf war, where European oil was at risk. \nBut is there a definable American interest which is specific enough and \nwhich can be justified and which can be explained, quite honestly, in \nthese terms: If an American service person loses his or her life, could \nyou go to the parent of that person, could you go to the wife of that \nperson, could you go to the child of that person, and tell them why the \nloss of their life was important to America? Could you explain our \npurpose in terms that would satisfy a grieving parent, wife, or child \nthat their son or daughter had died in a cause which assisted America? \nThat is the first and most important test.\n\n  The second test is, is the engagement of American troops going to be \nable to resolve the situation, or is the situation so complex, so \nconvoluted, and so historically intertwined that it probably can never \nbe resolved or never even be, for any extended period, pacified?\n  The third is, is there a plan for getting out? Before you get into \nsomething, you ought to know how you are going to get out of it or at \nleast have some concept of how you are going to get out of it. That is \nabsolutely critical.\n  Those are the tests for our engagement.\n  We are now engaged in a war in Kosovo. Unfortunately, in my opinion, \nnone of those tests was met before we made the decision to go forward. \nThis administration could not explain, and has certainly not explained \nvery well, why we decided to step off on this route of military action.\n  The initial statement was that we were doing it in order to bring \nMilosevic into negotiations, in order to bring the Yugoslav Government \ninto negotiations to try to settle the situation in Kosovo, because a \nnumber of people had been killed in Kosovo, hundreds maybe, although \nthe number that had actually been reported was somewhat less than that, \nand because we were concerned that there would be a great dislocation \nof population in the Kosovo--or the administration was concerned that \nthere would be a great dislocation of population in the Kosovo province \nof Serbia if we did not take action to try to force Milosevic to agree \nto the settlement as had been outlined at Rambouillet.\n  That was the initial purpose of the use of air power against Serbia, \nand against Yugoslavia, or Yugoslavia and Kosovo and Serbia. The \npurpose, therefore, was never to go in to occupy and to win a war \nagainst Yugoslavia. That was never the original purpose as presented by \nthis administration.\n  One has to wonder, what was our national interest in that region in \nKosovo? A legitimate case could be made that humanitarian interests are \na national interest. But actually what was happening in Kosovo, \nalthough severe and brutal and being shown on TV, was nothing--\nabsolutely nothing--compared to what was happening in Ethiopia, \nSomalia, Sudan, Sri Lanka, and a number of former republics, in fact, \nof the former Soviet Union, where literally millions of people died in \nAfrica as a result of internal civil war.\n  Remember, this was a civil war situation. Kosovo was a province of \nYugoslavia, which was an independent state, and is an independent \nstate.\n  So there is the issue of humanitarian interests, although they hardly \nraised it to the level that justified use of American force when we \nweren't using American force to settle matters in Ethiopia, in Somalia, \nin Sudan, in Sri Lanka, or Azerbaijan, or Georgia.\n  So you had to ask, what was in the national interest? Quite honestly, \nprior to this process--this is all prior to the actual air campaign--I \nnever believed, and I don't think the President ever made clear, \nbecause he really couldn't, that there was a dramatic American national \ninterest in Kosovo. In fact, the irony of this situation is that NATO \nis now using all its force against a region--Albania and Kosovo--and \nclaiming that that region is strategically important, when throughout \nthe cold war when NATO was at its peak--at its absolute peak--of \ndeterrence and purpose, when it had specific purpose, which was to \ndeter East European and Soviet aggression in Albania, which was behind \nthe Iron Curtain, which was an Eastern European country, it was never \neven considered a factor of threat. Other nations were--East Germany, \nPoland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Russia, Soviet Russia--during the \ncold war.\n  But Albania was never a factor, because it was such a poor and \ndesperate nation; it had no strategic impact at all. But suddenly it \nbecomes a nation of strategic impact to us. Suddenly Kosovo, a \nsubprovince of Yugoslavia, becomes a nation of strategic impact to us. \nIt is hardly explainable to the American people. It must be found \nagainst other strategic events which precipitated the bombing. And what \nimpact do those have? And what is the significance? I think the answer \nto that is yes, the unintended consequence of this bombing is that we \nhave created significant strategic and national concerns which weren't \nthere before we started the bombing but are certainly there now.\n  Let's name three of them.\n  First, of course, is the humanitarian issue. The huge number of \nrefugees, to whom our heart goes out, and to whom we obviously have \nsome responsibility for carrying forward--and I will get back to that \nin a second--clearly we now have a strategic and national concern about \ndoing something to care for those refugees. That should have been \nanticipated before we started the bombing. But it obviously was not by \nthis administration. So we created an event there.\n  The second event, which is maybe even more significant, which \nabsolutely is more significant, was an unintended consequence which \nthis administration clearly didn't expect and can't even represent that \nit marginally expected, and which has occurred; that is, that we have \nmanaged, through this bombing activity and this military action of NATO \nagainst the Kosovo region, potentially to be expanded to a greater \nSerbia--we have managed to dramatically undermine and, in my opinion, \ndestabilize the process of evolution towards democracy in Russia, and \ncertainly the process that Russia was moving towards engaging with the \nWestern nations in a constructive way, including being a partner for \npeace ancillary to NATO. We have as an unintended consequence managed \nto invigorate the nationalist spirit within the political system of \nRussia, which was already under great strain, and a fledgling democracy \nwhich is absolutely critical to the future peace of this world and to \nthe prospective activities of us as a nation as we move into the next \ncentury. A democracy in which we had invested a great deal has been \nplaced at some jeopardy as to its relationship with us in the West, and \nwe\n\n[[Page S3894]]\n\nhave clearly undermined much of the goodwill that we built in Russia.\n\n  Unfortunately, it could get worse, significantly worse. If we were to \npursue a course of invasion of Yugoslavia, it would put Russia in an \nalmost untenable position because of the relationship which has gone \nback for hundreds of years where the Russians consider the Slavic \npeople and the Serbian people to be their brothers. An invasion would \nclearly make it very difficult for the forces of moderation and reason \nwithin Russian society to overcome the forces of nationalism and \njingoism. Even worse than that, were we to declare war--which has been \nproposed by some, because we are at war, but if we were to formally \ndeclare war, we would even see a more difficult position placed on the \nRussian moderates and voices of reason.\n  Let me say this: Our relationship to Russia, our ability to nurture \nand build that nation as a democracy and a capitalist-oriented, \nmarketplace-oriented society is exponentially more important than what \nhappens in the Balkans. The Balkans are important to Europe. Russia is \nimportant to the United States.\n  So that unintended consequence has occurred. We have started the \ndestabilization of our relationship with Russia, and we have \ndramatically encouraged the forces of nationalism.\n  The third unintended consequence which this administration has \ncreated by its actions in Kosovo is that we have dramatically weakened \nour military capability to fulfill our legitimate obligations in many \nplaces around the globe.\n  As a result of this administration's continuous reduction in defense \nactivity and its basic antipathy towards the Defense Department for the \nfirst 4 to 5 years of this Presidency, we no longer have the capability \nto fight effectively in an extensive engagement on two fronts, as was \nour traditional approach to our military defense. And we know--now \npublicly reported--that our ordnances are being drawn down and our \ncapacity to support our men and women in military action is at risk. \nThat is a consequence of this event and could lead to serious \nramifications, which I have no desire to go into but which are logical.\n\n  So that is one of the reasons I have called this undertaking by our \nadministration to be one of the--probably the most significant--\nblunders of the post-world-war period, because we have created a huge \nrefugee population in large part, in good part--obviously not \nentirely--because Milosevic is a thug--because of the function of our \nbombing.\n  We have undermined our relationship with Russia and we have degraded \nour own military capability, all in the name of intervening in a region \nof the world where our interests were there, obviously, because we are \na humanitarian nation concerned about humanitarian needs, but in \nrelationship to other points around the world, whether it be African \ngenocide that is occurring today at a rate--well, it wasn't until the \nrefugee situation anyway--at a rate dramatically greater than what was \noccurring in Kosovo, or whether it be in our strategic relationship \nwith areas such as North Korea or Iraq, where we have dramatic national \ninterests. Our interests in this part of the world were limited, yet we \nhave rolled the dice there at a level that is extraordinary.\n  So what do we do now? That is of course the question. We have been \ndrawn into this action, and almost on the back of an envelope, it \nseems. You have watched the administration's different justifications \nfor being there. And they change with the regularity of the weather, it \nseems, in that part of the world. There is no consistency to their \nposition. One day it is that we are there to help the Kosovars have \nsome form of autonomy within the Yugoslavian system and to avoid \nrefugees.\n  And then there is a huge refugee event, in part because of our--in \npart, I say, only in part--because of our bombing. And now it is no \nlonger that we are there in order to maintain autonomy. We appear to be \nmoving there, being there, for purposes of obtaining independence, or \nsome greater autonomy than certainly a state relationship, and it is to \nput the refugees back in a region which has been decimated.\n  The target moves constantly. It is one day that we are trying to \nbring Milosevic into negotiations. It is another day that we are trying \nto replace the Milosevic regime. And, of course, we don't even know \nwhat it would be replaced with.\n  So it is a policy that has gone arbitrary and, in my opinion, on the \nback of an envelope process without any definitive purpose that can be \nsubscribed to in a way that we can be assured we can get there in any \ncourse or pattern.\n  So what do we do now?\n  One other point that should be made is the cost. One hates to talk \nabout costs when American troops are at risk. Clearly, we will do \nwhatever we need in this Congress to support those troops with whatever \ndollars are appropriate and whatever dollars we can put towards their \nefforts. But the fact is, the cost of this is going to be astronomical. \nThis $6 billion request from this White House, which is such an \nunderstated and inaccurate figure--it is frustrating to deal with a \nWhite House that won't be forthcoming with the American people on this \nissue, which it has been, clearly, on others.\n  But clearly, on this issue, that cost nowhere near reflects what it \nwill cost in the long run to pursue this policy that they have \nundertaken, simply because we are going to have to replace all of the \nordnance they have used, for one thing, which is accounted for. And, \nNo. 2, we are going to have to rebuild what we have blown up in order \nto put the refugees back, if it is the purpose of this administration \nto put the refugees back. Obviously, you can't put them back without \nhousing, without electricity, without water, and without jobs. So the \npotential of reconstruction costs exceeds the military costs probably \nby a factor of 2, 3, or 4.\n\n  The absurdity of this administration coming to us and claiming that \n$6 billion will get them through the rest of the year just from the \nstandpoint of executing this war is, on the face of it, something the \nAmerican people should question seriously. So the cost is dramatic.\n  So what should we do? I don't know the answer. If I had the answer, \nobviously it would be wonderful. But I don't. But let me suggest a \ncouple of options.\n  No. 1, we have the responsibility to the refugees. We have a \nresponsibility to make sure they are adequately housed and fed. I think \nthat is going to mean getting them out of where they are today. We \ncannot let them sit there as chips at the bargaining table for months, \nor years, as the Palestinians were left in limbo. Rather, we are going \nto have to move them someplace where they can survive the winter and \nwhere possibly they can be resettled. It may be political asylum for \nthem in many parts of Europe or in the United States, but there has to \nbe a thoughtful, long-range plan for how you handle these refugees.\n  Second, it is going to cost a lot of money, and we are going to have \nto spend it. Instead of pushing Russia to the brink, instead of \nengaging Russia in a way that basically undermines the moderate and \nreasoned forces and accelerates and raises the nationalist forces, \nlet's engage Russia in a constructive way. Let's use the German \nproposals. Let's use their support and use our contacts with Russia, \nwhich has the contact with Serbia, in order to try to negotiate a \nresolution of this, a resolution which would probably involve some sort \nof multifinanced force, not NATO related, in the Kosovo region. But, \nrather than pushing Russia away, let us try to draw them in and let us \nnot put ground troops into this region. How disastrous would that be. \nThis is an area of the world where the people fight, where they \nbelieve. We have taken a nation which was a little bit fractured, \nactually, Yugoslavia, greater Serbia, and united those people. And they \nwill fight.\n\n  Unless we go in there in a noncombative way, there will be a \nsignificant loss of life. And again the question will have to be asked, \nfor what cause? And I cannot answer that question. So I do not see it \nas being constructive to put ground forces into that region. To \nauthorize this administration to have that flexibility, after this \nadministration has so completely mismanaged the issue to begin with, \nis, to me, foolhardy. So this is a complex and difficult issue, but it \nis the issue of the time and we need to address it and that is why I \nhave taken this time.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order a quorum is not present.\n\n[[Page S3895]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask the Senator a \nquestion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withhold his point of order?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield solely for the purpose of a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was here for most of your remarks. First I want to \ncommend you. In my recollection of the discussions we had with those \nwho were in the administration prior to this involvement, with \nreference to Russia, there was almost kind of a trite answer--don't \nworry, they will not do anything.\n  I want to ask you if there is not a serious problem coming about now. \nThey are going to have elections next year. We have always wondered how \nlong will it be before their nationalist temperaments come back to the \nsurface and they move in the wrong direction politically. I wonder if \nyou might speculate or reason with me about that.\n  My evaluation, based upon a number of people who have talked about \nRussia and an analysis that has been given to me, is that they are now \nso anti-American and so antiwest that they are apt to move in a rather \nconcerted manner by large numbers of votes in a direction that is not \nmoving toward a marketplace economy and democracy. Is that your concern \nalso?\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the Senator from New Mexico, as usual, has hit the \nnail on the head. That is the most significant strategic concern we \nhave on the issue of Kosovo, which is where does Russia end up? Do we \nend up forcing it down the road towards a nationalist state with maybe \nirresponsible leadership? Or do we continue it on the path of democracy \nand marketplace economy?\n  I think that ever since the end of the cold war period everyone has \nanalyzed the Russian situation as being tentative. The biggest concern \nof everyone who has analyzed it is that they may go the course of a \nnationalist leader who might use the West as the purpose for uniting a \nmilitaristic response, a militaristic nation approach. That is the \nconcern. The Senator's point is absolutely on target.\n  Our biggest strategic interest today is what happens with Russia.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I make a point of order a quorum is not \npresent.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I commend my colleagues for the time they \nhave taken on the floor to talk about the situation in Kosovo. I was \nprivileged this last weekend to be selected to be part of the first \nleadership delegation to go to the Balkans. It was a joint House and \nSenate delegation involving Democrats and Republicans, and it was a \nwhirlwind trip. We all came back exhausted, but I think each of us came \nback better informed about the situation.\n  I would like to speak to that a few moments, following up on the \nspeech just given by my colleague.\n  Let me say at the outset that I am a product of the Vietnam era. I \ndid not serve in the military nor in Vietnam, obviously, but I came to \nthe conclusion, as a result of that experience, that war is the last \nresort; that there is no such thing as a military adventure. When \nmilitary is involved, people die. It should be taken ever so seriously.\n  That has guided me through 17 years of service on Capitol Hill. I \nhave not been quick to turn to the military or quick to pull the \ntrigger. I have always looked for an alternative, a peaceful \nalternative. Yet, I believe we find ourselves in the Balkans in a \nsituation where, frankly, there was no alternative but the use of \nforce.\n  The Senator raised the question about what in the world is our \nnational interest in Kosovo? Most Americans could not find it on a map. \nWhy are we sending all this money and all of our troops, all of the \nresources of this country focused on Serbia? Why?\n  It is part of Europe. It is part of a continent where the United \nStates has a special interest. And if there is any doubt about that \nspecial interest, merely tour the veterans cemeteries in Europe, \nbecause in World War I and World War II, our best and brightest in \nAmerica put on their uniforms, picked up their guns and went to Europe \nto defend the stability and future of that continent.\n  We have an Atlantic alliance, not just because of a common ethnic \nheritage, but because we believe the synergy between the United States \nand Europe brings strength to the Atlantic, brings strength to both \ncountries, both regions, and we have committed ourselves to that.\n  Today, as you look at the map of Europe, the investments we made in \ntwo World Wars and the cold war has paid off so well. We now have \nformer Warsaw Pact nations, like Poland, like the Czech Republic and \nlike Hungary, waiting in line and finally being accepted as part of the \nNATO alliance. They are part of our alliance. We won. We are bringing \nEurope together. Our leadership makes a difference.\n  But, yes, in one corner of Europe, a terrible thing has occurred over \nthe last 12 years. A man by the name of Slobodan Milosevic has on four \nseparate occasions started a war in this region of Europe. If you look \nat the nature of the war, you will find some harrowing language from \nthis man.\n  Twelve years ago in Kosovo, he stood up to the Serbs and said, ``They \nwill not beat you again,'' and heard this roar of approval. This man, \nwho was a minor league Communist apparatchik, said, ``I have a rallying \ncry here. I can rally the Serbs in their hatred of other ethnic \ngroups.'' If you think I am overstating the case, in 1989, he went to \nKosovo, stood on a battlefield where a war had been fought in 1389 and \nthe Serbs had lost to the Ottoman Turks, and announced his policy of \nethnic cleansing. As a result of his policy, that region has been at \nwar and in turmoil ever since.\n  For those who act surprised at Slobodan Milosevic, merely look at the \nhistory. For those who question why we are there, look at the history \nof the 20th century. We have said that Europe is important to the \nUnited States, and we have said something else: America does not go to \nwar for territory or for treasure. We go to war for values. And the \nvalues at stake in this conflict are values that Americans can take at \nheart.\n  Some have said that President Clinton came up with Kosovo at the last \nminute. Yet, history tells us that as President George Bush left \noffice, knowing what Milosevic was all about, he left a letter behind \nto President Clinton saying: Watch Kosovo. We have warned Milosevic--do \nnot show your aggression toward the province of Kosovo. President \nGeorge Bush knew that. President Clinton was forewarned. And he has \ntried, with limited success, to contain this man's barbarism.\n  Of course, they raise the question over whether or not we should have \nstarted the bombing in the Serbian area and in Kosovo. I voted for it. \nI voted for it because there was no alternative, none whatsoever.\n  Many people have questioned the strategy ever since--important \nquestions, questions that should be answered. But at least we have the \nanswer to one question. When the United States saw this ethnic \ncleansing, this genocide in Serbia, did we stand idly by and do \nnothing? The answer is no, and that is an important answer.\n  We decided to use the resources at our disposal to try to stop \nMilosevic from what he was doing. Of course, he is equally adept and \nshould be recognized as a man of military means. He decided since he \ncould not invade the neighboring nations of Albania and Macedonia with \ntroops, he would overwhelm them with refugees.\n  Saturday, I spent the afternoon in a refugee camp in Macedonia, near \nSkopje, named Brazda. You read about it a lot. It is a camp that did \nnot exist 2 weeks ago, and 32,000 people live there today in that camp. \nThe day I came and the previous 2 days, 7,500 people had flooded into \nthis camp from Kosovo. These are not the poorest of the poor dragging \nthemselves in. These are teachers and businessmen. These are doctors \nand lawyers whose neighbors put on black ski masks and came to the door \nand said, ``Take everything\n\n[[Page S3896]]\n\nthat you want in your arms and leave in 5 minutes; we're blowing up \nyour house.'' You have heard it on television, but I heard it \nfirsthand.\n  Standing in that camp and talking to those people, I asked a simple \nopen-ended question: Why did you leave Kosovo? The stories came back \nthe same time and time again. They did not leave for a crime or \nwrongdoing; they left because of who they were, and that is the nature \nof genocide and ``geno-suffering.''\n  Now, of course, they are trying to survive, and we are helping them. \nThank God we are. NATO is building camps. The humanitarian relief from \naround the world is inspiring, and yet these people wait, wondering \nwhat their fate will be.\n  I came away from that experience understanding better the Holocaust, \nunderstanding what must have been in the minds of so many Jewish people \nat the end of World War II who said: We need Israel because we have \nnowhere to go. Everywhere we go, we have been persecuted, we have been \nkilled. Now the Kosovar refugees ask the same question: Where shall we \ngo?\n  Our policy is to allow them to return to Kosovo. That is where they \nwant to be. That is where they should be. We have said to Mr. \nMilosevic: Here is what we are asking of you, demanding of you: Remove \nyour troops from Kosovo, allow the refugees to return in safety with an \ninternational force to protect them, and then we will negotiate the \npolitical status.\n  I think that is sensible and humane.\n  May I say a word, too, about Russia. Yes, I am concerned about the \nreaction of Russia. It is important that Russia prosper and get \nstronger. We have helped in many ways and can do more, and I am sure we \nwill. But Russia is a master of its own destiny, too. If it decides it \nis better to be an ally of Slobodan Milosevic than an ally of the \nUnited States, then, of course, it is a decision they can freely make \nand one with which they will have to live.\n\n  I hope they do not make that decision. I hope instead of arming \nMilosevic so he can shoot down American and NATO planes that they will \ndecide they can play a more positive and constructive role; that Russia \ncould be part of the brokerage of peace, lasting peace in the region; \nthat Russia could provide some troops in an international peacekeeping \nforce in Kosovo so that it will be more acceptable to the Serbian side. \nThey can do that, and I hope that they will. But I think it is faulty \nlogic to argue that we should restrain our foreign policy for fear that \nthe Russians might react against it. Did we stop to ask the Russians \nwhether we should bomb Saddam Hussein? I certainly hope not. We knew \nwhat our national interest was, and we proceeded with it.\n  We hope the Russians will be with us, but they certainly should not \nhave a veto over our foreign policy.\n  Allow me, if you will, to speak for a moment about the state of our \nmilitary. General Wes Clark, who is our commander in chief now of the \nNATO operations in Kosovo, is an extraordinary man. He was first in his \nclass at West Point, a Rhodes scholar. He is articulate, dedicated, and \npatriotic. Thank God for him and people just like him who have \ndedicated their lives and service to our country.\n  He met with us at great length and answered literally every question \nwe had to ask about this operation. Is he frustrated? Of course, he is. \nThis is NATO's first war. America has fought wars before, but this is a \nwar by committee with 19 nations gathering together to talk of \nstrategy, and that is a frustration to any commander in chief. He \nunderstands our mission, and he is executing it professionally.\n  It troubles me to hear some of my friends on the other side of the \naisle suggest that after 25 days of bombing in Serbia and Kosovo \nsomehow or another the American military might has been decimated.\n  I sure did not see that, not at Aviano Air Base or Ramstein in \nGermany. I saw a strong military that needs our support. I do not \nbelieve it is in the weak condition that many of my colleagues are \nsuggesting.\n  The President said we need $6 billion to make sure it continues to be \nstrong. I hope we move on that quickly and we do not use this request \nby the administration as an excuse to get into a prolonged political \ndebate about whether or not the military has been treated well over the \nlast few years. Let us focus on the immediate needs: Supplying our \ntroops and making certain they can defend themselves and successfully \nprosecute this mission.\n  Let me also say that the Senator concluded with three recommendations \nabout refugees. I disagree with his conclusion that we move them to \nanother place. They want to return to Kosovo. They should return to \nKosovo. I agree with him in bringing Russia in for peace negotiations. \nAnd I certainly agree with his conclusion that we should not involve \nground troops in this effort.\n  I say to those who are witnessing this event, the American people are \nnow focusing more on it, as they should. My visit over the last 3 days, \nthis last weekend, focused my attention on it as well. I am proud of \nwhat the United States is doing. I am proud of what NATO is doing and \nwhat it stands for. I believe we are standing for values that we have \nstood for for at least the 20th century, if not longer.\n  I believe we can succeed. But we cannot succeed when a television \nprogram like ``Nightline,'' 7 days into the war, has a program entitled \n``The Kosovo Crisis: Still no end in sight.'' Seven days--7 days into \nthe war they want it over with, and all the political pundits are \ncoming on television on Sunday and saying, well, we must have lost that \nwar. It is a good thing they were not around during the Battle of the \nBulge. Who knows how that war might have ended? It is going to take \npatience and determination to bring this to a good conclusion. I hope \nMembers of both political parties will join together to make that \nhappen.\n  I will tell you, when there was a vote on the Persian Gulf war, \nPresident Bush came to Congress and asked for our approval. I voted \nagainst it. I did not think it was necessary. I thought we could \nachieve our goals without the use of the military. But I lost and the \nvote went against me; the military action was approved. Immediately \nafter that vote, a resolution was introduced, and passed overwhelmingly \non a bipartisan basis, that said the debate is behind us now, we are \nbehind our men and women in uniform, and we will stay behind them to \nthe end.\n  There will be plenty of time to debate this. History will be the \njudge of whether we did the right thing and did it in the right way. \nFor the time being, let us, as a nation, let those of us, as elected \nofficials in the Senate and the House, have the determination to stand \nbehind this policy.\n  What are our options? Well, there are three. We can stand behind this \npolicy of bombing, or we can leave, or we can send in ground troops. It \nis an easy choice for me. I am going to stand behind this policy, \nbecause the future of NATO is at stake, the future of Europe is at \nstake, and the values of the United States, that we have defended so \nlong, are at stake as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe Senator Lautenberg or perhaps \nother Senators will be here momentarily and will wish to comment on \nthis subject--perhaps even the Senator from South Carolina. I know \nSenator Abraham is prepared to begin the discussion.\n  For years we have talked about how we can set aside Social Security \nto come up with a process so Social Security cannot be used to make the \ndeficit look better or be spent for other programs or, for that matter, \nfor tax cuts. A lot of thought has been given to this. Efforts have \nbeen made by Senators on both sides of the aisle. I think what we have \nthis time is real. It will keep this money from being spent, without a \nsupermajority vote in the Senate, for other than defense. It is a clear \nstep in the right direction.\n  We need to be able to say to the American people that not one cent of \nSocial Security is going to be able to be spent on anything but Social \nSecurity. This lockbox will make it a lot more difficult, although \nunder emergency circumstances obviously that could still be pierced. \nThe key, though, is to lock this money up, make sure it is not \nfrittered away, and then see if we can come up with genuine long-term \nSocial Security reform so this money can be used for that. If it is \nnot, it will still be used, available to reduce the debt, and, over a \nperiod of years, that itself will be a significant benefit to the \ncountry, to the economy, to our seniors, and to the Social Security \nprogram.\n  So I commend Senator Abraham for his persistence on this issue, and I \nthink the best thing for us to do at this point is to get into a \ndiscussion about what we are trying to do here and see if we can get \nthis process through. This is a change in the law; this is not just a \nbudget process change. This is something the Senate would have to act \non, the House would have to act on, and we would have to send it to the \nPresident.\n  So I think it is time, and appropriate, now, that we have this \ndiscussion about the future of Social Security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for giving us \nan opportunity to begin this debate. I realize we have a number of \nMembers on various sides of this issue with different ideas. I think if \nwe have a discussion here, perhaps we can identify some of the concerns \nand address them. I hope we can because I think this is a topic that \nneeds to have our full attention.\n  Let me begin by saying I have just submitted an amendment here on \nbehalf of myself as well as Senators Domenici, Ashcroft, Lott, Nickles, \nMcCain, Frist, Crapo, Collins, and Grams. The amendment is the Social \nSecurity Preservation and Debt Reduction Act. It implements a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution which we approved as part of the budget \nresolution just before our Easter recess.\n  As you know, that sense-of-the-Senate resolution passed this Chamber \non March 24 by a vote of 99 to zero. It said simply that we ought to \ntruly protect Social Security by seeing to it that moneys in the Social \nSecurity trust fund are only used to fix Social Security or to pay down \nthe public debt, and for no other purpose.\n  We all agree that saving Social Security is our No. 1 priority in \nthis Congress. That has been a discussion that virtually every Member \nat one time or another has been part of. The President, in both his \n1998 and his 1999 State of the Union Addresses, said we should save \nevery penny of the Social Security surplus. In this year's Address, he \nsaid we should use it to reduce the Federal debt so as to ensure it \nwill not be squandered on other spending programs.\n  I agree with that. So do my cosponsors. Therefore, it is our hope, \nthrough this amendment we are offering today, to put into effect that \nwhich so many people, including the President, have sought to \naccomplish. If enacted into law, this amendment would save every penny \nof the Social Security surplus either to fix Social Security or to \nreduce the public debt.\n  Using hundreds of billions of dollars from the Social Security trust \nfund for new spending will not save Social Security. Indeed, the \nCongressional Budget Office now estimates that the President's own \nbudget, the one he submitted to us in February, spends $158 billion of \nthe Social Security surplus, 20 percent of the surplus that will be \ngenerated over the next 5 years. Fortunately, as you know, the Senate \ncharted a different course. Through our sense-of-the-Senate resolution, \n99 Senators stated our intention to lock up the Social Security trust \nfund to protect those dollars from being spent on other Government \nprograms.\n  Let me recount what this resolution, which we passed as part of the \nbudget, provided.\n  First, it provided we would place Social Security truly and fully off \nbudget.\n  Second, we pledged to create a subcategory of the current gross \nFederal debt limit; namely, debt held by the public.\n  Third, we pledged to mandate the reduction of that publicly held debt \nlevel by an amount equal to the Social Security trust fund surplus.\n  In addition, the limits could be adjusted one time to accommodate \nsubstantive Social Security reform. In other words, unless we were \nusing the Social Security trust fund surplus to fix Social Security, \nreform to modernize the Social Security system, then it would be used \nto reduce the current levels of Publicly held debt.\n\n  The amendment I am offering would implement those pledges. So let me \nbriefly run down its provisions.\n  The Social Security Surplus Preservation and Debt Reduction Act \nreaffirms that Social Security is off budget. That means its assets \nshould not be counted for purposes of the budget submitted by the \nPresident or the Congressional Budget Resolution. The legislation \nestablishes a simple majority point of order against any budget that \ndoes not count Social Security moneys. This amendment also codifies the \nbudget resolution language to establish a 60-vote Senate point of order \nagainst any budget resolution, budget amendment, or budget conference \nreport that runs a deficit unless that deficit results solely from \nSocial Security reform legislation.\n  Of critical importance is the amendment's provision establishing in \nlaw a declining limit on the amount of debt that could be held by the \npublic. This limit would be reduced in the year 2000, in the year 2001, \nand at 2-year intervals thereafter through the year 2009, by an amount \nequal to the entire Social Security trust fund surplus for each \ncorresponding time period. The amount would be measured as CBO's \ncurrent annual projections of the Social Security surplus for these \nsame years.\n  The 60-vote point of order would lie against any resolution or bill \nthat would exceed the publicly held debt limits. In other words, we \ncould not expand the publicly held debt unless we had 60 Members of \nthis Chamber who would make such a decision.\n\n[[Page S3898]]\n\n  However, these limits would be automatically adjusted for the cost of \nSocial Security reform, as I have mentioned, and/or for any changes in \nthe actual or projected Social Security trust fund surpluses.\n  Clearly, we are trying to read out the long period of time through \nthis legislation, a 10-year period. So if, as we move through that \nperiod, the size of the Social Security trust fund surplus were to be \nreadjusted or projected differently, then the legislation we are \noffering right now would provide the mechanism for making adjustments \nin that reduction of the publicly held debt accordingly.\n  A number of additional provisions would protect Social Security \nrecipients from unforeseen events. First, specific language in the \namendment states that the Secretary of the Treasury shall give priority \nto the payment of Social Security benefits required to be paid by law. \nThis amendment guarantees that Social Security benefits will have the \nhighest priority on all Federal moneys. We institute a concrete \nguarantee to seniors, and to those who one day will be seniors, that \ntheir benefits are truly backed up by the full faith and credit of the \nGovernment of the United States.\n  In addition, Mr. President, this amendment includes a provision that \nwould set aside the public debt reductions in the case of recession. \nWhenever the Commerce Department reports two consecutive quarters of \nless than 1 percent growth, the limits would be set aside until there \nis one full quarter of more than 1 percent real growth. Once \nreestablished, the limit would restart 6 months later at the level of \npublic debt held at the time of the recession's ending and then step \nback down at the rate projected by the newly determined Social \nSecurity surpluses.\n\n  Finally, this amendment includes an exception for emergencies such as \nthe current crisis in Kosovo.\n  On March 17 of this year, Treasury Secretary Rubin sent a letter \nexpressing several concerns about this approach. First, let me say that \nI was somewhat disappointed when he did so and surprised that he would \nraise the concerns about a bill that had not yet been written, let \nalone introduced. I appreciate the way Washington public policy debates \nwork, Mr. President, and I understand the Secretary of the Treasury \nwanted to, at a very early stage, express concerns. What we have tried \nto do is respond to those concerns in such a fashion, I hope, that the \nway we have crafted the amendment will satisfy some of the issues \nraised in his correspondence. Let me talk about a few of those \nconsiderations at this time.\n  First, Secretary Rubin in his letter commented that fiscal restraint \nis best exercised through the tools of the budget process; debt limits \nshould not be used as an additional means of imposing restraint. But \nthe last 2 years have clearly shown that current budget rules are \ninadequate to curb Washington's spending habits.\n  Last year, the President threatened to shut down the Government \nunless we spent $21 billion of the Social Security surplus through \nvarious so-called ``emergency'' spending declarations. There was a lot \nof debate as to whether or not some of those provisions truly were \nappropriately described as emergencies. This year, as I noted, the \nPresident proposed spending $158 billion of the Social Security surplus \non new spending programs over the next 5 years.\n  The budget rules, therefore, I do not believe are protecting the \nSocial Security surplus, and it is not just the President who has \nproposed ideas and ways by which these Social Security surplus dollars \ncan be spent. Members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle, have a \nlot of spending ideas, as we have heard.\n  In my judgment, the current budget rules do not protect these Social \nSecurity surplus dollars adequately. They are not designed for that \npurpose. Therefore, in my judgment, only by locking away the Social \nSecurity surplus and guaranteeing that the spenders cannot get ahold of \nit will we be able to protect those surplus dollars.\n  The fact of the matter is, if there is money available, people will \nfind a way to spend it under the current rules. I think that is very \nsimple and clear, and I think we should take additional steps to \naddress it. I do not think we can count, as the Secretary has \nindicated, on the existing rules to suffice.\n  Next, Secretary Rubin has raised the specter of default saying:\n\n       Even the appearance of a risk that the United States of \n     America might not meet its obligations because of the absence \n     of necessary debt authority would impose significant \n     additional costs on American taxpayers.\n\n  Mr. President, we should keep in mind that we currently have a debt \nceiling of $5.95 trillion. We live within a debt ceiling. We are not \ntalking about creating something out of whole cloth here, a limit on \nthe amount of indebtedness the American Government can assume. That is \nthe law, and the Treasury cannot issue more debt than that.\n  Further, current gross Federal debt is about $5.48 trillion. It is \nnot at the moment projected to rise significantly over the next 10 \nyears. There is no specter of failure to meet our obligations here.\n\n  I will note, however, that the CBO estimated that the President's \nproposals in his budget would raise gross Federal debt to almost $8.4 \ntrillion, almost $3.5 trillion over the current debt limit, exceeding \nthe current debt limit by nearly 40 percent. Therefore, using the \nSecretary's logic, the President's budget will place us in immediate \njeopardy of default because it will exceed the debt limits that we \nalready have in place.\n  Our proposal, on the other hand, simply creates a sublimit of our \ncurrent debt limit, one for debt held by the public. It does nothing to \nlimit our ability to meet our obligations.\n  Nonetheless, we have tried to take Secretary Rubin's concerns \nseriously. What we have done to try to address those concerns--and I \nwill elaborate on this a little bit further at a later point in these \nremarks--we have delayed the implementation of each year's new debt \nlimit by 7 months to ensure that they become effective when the \nTreasury is most flush with cash. This will establish a buffer that is \nmore than sufficient, in our judgment, to cover Treasury's short-term \ncash management needs, even during seasons of the year when cash \ndeficits have historically appeared.\n  Third, Secretary Rubin has expressed concern that the publicly held \ndebt limits ``could easily be inadequate for the Government to meet its \nobligations at a given point during the year. If the Treasury could not \nborrow or raise, it is possible that it could simply stop honoring any \npayment.'' And he even went on to say Social Security payments.\n  What he means by that, and it is related to the earlier point that I \njust addressed, is the fact that the revenue stream to the Government \ndoes not always coincide with the outflow of money during particular \npoints in the year. That is why, as I have mentioned, we have altered \nour original proposal to move the date at which these publicly held \ndebt ceiling changes would occur to a point--May 1--at which time, \nbased on the past 10 years, the Government has been most flush, has had \nthe largest inflow of money--obviously, it corresponds to some extent \nto tax payment day and other factors--for the exact purpose of making \nsure the changes would occur at a point when the Treasury would have \nthe most cash on hand and the greatest flexibility with respect to any \nobligations, it would seem to me.\n  In addition, we have placed into this amendment a legal declaration \nthat Social Security payments required by law have priority claims on \nthe U.S. Treasury. In other words, we try to do two things here that I \nthink address all of the concerns raised by Secretary Rubin.\n  First, we have changed the effective date as to when the debt limits \nwould be changed to meet the maximum point of revenue stream to the \nGovernment, thus giving him and his successors total flexibility with \nrespect to meeting obligations, and the guaranteed Social Security \nbenefit checks will be paid by ensuring in the language of the \namendment that they would receive top priority of expenditures.\n  In addition, we have responded to the Secretary's concern about \nshort-term cash management swings, as I say, with a 7-month delay of \nimplementation of the debt limits.\n  We are open to other ideas, but we are trying to be responsive to \nthose\n\n[[Page S3899]]\n\nconcerns that have been raised. That is our hope here, to try to \naddress anything that might serve as an impediment to anyone concerning \nthe support of this vitally needed legislation.\n\n  In addition, Secretary Rubin has worried that the proposed debt \nlimits could run the risk of worsening an economic downturn. We take \nthat to mean concerns that if a recession were occurring, we would be \nin a difficult position to adequately address it. Once again, we have \ntaken into account those concerns, and we have placed in our amendment \nlanguage, as I mentioned earlier, that would suspend the debt limits \nduring times of recession and reinstate them only after we have \nrecovered from such recession at the newly adjusted publicly held debt \nlevels.\n  Finally, the Secretary expressed concern that the lockbox does not \nallow for emergencies. Let me first observe that this administration's \nuse of the term ``emergency'' has been somewhat variable, and it would \ncertainly be the view of this Senator, and I know others, that it has \nbeen used to characterize a number of expenditures that are hard \npressed to be included under that definition, at least as I see it. We \nspent $21 billion of the Social Security surplus on an emergency \npackage at the end of the last Congress that certainly had provisions \nwhich did not, in my judgment, meet the normal definition of that term.\n  However, considering that we now have a 60-vote point of order \nagainst any nondefense emergency spending provisions as part of the \nbudget resolution that we passed, we have placed in this amendment \nlanguage to automatically adjust upwards the publicly held debt limits \nfor any emergency spending provisions. Thus, we once again address the \nconcern that was raised.\n  Mr. President, I believe this meets, therefore, every one of the \nserious concerns expressed by the Treasury Secretary, while at the same \ntime still meeting the central goal of protecting and preserving the \nSocial Security trust fund surpluses. It successfully addresses the No. \n1 issue of this Congress: Saving and strengthening Social Security.\n  While it may not constitute the long-term reform proposals that I \nknow will be further debated as the Congress moves ahead, it protects \nthe surpluses of the trust fund so they can be employed to make sure \nthat we modernize the Social Security system in a way that not only \nguarantees today's beneficiaries are able to receive what they are \nentitled to, but also the future beneficiaries will as well. We owe it \nto those who have reached retirement age, as well as those who will one \nday join them, to do this.\n  As recent events have shown, the only way to do that is to take \nSocial Security finally and fully off budget, because so long as Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses can be accessed by spending priorities, \nthey will be spent. In my judgment, it is that simple. It is simply too \neasy to point to good ideas and good programs and arguments of things \nthat can be done with large amounts of the American people's money, too \neasy to see the benefits of Federal spending without looking at the \ncost to our financial stability and to those who depend on a sound \nSocial Security system.\n\n  In my opinion, we must, in order to meet our obligations to the \nAmerican people, see to it that every penny of the Social Security \ntrust fund surplus is preserved for Social Security. And the only way \nto do that is to lock up those funds by using them to pay down the \npublic debt. I think it is the right thing to do.\n  President Clinton himself has endorsed the idea at the root of this \namendment. This Chamber recently voted unanimously for a resolution \ncalling for legislation of this sort. So I hope we can get together, as \ncolleagues, to take what would be the final step--this amendment--to \nplace Social Security surpluses above the risks that they will be \nsquandered and secure them for generations to come.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased, on behalf of a variety of colleagues, to \noffer this amendment. We look forward to the discussion. I hope that it \ncan encompass not just a discussion of this proposal as offered, but if \nMembers have ideas with respect to the lockbox, I hope they will share \nthem with us, because I think protecting the Social Security surplus \ndollars is something that we have an obligation to achieve in this \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am honored to cosponsor the Abraham-\nDomenici Social Security surplus preservation amendment. This amendment \nwill protect Social Security for millions of Americans who now receive \nits benefits and who now pay taxes hoping that they someday, too, will \nreceive Social Security.\n  I believe protecting Social Security is the highest priority we could \nhave in the Congress. Protecting Social Security means we must make \nsure the current surpluses that will be needed to pay benefits later \nare not used to pay for new budget deficits in the rest of government. \nThat is what this bill does. It is why I am for it, and it is why I \nurge swift passage of this legislation.\n  The legislation we are debating today logically follows and, in fact \nimplements, previous policy decisions that have been made by this \nCongress. Let's review a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that the Senate \npassed by an overwhelming 99-to-0 vote just 2 weeks ago. That \nresolution made these points:\n  No. 1, Congress and the President should balance the budget excluding \nsurpluses generated by the Social Security trust funds.\n  No. 2, reducing the Federal debt held by the public is a top national \npriority.\n  No. 3, the surpluses now held in the Social Security trust fund will \nreduce the debt held by the public by $1.7 trillion.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that President \nClinton's budget would spend $158 billion of Social Security surpluses \non new spending programs over the next 5 years. That is the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office. It simply says that the President's plan \nfor spending is to use the Social Security surplus to go out and spend \n$158 billion which would not otherwise be spent over the next 5 years.\n  Social Security surpluses should be used for retirement security, for \npayment of current benefits, or to reduce the debt, and should not be \nused for other purposes.\n  These mandates should be implemented in two ways:\n  First, by providing for a Senate supermajority point of order against \nany bill or resolution that would use Social Security surpluses on \nanything other than the payment of Social Security benefits.\n  Second, by establishing a supermajority point of order in the Senate \nagainst raising the limits established on the level of debt held by the \npublic. This resolution passed the Senate 99 to nothing. It passed \nunanimously. Not only did it pass unanimously, there was no dissenting \ndebate.\n  The conference report on the budget resolution which we passed last \nweek took the first steps necessary to protect Social Security by \nbalancing the budget without using the Social Security surpluses, and \nit established for the next 2 years a point of order against budget \nresolutions that use Social Security surpluses to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, I believe that is what we need to do. We need to \nbasically say that it is out of order to go back and take Social \nSecurity surpluses to cover deficits in other parts of government.\n  The amendment we have before us implements the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. It simply takes what we did 2 weeks ago and makes permanent \nthe Social Security protection measures that were included in the \nconference report. Specifically, this amendment accomplishes the \nfollowing:\n  No. 1, this amendment creates a 60-vote point of order against future \nbudget resolutions that use Social Security surpluses to balance the \nbudget. This provision makes the temporary point of order included in \nthe conference report permanent, and it is made a part of the law, not \njust part of the Senate and House rules on the budget. We simply would \nbe able to say that it is out\n\n[[Page S3900]]\n\nof order, it requires a supermajority setting aside or suspending the \nrules in order to devote the Social Security surplus to covering \ndeficits in other parts of the operations of government.\n\n  This provision is identical to legislation I introduced earlier this \nyear to protect Social Security. This amendment lowers the amount of \ndebt held by the public by amounts roughly equal to the Social Security \nsurpluses. So as you have a Social Security surplus, instead of \nspending it on new government, you use it to lower the amount of debt \nheld against this country.\n  The effect of this provision is twofold: It helps ensure that the \nSocial Security trust funds are not used to pay for aggressive spending \nprograms or for tax cuts; and, secondly, it reduces overall Federal \ndebt. By reducing debt, this amendment will strengthen our economy, \nstrengthen Social Security, and our capacity to meet our obligations to \nit in the future.\n  Reducing the public debt makes it easier for America to meet its \nSocial Security obligations in three ways. I think Speaker Hastert was \nmost eloquent about this. He said if you ever came into a surplus in \nyour own life--maybe a rich uncle died, left you $50, $60,000--and you \neither could spend it on a bunch of new spending or pay down the \nmortgage on your house, which would help you meet the challenges of the \nfuture better? It is pretty clear, not going to Las Vegas and taking a \nlot of vacations but paying down your debt, paying down your mortgage, \nwould be the best thing.\n  Over the long run, paying off the debt will lower interest payments, \nwhich are now over $200 billion annually. They equal about 15 percent \nof our budget now.\n  No. 2, they would ease the burden of the $3.8 trillion national debt, \nwhich would free up more resources to help us meet Social Security \nobligations in the future. Of course, No. 3, a debt-free America will \nhave a stronger, faster-growing economy and will be better equipped to \ncome up with the money to redeem the trust fund's IOUs when needed.\n  We cannot afford not to pay off the Federal debt. Federal debt incurs \nvery real costs in the form of interest payments and higher interest \nrates. Under President Clinton's proposed budget, $158 billion from the \nfiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2004 budget would be diverted from debt \nreduction and directed towards spending. According to the Senate Budget \nCommittee, that represents 21 percent of the Social Security surplus \nover that period. In fiscal year 2000 itself, it represents $40 \nbillion, or 30 percent of the surplus.\n  In contrast, our amendment would require us to reserve every penny, \nall of the Social Security surplus, for debt reduction. Under this \nplan, publicly held debt, which now stands at 44.3 percent of GDP, \nwould be reduced to 10.3 percent of GDP by the year 2009. That is a 70-\npercent reduction over just 10 years.\n  Once this amendment is adopted, the President and Congress will no \nlonger raid Social Security surpluses to pay for non-Social Security \nspending. This amendment would, therefore, protect Social Security at \nthe beginning and at the end of the budget process. At the front end, \nCongress could no longer pass budgets that use Social Security \nsurpluses. At the back end, the ratcheting down of the debt ceiling \nwould ensure that Social Security surpluses go to debt reduction, \nthereby helping to keep our financial house in order. A strong \nfinancial house for the United States of America is fundamentally the \nbest guarantee we can ever have that Social Security will be a house of \nintegrity itself.\n  One of the most important lessons a parent teaches a child is to be \nresponsible, responsible for his or her conduct and responsible for his \nor her money. America needs to be responsible with the people's money. \nThe debt reduction proposed by this amendment is among the greatest \ngifts we can give to our children, and it is a great gift for our \nseniors. Imagine what our children could do if we were able to provide \nfor them a next generation that is free, free to build their own dreams \ninstead of pay for our past.\n  In addition to protecting our children from debt, this amendment will \nalso protect the Social Security system from irresponsible government \nspending.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment, and I \nthank the Chair for this time on the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senators who have taken the \nfloor and spoken on behalf of this lockbox amendment.\n  I have worked for many years with a number of Senators, some of whom \nare on the floor--some on the other side, like Senator Hollings--in an \neffort to see what we could do to make it as difficult as humanly \npossible to spend Social Security trust fund money for other kinds of \nexpenditures of the Federal Government, be it programs, or be it tax \ncuts.\n  Frankly, I have heard it said on a number of occasions that the \nthings we tried to do heretofore were all process and didn't get the \njob done. I don't want to take credit for doing something \nextraordinary. But I will say this idea of tying the Social Security \ntrust fund to the debt held by the public over a 10-year period, and \nlimiting the amount of debt that can occur in each of those years for a \ndecade, which essentially is the current debt minus the amount of \nSocial Security trust fund subtracted each year from that debt--what is \nleft over, that residual is the debt held by the public. But I did, at \na committee hearing, for some reason come up with the idea that maybe \nthat is what we ought to do--tie it to a debt limit.\n  There will be plenty of people who will take the floor and say this \nis too rigid, this is too tough, this puts too big a shackle around the \nGovernment of the United States.\n  Let me tell you honestly. If you want to tell the seniors of America \nwe don't want to spend your Social Security money for programs, or tax \ncuts, or anything other than when we need it for you, we will use it \nfor you, then you ought to really be serious about it. You ought to say \nthat is what we are trying to do.\n  Obviously this is the first time that the rhetoric and the \ncontentions by Senators from both sides of the aisle that we ought to \nnot spend Social Security money has been reduced to a statute that, if \nit passes and is signed by the President, will govern for 10 years, \nwhether or not the United States can easily use trust fund money from \nSocial Security for other causes, other reasons, as just as they may \nbe. It will become very difficult when this legislation becomes law for \nus to ever again in a wholesale, willy-nilly manner spend Social \nSecurity trust fund money. In fact, every time you exceed that debt \nlimit, and even if you have 60 votes, you are going to have to tell the \nAmerican people we are exceeding it; we have 60 votes now. It is \nsomething very important, and people are going to be able to look and \nsee. Was it something very, very important, or are we back to business \nas usual?\n  That is the essence of this proposal.\n  When I was saying we talk a lot about it, let me say on the debate on \nthe budget resolution on the floor of this Senate--and the occupant of \nthe Chair helped, because he voted the right way, but on this vote it \nwas an easy vote because 99 Senators voted for it, as I recall. There \nwas a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, kind of the precursor to this \nbill that was adopted by the Senate. It was an Abraham-Domenici and \nothers sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  It did the following things:\n  One, it reaffirmed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 that \nSocial Security trust funds are off budget.\n  Second, it provides a Senate point of order against any budget \nresolution that violates that section of the Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act.\n\n  Third, it mandates that Social Security surpluses are used only for \nSocial Security, or reducing the public debt.\n  Fourth, it provides for a Senate supermajority vote on a point of \norder against any measure that would use Social Security surpluses for \nanything other than the payment of Social Security benefits, Social \nSecurity reform, or the reduction of the debt held by the public.\n  Fifth, it ensures that all Social Security benefits are paid on time.\n  Last, it accommodates Social Security reform legislation. That was \npassed 99-0.\n\n[[Page S3901]]\n\n  Mr. President, what happened was we attempted in that sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution to encapsulate what this legislation that is before \nus today did. It said that it is the sense of the Senate that we should \nadopt a bill that does all of these things. Now we have that bill \nbefore us.\n  So those who would now want to either unduly delay this vote, or say \nwe should not do it, or vote against it, no, it is not so easy to \nexplain that they just less than 10 days ago voted--2 weeks ago and a \nfew days--voted 99-0 to adopt legislation just like this.\n  I understand that there can be a lot of explaining between the \nlanguage and the statute--the language in this lockbox legislation.\n  Right off, I want to mention one thing. There are a number of \nSenators--I am hoping it is a minimum--within the next couple of days \nwho are going to cite the fact that our distinguished Secretary of the \nTreasury, Mr. Rubin, said some legislation that he had seen that was \nthe Domenici legislation on the lockbox wouldn't work mechanically, \nthat part of the year you don't get in a real strong flow of income \ntax, and later on you get in a big flow of income tax, and that maybe \nyou would not be able to control the expenditures and the need for cash \nduring those early days if in fact you had a very rigid year-long debt \nlimit.\n  We have done the best we can. We are open to suggestions to adjust to \nthat need for flexibility without altering the ultimate dollar number \nthat will be the debt held by the public.\n  Again, rather than use it to destroy this legislation, which it \nshould not do--I read the letter, and we can fix the concerns of the \nSecretary--if that is all the concerns the administration has, if that \nis all of them, we already fixed most of them right here. But if it is \nnot quite right, we welcome the legislative liaison from the Treasury \nor the White House to come and tell Mr. Rubin to tell us how to fix it \nbetter, just as long as it is understood that we don't want somebody \nfrom the administration saying that what we are really telling you is \ntoo tough, it is too rigid, it holds your feet to the fire too much, we \nought to have more flexibility in terms of why and for what purpose we \nshould use this Social Security surplus. If that is the reason the \nlegislation is bad, we want to suggest that we are at opposite ends of \nthe polls; for that is the reason we think it is good, because it is \nvery tough.\n  If you are going to throw away much of the Social Security funds in \nthe next decade instead of applying it to the debt of $1.8 trillion, it \nis not going to be easy, which means that Government is going to be \npretty much tied to a reasonable budget that does not spend the Social \nSecurity budget surplus over time over this decade.\n  For those who say, well, you know, there will be no money for this or \nthat or the other, maybe there won't, but maybe there will be because \nwe are not saying that surpluses that are not Social Security surpluses \nare subject to any kind of restriction. They are subject to what \nCongress wants to do and what a President recommends.\n  So if there are surpluses that do not belong to them--and there is a \nvery large chunk of surplus now that doesn't belong to Social \nSecurity--we are not trying to limit that. We Republicans think most of \nthat should go back to the public in tax cuts, but that is a year-long \nbattle with the President and others. That is not Social Security \nmoney.\n  Mr. President, that same sense-of-the-Senate language that I told you \nabout that was adopted in the budget resolution in its final form, \nafter it got 99 votes freestanding, it was adopted by a vote of 54-44 \nwhen the budget resolution was adopted.\n  When 99 people vote and tell the Senate what we should do, and then \nwe do it, it would seem to me that it ought to be a rather simple \nproposition that we ought to do it, tell the public we meant what we \nsaid, and get on with making sure we find other ways to take care of \nour governmental needs, but not the Social Security trust fund for the \nnext decade.\n  Unless the Senate and the sense-of-the-Senate resolution was \nmeaningless, this statute should get rather broad-based support, it \nseems to this Senator.\n  Let me speak from the standpoint of what could be better for America \nthan us doing this. I can think of hardly anything that could be better \nfor America, not just for the seniors, better for America. Mr. \nPresident, $1.8 trillion during the next decade, and I truly believe \nthat if this statute is adopted it will be perilously close to $1.8 \ntrillion, that will be cut from the national debt.\n\n  That is an incredible number. Senator Ashcroft just told us how big \nit is, in terms of percentage of our gross national product. But $1.8 \ntrillion of public debt during this decade will be wiped clean and \nthere will be no public debt against that $1.8 trillion because the \nsurplus of Social Security money will be there, only to be used for \nmajor reform for Social Security if, in fact, that occurs during this \ndecade.\n  Why is that good? If you asked almost every rational, reasonable, \nmainstream American economist from Alan Greenspan to that long list \nthat said the President was doing good things in reducing the debt, you \nask them if reducing the debt by $1.8 trillion is not a very positive \nthing for our economy and they will all say: The best thing to use \nsurplus for is debt reduction. Because that means we borrow less. In a \nvery interesting way it means we save more, because if you were to \nspend it, you would have to be borrowing to take its place. And if you \ndo not borrow, you are saving. Since we individually save little, it is \nvery good, starting into the new millennium and the first few years, \nthat we have a low debt with low borrowing which may very well keep the \nAmerican economy moving ahead, strong, powerful, with lower interest \nrates.\n  What could be better for America? Nothing. What could be better for \nseniors? Nothing--other than a reformed Social Security program that \nwas in existence for 75 years with no problems. And, frankly, an \nappropriate plan might use this surplus in transition for that and we \nmight get that out of this also.\n  Why else is it good for seniors? Did anybody hear the President go to \nthe Rose Garden when he got a statement from the trustees of Social \nSecurity and Medicare the other day and announce to America that things \nwere looking better for Medicare and Social Security? I believe there \nwas an announcement that we added 8 years to the longevity of the trust \nfund for Medicare. And we did not do a thing. We just continued to have \na prospering American economy. So one can say seniors should want a \nprospering American economy more than anyone else in this society, \nbecause a prospering American economy, with high employment and low \nunemployment, is the best medicine for the Social Security trust fund \nand Medicare trust fund of anything, any set of activities we could do \nas American people, as business people, and as American taxpayers and \nworkers, producing goods and services in this very vibrant and powerful \neconomy.\n  So, when you look at that, this may just be, in some people's minds, \nsome small approach to making the case that we are trying to save \nSocial Security trust fund money from being spent arbitrarily for \nthings that are not Social Security. It is more than that. It is a \ncombination of things that I just described, including the very \npositive result of greatly reducing the national debt while we wait to \nsee what is needed for Social Security reform; a very, very positive \npiece of legislation.\n  It is important to allow the Federal Government maximum flexibility \nin times of low growth or recession. The Federal budget is one of the \nmost important economic policy tools we have. In fact, we have \nprocedures in place which allow us to suspend our budgetary enforcement \nrules during such times.\n  This legislation contains a low-growth, recession trigger as well. If \nthe Department of Commerce reports two consecutive quarters of real \neconomic growth of less than 1 percent, the limit of debt held by the \npublic is suspended. The current law statutory debt limit would still \nbe in place.\n  The limit on debt held by the public is suspended until the Commerce \nDepartment issues a final GDP report indicating that the level of real \nGDP has risen back to its level prior to the low growth or recession \nperiod. The limit on debt held by the public is restored at its actual \nlevel (at the time the Commerce Department report is issued that de-\ntriggers the suspension.)\n\n[[Page S3902]]\n\n  The limit on debt held by the public then begins to decline at the \nsame rate that it would have had the suspension not been triggered.\n  Mr. President, the Act is effective for 10 years and then sunsets. \nThis is the same time period covered by the recently adopted concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2000--H. Con. Res. 68. It is a \nperiod of time in which the Social Security trust fund balances are \nexpected to grow by nearly $1.8 trillion. These balances would retire \ndebt held by the public which would help prepare the country for the \nretirement of the baby boom generation early in the next century. It \nreaffirms off-budget treatment of the social security program.\n  The act reaffirms current law that the receipts and disbursements of \nthe Social Security trust funds shall not be counted for the purposes \nof the Federal budget submitted to Congress by the President or any \ncongressional budget.\n  The act creates a new Budget Act point of order against Congress \nadopting a budget that uses social security surpluses to achieve \nbalance, and requires the President to submit a budget that does the \nsame. It uses the Social Security surplus to reduce the debt held by \nthe public. The act establishes a new enforceable limit on the amount \nof debt held by the public over the period from 2000 to 2010. These \ndebt limits specified in the act are current estimates of the level of \nborrowing from the public over this period that result from the Social \nSecurity surplus only being used to retire debt. The surplus could not \nbe used for non-Social Security spending or tax cuts. Legislation \nincreasing these limits would require a super-majority vote in the \nSenate.\n  The act establishes the first limit becomes effective as of May 1, \n2000, and effectively ratchets down this limit May 1 and periodically \nthereafter. The effective date accommodates Treasury Department's \nFederal cash management responsibilities. The newly established debt \nheld by the public limits would not disrupt the cash management \noperations of the Bureau of the Public Debt nor would it jeopardize \nSocial Security benefit payments.\n  The limits follows:\n  May 1, 2000 through April 30, 2001, $3.628 trillion;\n  May 1, 2001 through April 30, 2002, $3.512 trillion;\n  May 1, 2002 through April 30, 2004, $3.383 trillion;\n  May 1, 2004 through April 30, 2006, $3.100 trillion;\n  May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2008, $2.775 trillion; and\n  May 1, 2008 through April 30, 2010, $2.404 trillion.\n  There are adjustments to Limits for Social Security reform, \nrecessions, emergencies and war. Social Security reform--the Act \nauthorizes adjustments to the limits established for legislation \nenacted that reforms Social Security during this time period. If Social \nSecurity reform legislation is enacted, and if that legislation has the \neffect of changing the debt held by the public specified in this act, \nthen the Secretary of the Treasury shall adjust the limits in this act \nto reflect those changes.\n  Recessions--the provisions of this act are suspended during a period \nof low economic growth. Two consecutive quarters of less than 1 percent \nreal economic growth would automatically make the debt limits in this \nact inoperative. After the recession has ended, the act would reinstate \nnew debt limit levels adjusted for the impact of the recession.\n  Emergencies--the act also provides for an automatic adjustment to the \ndebt limit levels specified if, after the adoption of this act, the \nCongress enacts into law ``emergency'' spending defined under the \nBalanced Budget Act. If emergency spending uses a non-Social Security \nsurplus, then no adjustment to the limits would be necessary. If, \nhowever, emergency spending requires the usage of Social Security \nsurpluses, then the limits specified in the act would be adjusted for \nthat amount.\n  Declaration of war--the act would be suspended upon Congress enacting \na declaration of war.\n  I want to suggest there are those who wonder what we will do if we \nhave a recession. I provided in this a triggering mechanism. If there \nis anybody who would like to improve upon it, I welcome it. But it says \nyou have a recession if you have two consecutive quarters of \nsignificant downturn in the economy, in which event you may very well \nbe dramatically impacting upon the tax take of the country. In that \ncase you may, indeed, trigger a halt to the reduction, the constant \nreduction of the debt limit. And you may leave it in place until you \nget into a recovery mode and then set it back on its trendline toward \ntotal elimination of the $1.8 trillion.\n  In addition, you will find some language in it regarding war, or \nregarding substantial moneys being needed for our military. Those may \noccur from time to time and we would not want people to say this is \nmaking it impossible to fund that, even though holding it is a good \nthing. It might be that you would want to use it for those kinds of \nthings, and there is a provision permitting us to do that.\n  When you add it all up, I think we have been considerate of the \nproblems associated with trying to truly lock this money in and that we \nhave a good bill. We hope we get some support from the Democratic side \nbefore we are finished, and we stand ready to debate it. I hope our \nleader stands ready to debate it as long as necessary for us to get an \nup-or-down vote and see just where we all stand so our people will \nunderstand our position when the legislation appears, rather than when \nwe have a sense of the Senate that we ought to do this. Let's see what \nhappens on the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me first respond to our \ndistinguished budget chairman by reading a letter addressed to our \ndistinguished minority leader by the Secretary of the Treasury, Robert \nRubin. It is dated March 17, 1999.\n\n       Dear Tom: Thank you for inquiring about the impact of the \n     new debt limits contained in the Social Security Surplus \n     Preservation Act. I appreciate the opportunity to respond to \n     your question. In brief, I am deeply concerned that these \n     limits could preclude the United States from meeting its \n     future financial obligations to repay maturing debt and to \n     honor payments--including benefit payments--and could also \n     run the risk of worsening a future economic downturn.\n       It has been this Administration's view that fiscal \n     restraint is best exercised through the tools of the budget \n     process. Existing enforcement tools such as the pay-go rules \n     and the discretionary spending limits in the Budget \n     Enforcement Act have been key elements in maintaining fiscal \n     discipline in the 1990's Debt limits should not be used as an \n     additional means of imposing restraint. Debt is incurred \n     solely to pay expenditures that have previously been \n     authorized by the Congress and for the investment of the \n     Federal trust funds. By the time the debt limit is reached, \n     the Government is obligated to make payments and must have \n     enough money to do so.\n       If Treasury were prohibited from issuing any new debt to \n     honor the Government's obligations, there could be permanent \n     damage to our credit standing. The debt obligations of the \n     United States are recognized as having the least credit risk \n     of any investment in the world. That credit standing is a \n     precious asset of the American people. Even the appearance of \n     a risk that the United States of America might not meet its \n     obligations because of the absence of necessary debt \n     authority would be likely to impose significant additional \n     costs on American taxpayers. Yet, in November 1995, a debt \n     crisis was precipitated when Government borrowing reached the \n     debt limit and in January Moody's credit rating service \n     placed Treasury securities on review for possible downgrade.\n       As you know, there is currently a statutory limit on the \n     amount of money that Treasury can borrow in total from both \n     the public and from Federal trust funds. The proposed \n     ``lockbox'' provision would add a new statutory limit on debt \n     to the public.\n       The proposed new debt limit runs the risk of precipitating \n     additional debt crises in the future. Although the proposal \n     adjusts the debt ceiling for discrepancies between the actual \n     and projected Social Security surpluses, it does not make \n     similar corrections for unanticipated developments on the \n     non-Social Security side of the budget. While our \n     forecasts have been conservative, the current forecast of \n     the non-Social Security budget could prove too optimistic \n     because of changes in the economy, demographics, or \n     countless other factors. This could cause the publicly \n     held debt to exceed the new debt limit.\n       Furthermore, even if the debt limit appears sufficient \n     because if covers the annual debt level--measured from end-\n     of-year to end-of-year--it could easily be inadequate for the \n     Government to meet its obligations at a given point during \n     the year. Under normal circumstances, every business day, \n     Treasury makes payments--including Social Security payments \n     on certain days. In any given week, Treasury receives \n     revenues, makes payments, and refinances maturing\n\n[[Page S3903]]\n\n     debt. Weekly and monthly swings in cash flow can easily \n     exceed on-hand cash balances. When this occurs, Treasury then \n     borrows from the public to meet its obligations. If the \n     amount of publicly held debt were to reach the level of the \n     debt limit--or if the debt limit were to decline to below the \n     level of publicly held debt--Treasury could be precluded from \n     borrowing additional amounts from the public. If Treasury \n     could not borrow to raise cash, it is possible that it could \n     simply have to stop honoring any payments--including Social \n     Security payments.\n       In this case, Treasury could be prohibited from issuing any \n     new debt to redeem maturing debt. Every Thursday, \n     approximately $20-23 billion of weekly Treasury bills mature \n     and, every month, an additional $60-85 billion in debt \n     matures. These securities must either be paid off in cash or \n     refinanced by issuing new debt. Treasury could be put in the \n     position of having to default for the first time in our \n     nation's history.\n       Congress could defuse the debt limit problems by \n     immediately voting to raise the debt ceiling. Under the \n     ``lockbox'' proposal, however, it would take sixty votes in \n     the Senate to do so. As past experience indicates, obtaining \n     a super-majority for this purpose is often time-consuming and \n     difficult. Moreover, this requirement would greatly enhance \n     the power of a determined minority to use the debt limit to \n     impose their views on unrelated issues.\n       Finally, the proposed debt limits could run the risk of \n     worsening an economic downturn. If the economy were to slow \n     unexpectedly, the budget balance would worsen. Absent a \n     super-majority vote to raise the debt limit, Congress would \n     need to reduce other spending or raise taxes. Either cutting \n     spending or raising taxes in a slowing economy could \n     aggravate the economic slowdown and substantially raise the \n     risk of a significant recession. And even those measures \n     would not guarantee that the debt limit would be not be \n     exceeded. A deepening recession would add further to revenue \n     losses and increases in outlays. The tax increases and \n     spending cuts could turn out to be inadequate to satisfy all \n     existing payment obligations and keep the debt under the \n     limit, worsening a crisis.\n       To summarize, these new debt limits could create \n     uncertainty about the Federal government's ability to honor \n     its future obligations and should not be used as a instrument \n     of fiscal policy. While we certainly share the goal of \n     preserving Social Security, this legislation does nothing to \n     extend the solvency of the Social Security trust funds, while \n     potentially threatening the ability to make Social Security \n     payments to millions of Americans. I will recommend that the \n     President veto the bill if it contains the debt limit \n     provisions. If you have any additional questions, please do \n     not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert E. Rubin.\n\n  t(Mr. DOMENICI assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the interesting thing to this Senator, \nof course, is the date, March 17. Nothing has changed. We knew that the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee and his colleagues would \nbe conspiring, as they have delayed us this afternoon to get the exact \nright conspiracy. To do what? To eliminate President Clinton's budget, \non the one hand, and to engage in a charade or fraud, on the other \nhand, to make the Members, and particularly the media that covers this \nthing, see the perception is the reality. They are still talking \nsurplus, surplus, surplus, surplus when we pointed out time and time \nand time again there is no surplus. We are spending $100 billion more \nthan we are taking in. But this is to get everybody to think there is \nsome change.\n  All you have to do is read the distinguished chairman's summary of \nthe Social Security Surplus Preservation and Debt Reduction Act, \nsummary of amendment, April 20, 1999. This is 1 month later. The \ndistinguished Secretary of the Treasury foresaw this amendment. There \nis nothing complicated about it except its wording and rewording of the \nstatutory provisions of 13301 and many, many other provisions, to \nmislead, as if it were really doing something.\n  But, 2, ``Uses Social Security surplus to reduce the debt held by the \npublic.''\n  Mr. President, we have been doing that for years and years on end. \nThat is what we call the unified--there it is--the unified deficit. \nThat is when they use the Social Security surplus. We have this chart. \nWe have been using this for years.\n  As a former chairman of the Budget Committee--I speak advisedly, not \npolitically--I have been trying my dead level best to do what the \nchairman in this amendment proposes to do, but it is the same act, the \nsame scene, because in 1968 President Lyndon Baines Johnson brought \nabout a merging of the Social Security trust fund with general funds of \nthe U.S. Government so we could then talk about a unified deficit with \ntrust funds. Therefore, you could get a surplus rather than a deficit.\n  The truth of the matter is, the trust fund surplus from Social \nSecurity is $126 billion. You use Social Security trust funds and you \ncontinue to do so.\n  They say pay down the public debt. Let me get into that paying down \nthe public debt, like it is something other than the national debt. I \nam in my 33rd year, and the real problem is to really try to stop \nincreasing the national debt and to pay down the national debt.\n  When we say pay down the debt, do not give monkeyshines of paying \ndown public debt, thereby increasing Social Security debt. The \ndistinguished Senator from Missouri said just a minute ago, if you \ninherited money, rather than going off to Las Vegas you ought to pay \noff your home mortgage. This does not pay off the home mortgage. This \ndoes not pay down the national debt. It just levels off and obscures \nthe true size of the national debt, whereby we are thinking we are \nreducing the public debt and we are paying our bills. Not at all.\n  (Mr. SMITH of Oregon assumed the chair.)\n  Let's assume, Mr. President, individually I had two credit cards, I \nhad a MasterCard and I had a Visa card, and I got in a big bill from \nMasterCard, and I said, ``Well, I'll take care of that crowd. They've \nbeen bringing a lot of pressure on me, so I will just take the Visa \ncard and pay off the MasterCard.'' I still owe that much more money. I \nhave just transferred it from MasterCard to Visa. In this case, I am \njust transferring it from public debt to Social Security. I am using, \nborrowing, spending--ah, spending--the Social Security moneys to pay \ndown the public debt.\n  That is all this amendment says, and that is what we have been doing \nsince 1968. But on this long sheet here of--how many pages are here? It \nis a 17-page amendment, with all these facts and figures. You can find \nthe triggering mechanism on page 10, when they say, ``After the \nSecretary determines the actual level for the social security surplus \nfor the current year, the Secretary shall take the estimated level of \nthe social security surplus for that year specified in paragraph (1) \nand subtract that actual level.'' And when you subtract that level, you \nbring down the public debt. That is the triggering mechanism. The \namendment has 17 pages, and you will find it on page 10. The debt goes \nup, up, and away.\n  Mr. President, I had to go to the Congressional Budget Office and ask \nfor the trust fund balances. As of February 1999--I have not gotten it \nfor March yet. Let me give you the Congressional Budget Office figures \nhere of what we owe Social Security. That is something you ought to \nremember, that there isn't any Social Security surplus. Yes, each \nfiscal year there has been for several years, because we really bring \nin more than what we have to pay out that particular year. But having \nspent it, having been paying down the public debt, we have been \nspending the Social Security money.\n  So Social Security, as of 1998, $730 billion in the red; 1999, $857 \nbillion. These are CBO figures. These are shockers--shockers--to you, \nbecause I am reading out how we are increasing the debt, not paying it \ndown.\n  We are the board of directors of the Government. We are not stock \nanalysts up on Wall Street hoping that the Government does not come in \nwith its sharp elbows, borrowing to pay its bills, running up interest \nrates, perhaps causing inflation, crowding out corporate finance.\n  So you will find that the financial community and the Greenspans--oh, \nthey love this ``pay down the public debt.'' They are not elected to \noffice. We are elected as the trustees of the fiscal condition of the \nU.S. Government.\n  Here is the most important program we have domestically, the Social \nSecurity program. And in 1998, $730 billion in the red; in 1999, it is \nprojected to be $857 billion; in 2000, $994 billion; in 2001, $1.139 \ntrillion; and in the year 2002, under current policy, paying down the \npublic debt, $1.292 trillion; in 2003, $1.453 trillion; in 2004, $1.624 \ntrillion; in 2005, $1.808 trillion, in 2006, $2.001 trillion; in 2007, \n$2.205 trillion. And at the end of the 10-year period this particular \namendment contemplates, in the year 2008, we will owe, paying down\n\n[[Page S3904]]\n\nthe public debt and increasing the Social Security debt, $2.417 \ntrillion.\n  Now, come on. When you need the money to make the payments, when you \ncan't just depend on the interest cost in 2013, at the end of the year \nin 2012, you are going to have to start borrowing money. And in 2034 \nyou will be outright broke and you will owe nearly $4.5 trillion--\nalmost $5 trillion.\n\n  Who would want to be Senators running for reelection? Who would want \nto get elected to that mess? All you can do is cut down all the \nprograms and raise taxes, unless you can get away with this fraud that \nis going on.\n  I use the word ``fraud'' advisedly. We learned, as freshmen in law \nschool, that it had to be false, and it was intended to be false, and \nintended to deceive, that it was relied upon, it did cause damage, and \nthe damage was the proximate cause. This particular amendment is \nknowingly with intent to deceive. It is a fraud. It does not change a \nthing.\n  We have been paying down the public debt with Social Security money, \nand we are running up Social Security's debt, sticking it more and more \nand more in the red, all under, ``We're going to save Social Security \n100 percent. It is going to be spent on only Social Security''--\nabsolutely false. When you pay down the public debt, that debt could \nhave been caused by defense, Kosovo, it could have been caused by food \nstamps, it could be caused by foreign aid or Lawrence Welk's home--I \nremember when we appropriated money for Lawrence's home--it could be \nanything.\n  So when you are paying down the debt, as it says right here on the \nface of the handout by the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee--and I read, again, ``uses the Social Security surplus to \nreduce the debt held by the public''--the debt held by the public is \ncumulative with every and any amount of different expenditures. So it \nhas more to be spent on every and any thing but Social Security, all \nthe time saying they are saving Social Security.\n  Let me make absolutely clear about this fiscal condition that we are \nin, because we have a cancer; we have fiscal cancer.\n  Mr. President, I have a good friend over on the House side, the \nchairman of the Transportation Committee, Mr. Shuster.  And he is \nfinally going to spend some highway moneys on highways. Bless him. I am \n100 percent for him, because I have been in this game now ever since we \nstarted the budget process in 1973, 1974, with Senator Muskie. I have \nbeen the chairman of the committee.\n  But here are the trust funds. The Secretary of Treasury refers to \ntrust funds. Somebody will say, they are not trusts, but they are \nsupposed to be. ``For the investment of Federal trust funds'' is the \nexpression used by Secretary Rubin. I am using the same expression: \n``Trust fund looted to balance the budget.''\n  In 1999, here is what we owe Social Security: $857 billion; Medicare, \nwe got $129 billion for the HI portion of Medicare and 39 billion for \nthe SMI portion; for military retirement, $141 billion; for civilian \nretirement, we owe $490 billion--that is civil service employees; they \nought to know it; it is going up--unemployment compensation fund, $79 \nbillion; highway moneys, $25 billion; airport moneys, $11 billion; \nrailroad retirement, $23 billion; and ``other,'' like the Federal \nFinance Bank, $57 billion. So we owe our trust funds $1.851 trillion.\n  By this 5-year period, at the end of 2004, we will owe $2.954 \ntrillion under current policy, and the amendment of the Senator that \nhas just been put in by the majority leader--I wasn't here when it was \nintroduced, but I understood he was going to put it in or the chairman \nof the Budget Committee--the one under consideration, in 5 years, we \nwill owe $3 trillion to all of the particular trust funds. And the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas came down to the floor of the Senate, \nand this is a quote of what he said on April 15:\n\n       I believe that this is an excellent budget. I think, \n     looking at the whole package, it is the finest budget \n     presented in America in the 20 years that I have served in \n     Congress.\n\n  Do you know what it does, Mr. President? It just breaks all the \ndiscipline, the little discipline that we do have that has been in the \npay-go rules. So once we settle out, then any amendment that came in, \nyou had to have an offset.\n  Here is what they do in the conference report so that they can go \nahead with tax cuts and anything else they want. Of course, the \nmanifest intent is to do away with Social Security, privatize it. In \norder to privatize it under Milton Friedman's plan, you need what? You \nneed these surpluses. You need the $1.8 or the $2 trillion or, if you \ndo it in the year 2004, you will need $3 trillion. So you will need \nthese surpluses.\n  Here's how you get them. Section 202 of this budget--here is the \nconference report on the budget:\n\n       Whenever the Committee on Ways and Means of the House or \n     the Committee on Finance of the Senate reports a bill or an \n     amendment thereto is offered or a conference report thereon \n     is submitted that enhances retirement security through \n     structural programmatic reform, the appropriate chairman of \n     the Committee on the Budget may, one, increase the \n     appropriate allocations and aggregates of new budget \n     authority and outlays for the amount of new budget authority \n     provided by such measure and outlays flowing therefrom for \n     that purpose. Two, in the Senate, adjust the levels used for \n     determining compliance with the pay-as-you-go requirements of \n     section 207. And, three, reduce the revenue aggregates by the \n     amount of the revenue loss resulting from that measure for \n     that purpose.\n\n  There go your tax cuts.\n  What does this mean? It means what the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee says. Whenever the Committee on Ways and Means of the \nHouse or the Committee on Finance reports a bill, an amendment thereto, \nthe chairman can decide, the appropriate chairman of the Committee on \nthe Budget, he can tell you what that means; it means what he says.\n  I am speaking as seriously as I know how. I have never seen the \nextreme of the shenanigans and the maneuvers and the misleads and the \nfraud going on politically, all to get by the next election, \nspecifically using Social Security trust funds.\n  Let's go back, Mr. President, to the Greenspan Commission. The \nGreenspan Commission, in 1983, said we are going to institute this \npayroll tax; namely, the 6.2 percent, the payroll by the employer, and \n6.2 percent by the employee, for 12.4 percent. And we know that is a \nhigh payroll tax. But we are putting that in to take care of the baby \nboomers in the next generation. That is why it was put in that way.\n  And to make sure that it was set aside, section 21, Mr. President, \nprovided just exactly that. It provided that it be set aside and that--\nif I can find that section, I will show it to you, section 21. It said \nremove Social Security from the unified budget. That has been the on-\nbudget, off-budget, unified and all that, un-unified, private debt, \npublic debt, trust fund debt, everything else--it is just one account. \nBut I will read section 21:\n\n       A majority of the members of the National Commission \n     recommends that the operations of the OASI, DI, HI and SMI \n     Trust Funds should be removed from the unified budget.\n\n  It took this Senator on the Budget Committee almost 7 years before I \ncould finally get it reported out of the Budget Committee, that \nparticular provision.\n  I ask unanimous consent that section 21 of the Greenspan Commission \nreport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, section 21 was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                 social security and the unified budget\n\n       (21) A majority of the members of the National Commission \n     recommends that the operations of the OASI, DI, HI, and SMI \n     Trust Funds should be removed from the unified budget. Some \n     of those who do not support this recommendation believe that \n     the situation would be adequately handled if the operations \n     of the Social Security program were displayed within the \n     present unified Federal budget as a separate budget function, \n     apart from other income security programs.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair.\n  I think we have in here section 13301. I ask unanimous consent that \nwe print in the Record at this point section 13301 of the Budget \nEnforcement Act.\n  There being no objection, section 13301 was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SEC. 13301. OFF-BUDGET STATUS OF OASDI TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Social Security From all Budgets.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n\n[[Page S3905]]\n\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (b) Exclusion of Social Security From Congressional \n     Budget.--Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The \n     concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and \n     revenue totals of the old age, survivors, and disability \n     insurance program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection or in any . . .''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. I will read \n``Exclusion'':\n\n       Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is \n     amended by adding at the end the following: ``The concurrent \n     resolution shall not include the outlays and revenue totals \n     of the old age, survivors and, disability insurance program \n     established under title II of the Social Security Act or the \n     related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.''\n\n  And it goes on in paragraph (a) saying that the Social Security trust \nfund\n\n     . . . shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of the budget \n     of--(1) the budget of the United States Government as \n     submitted by the President, (2) the congressional budget, or \n     (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act.\n\n  Now, true it is, the amendment reiterates that particular section. \nBut that has been in the disabuse, the disavowal, the violation thereof \never since 1990, when President Bush signed it into law on November 5 \nof that particular year. And this particular amendment continues to put \nit within the unified by paying it down.\n  Now, that has been the big problem all along. And so at the beginning \nof the year, when I fortunately began to hear music to my ears that \nboth the White House and congressional leaders on both sides were \nsaying again and again that they were going to save Social Security, I \ngot with my friend Ken Apfel, who used to work for the Budget Committee \nand is the Administrator of Social Security today, and, as a result, we \nintroduced S. 605, a bill to solidify the off-budget status of the Old \nAge Survivors and Disability Insurance Program under title II of the \nSocial Security Act and to protect program assets. Let me read section \n5:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law throughout each \n     month that begins after October 1st, 1999, the Secretary of \n     the Treasury shall maintain in a secure repository or \n     repositories cash in a total amount equal to the total \n     redemption value of all obligations issued to the Federal old \n     age and survivors insurance trust fund and the Federal \n     disability insurance trust fund pursuant to section 201(d) of \n     the Social Security Act that are outstanding on the first day \n     of such month.\n\n  Mr. President, that really puts it into a lockbox. It is in the \nBudget Committee. I have asked the chairman to let us bring it up. I \nwould be delighted to have hearings on it. We would give anything to \nhave a vote on it, but they have filled up the tree so I can't put it \nin as an amendment here. Maybe we can get it at the end of the so-\ncalled cloture vote and put it in when we get an up-or-down vote on \nthis.\n  But section 201(d) requires the Social Security Administration to \ninvest in Treasury bills, Government securities. Necessarily, they get \nthe IOU and the Government gets the money. But if you immediately \ntransfer an equal amount of money back to a trust fund in Treasury, as \nsection 5 requires, then you have the lockbox where the money is only \nexpended for Social Security purposes.\n  Now, this has been drawn with the assistance of the Social Security \nAdministration. And some of my colleagues, when I showed it to them, \nthey said: Wait a minute, that's what you are going to do. What you are \ngoing to do with the money is, you do exactly with the money as you did \nbetween the years 1935 and 1968 before you started this monkeyshine of \na unified budget, spending all of the Social Security trust funds. That \nis what happens. You keep it right over there and it gets the highest \namount permissible by law under T bills today, which this year in \ninterest will be $48 to $50 billion in interest that it earns.\n  This money is supposed to be earning, on the one hand, and kept in \ntrust, those earnings, and the total fund on the other hand. Instead, \nwe are spending the interest and the fund itself. We are breaking \nSocial Security, and coming out here baldfaced and saying we all want \nto save Social Security, and not one red cent is going to be spent on \nany other than Social Security. It is one grand fraud.\n  Mr. President, let me just emphasis, since I have the page turned \nhere on public debt and private debt, or gross Federal debt--I am \nreferring to an analysis of the President's budgetary proposals for \nfiscal year 2000. I asked CBO, ``What do you really leave out when you \ncall it this public debt? What part of the debt, the overall public and \nprivate, or trust fund debt, goes into the national debt?'' This is \nheld by the public. I am referring to page 74, April 1999, the most \nrecent report of the Congressional Budget Office: Debt held by the \npublic is the amount of money that the Federal Government has borrowed \nby selling securities to finance all of the deficits less any surpluses \naccumulated over time. Under the CBO's apparent baseline forecast, debt \nheld by the public is estimated to decline from $3.6 trillion in 1999 \nto $1.2 trillion in 2009. Gross Federal debt consists of debt held by \nthe public and debt issued to Government accounts.\n  Like you issue and you receive in Government accounts, most of the \nlatter type of debt is held by trust funds, the largest of which are \nSocial Security and Federal civilian employee retirement funds.\n  Because Treasury handles investment by trust funds and other \nGovernment accounts, purchases and sales of such securities do not flow \nthrough the credit markets. Therefore, interest on those securities is \nconsidered to be an intragovernmental transfer.\n  That is what I call the monkeyshine when they take from one and give \nit to the other. You only are talking about the one that you are \ngiving, and you are saying you are reducing the public debt, but you \nare increasing Social Security debt and saying in the same breath you \nare saving Social Security when you are looting it, when you are \nsavaging it. You are ruining it. There is no question that is what is \ngoing on, and that is what this amendment calls for.\n  Back in 1983, if we had any idea that Social Security trust funds \nwere going to be spent for any other purpose, you would have never \npassed that tax increase on Social Security, that payroll tax. You \nwould never have been able to get the votes.\n  We all talked and revered ourselves out here on the floor with the \nflourishes of how we were saving Social Security, that we weren't going \nto let it get in the red anymore, and how we are going to take care of \nthe baby boomers in the next generation, and that we are not going to \nhave it go bust. Instead, it is not the baby boomers that continue to \ntalk. It is the adults on the floor of the Congress totally in \nviolation of all Government policy. We are going to private \ncorporations. And in 1994 we passed the Pension Reform Act and said \nthere are too many of these takeovers. Well, these fast money artists \ncome in and pay down a good conservative-run company. They pay down the \ncompany's debt with the pension fund, and then take all the money and \nrun. We said that is going to have to stop, and we are going make it a \nfelony if you do it.\n  So we passed the Pension Reform Act of 1994.\n  Colleagues have heard me tell the story of Denny McLain, because I \nsaw it in the New York Times whereby Mr. McLain, the all-time pitcher \nfor the Detroit Tigers, became the head of a corporation, paid off the \ndebt with the company pension fund, got fired, convicted of a felony, \nand sentenced to 8 years. Mr. President, if you can find what cell poor \nDenny is in, tell him next time run for the Senate. Instead of the jail \nterm, he would get the ``Good Government Award.''\n  We stand out here baldfaced and say how we are saving Social Security \nwhen we are spending it on the debt. Don't get all caught up with \npublic debt like they want. That is what they want. They want us to \nmeet ourselves coming around the corner. By the year 2000, next year, \nwe will owe $2 trillion, and by the end of the 5-year budget period, we \nwill owe trust funds--the Government itself--$3 trillion.\n\n  I can tell you. You couldn't do this in corporate America. We would \nbe all fired as the directors.\n  But that is what happens and what occurs then. Finally, the fiscal \ncancer\n\n[[Page S3906]]\n\ngrows in droves. What happens is then it is projected that this year \nthere is $356.3 billion in interest costs.\n  Let me just say a word about that. I see other colleagues here on the \nfloor, who I would be glad to yield to.\n  But I am trying to emphasize again and again that this amendment does \nnothing more than increase our fiscal cancer. It does not save Social \nSecurity. It puts Social Security deeper in the red. That is what \nhappens here when you get the forced spending like taxes for interest \ncosts on the national debt, which is part of the public debt, too, and \nthe debt owed to the trust funds--what they might call if we were a \nprivate entity our ``private debt.'' But what happens is, as with \nLyndon Johnson, President Johnson, back in 1968 when we last balanced \nthe budget, when the Government last balanced the budget, in 1968-1969 \nwe ended up with a surplus. We didn't use Social Security moneys, \nincidentally. At that particular time, there were about 200 years of \nhistory, and the cost of all the wars from the Revolution on up to \nWorld War I, World War II, the cost of Vietnam, Korea, the debt was \nless than $1 trillion. And the interest cost was only $16 billion--one-\nsixth--$16 billion. Here, without the cost of a war and the ensuing \nyears, it has gone up to $1.2 trillion.\n  So we have increased spending for nothing, absolutely nothing. This \nis what I call ``fiscal cancer.'' You put in a sales tax. You get a \nschool. You put in a gas tax. You get a highway. You put in other \ntaxes. You get general government. But you put in this interest tax, \nfor this charade, fraud, maneuver, political maneuver, and the cancer \ncontinues to grow. As the amount shows here on its face, for the next 5 \nyears, the interest costs go up.\n  Here we are forced to spend $340 billion more than what President \nJohnson spent when the budget was last balanced.\n  Mr. President, just think of that $340 billion that I am going to \nspend this year, next year, next year. In fact, it is going up, up and \naway in interest costs. This is all under current policy, incidentally. \nAnd we have already destroyed current policy by passing an $18 billion \nmilitary pay bill.\n  We have now, and we are all going to vote for it, I think, $6 billion \nfor Kosovo. We have already busted the caps $21 billion. That is not \nthe case here. This is saying that you have not busted the caps, that \nyou had no Kosovo, that you had not voted $18 billion for the military. \nBut just think of that $340 billion more. I could give $80 billion to \npaying down Social Security or saving Social Security. I could give $80 \nbillion to pay down the public debt. I could give $80 billion for the \nRepublican tax cut. I could give $80 billion for the Democratic \nspending programs, for Medicare and otherwise. That is only $320 \nbillion. I would still have $20 billion for a parade and a party. As I \npromised my distinguished chairman, I would jump off the Capitol dome \nif he balanced the budget by the year 2002. That was a couple of years \nago--or 2001. I am still willing to reiterate that pledge.\n  They are not balancing the budget. We are spending, as you can see, \n$105.2 billion more than we are taking in, according to CBO this year, \nand $91.8 billion more than we are taking in for the budget that we are \nworking on for the year 2000. That is what I call fiscal cancer, and \nnobody wants to talk about it. They want to say: Oh, everything is \ncoming up like roses. It is morning in America, whatever else, any kind \nof political jargon. But the reality is there. I have a record and I \ndid not just come to this recently. I put in the sales tax, back in \n1949 and 1950 for public education in my own State. I got the first \ntriple-A credit rating of a southern State.\n  I have been chairman of this Budget Committee and I have been \nwatching. I am trying to educate the media, that is the only saving \ngrace I have, if they could finally come out like Barron's did and say \nthere is no surplus. Everybody is talking about using the Social \nSecurity surplus. Mr. President, I do not think I can get this printed \nin the Record--but here the Concord Coalition has finally come around, \nand a few others have come around and said it--but Barron's, dated \nMarch 1: ``There is no budget surplus.''\n  If we could talk sense to each other, we could figure out how to get \nout of this thing. I said let's do it the way the Social Security \nAdministration said; let's save it, let's put it in a true lockbox, S. \n605. I thought when I passed 13301 that I had put it in a lockbox, on \nNovember 5, 1990. We said it never would be spent and be used to \nreflect the financial condition, but they violate it regularly.\n  S. 605 now says that you have to keep the money there. That is how we \ndid it for years on end. It was fiscally sound. That is what is \nrequired of other pension funds, that they maintain their fiscal \nsoundness.\n  With that in mind, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President, for recognizing me.\n  Mr. President, I support the underlying bill to reform the rules \ngoverning emergency spending that has been reported out of the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs. Two amendments to that bill have now \nbeen offered, a first-degree amendment and a second-degree amendment, \nwhich blocks further amendments. The pending amendments are proposing \nto establish what is being called a Social Security lockbox.\n  Unfortunately, this lockbox is not secure. And it actually could \nundermine Social Security.\n  We Democrats have a far better alternative. Ours is a true lockbox. \nAnd it protects both Social Security and Medicare in a much more \nresponsible way.\n  Before I comment further on the lockbox proposals, I want to review \nthe underlying bill before us, which would make significant \nimprovements in the treatment of emergency spending.\n  Emergency spending is not casual spending. It is so important that it \nis exempt from budget rules. And that is as it ought to be, because it \ninvolves responding to things like floods, earthquakes and volcanoes.\n  We can all identify parts of the country--the floods in the Midwest, \nthe volcano in the State of Washington, and the terrible earthquake \ndamage in California. Those are emergencies. They are immediate threats \nto American public health and safety, and Congress often has to act \npromptly to avoid the loss of life and property.\n  Unfortunately, the emergency exception has been abused. Last year, \nCongress stretched the rules past the breaking point in the omnibus \nappropriations bill, which included many items of questionable \nemergency designation, especially those for military spending. These \nwere declared emergencies when, in fact, we were not looking at Kosovo \nand these items were not needed to respond to an imminent threat.\n  Mr. President, Congress has been able to abuse the emergency \ndesignation in part because the rules have been totally open-ended.\n  To address the problem, the Governmental Affairs bill proposes a new \ndefinition of ``emergencies'' and a point of order to help prevent \nconference committees from inserting unjustifiable new emergency \nspending. It is a good bill. And I commend Senator Thompson and Senator \nLieberman for their leadership.\n  Mr. President, while we were considering the budget resolution, the \nSenate approved an amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois, Senator Durbin, that was based on this legislation. Yet the \nconferees on the budget resolution ignored the Senate's position. \nInstead, the conferees constructed a 60-vote point of order that now \napplies to all emergency spending--but with a huge loophole. Military \nspending was completely exempted, whether it was for new weapons \nsystems or whatever.\n  Mr. President, Heaven knows that all of us want to support our \nmilitary, and want to make sure that what we are doing in Kosovo is \nfully supported. I, for one, hope that we will do whatever we can to \nbring this wave of atrocities to a halt. So I am not complaining about \nmilitary spending.\n  But, Mr. President, I thought that what the conferees on the budget \nresolution did was wrong. It was an abuse of the conference process \nsince neither Senate nor House had approved anything like this. They \njust came up with it on their own.\n\n[[Page S3907]]\n\n  I also thought it was bad policy.\n  Mr. President, there is no reason to allow 41 Senators to overrule 59 \nSenators who want to provide emergency spending for a flood, tornado, \nhurricane, or earthquake. And there is no reason to create a higher \nhurdle for a legitimate disaster than for a new weapons system.\n  I am afraid, Mr. President, that a 60 vote point of order against \nemergency designations is itself subject to abuse. One can conceive of \nall kinds of mischief to punish a particular senator or state for \npolitical reasons. And we should not to allow that kind of abuse.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the amendment before us would leave \nthis problematic approach from the budget resolution in place. Even \nworse, it would write it into law. I think that would be a serious \nmistake.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to turn to the proposal to establish what \nproponents call a lockbox.\n  I strongly support the purported goal of this amendment; that is, to \nsecure the future funding of Social Security. But I have three major \nproblems with this proposal.\n  First, it does nothing to protect Medicare. Instead, it allows \nCongress to divert funds needed for Medicare in order to provide tax \nbreaks for the wealthy.\n  Second, it threatens Social Security. Under the amendment, an \nunexpected economic downturn could block the issuance of Social \nSecurity checks. This would deal a serious blow to so many of our \nelderly who are dependent on Social Security.\n  Also, the amendment contains a booby trap that would allow Social \nSecurity contributions to be invaded for purposes other than Social \nSecurity benefits, like a risky new privatization scheme.\n  And third, the amendment could create a Government default --a U.S. \nGovernment default. It could undermine our Nation's credit standing, \nincrease interest costs, and ultimately lead to a worldwide economic \ncrisis.\n  I want to explain each of these in turn. The Medicare trust fund is \nnow expected to be bankrupt by 2015--only 16 years away. We ought to \nmove quickly to reform and modernize the program. But it is also clear \nthat we will need additional resources. That is why most Democrats \nbelieve it is critical to save some of the surplus for Medicare.\n  Our Republican friends say they agree about the importance of saving \nsome of the surplus for Social Security. But when it comes to saving \nfor Medicare, they are not willing to reserve a single penny. Instead, \nthey want to use funding that is needed for Medicare to provide any \nother things they favor, including tax breaks which are largely for the \nwealthy.\n  We Democrats think that is a mistake. And that is why I have \ndeveloped a lockbox that would reserve funding for Medicare as well as \nSocial Security. And I hope to have an opportunity to offer that \nproposal with Senator Conrad of North Dakota.\n  Beyond its failure, Mr. President, to protect Medicare, the second \nmajor problem with the pending amendment is that it fails to protect \nSocial Security. Actually, in some ways it threatens Social Security \nbenefits.\n  First, it threatens to block the issuance of Social Security checks \nif the economy slows, or if the Congress fails to act responsibly. If \nthe limit on public debt is exceeded, even by the smallest of margins, \nthe Government could not issue more Social Security checks, and checks \nalready issued could not be honored.\n  The Republicans say they protected Social Security benefits by \nproviding that such benefits would be given--and I quote-- \n``priority.'' But this language will be of no use if the debt limit has \nbeen exceeded.\n  In that situation, no new checks could be issued. And that applies \nnot only to Social Security checks, but unemployment compensation, \nMedicare payments and all other Government payments as well.\n  The lockbox amendment also includes a huge loophole. I call it a mine \nfield. And it could allow Social Security funds to be used for a wide \nvariety of purposes, anything that Congress labels as Social Security \nreform.\n  Mr. President, these are code words. They say we are going to lock \nthe door, but we are going to leave it open just a crack or two--\nsomething people wouldn't do in their safe deposit box, something they \nwouldn't do in their homes. We want to leave a couple of catch phrases \nin here like ``retirement security,'' like ``reform,'' and so that we \ndo not really guarantee that Social Security surpluses are going to be \nreserved for Social Security beneficiaries.\n  We had a vote here, 98 to nothing. We said that all Social Security \nsurpluses should be reserved for Social Security recipients. 98 to \nnothing. But it didn't take long for the conferees on the budget \nresolution--those from the majority party--we weren't included--to put \nthat vote in the trash basket. They included vague language that would \nallow Social Security surpluses to be used for, and I quote, \n``retirement security.''\n  Similarly, the language of this amendment includes an escape hatch \nthat will allow Congress to divert Social Security surpluses for \nanything that Congress labels as Social Security reform.\n  I heard the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee say \nearlier today that much of our surpluses ought to be reserved to give \ntax cuts to the people. It is not a bad idea. We like tax cuts, \ntargeted tax cuts. But the leading Republican tax proposal, S. 3, would \ngive those in the top one percent, with average incomes of $800,000 a \nyear, a $20,000 tax cut. Meanwhile, some poor guy who works for a \nliving, and his wife, or maybe a single parent who is working out there \nand making $38,000 a year, is going to get 99 bucks. That is what the \nRepublican leadership has proposed.\n  So I would say to that $800,000 wage earner: Sorry, buddy, we are not \ngoing to give you the $20,000 that you could use to put a downpayment \non a yacht or whatever else you want to do.\n  My conscience doesn't bother me at all when I say that tax cuts ought \nto be reserved for people who need proper day care for their children \nor need to help an elderly parent who has special medical problems.\n  Mr. President, when the Social Security trust fund goes bankrupt in \n2034, it will be able to pay only about 70 percent of the promised \nbenefits. Diverting payroll taxes for other uses, as this amendment \nallows, could make matters much worse. The date of insolvency could be \nmoved up and arrive earlier. And instead of being able to pay only 70 \npercent of promised benefits, we would be able to pay even less.\n  The issue here is not whether to establish private savings accounts, \nas many have suggested. President Clinton has recommended one form of \nsuch accounts, his USA accounts. Others have similar ideas.\n  But when Social Security already is 30 percent short of being able to \nprovide promised benefits to baby boomers, we can't afford to invade \nits funds for other uses. If we want to establish private accounts, we \ncan use other funds. We shouldn't permit even deeper cuts in guaranteed \nbenefits.\n  It also is important to understand that this amendment would do \nnothing to extend the life of Social Security trust funds. That is not \njust my opinion, it is a fact.\n  To back that up, I have a letter from Mr. Harry Ballantyne, chief \nactuary of the Social Security Administration. As Mr. Ballantyne \nwrites, the adoption of this proposal would have no significant effect \non the long-term solvency of the program--none.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter from the chief \nactuary of the Social Security Administration be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               Social Security Administration,\n\n                                                   April 19, 1999.\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: This letter addresses the \n     potential long-range financial effects on the OASDI program \n     of ``locking away'' the annual increases in the Social \n     Security Trust Funds, as proposed by Republican leaders in \n     the Senate and the House on March 10, 1999. The proposal \n     would require that annual increases in the OASI and DI Trust \n     Funds would be used solely to purchase long-term special \n     issue U.S. government bonds. In addition, the proposal would \n     require that the revenue used for the purchase of these bonds \n     would in turn be used solely for the purpose of reducing \n     Federal debt held by the public. Of course, the net\n\n[[Page S3908]]\n\n     change in the Federal debt held by the public in any year \n     would also be affected by the size of any on-budget deficit \n     or surplus for that year.\n       The proposal would not have any significant effect on the \n     long-range solvency of the OASDI program under the \n     intermediate assumptions of the 1999 Trustees Report. Thus, \n     the estimated long-range actuarial deficit of 2.07 percent of \n     taxable payroll and the year of the combined trust funds' \n     exhaustion (2034) would not change. The first year in which \n     estimated outgo will exceed estimated tax income would not be \n     affected and would therefore remain at 2014.\n       Any plan that reduces the amount of Federal debt held by \n     the public may make later redemption by the Trust Funds of \n     special issue U.S. government bonds easier.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Harry C. Ballantyne,\n                                                    Chief Actuary.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is critical that Congress act \npromptly to extend the solvency of Social Security. President Clinton \nhas presented two related proposals that would extend Social Security's \nlife through 2059. Some of my colleagues don't like those proposals. \nThat is fair. But if they do not like his ideas, they should propose \nsome of their own. So far, they haven't done it. And no one should be \nfooled into believing that this lockbox proposal is an answer.\n  Finally, the most serious problem with this proposal is that it \nthreatens to lead to a Government default. In the short term, that \ncould damage our Nation's credit standing and increase interest costs.\n  Treasury Secretary Rubin has written an excellent letter that \nexplains the severity of the risks posed by this proposal. I note that \nthe distinguished Senator from South Carolina already talked about this \nand has asked that Rubin's letter be printed in the Record. It was \naccepted on a unanimous consent basis. No Senator should vote on the \npending amendment until they have read this letter. And it is hard to \nsee how anyone could endorse the amendment after reading that letter.\n\n  Unfortunately, this amendment could very well lead to a serious debt \ncrisis in the future. Proposed limits on publicly held debt would be \nexceeded if current projections of the non-Social Security budget \nproved too optimistic. And, even if Congress tried in good faith to \ncomply with new public debt limits, those limits could be reached due \nto changes in the economy, demographic shifts, or a variety of other \nfactors.\n  Mr. President, the sponsors of the amendment say that they have \nincluded a provision to ensure that a recession would not trigger a \ndefault. However, that provision won't always work. The provision would \nonly become effective after two quarters of low economic growth. We \ncould be in a deep recession for nearly 7 months before the exemption \nkicks in. By then, it could be too late. We could already be in \ndefault.\n  Mr. President, our Nation has never defaulted on a debt backed by the \nfull faith and credit of the United States. But this amendment could \ntrigger default based on factors completely beyond our control. That \nwouldn't just block Social Security and other checks; it could easily \nlead to a worldwide financial crisis. That could prove catastrophic.\n  Mr. President, this is crazy. If suddenly the economy slows, revenues \ndecline, or expenditures increase unexpectedly, for any reason, why \nshould we risk the world's economy? It is like forcing the whole world \nto play a game of economic Russian roulette.\n  I would note that the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, Congressman Bill Archer, recognizes the folly of this \napproach and strongly opposes it. So this shouldn't be a partisan \nissue. He is not a Democrat. And I hope others on that side of the \naisle will also join in opposition. There are other more responsible \nways to enforce budget discipline. And that is what we Democrats are \nproposing.\n  Senator Conrad and I have developed an alternative lockbox to protect \nsurpluses for both Social Security and Medicare, and we hope to have an \nopportunity to present it to the Senate. Our proposal would reserve all \nSocial Security surpluses for Social Security and a portion of other \nsurpluses for Medicare. Our lockbox would be enforced first by \nrequiring 60 votes to invade the lockbox. Then, if Congress raided \nprojected surpluses, other programs would be cut across the board. We \nthink this makes more sense than the potential triggering of a default \nand a worldwide economic meltdown.\n  So I will briefly review the main problems with the proposal in front \nof us.\n  It does nothing to protect Medicare. It allows Congress to spend \nmoney needed for Medicare on tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  Second, it threatens Social Security. It could block Social Security \nchecks when the economy performs worse than expected. And it includes a \ntrap door that allows Social Security taxes to be invaded for purposes \nother than Social Security benefits, like risky new privatization \nschemes.\n  Finally, the amendment threatens a default on debt backed by the full \nfaith and credit of our country. This could increase interest costs \nimmediately, and ultimately lead to a worldwide economic catastrophe.\n  For all of these reasons, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will \nrecognize the serious problems with this amendment, and that we will be \ngiven an opportunity to offer amendments to improve it.\n  Unfortunately, right now, we Democrats--45 of us--are being prevented \nfrom offering amendments that we think are needed to protect Social \nSecurity and Medicare beneficiaries. We are prohibited by a trick \ncalled filling the amendment tree. This prevents us from offering \namendments, under the Senate rules.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will give us the opportunity to \noffer amendments. We need a lockbox for Social Security. But it should \nbe a real lockbox, without an escape hatch. It should protect Medicare \nas well. And it should be designed in a way that doesn't pose a threat \nof a Government default and a worldwide economic crisis.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we can come together on an understanding--\nthat the 98 Senators present last week voted on--that Social Security \nsurpluses should be reserved exclusively--no ifs, ands, or buts--for \nSocial Security beneficiaries. No loopholes. No escape hatches. No \nlittle crack in the door of the lockbox.\n  I hope our colleagues will think seriously about this when they vote. \nAnd I want the American public to take note of what is going on here. \nThey are the final arbiters of whether or not we are doing the right \nthing.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for his courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe Senator Lautenberg or perhaps \nother Senators will be here momentarily and will wish to comment on \nthis subject--perhaps even the Senator from South Carolina. I know \nSenator Abraham is prepared to begin the discussion.\n  For years we have talked about how we can set aside Social Security \nto come up with a process so Social Security cannot be used to make the \ndeficit look better or be spent for other programs or, for that matter, \nfor tax cuts. A lot of thought has been given to this. Efforts have \nbeen made by Senators on both sides of the aisle. I think what we have \nthis time is real. It will keep this money from being spent, without a \nsupermajority vote in the Senate, for other than defense. It is a clear \nstep in the right direction.\n  We need to be able to say to the American people that not one cent of \nSocial Security is going to be able to be spent on anything but Social \nSecurity. This lockbox will make it a lot more difficult, although \nunder emergency circumstances obviously that could still be pierced. \nThe key, though, is to lock this money up, make sure it is not \nfrittered away, and then see if we can come up with genuine long-term \nSocial Security reform so this money can be used for that. If it is \nnot, it will still be used, available to reduce the debt, and, over a \nperiod of years, that itself will be a significant benefit to the \ncountry, to the economy, to our seniors, and to the Social Security \nprogram.\n  So I commend Senator Abraham for his persistence on this issue, and I \nthink the best thing for us to do at this point is to get into a \ndiscussion about what we are trying to do here and see if we can get \nthis process through. This is a change in the law; this is not just a \nbudget process change. This is something the Senate would have to act \non, the House would have to act on, and we would have to send it to the \nPresident.\n  So I think it is time, and appropriate, now, that we have this \ndiscussion about the future of Social Security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for giving us \nan opportunity to begin this debate. I realize we have a number of \nMembers on various sides of this issue with different ideas. I think if \nwe have a discussion here, perhaps we can identify some of the concerns \nand address them. I hope we can because I think this is a topic that \nneeds to have our full attention.\n  Let me begin by saying I have just submitted an amendment here on \nbehalf of myself as well as Senators Domenici, Ashcroft, Lott, Nickles, \nMcCain, Frist, Crapo, Collins, and Grams. The amendment is the Social \nSecurity Preservation and Debt Reduction Act. It implements a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution which we approved as part of the budget \nresolution just before our Easter recess.\n  As you know, that sense-of-the-Senate resolution passed this Chamber \non March 24 by a vote of 99 to zero. It said simply that we ought to \ntruly protect Social Security by seeing to it that moneys in the Social \nSecurity trust fund are only used to fix Social Security or to pay down \nthe public debt, and for no other purpose.\n  We all agree that saving Social Security is our No. 1 priority in \nthis Congress. That has been a discussion that virtually every Member \nat one time or another has been part of. The President, in both his \n1998 and his 1999 State of the Union Addresses, said we should save \nevery penny of the Social Security surplus. In this year's Address, he \nsaid we should use it to reduce the Federal debt so as to ensure it \nwill not be squandered on other spending programs.\n  I agree with that. So do my cosponsors. Therefore, it is our hope, \nthrough this amendment we are offering today, to put into effect that \nwhich so many people, including the President, have sought to \naccomplish. If enacted into law, this amendment would save every penny \nof the Social Security surplus either to fix Social Security or to \nreduce the public debt.\n  Using hundreds of billions of dollars from the Social Security trust \nfund for new spending will not save Social Security. Indeed, the \nCongressional Budget Office now estimates that the President's own \nbudget, the one he submitted to us in February, spends $158 billion of \nthe Social Security surplus, 20 percent of the surplus that will be \ngenerated over the next 5 years. Fortunately, as you know, the Senate \ncharted a different course. Through our sense-of-the-Senate resolution, \n99 Senators stated our intention to lock up the Social Security trust \nfund to protect those dollars from being spent on other Government \nprograms.\n  Let me recount what this resolution, which we passed as part of the \nbudget, provided.\n  First, it provided we would place Social Security truly and fully off \nbudget.\n  Second, we pledged to create a subcategory of the current gross \nFederal debt limit; namely, debt held by the public.\n  Third, we pledged to mandate the reduction of that publicly held debt \nlevel by an amount equal to the Social Security trust fund surplus.\n  In addition, the limits could be adjusted one time to accommodate \nsubstantive Social Security reform. In other words, unless we were \nusing the Social Security trust fund surplus to fix Social Security, \nreform to modernize the Social Security system, then it would be used \nto reduce the current levels of Publicly held debt.\n\n  The amendment I am offering would implement those pledges. So let me \nbriefly run down its provisions.\n  The Social Security Surplus Preservation and Debt Reduction Act \nreaffirms that Social Security is off budget. That means its assets \nshould not be counted for purposes of the budget submitted by the \nPresident or the Congressional Budget Resolution. The legislation \nestablishes a simple majority point of order against any budget that \ndoes not count Social Security moneys. This amendment also codifies the \nbudget resolution language to establish a 60-vote Senate point of order \nagainst any budget resolution, budget amendment, or budget conference \nreport that runs a deficit unless that deficit results solely from \nSocial Security reform legislation.\n  Of critical importance is the amendment's provision establishing in \nlaw a declining limit on the amount of debt that could be held by the \npublic. This limit would be reduced in the year 2000, in the year 2001, \nand at 2-year intervals thereafter through the year 2009, by an amount \nequal to the entire Social Security trust fund surplus for each \ncorresponding time period. The amount would be measured as CBO's \ncurrent annual projections of the Social Security surplus for these \nsame years.\n  The 60-vote point of order would lie against any resolution or bill \nthat would exceed the publicly held debt limits. In other words, we \ncould not expand the publicly held debt unless we had 60 Members of \nthis Chamber who would make such a decision.\n\n[[Page S3898]]\n\n  However, these limits would be automatically adjusted for the cost of \nSocial Security reform, as I have mentioned, and/or for any changes in \nthe actual or projected Social Security trust fund surpluses.\n  Clearly, we are trying to read out the long period of time through \nthis legislation, a 10-year period. So if, as we move through that \nperiod, the size of the Social Security trust fund surplus were to be \nreadjusted or projected differently, then the legislation we are \noffering right now would provide the mechanism for making adjustments \nin that reduction of the publicly held debt accordingly.\n  A number of additional provisions would protect Social Security \nrecipients from unforeseen events. First, specific language in the \namendment states that the Secretary of the Treasury shall give priority \nto the payment of Social Security benefits required to be paid by law. \nThis amendment guarantees that Social Security benefits will have the \nhighest priority on all Federal moneys. We institute a concrete \nguarantee to seniors, and to those who one day will be seniors, that \ntheir benefits are truly backed up by the full faith and credit of the \nGovernment of the United States.\n  In addition, Mr. President, this amendment includes a provision that \nwould set aside the public debt reductions in the case of recession. \nWhenever the Commerce Department reports two consecutive quarters of \nless than 1 percent growth, the limits would be set aside until there \nis one full quarter of more than 1 percent real growth. Once \nreestablished, the limit would restart 6 months later at the level of \npublic debt held at the time of the recession's ending and then step \nback down at the rate projected by the newly determined Social \nSecurity surpluses.\n\n  Finally, this amendment includes an exception for emergencies such as \nthe current crisis in Kosovo.\n  On March 17 of this year, Treasury Secretary Rubin sent a letter \nexpressing several concerns about this approach. First, let me say that \nI was somewhat disappointed when he did so and surprised that he would \nraise the concerns about a bill that had not yet been written, let \nalone introduced. I appreciate the way Washington public policy debates \nwork, Mr. President, and I understand the Secretary of the Treasury \nwanted to, at a very early stage, express concerns. What we have tried \nto do is respond to those concerns in such a fashion, I hope, that the \nway we have crafted the amendment will satisfy some of the issues \nraised in his correspondence. Let me talk about a few of those \nconsiderations at this time.\n  First, Secretary Rubin in his letter commented that fiscal restraint \nis best exercised through the tools of the budget process; debt limits \nshould not be used as an additional means of imposing restraint. But \nthe last 2 years have clearly shown that current budget rules are \ninadequate to curb Washington's spending habits.\n  Last year, the President threatened to shut down the Government \nunless we spent $21 billion of the Social Security surplus through \nvarious so-called ``emergency'' spending declarations. There was a lot \nof debate as to whether or not some of those provisions truly were \nappropriately described as emergencies. This year, as I noted, the \nPresident proposed spending $158 billion of the Social Security surplus \non new spending programs over the next 5 years.\n  The budget rules, therefore, I do not believe are protecting the \nSocial Security surplus, and it is not just the President who has \nproposed ideas and ways by which these Social Security surplus dollars \ncan be spent. Members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle, have a \nlot of spending ideas, as we have heard.\n  In my judgment, the current budget rules do not protect these Social \nSecurity surplus dollars adequately. They are not designed for that \npurpose. Therefore, in my judgment, only by locking away the Social \nSecurity surplus and guaranteeing that the spenders cannot get ahold of \nit will we be able to protect those surplus dollars.\n  The fact of the matter is, if there is money available, people will \nfind a way to spend it under the current rules. I think that is very \nsimple and clear, and I think we should take additional steps to \naddress it. I do not think we can count, as the Secretary has \nindicated, on the existing rules to suffice.\n  Next, Secretary Rubin has raised the specter of default saying:\n\n       Even the appearance of a risk that the United States of \n     America might not meet its obligations because of the absence \n     of necessary debt authority would impose significant \n     additional costs on American taxpayers.\n\n  Mr. President, we should keep in mind that we currently have a debt \nceiling of $5.95 trillion. We live within a debt ceiling. We are not \ntalking about creating something out of whole cloth here, a limit on \nthe amount of indebtedness the American Government can assume. That is \nthe law, and the Treasury cannot issue more debt than that.\n  Further, current gross Federal debt is about $5.48 trillion. It is \nnot at the moment projected to rise significantly over the next 10 \nyears. There is no specter of failure to meet our obligations here.\n\n  I will note, however, that the CBO estimated that the President's \nproposals in his budget would raise gross Federal debt to almost $8.4 \ntrillion, almost $3.5 trillion over the current debt limit, exceeding \nthe current debt limit by nearly 40 percent. Therefore, using the \nSecretary's logic, the President's budget will place us in immediate \njeopardy of default because it will exceed the debt limits that we \nalready have in place.\n  Our proposal, on the other hand, simply creates a sublimit of our \ncurrent debt limit, one for debt held by the public. It does nothing to \nlimit our ability to meet our obligations.\n  Nonetheless, we have tried to take Secretary Rubin's concerns \nseriously. What we have done to try to address those concerns--and I \nwill elaborate on this a little bit further at a later point in these \nremarks--we have delayed the implementation of each year's new debt \nlimit by 7 months to ensure that they become effective when the \nTreasury is most flush with cash. This will establish a buffer that is \nmore than sufficient, in our judgment, to cover Treasury's short-term \ncash management needs, even during seasons of the year when cash \ndeficits have historically appeared.\n  Third, Secretary Rubin has expressed concern that the publicly held \ndebt limits ``could easily be inadequate for the Government to meet its \nobligations at a given point during the year. If the Treasury could not \nborrow or raise, it is possible that it could simply stop honoring any \npayment.'' And he even went on to say Social Security payments.\n  What he means by that, and it is related to the earlier point that I \njust addressed, is the fact that the revenue stream to the Government \ndoes not always coincide with the outflow of money during particular \npoints in the year. That is why, as I have mentioned, we have altered \nour original proposal to move the date at which these publicly held \ndebt ceiling changes would occur to a point--May 1--at which time, \nbased on the past 10 years, the Government has been most flush, has had \nthe largest inflow of money--obviously, it corresponds to some extent \nto tax payment day and other factors--for the exact purpose of making \nsure the changes would occur at a point when the Treasury would have \nthe most cash on hand and the greatest flexibility with respect to any \nobligations, it would seem to me.\n  In addition, we have placed into this amendment a legal declaration \nthat Social Security payments required by law have priority claims on \nthe U.S. Treasury. In other words, we try to do two things here that I \nthink address all of the concerns raised by Secretary Rubin.\n  First, we have changed the effective date as to when the debt limits \nwould be changed to meet the maximum point of revenue stream to the \nGovernment, thus giving him and his successors total flexibility with \nrespect to meeting obligations, and the guaranteed Social Security \nbenefit checks will be paid by ensuring in the language of the \namendment that they would receive top priority of expenditures.\n  In addition, we have responded to the Secretary's concern about \nshort-term cash management swings, as I say, with a 7-month delay of \nimplementation of the debt limits.\n  We are open to other ideas, but we are trying to be responsive to \nthose\n\n[[Page S3899]]\n\nconcerns that have been raised. That is our hope here, to try to \naddress anything that might serve as an impediment to anyone concerning \nthe support of this vitally needed legislation.\n\n  In addition, Secretary Rubin has worried that the proposed debt \nlimits could run the risk of worsening an economic downturn. We take \nthat to mean concerns that if a recession were occurring, we would be \nin a difficult position to adequately address it. Once again, we have \ntaken into account those concerns, and we have placed in our amendment \nlanguage, as I mentioned earlier, that would suspend the debt limits \nduring times of recession and reinstate them only after we have \nrecovered from such recession at the newly adjusted publicly held debt \nlevels.\n  Finally, the Secretary expressed concern that the lockbox does not \nallow for emergencies. Let me first observe that this administration's \nuse of the term ``emergency'' has been somewhat variable, and it would \ncertainly be the view of this Senator, and I know others, that it has \nbeen used to characterize a number of expenditures that are hard \npressed to be included under that definition, at least as I see it. We \nspent $21 billion of the Social Security surplus on an emergency \npackage at the end of the last Congress that certainly had provisions \nwhich did not, in my judgment, meet the normal definition of that term.\n  However, considering that we now have a 60-vote point of order \nagainst any nondefense emergency spending provisions as part of the \nbudget resolution that we passed, we have placed in this amendment \nlanguage to automatically adjust upwards the publicly held debt limits \nfor any emergency spending provisions. Thus, we once again address the \nconcern that was raised.\n  Mr. President, I believe this meets, therefore, every one of the \nserious concerns expressed by the Treasury Secretary, while at the same \ntime still meeting the central goal of protecting and preserving the \nSocial Security trust fund surpluses. It successfully addresses the No. \n1 issue of this Congress: Saving and strengthening Social Security.\n  While it may not constitute the long-term reform proposals that I \nknow will be further debated as the Congress moves ahead, it protects \nthe surpluses of the trust fund so they can be employed to make sure \nthat we modernize the Social Security system in a way that not only \nguarantees today's beneficiaries are able to receive what they are \nentitled to, but also the future beneficiaries will as well. We owe it \nto those who have reached retirement age, as well as those who will one \nday join them, to do this.\n  As recent events have shown, the only way to do that is to take \nSocial Security finally and fully off budget, because so long as Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses can be accessed by spending priorities, \nthey will be spent. In my judgment, it is that simple. It is simply too \neasy to point to good ideas and good programs and arguments of things \nthat can be done with large amounts of the American people's money, too \neasy to see the benefits of Federal spending without looking at the \ncost to our financial stability and to those who depend on a sound \nSocial Security system.\n\n  In my opinion, we must, in order to meet our obligations to the \nAmerican people, see to it that every penny of the Social Security \ntrust fund surplus is preserved for Social Security. And the only way \nto do that is to lock up those funds by using them to pay down the \npublic debt. I think it is the right thing to do.\n  President Clinton himself has endorsed the idea at the root of this \namendment. This Chamber recently voted unanimously for a resolution \ncalling for legislation of this sort. So I hope we can get together, as \ncolleagues, to take what would be the final step--this amendment--to \nplace Social Security surpluses above the risks that they will be \nsquandered and secure them for generations to come.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased, on behalf of a variety of colleagues, to \noffer this amendment. We look forward to the discussion. I hope that it \ncan encompass not just a discussion of this proposal as offered, but if \nMembers have ideas with respect to the lockbox, I hope they will share \nthem with us, because I think protecting the Social Security surplus \ndollars is something that we have an obligation to achieve in this \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am honored to cosponsor the Abraham-\nDomenici Social Security surplus preservation amendment. This amendment \nwill protect Social Security for millions of Americans who now receive \nits benefits and who now pay taxes hoping that they someday, too, will \nreceive Social Security.\n  I believe protecting Social Security is the highest priority we could \nhave in the Congress. Protecting Social Security means we must make \nsure the current surpluses that will be needed to pay benefits later \nare not used to pay for new budget deficits in the rest of government. \nThat is what this bill does. It is why I am for it, and it is why I \nurge swift passage of this legislation.\n  The legislation we are debating today logically follows and, in fact \nimplements, previous policy decisions that have been made by this \nCongress. Let's review a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that the Senate \npassed by an overwhelming 99-to-0 vote just 2 weeks ago. That \nresolution made these points:\n  No. 1, Congress and the President should balance the budget excluding \nsurpluses generated by the Social Security trust funds.\n  No. 2, reducing the Federal debt held by the public is a top national \npriority.\n  No. 3, the surpluses now held in the Social Security trust fund will \nreduce the debt held by the public by $1.7 trillion.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that President \nClinton's budget would spend $158 billion of Social Security surpluses \non new spending programs over the next 5 years. That is the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office. It simply says that the President's plan \nfor spending is to use the Social Security surplus to go out and spend \n$158 billion which would not otherwise be spent over the next 5 years.\n  Social Security surpluses should be used for retirement security, for \npayment of current benefits, or to reduce the debt, and should not be \nused for other purposes.\n  These mandates should be implemented in two ways:\n  First, by providing for a Senate supermajority point of order against \nany bill or resolution that would use Social Security surpluses on \nanything other than the payment of Social Security benefits.\n  Second, by establishing a supermajority point of order in the Senate \nagainst raising the limits established on the level of debt held by the \npublic. This resolution passed the Senate 99 to nothing. It passed \nunanimously. Not only did it pass unanimously, there was no dissenting \ndebate.\n  The conference report on the budget resolution which we passed last \nweek took the first steps necessary to protect Social Security by \nbalancing the budget without using the Social Security surpluses, and \nit established for the next 2 years a point of order against budget \nresolutions that use Social Security surpluses to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, I believe that is what we need to do. We need to \nbasically say that it is out of order to go back and take Social \nSecurity surpluses to cover deficits in other parts of government.\n  The amendment we have before us implements the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. It simply takes what we did 2 weeks ago and makes permanent \nthe Social Security protection measures that were included in the \nconference report. Specifically, this amendment accomplishes the \nfollowing:\n  No. 1, this amendment creates a 60-vote point of order against future \nbudget resolutions that use Social Security surpluses to balance the \nbudget. This provision makes the temporary point of order included in \nthe conference report permanent, and it is made a part of the law, not \njust part of the Senate and House rules on the budget. We simply would \nbe able to say that it is out\n\n[[Page S3900]]\n\nof order, it requires a supermajority setting aside or suspending the \nrules in order to devote the Social Security surplus to covering \ndeficits in other parts of the operations of government.\n\n  This provision is identical to legislation I introduced earlier this \nyear to protect Social Security. This amendment lowers the amount of \ndebt held by the public by amounts roughly equal to the Social Security \nsurpluses. So as you have a Social Security surplus, instead of \nspending it on new government, you use it to lower the amount of debt \nheld against this country.\n  The effect of this provision is twofold: It helps ensure that the \nSocial Security trust funds are not used to pay for aggressive spending \nprograms or for tax cuts; and, secondly, it reduces overall Federal \ndebt. By reducing debt, this amendment will strengthen our economy, \nstrengthen Social Security, and our capacity to meet our obligations to \nit in the future.\n  Reducing the public debt makes it easier for America to meet its \nSocial Security obligations in three ways. I think Speaker Hastert was \nmost eloquent about this. He said if you ever came into a surplus in \nyour own life--maybe a rich uncle died, left you $50, $60,000--and you \neither could spend it on a bunch of new spending or pay down the \nmortgage on your house, which would help you meet the challenges of the \nfuture better? It is pretty clear, not going to Las Vegas and taking a \nlot of vacations but paying down your debt, paying down your mortgage, \nwould be the best thing.\n  Over the long run, paying off the debt will lower interest payments, \nwhich are now over $200 billion annually. They equal about 15 percent \nof our budget now.\n  No. 2, they would ease the burden of the $3.8 trillion national debt, \nwhich would free up more resources to help us meet Social Security \nobligations in the future. Of course, No. 3, a debt-free America will \nhave a stronger, faster-growing economy and will be better equipped to \ncome up with the money to redeem the trust fund's IOUs when needed.\n  We cannot afford not to pay off the Federal debt. Federal debt incurs \nvery real costs in the form of interest payments and higher interest \nrates. Under President Clinton's proposed budget, $158 billion from the \nfiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2004 budget would be diverted from debt \nreduction and directed towards spending. According to the Senate Budget \nCommittee, that represents 21 percent of the Social Security surplus \nover that period. In fiscal year 2000 itself, it represents $40 \nbillion, or 30 percent of the surplus.\n  In contrast, our amendment would require us to reserve every penny, \nall of the Social Security surplus, for debt reduction. Under this \nplan, publicly held debt, which now stands at 44.3 percent of GDP, \nwould be reduced to 10.3 percent of GDP by the year 2009. That is a 70-\npercent reduction over just 10 years.\n  Once this amendment is adopted, the President and Congress will no \nlonger raid Social Security surpluses to pay for non-Social Security \nspending. This amendment would, therefore, protect Social Security at \nthe beginning and at the end of the budget process. At the front end, \nCongress could no longer pass budgets that use Social Security \nsurpluses. At the back end, the ratcheting down of the debt ceiling \nwould ensure that Social Security surpluses go to debt reduction, \nthereby helping to keep our financial house in order. A strong \nfinancial house for the United States of America is fundamentally the \nbest guarantee we can ever have that Social Security will be a house of \nintegrity itself.\n  One of the most important lessons a parent teaches a child is to be \nresponsible, responsible for his or her conduct and responsible for his \nor her money. America needs to be responsible with the people's money. \nThe debt reduction proposed by this amendment is among the greatest \ngifts we can give to our children, and it is a great gift for our \nseniors. Imagine what our children could do if we were able to provide \nfor them a next generation that is free, free to build their own dreams \ninstead of pay for our past.\n  In addition to protecting our children from debt, this amendment will \nalso protect the Social Security system from irresponsible government \nspending.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment, and I \nthank the Chair for this time on the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senators who have taken the \nfloor and spoken on behalf of this lockbox amendment.\n  I have worked for many years with a number of Senators, some of whom \nare on the floor--some on the other side, like Senator Hollings--in an \neffort to see what we could do to make it as difficult as humanly \npossible to spend Social Security trust fund money for other kinds of \nexpenditures of the Federal Government, be it programs, or be it tax \ncuts.\n  Frankly, I have heard it said on a number of occasions that the \nthings we tried to do heretofore were all process and didn't get the \njob done. I don't want to take credit for doing something \nextraordinary. But I will say this idea of tying the Social Security \ntrust fund to the debt held by the public over a 10-year period, and \nlimiting the amount of debt that can occur in each of those years for a \ndecade, which essentially is the current debt minus the amount of \nSocial Security trust fund subtracted each year from that debt--what is \nleft over, that residual is the debt held by the public. But I did, at \na committee hearing, for some reason come up with the idea that maybe \nthat is what we ought to do--tie it to a debt limit.\n  There will be plenty of people who will take the floor and say this \nis too rigid, this is too tough, this puts too big a shackle around the \nGovernment of the United States.\n  Let me tell you honestly. If you want to tell the seniors of America \nwe don't want to spend your Social Security money for programs, or tax \ncuts, or anything other than when we need it for you, we will use it \nfor you, then you ought to really be serious about it. You ought to say \nthat is what we are trying to do.\n  Obviously this is the first time that the rhetoric and the \ncontentions by Senators from both sides of the aisle that we ought to \nnot spend Social Security money has been reduced to a statute that, if \nit passes and is signed by the President, will govern for 10 years, \nwhether or not the United States can easily use trust fund money from \nSocial Security for other causes, other reasons, as just as they may \nbe. It will become very difficult when this legislation becomes law for \nus to ever again in a wholesale, willy-nilly manner spend Social \nSecurity trust fund money. In fact, every time you exceed that debt \nlimit, and even if you have 60 votes, you are going to have to tell the \nAmerican people we are exceeding it; we have 60 votes now. It is \nsomething very important, and people are going to be able to look and \nsee. Was it something very, very important, or are we back to business \nas usual?\n  That is the essence of this proposal.\n  When I was saying we talk a lot about it, let me say on the debate on \nthe budget resolution on the floor of this Senate--and the occupant of \nthe Chair helped, because he voted the right way, but on this vote it \nwas an easy vote because 99 Senators voted for it, as I recall. There \nwas a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, kind of the precursor to this \nbill that was adopted by the Senate. It was an Abraham-Domenici and \nothers sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  It did the following things:\n  One, it reaffirmed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 that \nSocial Security trust funds are off budget.\n  Second, it provides a Senate point of order against any budget \nresolution that violates that section of the Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act.\n\n  Third, it mandates that Social Security surpluses are used only for \nSocial Security, or reducing the public debt.\n  Fourth, it provides for a Senate supermajority vote on a point of \norder against any measure that would use Social Security surpluses for \nanything other than the payment of Social Security benefits, Social \nSecurity reform, or the reduction of the debt held by the public.\n  Fifth, it ensures that all Social Security benefits are paid on time.\n  Last, it accommodates Social Security reform legislation. That was \npassed 99-0.\n\n[[Page S3901]]\n\n  Mr. President, what happened was we attempted in that sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution to encapsulate what this legislation that is before \nus today did. It said that it is the sense of the Senate that we should \nadopt a bill that does all of these things. Now we have that bill \nbefore us.\n  So those who would now want to either unduly delay this vote, or say \nwe should not do it, or vote against it, no, it is not so easy to \nexplain that they just less than 10 days ago voted--2 weeks ago and a \nfew days--voted 99-0 to adopt legislation just like this.\n  I understand that there can be a lot of explaining between the \nlanguage and the statute--the language in this lockbox legislation.\n  Right off, I want to mention one thing. There are a number of \nSenators--I am hoping it is a minimum--within the next couple of days \nwho are going to cite the fact that our distinguished Secretary of the \nTreasury, Mr. Rubin, said some legislation that he had seen that was \nthe Domenici legislation on the lockbox wouldn't work mechanically, \nthat part of the year you don't get in a real strong flow of income \ntax, and later on you get in a big flow of income tax, and that maybe \nyou would not be able to control the expenditures and the need for cash \nduring those early days if in fact you had a very rigid year-long debt \nlimit.\n  We have done the best we can. We are open to suggestions to adjust to \nthat need for flexibility without altering the ultimate dollar number \nthat will be the debt held by the public.\n  Again, rather than use it to destroy this legislation, which it \nshould not do--I read the letter, and we can fix the concerns of the \nSecretary--if that is all the concerns the administration has, if that \nis all of them, we already fixed most of them right here. But if it is \nnot quite right, we welcome the legislative liaison from the Treasury \nor the White House to come and tell Mr. Rubin to tell us how to fix it \nbetter, just as long as it is understood that we don't want somebody \nfrom the administration saying that what we are really telling you is \ntoo tough, it is too rigid, it holds your feet to the fire too much, we \nought to have more flexibility in terms of why and for what purpose we \nshould use this Social Security surplus. If that is the reason the \nlegislation is bad, we want to suggest that we are at opposite ends of \nthe polls; for that is the reason we think it is good, because it is \nvery tough.\n  If you are going to throw away much of the Social Security funds in \nthe next decade instead of applying it to the debt of $1.8 trillion, it \nis not going to be easy, which means that Government is going to be \npretty much tied to a reasonable budget that does not spend the Social \nSecurity budget surplus over time over this decade.\n  For those who say, well, you know, there will be no money for this or \nthat or the other, maybe there won't, but maybe there will be because \nwe are not saying that surpluses that are not Social Security surpluses \nare subject to any kind of restriction. They are subject to what \nCongress wants to do and what a President recommends.\n  So if there are surpluses that do not belong to them--and there is a \nvery large chunk of surplus now that doesn't belong to Social \nSecurity--we are not trying to limit that. We Republicans think most of \nthat should go back to the public in tax cuts, but that is a year-long \nbattle with the President and others. That is not Social Security \nmoney.\n  Mr. President, that same sense-of-the-Senate language that I told you \nabout that was adopted in the budget resolution in its final form, \nafter it got 99 votes freestanding, it was adopted by a vote of 54-44 \nwhen the budget resolution was adopted.\n  When 99 people vote and tell the Senate what we should do, and then \nwe do it, it would seem to me that it ought to be a rather simple \nproposition that we ought to do it, tell the public we meant what we \nsaid, and get on with making sure we find other ways to take care of \nour governmental needs, but not the Social Security trust fund for the \nnext decade.\n  Unless the Senate and the sense-of-the-Senate resolution was \nmeaningless, this statute should get rather broad-based support, it \nseems to this Senator.\n  Let me speak from the standpoint of what could be better for America \nthan us doing this. I can think of hardly anything that could be better \nfor America, not just for the seniors, better for America. Mr. \nPresident, $1.8 trillion during the next decade, and I truly believe \nthat if this statute is adopted it will be perilously close to $1.8 \ntrillion, that will be cut from the national debt.\n\n  That is an incredible number. Senator Ashcroft just told us how big \nit is, in terms of percentage of our gross national product. But $1.8 \ntrillion of public debt during this decade will be wiped clean and \nthere will be no public debt against that $1.8 trillion because the \nsurplus of Social Security money will be there, only to be used for \nmajor reform for Social Security if, in fact, that occurs during this \ndecade.\n  Why is that good? If you asked almost every rational, reasonable, \nmainstream American economist from Alan Greenspan to that long list \nthat said the President was doing good things in reducing the debt, you \nask them if reducing the debt by $1.8 trillion is not a very positive \nthing for our economy and they will all say: The best thing to use \nsurplus for is debt reduction. Because that means we borrow less. In a \nvery interesting way it means we save more, because if you were to \nspend it, you would have to be borrowing to take its place. And if you \ndo not borrow, you are saving. Since we individually save little, it is \nvery good, starting into the new millennium and the first few years, \nthat we have a low debt with low borrowing which may very well keep the \nAmerican economy moving ahead, strong, powerful, with lower interest \nrates.\n  What could be better for America? Nothing. What could be better for \nseniors? Nothing--other than a reformed Social Security program that \nwas in existence for 75 years with no problems. And, frankly, an \nappropriate plan might use this surplus in transition for that and we \nmight get that out of this also.\n  Why else is it good for seniors? Did anybody hear the President go to \nthe Rose Garden when he got a statement from the trustees of Social \nSecurity and Medicare the other day and announce to America that things \nwere looking better for Medicare and Social Security? I believe there \nwas an announcement that we added 8 years to the longevity of the trust \nfund for Medicare. And we did not do a thing. We just continued to have \na prospering American economy. So one can say seniors should want a \nprospering American economy more than anyone else in this society, \nbecause a prospering American economy, with high employment and low \nunemployment, is the best medicine for the Social Security trust fund \nand Medicare trust fund of anything, any set of activities we could do \nas American people, as business people, and as American taxpayers and \nworkers, producing goods and services in this very vibrant and powerful \neconomy.\n  So, when you look at that, this may just be, in some people's minds, \nsome small approach to making the case that we are trying to save \nSocial Security trust fund money from being spent arbitrarily for \nthings that are not Social Security. It is more than that. It is a \ncombination of things that I just described, including the very \npositive result of greatly reducing the national debt while we wait to \nsee what is needed for Social Security reform; a very, very positive \npiece of legislation.\n  It is important to allow the Federal Government maximum flexibility \nin times of low growth or recession. The Federal budget is one of the \nmost important economic policy tools we have. In fact, we have \nprocedures in place which allow us to suspend our budgetary enforcement \nrules during such times.\n  This legislation contains a low-growth, recession trigger as well. If \nthe Department of Commerce reports two consecutive quarters of real \neconomic growth of less than 1 percent, the limit of debt held by the \npublic is suspended. The current law statutory debt limit would still \nbe in place.\n  The limit on debt held by the public is suspended until the Commerce \nDepartment issues a final GDP report indicating that the level of real \nGDP has risen back to its level prior to the low growth or recession \nperiod. The limit on debt held by the public is restored at its actual \nlevel (at the time the Commerce Department report is issued that de-\ntriggers the suspension.)\n\n[[Page S3902]]\n\n  The limit on debt held by the public then begins to decline at the \nsame rate that it would have had the suspension not been triggered.\n  Mr. President, the Act is effective for 10 years and then sunsets. \nThis is the same time period covered by the recently adopted concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2000--H. Con. Res. 68. It is a \nperiod of time in which the Social Security trust fund balances are \nexpected to grow by nearly $1.8 trillion. These balances would retire \ndebt held by the public which would help prepare the country for the \nretirement of the baby boom generation early in the next century. It \nreaffirms off-budget treatment of the social security program.\n  The act reaffirms current law that the receipts and disbursements of \nthe Social Security trust funds shall not be counted for the purposes \nof the Federal budget submitted to Congress by the President or any \ncongressional budget.\n  The act creates a new Budget Act point of order against Congress \nadopting a budget that uses social security surpluses to achieve \nbalance, and requires the President to submit a budget that does the \nsame. It uses the Social Security surplus to reduce the debt held by \nthe public. The act establishes a new enforceable limit on the amount \nof debt held by the public over the period from 2000 to 2010. These \ndebt limits specified in the act are current estimates of the level of \nborrowing from the public over this period that result from the Social \nSecurity surplus only being used to retire debt. The surplus could not \nbe used for non-Social Security spending or tax cuts. Legislation \nincreasing these limits would require a super-majority vote in the \nSenate.\n  The act establishes the first limit becomes effective as of May 1, \n2000, and effectively ratchets down this limit May 1 and periodically \nthereafter. The effective date accommodates Treasury Department's \nFederal cash management responsibilities. The newly established debt \nheld by the public limits would not disrupt the cash management \noperations of the Bureau of the Public Debt nor would it jeopardize \nSocial Security benefit payments.\n  The limits follows:\n  May 1, 2000 through April 30, 2001, $3.628 trillion;\n  May 1, 2001 through April 30, 2002, $3.512 trillion;\n  May 1, 2002 through April 30, 2004, $3.383 trillion;\n  May 1, 2004 through April 30, 2006, $3.100 trillion;\n  May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2008, $2.775 trillion; and\n  May 1, 2008 through April 30, 2010, $2.404 trillion.\n  There are adjustments to Limits for Social Security reform, \nrecessions, emergencies and war. Social Security reform--the Act \nauthorizes adjustments to the limits established for legislation \nenacted that reforms Social Security during this time period. If Social \nSecurity reform legislation is enacted, and if that legislation has the \neffect of changing the debt held by the public specified in this act, \nthen the Secretary of the Treasury shall adjust the limits in this act \nto reflect those changes.\n  Recessions--the provisions of this act are suspended during a period \nof low economic growth. Two consecutive quarters of less than 1 percent \nreal economic growth would automatically make the debt limits in this \nact inoperative. After the recession has ended, the act would reinstate \nnew debt limit levels adjusted for the impact of the recession.\n  Emergencies--the act also provides for an automatic adjustment to the \ndebt limit levels specified if, after the adoption of this act, the \nCongress enacts into law ``emergency'' spending defined under the \nBalanced Budget Act. If emergency spending uses a non-Social Security \nsurplus, then no adjustment to the limits would be necessary. If, \nhowever, emergency spending requires the usage of Social Security \nsurpluses, then the limits specified in the act would be adjusted for \nthat amount.\n  Declaration of war--the act would be suspended upon Congress enacting \na declaration of war.\n  I want to suggest there are those who wonder what we will do if we \nhave a recession. I provided in this a triggering mechanism. If there \nis anybody who would like to improve upon it, I welcome it. But it says \nyou have a recession if you have two consecutive quarters of \nsignificant downturn in the economy, in which event you may very well \nbe dramatically impacting upon the tax take of the country. In that \ncase you may, indeed, trigger a halt to the reduction, the constant \nreduction of the debt limit. And you may leave it in place until you \nget into a recovery mode and then set it back on its trendline toward \ntotal elimination of the $1.8 trillion.\n  In addition, you will find some language in it regarding war, or \nregarding substantial moneys being needed for our military. Those may \noccur from time to time and we would not want people to say this is \nmaking it impossible to fund that, even though holding it is a good \nthing. It might be that you would want to use it for those kinds of \nthings, and there is a provision permitting us to do that.\n  When you add it all up, I think we have been considerate of the \nproblems associated with trying to truly lock this money in and that we \nhave a good bill. We hope we get some support from the Democratic side \nbefore we are finished, and we stand ready to debate it. I hope our \nleader stands ready to debate it as long as necessary for us to get an \nup-or-down vote and see just where we all stand so our people will \nunderstand our position when the legislation appears, rather than when \nwe have a sense of the Senate that we ought to do this. Let's see what \nhappens on the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me first respond to our \ndistinguished budget chairman by reading a letter addressed to our \ndistinguished minority leader by the Secretary of the Treasury, Robert \nRubin. It is dated March 17, 1999.\n\n       Dear Tom: Thank you for inquiring about the impact of the \n     new debt limits contained in the Social Security Surplus \n     Preservation Act. I appreciate the opportunity to respond to \n     your question. In brief, I am deeply concerned that these \n     limits could preclude the United States from meeting its \n     future financial obligations to repay maturing debt and to \n     honor payments--including benefit payments--and could also \n     run the risk of worsening a future economic downturn.\n       It has been this Administration's view that fiscal \n     restraint is best exercised through the tools of the budget \n     process. Existing enforcement tools such as the pay-go rules \n     and the discretionary spending limits in the Budget \n     Enforcement Act have been key elements in maintaining fiscal \n     discipline in the 1990's Debt limits should not be used as an \n     additional means of imposing restraint. Debt is incurred \n     solely to pay expenditures that have previously been \n     authorized by the Congress and for the investment of the \n     Federal trust funds. By the time the debt limit is reached, \n     the Government is obligated to make payments and must have \n     enough money to do so.\n       If Treasury were prohibited from issuing any new debt to \n     honor the Government's obligations, there could be permanent \n     damage to our credit standing. The debt obligations of the \n     United States are recognized as having the least credit risk \n     of any investment in the world. That credit standing is a \n     precious asset of the American people. Even the appearance of \n     a risk that the United States of America might not meet its \n     obligations because of the absence of necessary debt \n     authority would be likely to impose significant additional \n     costs on American taxpayers. Yet, in November 1995, a debt \n     crisis was precipitated when Government borrowing reached the \n     debt limit and in January Moody's credit rating service \n     placed Treasury securities on review for possible downgrade.\n       As you know, there is currently a statutory limit on the \n     amount of money that Treasury can borrow in total from both \n     the public and from Federal trust funds. The proposed \n     ``lockbox'' provision would add a new statutory limit on debt \n     to the public.\n       The proposed new debt limit runs the risk of precipitating \n     additional debt crises in the future. Although the proposal \n     adjusts the debt ceiling for discrepancies between the actual \n     and projected Social Security surpluses, it does not make \n     similar corrections for unanticipated developments on the \n     non-Social Security side of the budget. While our \n     forecasts have been conservative, the current forecast of \n     the non-Social Security budget could prove too optimistic \n     because of changes in the economy, demographics, or \n     countless other factors. This could cause the publicly \n     held debt to exceed the new debt limit.\n       Furthermore, even if the debt limit appears sufficient \n     because if covers the annual debt level--measured from end-\n     of-year to end-of-year--it could easily be inadequate for the \n     Government to meet its obligations at a given point during \n     the year. Under normal circumstances, every business day, \n     Treasury makes payments--including Social Security payments \n     on certain days. In any given week, Treasury receives \n     revenues, makes payments, and refinances maturing\n\n[[Page S3903]]\n\n     debt. Weekly and monthly swings in cash flow can easily \n     exceed on-hand cash balances. When this occurs, Treasury then \n     borrows from the public to meet its obligations. If the \n     amount of publicly held debt were to reach the level of the \n     debt limit--or if the debt limit were to decline to below the \n     level of publicly held debt--Treasury could be precluded from \n     borrowing additional amounts from the public. If Treasury \n     could not borrow to raise cash, it is possible that it could \n     simply have to stop honoring any payments--including Social \n     Security payments.\n       In this case, Treasury could be prohibited from issuing any \n     new debt to redeem maturing debt. Every Thursday, \n     approximately $20-23 billion of weekly Treasury bills mature \n     and, every month, an additional $60-85 billion in debt \n     matures. These securities must either be paid off in cash or \n     refinanced by issuing new debt. Treasury could be put in the \n     position of having to default for the first time in our \n     nation's history.\n       Congress could defuse the debt limit problems by \n     immediately voting to raise the debt ceiling. Under the \n     ``lockbox'' proposal, however, it would take sixty votes in \n     the Senate to do so. As past experience indicates, obtaining \n     a super-majority for this purpose is often time-consuming and \n     difficult. Moreover, this requirement would greatly enhance \n     the power of a determined minority to use the debt limit to \n     impose their views on unrelated issues.\n       Finally, the proposed debt limits could run the risk of \n     worsening an economic downturn. If the economy were to slow \n     unexpectedly, the budget balance would worsen. Absent a \n     super-majority vote to raise the debt limit, Congress would \n     need to reduce other spending or raise taxes. Either cutting \n     spending or raising taxes in a slowing economy could \n     aggravate the economic slowdown and substantially raise the \n     risk of a significant recession. And even those measures \n     would not guarantee that the debt limit would be not be \n     exceeded. A deepening recession would add further to revenue \n     losses and increases in outlays. The tax increases and \n     spending cuts could turn out to be inadequate to satisfy all \n     existing payment obligations and keep the debt under the \n     limit, worsening a crisis.\n       To summarize, these new debt limits could create \n     uncertainty about the Federal government's ability to honor \n     its future obligations and should not be used as a instrument \n     of fiscal policy. While we certainly share the goal of \n     preserving Social Security, this legislation does nothing to \n     extend the solvency of the Social Security trust funds, while \n     potentially threatening the ability to make Social Security \n     payments to millions of Americans. I will recommend that the \n     President veto the bill if it contains the debt limit \n     provisions. If you have any additional questions, please do \n     not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert E. Rubin.\n\n  t(Mr. DOMENICI assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the interesting thing to this Senator, \nof course, is the date, March 17. Nothing has changed. We knew that the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee and his colleagues would \nbe conspiring, as they have delayed us this afternoon to get the exact \nright conspiracy. To do what? To eliminate President Clinton's budget, \non the one hand, and to engage in a charade or fraud, on the other \nhand, to make the Members, and particularly the media that covers this \nthing, see the perception is the reality. They are still talking \nsurplus, surplus, surplus, surplus when we pointed out time and time \nand time again there is no surplus. We are spending $100 billion more \nthan we are taking in. But this is to get everybody to think there is \nsome change.\n  All you have to do is read the distinguished chairman's summary of \nthe Social Security Surplus Preservation and Debt Reduction Act, \nsummary of amendment, April 20, 1999. This is 1 month later. The \ndistinguished Secretary of the Treasury foresaw this amendment. There \nis nothing complicated about it except its wording and rewording of the \nstatutory provisions of 13301 and many, many other provisions, to \nmislead, as if it were really doing something.\n  But, 2, ``Uses Social Security surplus to reduce the debt held by the \npublic.''\n  Mr. President, we have been doing that for years and years on end. \nThat is what we call the unified--there it is--the unified deficit. \nThat is when they use the Social Security surplus. We have this chart. \nWe have been using this for years.\n  As a former chairman of the Budget Committee--I speak advisedly, not \npolitically--I have been trying my dead level best to do what the \nchairman in this amendment proposes to do, but it is the same act, the \nsame scene, because in 1968 President Lyndon Baines Johnson brought \nabout a merging of the Social Security trust fund with general funds of \nthe U.S. Government so we could then talk about a unified deficit with \ntrust funds. Therefore, you could get a surplus rather than a deficit.\n  The truth of the matter is, the trust fund surplus from Social \nSecurity is $126 billion. You use Social Security trust funds and you \ncontinue to do so.\n  They say pay down the public debt. Let me get into that paying down \nthe public debt, like it is something other than the national debt. I \nam in my 33rd year, and the real problem is to really try to stop \nincreasing the national debt and to pay down the national debt.\n  When we say pay down the debt, do not give monkeyshines of paying \ndown public debt, thereby increasing Social Security debt. The \ndistinguished Senator from Missouri said just a minute ago, if you \ninherited money, rather than going off to Las Vegas you ought to pay \noff your home mortgage. This does not pay off the home mortgage. This \ndoes not pay down the national debt. It just levels off and obscures \nthe true size of the national debt, whereby we are thinking we are \nreducing the public debt and we are paying our bills. Not at all.\n  (Mr. SMITH of Oregon assumed the chair.)\n  Let's assume, Mr. President, individually I had two credit cards, I \nhad a MasterCard and I had a Visa card, and I got in a big bill from \nMasterCard, and I said, ``Well, I'll take care of that crowd. They've \nbeen bringing a lot of pressure on me, so I will just take the Visa \ncard and pay off the MasterCard.'' I still owe that much more money. I \nhave just transferred it from MasterCard to Visa. In this case, I am \njust transferring it from public debt to Social Security. I am using, \nborrowing, spending--ah, spending--the Social Security moneys to pay \ndown the public debt.\n  That is all this amendment says, and that is what we have been doing \nsince 1968. But on this long sheet here of--how many pages are here? It \nis a 17-page amendment, with all these facts and figures. You can find \nthe triggering mechanism on page 10, when they say, ``After the \nSecretary determines the actual level for the social security surplus \nfor the current year, the Secretary shall take the estimated level of \nthe social security surplus for that year specified in paragraph (1) \nand subtract that actual level.'' And when you subtract that level, you \nbring down the public debt. That is the triggering mechanism. The \namendment has 17 pages, and you will find it on page 10. The debt goes \nup, up, and away.\n  Mr. President, I had to go to the Congressional Budget Office and ask \nfor the trust fund balances. As of February 1999--I have not gotten it \nfor March yet. Let me give you the Congressional Budget Office figures \nhere of what we owe Social Security. That is something you ought to \nremember, that there isn't any Social Security surplus. Yes, each \nfiscal year there has been for several years, because we really bring \nin more than what we have to pay out that particular year. But having \nspent it, having been paying down the public debt, we have been \nspending the Social Security money.\n  So Social Security, as of 1998, $730 billion in the red; 1999, $857 \nbillion. These are CBO figures. These are shockers--shockers--to you, \nbecause I am reading out how we are increasing the debt, not paying it \ndown.\n  We are the board of directors of the Government. We are not stock \nanalysts up on Wall Street hoping that the Government does not come in \nwith its sharp elbows, borrowing to pay its bills, running up interest \nrates, perhaps causing inflation, crowding out corporate finance.\n  So you will find that the financial community and the Greenspans--oh, \nthey love this ``pay down the public debt.'' They are not elected to \noffice. We are elected as the trustees of the fiscal condition of the \nU.S. Government.\n  Here is the most important program we have domestically, the Social \nSecurity program. And in 1998, $730 billion in the red; in 1999, it is \nprojected to be $857 billion; in 2000, $994 billion; in 2001, $1.139 \ntrillion; and in the year 2002, under current policy, paying down the \npublic debt, $1.292 trillion; in 2003, $1.453 trillion; in 2004, $1.624 \ntrillion; in 2005, $1.808 trillion, in 2006, $2.001 trillion; in 2007, \n$2.205 trillion. And at the end of the 10-year period this particular \namendment contemplates, in the year 2008, we will owe, paying down\n\n[[Page S3904]]\n\nthe public debt and increasing the Social Security debt, $2.417 \ntrillion.\n  Now, come on. When you need the money to make the payments, when you \ncan't just depend on the interest cost in 2013, at the end of the year \nin 2012, you are going to have to start borrowing money. And in 2034 \nyou will be outright broke and you will owe nearly $4.5 trillion--\nalmost $5 trillion.\n\n  Who would want to be Senators running for reelection? Who would want \nto get elected to that mess? All you can do is cut down all the \nprograms and raise taxes, unless you can get away with this fraud that \nis going on.\n  I use the word ``fraud'' advisedly. We learned, as freshmen in law \nschool, that it had to be false, and it was intended to be false, and \nintended to deceive, that it was relied upon, it did cause damage, and \nthe damage was the proximate cause. This particular amendment is \nknowingly with intent to deceive. It is a fraud. It does not change a \nthing.\n  We have been paying down the public debt with Social Security money, \nand we are running up Social Security's debt, sticking it more and more \nand more in the red, all under, ``We're going to save Social Security \n100 percent. It is going to be spent on only Social Security''--\nabsolutely false. When you pay down the public debt, that debt could \nhave been caused by defense, Kosovo, it could have been caused by food \nstamps, it could be caused by foreign aid or Lawrence Welk's home--I \nremember when we appropriated money for Lawrence's home--it could be \nanything.\n  So when you are paying down the debt, as it says right here on the \nface of the handout by the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee--and I read, again, ``uses the Social Security surplus to \nreduce the debt held by the public''--the debt held by the public is \ncumulative with every and any amount of different expenditures. So it \nhas more to be spent on every and any thing but Social Security, all \nthe time saying they are saving Social Security.\n  Let me make absolutely clear about this fiscal condition that we are \nin, because we have a cancer; we have fiscal cancer.\n  Mr. President, I have a good friend over on the House side, the \nchairman of the Transportation Committee, Mr. Shuster.  And he is \nfinally going to spend some highway moneys on highways. Bless him. I am \n100 percent for him, because I have been in this game now ever since we \nstarted the budget process in 1973, 1974, with Senator Muskie. I have \nbeen the chairman of the committee.\n  But here are the trust funds. The Secretary of Treasury refers to \ntrust funds. Somebody will say, they are not trusts, but they are \nsupposed to be. ``For the investment of Federal trust funds'' is the \nexpression used by Secretary Rubin. I am using the same expression: \n``Trust fund looted to balance the budget.''\n  In 1999, here is what we owe Social Security: $857 billion; Medicare, \nwe got $129 billion for the HI portion of Medicare and 39 billion for \nthe SMI portion; for military retirement, $141 billion; for civilian \nretirement, we owe $490 billion--that is civil service employees; they \nought to know it; it is going up--unemployment compensation fund, $79 \nbillion; highway moneys, $25 billion; airport moneys, $11 billion; \nrailroad retirement, $23 billion; and ``other,'' like the Federal \nFinance Bank, $57 billion. So we owe our trust funds $1.851 trillion.\n  By this 5-year period, at the end of 2004, we will owe $2.954 \ntrillion under current policy, and the amendment of the Senator that \nhas just been put in by the majority leader--I wasn't here when it was \nintroduced, but I understood he was going to put it in or the chairman \nof the Budget Committee--the one under consideration, in 5 years, we \nwill owe $3 trillion to all of the particular trust funds. And the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas came down to the floor of the Senate, \nand this is a quote of what he said on April 15:\n\n       I believe that this is an excellent budget. I think, \n     looking at the whole package, it is the finest budget \n     presented in America in the 20 years that I have served in \n     Congress.\n\n  Do you know what it does, Mr. President? It just breaks all the \ndiscipline, the little discipline that we do have that has been in the \npay-go rules. So once we settle out, then any amendment that came in, \nyou had to have an offset.\n  Here is what they do in the conference report so that they can go \nahead with tax cuts and anything else they want. Of course, the \nmanifest intent is to do away with Social Security, privatize it. In \norder to privatize it under Milton Friedman's plan, you need what? You \nneed these surpluses. You need the $1.8 or the $2 trillion or, if you \ndo it in the year 2004, you will need $3 trillion. So you will need \nthese surpluses.\n  Here's how you get them. Section 202 of this budget--here is the \nconference report on the budget:\n\n       Whenever the Committee on Ways and Means of the House or \n     the Committee on Finance of the Senate reports a bill or an \n     amendment thereto is offered or a conference report thereon \n     is submitted that enhances retirement security through \n     structural programmatic reform, the appropriate chairman of \n     the Committee on the Budget may, one, increase the \n     appropriate allocations and aggregates of new budget \n     authority and outlays for the amount of new budget authority \n     provided by such measure and outlays flowing therefrom for \n     that purpose. Two, in the Senate, adjust the levels used for \n     determining compliance with the pay-as-you-go requirements of \n     section 207. And, three, reduce the revenue aggregates by the \n     amount of the revenue loss resulting from that measure for \n     that purpose.\n\n  There go your tax cuts.\n  What does this mean? It means what the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee says. Whenever the Committee on Ways and Means of the \nHouse or the Committee on Finance reports a bill, an amendment thereto, \nthe chairman can decide, the appropriate chairman of the Committee on \nthe Budget, he can tell you what that means; it means what he says.\n  I am speaking as seriously as I know how. I have never seen the \nextreme of the shenanigans and the maneuvers and the misleads and the \nfraud going on politically, all to get by the next election, \nspecifically using Social Security trust funds.\n  Let's go back, Mr. President, to the Greenspan Commission. The \nGreenspan Commission, in 1983, said we are going to institute this \npayroll tax; namely, the 6.2 percent, the payroll by the employer, and \n6.2 percent by the employee, for 12.4 percent. And we know that is a \nhigh payroll tax. But we are putting that in to take care of the baby \nboomers in the next generation. That is why it was put in that way.\n  And to make sure that it was set aside, section 21, Mr. President, \nprovided just exactly that. It provided that it be set aside and that--\nif I can find that section, I will show it to you, section 21. It said \nremove Social Security from the unified budget. That has been the on-\nbudget, off-budget, unified and all that, un-unified, private debt, \npublic debt, trust fund debt, everything else--it is just one account. \nBut I will read section 21:\n\n       A majority of the members of the National Commission \n     recommends that the operations of the OASI, DI, HI and SMI \n     Trust Funds should be removed from the unified budget.\n\n  It took this Senator on the Budget Committee almost 7 years before I \ncould finally get it reported out of the Budget Committee, that \nparticular provision.\n  I ask unanimous consent that section 21 of the Greenspan Commission \nreport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, section 21 was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                 social security and the unified budget\n\n       (21) A majority of the members of the National Commission \n     recommends that the operations of the OASI, DI, HI, and SMI \n     Trust Funds should be removed from the unified budget. Some \n     of those who do not support this recommendation believe that \n     the situation would be adequately handled if the operations \n     of the Social Security program were displayed within the \n     present unified Federal budget as a separate budget function, \n     apart from other income security programs.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair.\n  I think we have in here section 13301. I ask unanimous consent that \nwe print in the Record at this point section 13301 of the Budget \nEnforcement Act.\n  There being no objection, section 13301 was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SEC. 13301. OFF-BUDGET STATUS OF OASDI TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Social Security From all Budgets.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n\n[[Page S3905]]\n\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (b) Exclusion of Social Security From Congressional \n     Budget.--Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The \n     concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and \n     revenue totals of the old age, survivors, and disability \n     insurance program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection or in any . . .''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. I will read \n``Exclusion'':\n\n       Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is \n     amended by adding at the end the following: ``The concurrent \n     resolution shall not include the outlays and revenue totals \n     of the old age, survivors and, disability insurance program \n     established under title II of the Social Security Act or the \n     related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.''\n\n  And it goes on in paragraph (a) saying that the Social Security trust \nfund\n\n     . . . shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of the budget \n     of--(1) the budget of the United States Government as \n     submitted by the President, (2) the congressional budget, or \n     (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act.\n\n  Now, true it is, the amendment reiterates that particular section. \nBut that has been in the disabuse, the disavowal, the violation thereof \never since 1990, when President Bush signed it into law on November 5 \nof that particular year. And this particular amendment continues to put \nit within the unified by paying it down.\n  Now, that has been the big problem all along. And so at the beginning \nof the year, when I fortunately began to hear music to my ears that \nboth the White House and congressional leaders on both sides were \nsaying again and again that they were going to save Social Security, I \ngot with my friend Ken Apfel, who used to work for the Budget Committee \nand is the Administrator of Social Security today, and, as a result, we \nintroduced S. 605, a bill to solidify the off-budget status of the Old \nAge Survivors and Disability Insurance Program under title II of the \nSocial Security Act and to protect program assets. Let me read section \n5:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law throughout each \n     month that begins after October 1st, 1999, the Secretary of \n     the Treasury shall maintain in a secure repository or \n     repositories cash in a total amount equal to the total \n     redemption value of all obligations issued to the Federal old \n     age and survivors insurance trust fund and the Federal \n     disability insurance trust fund pursuant to section 201(d) of \n     the Social Security Act that are outstanding on the first day \n     of such month.\n\n  Mr. President, that really puts it into a lockbox. It is in the \nBudget Committee. I have asked the chairman to let us bring it up. I \nwould be delighted to have hearings on it. We would give anything to \nhave a vote on it, but they have filled up the tree so I can't put it \nin as an amendment here. Maybe we can get it at the end of the so-\ncalled cloture vote and put it in when we get an up-or-down vote on \nthis.\n  But section 201(d) requires the Social Security Administration to \ninvest in Treasury bills, Government securities. Necessarily, they get \nthe IOU and the Government gets the money. But if you immediately \ntransfer an equal amount of money back to a trust fund in Treasury, as \nsection 5 requires, then you have the lockbox where the money is only \nexpended for Social Security purposes.\n  Now, this has been drawn with the assistance of the Social Security \nAdministration. And some of my colleagues, when I showed it to them, \nthey said: Wait a minute, that's what you are going to do. What you are \ngoing to do with the money is, you do exactly with the money as you did \nbetween the years 1935 and 1968 before you started this monkeyshine of \na unified budget, spending all of the Social Security trust funds. That \nis what happens. You keep it right over there and it gets the highest \namount permissible by law under T bills today, which this year in \ninterest will be $48 to $50 billion in interest that it earns.\n  This money is supposed to be earning, on the one hand, and kept in \ntrust, those earnings, and the total fund on the other hand. Instead, \nwe are spending the interest and the fund itself. We are breaking \nSocial Security, and coming out here baldfaced and saying we all want \nto save Social Security, and not one red cent is going to be spent on \nany other than Social Security. It is one grand fraud.\n  Mr. President, let me just emphasis, since I have the page turned \nhere on public debt and private debt, or gross Federal debt--I am \nreferring to an analysis of the President's budgetary proposals for \nfiscal year 2000. I asked CBO, ``What do you really leave out when you \ncall it this public debt? What part of the debt, the overall public and \nprivate, or trust fund debt, goes into the national debt?'' This is \nheld by the public. I am referring to page 74, April 1999, the most \nrecent report of the Congressional Budget Office: Debt held by the \npublic is the amount of money that the Federal Government has borrowed \nby selling securities to finance all of the deficits less any surpluses \naccumulated over time. Under the CBO's apparent baseline forecast, debt \nheld by the public is estimated to decline from $3.6 trillion in 1999 \nto $1.2 trillion in 2009. Gross Federal debt consists of debt held by \nthe public and debt issued to Government accounts.\n  Like you issue and you receive in Government accounts, most of the \nlatter type of debt is held by trust funds, the largest of which are \nSocial Security and Federal civilian employee retirement funds.\n  Because Treasury handles investment by trust funds and other \nGovernment accounts, purchases and sales of such securities do not flow \nthrough the credit markets. Therefore, interest on those securities is \nconsidered to be an intragovernmental transfer.\n  That is what I call the monkeyshine when they take from one and give \nit to the other. You only are talking about the one that you are \ngiving, and you are saying you are reducing the public debt, but you \nare increasing Social Security debt and saying in the same breath you \nare saving Social Security when you are looting it, when you are \nsavaging it. You are ruining it. There is no question that is what is \ngoing on, and that is what this amendment calls for.\n  Back in 1983, if we had any idea that Social Security trust funds \nwere going to be spent for any other purpose, you would have never \npassed that tax increase on Social Security, that payroll tax. You \nwould never have been able to get the votes.\n  We all talked and revered ourselves out here on the floor with the \nflourishes of how we were saving Social Security, that we weren't going \nto let it get in the red anymore, and how we are going to take care of \nthe baby boomers in the next generation, and that we are not going to \nhave it go bust. Instead, it is not the baby boomers that continue to \ntalk. It is the adults on the floor of the Congress totally in \nviolation of all Government policy. We are going to private \ncorporations. And in 1994 we passed the Pension Reform Act and said \nthere are too many of these takeovers. Well, these fast money artists \ncome in and pay down a good conservative-run company. They pay down the \ncompany's debt with the pension fund, and then take all the money and \nrun. We said that is going to have to stop, and we are going make it a \nfelony if you do it.\n  So we passed the Pension Reform Act of 1994.\n  Colleagues have heard me tell the story of Denny McLain, because I \nsaw it in the New York Times whereby Mr. McLain, the all-time pitcher \nfor the Detroit Tigers, became the head of a corporation, paid off the \ndebt with the company pension fund, got fired, convicted of a felony, \nand sentenced to 8 years. Mr. President, if you can find what cell poor \nDenny is in, tell him next time run for the Senate. Instead of the jail \nterm, he would get the ``Good Government Award.''\n  We stand out here baldfaced and say how we are saving Social Security \nwhen we are spending it on the debt. Don't get all caught up with \npublic debt like they want. That is what they want. They want us to \nmeet ourselves coming around the corner. By the year 2000, next year, \nwe will owe $2 trillion, and by the end of the 5-year budget period, we \nwill owe trust funds--the Government itself--$3 trillion.\n\n  I can tell you. You couldn't do this in corporate America. We would \nbe all fired as the directors.\n  But that is what happens and what occurs then. Finally, the fiscal \ncancer\n\n[[Page S3906]]\n\ngrows in droves. What happens is then it is projected that this year \nthere is $356.3 billion in interest costs.\n  Let me just say a word about that. I see other colleagues here on the \nfloor, who I would be glad to yield to.\n  But I am trying to emphasize again and again that this amendment does \nnothing more than increase our fiscal cancer. It does not save Social \nSecurity. It puts Social Security deeper in the red. That is what \nhappens here when you get the forced spending like taxes for interest \ncosts on the national debt, which is part of the public debt, too, and \nthe debt owed to the trust funds--what they might call if we were a \nprivate entity our ``private debt.'' But what happens is, as with \nLyndon Johnson, President Johnson, back in 1968 when we last balanced \nthe budget, when the Government last balanced the budget, in 1968-1969 \nwe ended up with a surplus. We didn't use Social Security moneys, \nincidentally. At that particular time, there were about 200 years of \nhistory, and the cost of all the wars from the Revolution on up to \nWorld War I, World War II, the cost of Vietnam, Korea, the debt was \nless than $1 trillion. And the interest cost was only $16 billion--one-\nsixth--$16 billion. Here, without the cost of a war and the ensuing \nyears, it has gone up to $1.2 trillion.\n  So we have increased spending for nothing, absolutely nothing. This \nis what I call ``fiscal cancer.'' You put in a sales tax. You get a \nschool. You put in a gas tax. You get a highway. You put in other \ntaxes. You get general government. But you put in this interest tax, \nfor this charade, fraud, maneuver, political maneuver, and the cancer \ncontinues to grow. As the amount shows here on its face, for the next 5 \nyears, the interest costs go up.\n  Here we are forced to spend $340 billion more than what President \nJohnson spent when the budget was last balanced.\n  Mr. President, just think of that $340 billion that I am going to \nspend this year, next year, next year. In fact, it is going up, up and \naway in interest costs. This is all under current policy, incidentally. \nAnd we have already destroyed current policy by passing an $18 billion \nmilitary pay bill.\n  We have now, and we are all going to vote for it, I think, $6 billion \nfor Kosovo. We have already busted the caps $21 billion. That is not \nthe case here. This is saying that you have not busted the caps, that \nyou had no Kosovo, that you had not voted $18 billion for the military. \nBut just think of that $340 billion more. I could give $80 billion to \npaying down Social Security or saving Social Security. I could give $80 \nbillion to pay down the public debt. I could give $80 billion for the \nRepublican tax cut. I could give $80 billion for the Democratic \nspending programs, for Medicare and otherwise. That is only $320 \nbillion. I would still have $20 billion for a parade and a party. As I \npromised my distinguished chairman, I would jump off the Capitol dome \nif he balanced the budget by the year 2002. That was a couple of years \nago--or 2001. I am still willing to reiterate that pledge.\n  They are not balancing the budget. We are spending, as you can see, \n$105.2 billion more than we are taking in, according to CBO this year, \nand $91.8 billion more than we are taking in for the budget that we are \nworking on for the year 2000. That is what I call fiscal cancer, and \nnobody wants to talk about it. They want to say: Oh, everything is \ncoming up like roses. It is morning in America, whatever else, any kind \nof political jargon. But the reality is there. I have a record and I \ndid not just come to this recently. I put in the sales tax, back in \n1949 and 1950 for public education in my own State. I got the first \ntriple-A credit rating of a southern State.\n  I have been chairman of this Budget Committee and I have been \nwatching. I am trying to educate the media, that is the only saving \ngrace I have, if they could finally come out like Barron's did and say \nthere is no surplus. Everybody is talking about using the Social \nSecurity surplus. Mr. President, I do not think I can get this printed \nin the Record--but here the Concord Coalition has finally come around, \nand a few others have come around and said it--but Barron's, dated \nMarch 1: ``There is no budget surplus.''\n  If we could talk sense to each other, we could figure out how to get \nout of this thing. I said let's do it the way the Social Security \nAdministration said; let's save it, let's put it in a true lockbox, S. \n605. I thought when I passed 13301 that I had put it in a lockbox, on \nNovember 5, 1990. We said it never would be spent and be used to \nreflect the financial condition, but they violate it regularly.\n  S. 605 now says that you have to keep the money there. That is how we \ndid it for years on end. It was fiscally sound. That is what is \nrequired of other pension funds, that they maintain their fiscal \nsoundness.\n  With that in mind, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President, for recognizing me.\n  Mr. President, I support the underlying bill to reform the rules \ngoverning emergency spending that has been reported out of the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs. Two amendments to that bill have now \nbeen offered, a first-degree amendment and a second-degree amendment, \nwhich blocks further amendments. The pending amendments are proposing \nto establish what is being called a Social Security lockbox.\n  Unfortunately, this lockbox is not secure. And it actually could \nundermine Social Security.\n  We Democrats have a far better alternative. Ours is a true lockbox. \nAnd it protects both Social Security and Medicare in a much more \nresponsible way.\n  Before I comment further on the lockbox proposals, I want to review \nthe underlying bill before us, which would make significant \nimprovements in the treatment of emergency spending.\n  Emergency spending is not casual spending. It is so important that it \nis exempt from budget rules. And that is as it ought to be, because it \ninvolves responding to things like floods, earthquakes and volcanoes.\n  We can all identify parts of the country--the floods in the Midwest, \nthe volcano in the State of Washington, and the terrible earthquake \ndamage in California. Those are emergencies. They are immediate threats \nto American public health and safety, and Congress often has to act \npromptly to avoid the loss of life and property.\n  Unfortunately, the emergency exception has been abused. Last year, \nCongress stretched the rules past the breaking point in the omnibus \nappropriations bill, which included many items of questionable \nemergency designation, especially those for military spending. These \nwere declared emergencies when, in fact, we were not looking at Kosovo \nand these items were not needed to respond to an imminent threat.\n  Mr. President, Congress has been able to abuse the emergency \ndesignation in part because the rules have been totally open-ended.\n  To address the problem, the Governmental Affairs bill proposes a new \ndefinition of ``emergencies'' and a point of order to help prevent \nconference committees from inserting unjustifiable new emergency \nspending. It is a good bill. And I commend Senator Thompson and Senator \nLieberman for their leadership.\n  Mr. President, while we were considering the budget resolution, the \nSenate approved an amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois, Senator Durbin, that was based on this legislation. Yet the \nconferees on the budget resolution ignored the Senate's position. \nInstead, the conferees constructed a 60-vote point of order that now \napplies to all emergency spending--but with a huge loophole. Military \nspending was completely exempted, whether it was for new weapons \nsystems or whatever.\n  Mr. President, Heaven knows that all of us want to support our \nmilitary, and want to make sure that what we are doing in Kosovo is \nfully supported. I, for one, hope that we will do whatever we can to \nbring this wave of atrocities to a halt. So I am not complaining about \nmilitary spending.\n  But, Mr. President, I thought that what the conferees on the budget \nresolution did was wrong. It was an abuse of the conference process \nsince neither Senate nor House had approved anything like this. They \njust came up with it on their own.\n\n[[Page S3907]]\n\n  I also thought it was bad policy.\n  Mr. President, there is no reason to allow 41 Senators to overrule 59 \nSenators who want to provide emergency spending for a flood, tornado, \nhurricane, or earthquake. And there is no reason to create a higher \nhurdle for a legitimate disaster than for a new weapons system.\n  I am afraid, Mr. President, that a 60 vote point of order against \nemergency designations is itself subject to abuse. One can conceive of \nall kinds of mischief to punish a particular senator or state for \npolitical reasons. And we should not to allow that kind of abuse.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the amendment before us would leave \nthis problematic approach from the budget resolution in place. Even \nworse, it would write it into law. I think that would be a serious \nmistake.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to turn to the proposal to establish what \nproponents call a lockbox.\n  I strongly support the purported goal of this amendment; that is, to \nsecure the future funding of Social Security. But I have three major \nproblems with this proposal.\n  First, it does nothing to protect Medicare. Instead, it allows \nCongress to divert funds needed for Medicare in order to provide tax \nbreaks for the wealthy.\n  Second, it threatens Social Security. Under the amendment, an \nunexpected economic downturn could block the issuance of Social \nSecurity checks. This would deal a serious blow to so many of our \nelderly who are dependent on Social Security.\n  Also, the amendment contains a booby trap that would allow Social \nSecurity contributions to be invaded for purposes other than Social \nSecurity benefits, like a risky new privatization scheme.\n  And third, the amendment could create a Government default --a U.S. \nGovernment default. It could undermine our Nation's credit standing, \nincrease interest costs, and ultimately lead to a worldwide economic \ncrisis.\n  I want to explain each of these in turn. The Medicare trust fund is \nnow expected to be bankrupt by 2015--only 16 years away. We ought to \nmove quickly to reform and modernize the program. But it is also clear \nthat we will need additional resources. That is why most Democrats \nbelieve it is critical to save some of the surplus for Medicare.\n  Our Republican friends say they agree about the importance of saving \nsome of the surplus for Social Security. But when it comes to saving \nfor Medicare, they are not willing to reserve a single penny. Instead, \nthey want to use funding that is needed for Medicare to provide any \nother things they favor, including tax breaks which are largely for the \nwealthy.\n  We Democrats think that is a mistake. And that is why I have \ndeveloped a lockbox that would reserve funding for Medicare as well as \nSocial Security. And I hope to have an opportunity to offer that \nproposal with Senator Conrad of North Dakota.\n  Beyond its failure, Mr. President, to protect Medicare, the second \nmajor problem with the pending amendment is that it fails to protect \nSocial Security. Actually, in some ways it threatens Social Security \nbenefits.\n  First, it threatens to block the issuance of Social Security checks \nif the economy slows, or if the Congress fails to act responsibly. If \nthe limit on public debt is exceeded, even by the smallest of margins, \nthe Government could not issue more Social Security checks, and checks \nalready issued could not be honored.\n  The Republicans say they protected Social Security benefits by \nproviding that such benefits would be given--and I quote-- \n``priority.'' But this language will be of no use if the debt limit has \nbeen exceeded.\n  In that situation, no new checks could be issued. And that applies \nnot only to Social Security checks, but unemployment compensation, \nMedicare payments and all other Government payments as well.\n  The lockbox amendment also includes a huge loophole. I call it a mine \nfield. And it could allow Social Security funds to be used for a wide \nvariety of purposes, anything that Congress labels as Social Security \nreform.\n  Mr. President, these are code words. They say we are going to lock \nthe door, but we are going to leave it open just a crack or two--\nsomething people wouldn't do in their safe deposit box, something they \nwouldn't do in their homes. We want to leave a couple of catch phrases \nin here like ``retirement security,'' like ``reform,'' and so that we \ndo not really guarantee that Social Security surpluses are going to be \nreserved for Social Security beneficiaries.\n  We had a vote here, 98 to nothing. We said that all Social Security \nsurpluses should be reserved for Social Security recipients. 98 to \nnothing. But it didn't take long for the conferees on the budget \nresolution--those from the majority party--we weren't included--to put \nthat vote in the trash basket. They included vague language that would \nallow Social Security surpluses to be used for, and I quote, \n``retirement security.''\n  Similarly, the language of this amendment includes an escape hatch \nthat will allow Congress to divert Social Security surpluses for \nanything that Congress labels as Social Security reform.\n  I heard the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee say \nearlier today that much of our surpluses ought to be reserved to give \ntax cuts to the people. It is not a bad idea. We like tax cuts, \ntargeted tax cuts. But the leading Republican tax proposal, S. 3, would \ngive those in the top one percent, with average incomes of $800,000 a \nyear, a $20,000 tax cut. Meanwhile, some poor guy who works for a \nliving, and his wife, or maybe a single parent who is working out there \nand making $38,000 a year, is going to get 99 bucks. That is what the \nRepublican leadership has proposed.\n  So I would say to that $800,000 wage earner: Sorry, buddy, we are not \ngoing to give you the $20,000 that you could use to put a downpayment \non a yacht or whatever else you want to do.\n  My conscience doesn't bother me at all when I say that tax cuts ought \nto be reserved for people who need proper day care for their children \nor need to help an elderly parent who has special medical problems.\n  Mr. President, when the Social Security trust fund goes bankrupt in \n2034, it will be able to pay only about 70 percent of the promised \nbenefits. Diverting payroll taxes for other uses, as this amendment \nallows, could make matters much worse. The date of insolvency could be \nmoved up and arrive earlier. And instead of being able to pay only 70 \npercent of promised benefits, we would be able to pay even less.\n  The issue here is not whether to establish private savings accounts, \nas many have suggested. President Clinton has recommended one form of \nsuch accounts, his USA accounts. Others have similar ideas.\n  But when Social Security already is 30 percent short of being able to \nprovide promised benefits to baby boomers, we can't afford to invade \nits funds for other uses. If we want to establish private accounts, we \ncan use other funds. We shouldn't permit even deeper cuts in guaranteed \nbenefits.\n  It also is important to understand that this amendment would do \nnothing to extend the life of Social Security trust funds. That is not \njust my opinion, it is a fact.\n  To back that up, I have a letter from Mr. Harry Ballantyne, chief \nactuary of the Social Security Administration. As Mr. Ballantyne \nwrites, the adoption of this proposal would have no significant effect \non the long-term solvency of the program--none.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter from the chief \nactuary of the Social Security Administration be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               Social Security Administration,\n\n                                                   April 19, 1999.\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: This letter addresses the \n     potential long-range financial effects on the OASDI program \n     of ``locking away'' the annual increases in the Social \n     Security Trust Funds, as proposed by Republican leaders in \n     the Senate and the House on March 10, 1999. The proposal \n     would require that annual increases in the OASI and DI Trust \n     Funds would be used solely to purchase long-term special \n     issue U.S. government bonds. In addition, the proposal would \n     require that the revenue used for the purchase of these bonds \n     would in turn be used solely for the purpose of reducing \n     Federal debt held by the public. Of course, the net\n\n[[Page S3908]]\n\n     change in the Federal debt held by the public in any year \n     would also be affected by the size of any on-budget deficit \n     or surplus for that year.\n       The proposal would not have any significant effect on the \n     long-range solvency of the OASDI program under the \n     intermediate assumptions of the 1999 Trustees Report. Thus, \n     the estimated long-range actuarial deficit of 2.07 percent of \n     taxable payroll and the year of the combined trust funds' \n     exhaustion (2034) would not change. The first year in which \n     estimated outgo will exceed estimated tax income would not be \n     affected and would therefore remain at 2014.\n       Any plan that reduces the amount of Federal debt held by \n     the public may make later redemption by the Trust Funds of \n     special issue U.S. government bonds easier.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Harry C. Ballantyne,\n                                                    Chief Actuary.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is critical that Congress act \npromptly to extend the solvency of Social Security. President Clinton \nhas presented two related proposals that would extend Social Security's \nlife through 2059. Some of my colleagues don't like those proposals. \nThat is fair. But if they do not like his ideas, they should propose \nsome of their own. So far, they haven't done it. And no one should be \nfooled into believing that this lockbox proposal is an answer.\n  Finally, the most serious problem with this proposal is that it \nthreatens to lead to a Government default. In the short term, that \ncould damage our Nation's credit standing and increase interest costs.\n  Treasury Secretary Rubin has written an excellent letter that \nexplains the severity of the risks posed by this proposal. I note that \nthe distinguished Senator from South Carolina already talked about this \nand has asked that Rubin's letter be printed in the Record. It was \naccepted on a unanimous consent basis. No Senator should vote on the \npending amendment until they have read this letter. And it is hard to \nsee how anyone could endorse the amendment after reading that letter.\n\n  Unfortunately, this amendment could very well lead to a serious debt \ncrisis in the future. Proposed limits on publicly held debt would be \nexceeded if current projections of the non-Social Security budget \nproved too optimistic. And, even if Congress tried in good faith to \ncomply with new public debt limits, those limits could be reached due \nto changes in the economy, demographic shifts, or a variety of other \nfactors.\n  Mr. President, the sponsors of the amendment say that they have \nincluded a provision to ensure that a recession would not trigger a \ndefault. However, that provision won't always work. The provision would \nonly become effective after two quarters of low economic growth. We \ncould be in a deep recession for nearly 7 months before the exemption \nkicks in. By then, it could be too late. We could already be in \ndefault.\n  Mr. President, our Nation has never defaulted on a debt backed by the \nfull faith and credit of the United States. But this amendment could \ntrigger default based on factors completely beyond our control. That \nwouldn't just block Social Security and other checks; it could easily \nlead to a worldwide financial crisis. That could prove catastrophic.\n  Mr. President, this is crazy. If suddenly the economy slows, revenues \ndecline, or expenditures increase unexpectedly, for any reason, why \nshould we risk the world's economy? It is like forcing the whole world \nto play a game of economic Russian roulette.\n  I would note that the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, Congressman Bill Archer, recognizes the folly of this \napproach and strongly opposes it. So this shouldn't be a partisan \nissue. He is not a Democrat. And I hope others on that side of the \naisle will also join in opposition. There are other more responsible \nways to enforce budget discipline. And that is what we Democrats are \nproposing.\n  Senator Conrad and I have developed an alternative lockbox to protect \nsurpluses for both Social Security and Medicare, and we hope to have an \nopportunity to present it to the Senate. Our proposal would reserve all \nSocial Security surpluses for Social Security and a portion of other \nsurpluses for Medicare. Our lockbox would be enforced first by \nrequiring 60 votes to invade the lockbox. Then, if Congress raided \nprojected surpluses, other programs would be cut across the board. We \nthink this makes more sense than the potential triggering of a default \nand a worldwide economic meltdown.\n  So I will briefly review the main problems with the proposal in front \nof us.\n  It does nothing to protect Medicare. It allows Congress to spend \nmoney needed for Medicare on tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  Second, it threatens Social Security. It could block Social Security \nchecks when the economy performs worse than expected. And it includes a \ntrap door that allows Social Security taxes to be invaded for purposes \nother than Social Security benefits, like risky new privatization \nschemes.\n  Finally, the amendment threatens a default on debt backed by the full \nfaith and credit of our country. This could increase interest costs \nimmediately, and ultimately lead to a worldwide economic catastrophe.\n  For all of these reasons, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will \nrecognize the serious problems with this amendment, and that we will be \ngiven an opportunity to offer amendments to improve it.\n  Unfortunately, right now, we Democrats--45 of us--are being prevented \nfrom offering amendments that we think are needed to protect Social \nSecurity and Medicare beneficiaries. We are prohibited by a trick \ncalled filling the amendment tree. This prevents us from offering \namendments, under the Senate rules.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will give us the opportunity to \noffer amendments. We need a lockbox for Social Security. But it should \nbe a real lockbox, without an escape hatch. It should protect Medicare \nas well. And it should be designed in a way that doesn't pose a threat \nof a Government default and a worldwide economic crisis.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we can come together on an understanding--\nthat the 98 Senators present last week voted on--that Social Security \nsurpluses should be reserved exclusively--no ifs, ands, or buts--for \nSocial Security beneficiaries. No loopholes. No escape hatches. No \nlittle crack in the door of the lockbox.\n  I hope our colleagues will think seriously about this when they vote. \nAnd I want the American public to take note of what is going on here. \nThey are the final arbiters of whether or not we are doing the right \nthing.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for his courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, a few weeks ago I reintroduced the National \nSalvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act, S. 655. This bipartisan \nbill has several cosponsors including Senator Breaux. It is similar to \nthe measure that Senator Ford and I coauthored during the 105th \nCongress.\n  This responsible legislation is important to used car buyers and \nmotorists across the country because it will help curtail motor vehicle \ntitling fraud. It does so by providing states with incentives to adopt \nminimal uniform definitions and standards that promote greater \ndisclosure to potential used vehicle purchasers.\n  During the last Congress, this legislation received the formal \nsupport of over 55 of our colleagues from both sides of the aisle and a \nmodified version passed the House of Representatives by an overwhelming \nmajority last October.\n  Mr. President, every year used car buyers throughout the nation are \ncheated by those who pass off rebuilt salvage vehicles as undamaged. \nThese consumers are never notified that the used vehicle they purchased \nwas totaled and subsequently rebuilt. Often times, they find out only \nwhen the supposedly undamaged car or truck they bought is taken in for \nrepair. It is at this point that they find their vehicle has been \nrebuilt and that it may pose a safety hazard. One where the cost of \nrepair far exceeds the vehicle's worth or which cannot be fixed for \nsafe operation\n  Today, used car buyers and automobile dealers are paying over $4 \nbillion dollars annually for vehicles that have been rebuilt--many of \nwhich are virtually worthless. It is happening in Mississippi and in \nyour own states. Title laundering is a growing problem. It must be \nstopped.\n  Congress recognized the primary reason that millions of structurally \nunsafe vehicles were being placed back on America's roads and highways \nwas due to the lack of uniformity in state titling rules. That is why \nthe 103rd Congress passed the Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992 which required \nthe Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish a task force, the \nMotor Vehicle Titling, Registration and Salvage Advisory Committee, to \nstudy problems related to motor vehicle fraud and theft. The Act \ndirected the Committee to include representatives from several cabinet \nagencies, police chiefs and municipal auto theft investigators, State \nmotor vehicle officials, industry and insurance representatives, \nrecyclers, salvage yard operators, and scrap processors. Their primary \nfunction was to develop reasonable and balanced recommendations that \nwould protect consumers.\n  The Salvage Advisory Committee was formed in 1993. It was chaired by \nthe Chief of the Odometer Fraud Staff for the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration. It included the Justice Department's Assistant \nDirector for Consumer Litigation and a senior attorney from the \nCriminal Justice Division. It also included several Secretaries of \nState, State DMV Directors and other stakeholders. These are the \nexperts on the front line who deal with titling issues on a day-to-day \nbasis that Congress chose for the Committee. The Salvage Advisory \nCommittee deliberated for almost a year and issued its findings in \nFebruary 1994. The Committee's report identified a series of practical, \nwell thought out solutions to address the issue of title washing. It \nincluded the establishment of national uniform titling definitions and \nstandards for salvage, rebuilt salvage, flood, and non-repairable \npassenger vehicles.\n  This esteemed group knew what would work and what would not. They did \nnot recommend a complex, overly burdensome titling and registration \nscheme. Instead, they identified a few definitions that should be \nstandardized and minimal procedures that should be adopted by states.\n  The task force recommended that a passenger vehicle that experiences \ndamage exceeding 75% of its pre-accident value be designated as \n``salvage.''\n  It also recommended that salvage vehicles that have been repaired for \nsafe operation be branded ``rebuilt salvage,'' have an inspection to \ndetermine whether stolen parts were used to fix the vehicle, and have a \ndecal permanently affixed to the driver's door jamb indicating the \nvehicle's history.\n  The Salvage Committee identified a nonrepairable vehicle as a \npassenger motor vehicle that is incapable of safe operation for use on \nroads or highways and which has no resale value except as a source of \nparts or scrap.\n  Another recommendation included the carrying forward of all brands on \nnew title documents so that the terms used in one state would be \nidentified on the titles of other states where the vehicle is re-\nregistered.\n  Mr. President, Senator Ford and I simply authored a bill during the \nlast Congress that codified these task force recommendations.\n  The bill also included a slightly modified definition of flood \nvehicles. One that focuses on the electrical and mechanical damage \nresulting from excessive water. The task force originally recommended \nthat all passenger vehicles submerged in water that has reached over \nthe door sill or has entered the passenger or trunk damage be \ndesignated as a flood vehicle.\n  Upon further reflection, and actual real world experience, the flood \ndefinition in this legislation was modified to brand only those \nvehicles that suffer debilitating damage instead of simply cosmetic \ndamage, such as wet carpeting, that would have occurred under the \noriginal flood definition. The reason for this change was to ensure \nthat a consumer's vehicle is not branded as a flood vehicle merely \nbecause its floor mats got wet. It makes no sense to brand a car or a \ntruck as a flood vehicle, causing a significant and unnecessary \ndevaluation of its worth, when the vehicle's operating functions and \nelectrical, mechanical or computerized components are not damaged by \nwater. This legislation also improves upon the task force's \nrecommendations by including any vehicle acquired by an insurer as part \nof a water damage settlement.\n  S. 655, the National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act \nretains these important provisions and also includes additional \ntechnical corrections offered by state Attorneys General, consumer \ngroups, and the U.S. Department of Transportation. Modifications that \nimprove the legislation but do not take it in a completely different \ndirection than proposed by the Salvage Advisory Committee. The changes \nI have made are consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in New \nYork v. United States, 505 U.S. 144. The bill now includes the complete \nrange of modifications that states are willing to make to their own \ntitling rules and procedures. To push the envelope further by advancing \nprescriptive federal titling standards would seriously hinder Congress' \nefforts to achieve full state participation. Stricter titling \nrequirements, those that create unnecessary and onerous procedures, \nadditional paperwork, and more bureaucracy may also impose an unfunded \nmandate on states.\n\n  Mr. President, my colleagues and I believe that it is time to act \nupon the task force's now five-year old recommendations by enacting the \nNational Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act. A number of \nhearings have been held on this issue in both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate. All with the same conclusion--title \nwashing is a serious problem affecting the wallets of used car buyers \nand the safety of motorists nationwide. Since the Salvage Advisory \nCommittee issued its report in 1994, consumers have lost as much as $20 \nbillion and as many as 8 million more potentially structurally unsafe \nvehicles have been placed back on our nation's roads and highways. Some \nof the unsafe salvage vehicles stealthfully returned to the road were \nprevious Department of Transportation crash test cars. These are cars \nthat were deliberately wrecked, then rebuilt and sold to unsuspecting \nbuyers across America.\n  The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act would help \nput unscrupulous rebuilders out of business. It is a workable and well \naccepted legislative solution. It establishes a rational voluntary \nuniform titling regime that state Motor Vehicle administrators support. \nThe bill is also supported by law enforcement agencies, consumers, and \nthe automobile and insurance industries because it is a common sense \napproach that will effectively curtail title laundering.\n  It is a program that state legislatures will adopt because it is a \nwin-win\n\n[[Page S3910]]\n\nfor consumers, states, and industry. That is key. Congress should not \nspin its wheels and push for a burdensome and overly complex titling \nscheme that most states will reject even if they are eligible to \nreceive offsetting federal funding or are penalized in some way for not \nadopting such a scheme. The only winners under such a scenario are the \nthieves and charlatans who will continue to take advantage of state \ninconsistencies by washing the titles of severely damaged vehicles.\n  Instead of being a federal mandate, The National Salvage Motor \nVehicle Consumer Protection Act provides participating states with a \nnew incentive grant to adopt uniform titling and registration \nstandards. These standards will protect the used car buyers in their \nstates from unknowingly purchasing totaled and subsequently rebuilt \nvehicles. The authorized funding can be used by states to issue new \ntitles, establish and administer vehicle theft or safety inspections, \nenforce titling requirements, and for other related purposes.\n  Mr. President, since this is a voluntary program, no state will be \npenalized for non participation.\n  Mr. President, this particular approach was recommended by the \nDepartment of Transportation. It was a sound recommendation and I \naccepted it.\n  This modification is good public policy since it no longer links \nstate participation with federal seed money for states to participate \nin the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS).\n  NMVTIS is beneficial to states because it will allow them to \ninstantaneously share and retrieve titling and registration information \nwith each other. The effectiveness of NMVTIS depends on the total \nnumber of states that choose to participate in the system. Thus, it is \nimportant to have the maximum number of states using NMVTIS whether or \nnot they utilize common terms. The Congressional Budget Office \nconcluded in 1997 that a penalty-based titling branding scheme which \ndenies states funding for NMVTIS would significantly reduce the number \nof states that choose to utilize the system. This, in turn, would \nseverely undermine the intent of the 103rd Congress which created \nNMVTIS and would jeopardize the overall effectiveness of a nationwide \ntitling information system.\n  I think it is also important to note that the National Salvage Motor \nVehicle Consumer Protection Act does not recommend definitions or \nstandards that none of the 50 states currently have in place. Instead, \nthis legislation accepts, codifies, and in some cases improves upon the \nrecommendations put forward by a Congressionally mandated task force. A \ncommission created by a Democratically controlled Congress to \nspecifically address the issue of title fraud.\n  The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act goes even \nfurther in the direction of promoting disclosure by requiring a written \ndisclosure statement be provided to purchasers of rebuilt salvage \nvehicles. It permits states to use terms that are synonymous with those \nidentified in the bill. And, it expressly allows states to adopt even \ngreater disclosure standards than are provided for in the legislation. \nIn the case of salvage vehicles, it lets states adopt an even lower \nthreshold than 75% if they so choose. It does not, however, establish a \nminimum baseline of 65%, a threshold that no state in the union has \ntoday. None. The 65% threshold would negatively affect tens of millions \nof car owners with low value vehicles. A proposal advanced by some that \nwould unnecessarily brand for life the vehicles of low income drivers \ninvolved in minor accidents such as fender-benders.\n  There are similar counter-productive proposals that would brand \nvehicles that have only slight cosmetic and structural damage such as a \ndented front end and a busted headlight. Who benefits from this? Who \nwill be harmed by this? I want answers to these questions. America's \nmotor vehicle owners deserve answers to these questions.\n  I think my colleagues will agree that Congress should not force \nstates into enacting standards that adversely impact consumers or \ntitling provisions that not even one state has chosen to adopt. \nRemember, these well intentioned but impractical, confusing, and unwise \nproposals have been around for many years. States, as well as the task \nforce, expressly rejected them. No one who works on vehicle titling \nissues wants them.\n  Let me say again that the National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer \nProtection Act creates a voluntary federal titling program. It creates \nminimal national standards while offering participating states the \nflexibility they need and want to adopt additional disclosure \nrequirements and more stringent provisions. It provides appropriate \nvehicle titling terms and definitions that do not unnecessarily devalue \nvehicles or cause repairable automobiles to be junked. The bill focuses \non pre-purchase disclosure, helps motorists by requiring the tracking \nof salvage vehicle VIN numbers, continues consumers' ability to pursue \nprivate rights of actions available under state law, and allows states \nto adopt new civil and criminal penalties. And, it has wide-spread \nsupport.\n  The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act is the \nright legislative solution to combat title fraud. It solves the problem \nwithout creating new problems and new headaches for consumers, for \nstates, and for industry. It is time for Congress to pass this \nimportant measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/20/senate-section/article/S3910-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 1999. This bill has passed the Senate under \nunanimous consent thanks to the leadership of its sponsor Senator \nWarner, and Senator Chafee, Chair of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and Senator Baucus, the ranking member on the Committee. I \nwant to thank the Senators for their work.\n  Included in this legislation is a request that the Army Corps of \nEngineers evaluate plans to alleviate flooding and make other \nimprovements to the Muddy River, which runs through Brookline and \nBoston, Massachusetts. This is an urgently needed project.\n  The Muddy River flows through mostly urban-residential areas in \nBrookline and Boston before emptying into the Charles River. The River \nhas flooded several times in the past, with two particularly severe \nfloods in 1996 and 1998. The 1996 flood was a presidentially declared \ndisaster. It lasted three days, submerged parts of Brookline and Boston \nin knee-deep water, flooded underground Massachusetts Bay \nTransportation Authority stations and halted commuter train traffic, \nand extensively damaged homes and businesses. Massachusetts Governor \nPaul Cellucci estimates that the cost of these two floods exceeded \n$100,000,000. Preventing future damage from floods is a top priority \nfor the Town of Brookline, the City of Boston and the State of \nMassachusetts, and each has pledged to do their part to find a \nsolution.\n  Specifically, the Water Resources Development Act of 1999 asks the \nSecretary of the Army to evaluate a study called the ``Emerald Necklace \nEnvironmental Improvement Master Plan:\n\n[[Page S3911]]\n\nPhase I Muddy River Flood Control, Water Quality and Environmental \nEnhancement'', and to report its findings to Congress by December 31, \n1999. The Plan was commissioned by the Boston Parks and Recreation \nDepartment and issued in January 1999. It presents a solution that has \nbroad community support. Residents and businesses joined with the Town \nof Brookline, City of Boston, State of Massachusetts and the federal \ngovernment to develop this plan. It draws on research by the Army Corps \nof Engineers, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and others to \nrecommend comprehensive improvements to end destructive flooding, \nenhance water quality and protect habitat. I believe this project \nembodies the kind of citizen-government partnership that is necessary \nfor an efficient and successful use of federal resources.\n  The Massachusetts delegation, the Town of Brookline, the City of \nBoston and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts all look forward to \nworking with the Army Corps in Boston and Washington over the coming \nmonths to complete this evaluation by the end of the year, and to move \nahead with the work of ending these destructive floods and making other \nneeded improvements.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 1999, passed by the Senate yesterday, incorporates \nso many projects of importance to the Great Lakes region. I am \nespecially pleased that so many of these projects serve to reinforce \nthe pre-eminent leadership of the Chicago regional office in meeting \nthe environmental responsibilities assigned to the Army Corps of \nEngineers in past reauthorizations of the Water Resources Development \nAct.\n  Mr. President, the Water Resources Development Act of 1999 \nincorporates a very important matter which I have considered a priority \nfor some time. The subject is contaminated sediments and they are a \npotential threat to public and environmental health across the country. \nPersistent, bioaccumulative toxic substances in contaminated sediment \ncan poison the food chain, making fish and shellfish unsafe for humans \nand wildlife to eat. Contamination of sediments can also interfere with \nrecreational uses and increase the costs of and time needed for \nnavigational dredging and subsequent disposal of dredged material.\n  Unfortunately, the resources of the federal government have not been \nbrought to bear on these problems in a well coordinated fashion. \nSection 222 of this Act will require the Environmental Protection \nAgency and Army Corps of Engineers to finally activate the National \nContaminated Sediment Task Force that was mandated by the Water \nResources Development Act of 1992. I am hopeful that convening this \nTask Force will encourage the Federal agencies to work together to \ncombat this problem and create greater public awareness of the need to \naddress contaminated sediments. We also need a better understanding of \nthe quantities and sources of sediment contamination, to prevent \nrecontamination and minimize the recurrence of these costs and impacts, \nand to get a handle on the extent of the public health threat. To that \nend, the Act requires the Task Force to report on the status of \nremedial action on contaminated sediments around the country, including \na description of the authorities used in cleanup, the nature and \nsources of sediment contamination, the methods for determining the need \nfor cleanup, the fate of dredged materials and barriers to swift \nremediation.\n  Mr. President, as the Democratic Co-Chair of the Senate Great Lakes \nTask Force, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight several \nspecific programs included in this bill which were developed through \nthe bipartisan and bicameral cooperation of the members of this Task \nForce. Extension of cost-sharing rules to allow non-traditional \npartners such as non-profit organizations to partner with the Army \nCorps of Engineers on restoration activities will greatly expand the \npotential uses of these authorities in the Great Lakes basin (Sections \n205 and 206). Section 224(2) will enhance the authority of the Corps to \nwork cooperatively with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission to make more \nefficient use of Corps' engineering expertise in constructing barriers \nand traps to reduce these aggressive invaders. Section 225 authorizes a \nspecial study on the watershed of the western basin of Lake Erie to \nenhance the integration of disparate elements of the Corps' program in \nthis region. Section 223, the Great Lakes Basin Program incorporates \nthree high-profile elements critical to the region as a whole which \nwere developed through extensive negotiations among Task Force members \nat the end of the 105th Congress.\n  The first element of the Great Lakes Basin Program (Section 223a) \ndirects the Army Corps of Engineers to develop a framework for their \nactivities in the Great Lakes basin to be updated biennially. Many Army \nCorps of Engineers divisions have developed and use such strategic \nplans. Among other strengths, such plans allow greater programatic \ncoordination--especially among projects conducted for such disparate \npurposes as navigation, environmental restoration, water quality, and \nflood control. Development of such a strategic plan for the Great Lakes \nbasin has never been more important than at present, given the recent \nrestructuring of the Army Corps of Engineers which leaves the Great \nLakes and Ohio River division as the only Army Corps of Engineers \ndivision maintaining two regional offices (Chicago and Cincinnati).\n  The second element of the Great Lakes Basin Program (Section 223b) \ndirects the Army Corps of Engineers to inventory existing information \nrelevant to the Great Lakes biohydrological system and sustainable \nwater use management. The Corps is to report to Congress, as well as to \nthe International Joint Commission and the eight Great Lakes states, on \nthe results of this inventory and recommendations on how to improve the \ninformation base. This information is crucial to the ongoing debate \nregarding attempts to export or divert Great Lakes surface and ground \nwater out of the basin. The closely related provision, contained in \nsubsection (e), on water use activities and policies, allows the \nSecretary to provide technical assistance to the Great Lakes states in \ndevelopment of interstate guidelines to improve consistency and \nefficiency of State-level water use activities and policies.\n  The third major element of the Great Lakes Basin Program (Section \n223c) directs the Army Corps of Engineers to submit to Congress a \nreport based on existing information detailing the economic benefits of \nrecreational boating in the Great Lakes basin. As many of my colleagues \nmay know, despite Congress' repeated objections, consecutive \nAdministrations have unwisely sought to limit the Corps' role in \ndredging recreational harbors. Clearly these harbors' value to the \nregional economy should be recognized in the cost-benefit analyses used \nin making dredging decisions. For the Great Lakes region, dredging of \nthese recreational harbors will be of increasing importance in the \ncoming year as Great Lakes water levels decline from the high of the \npast several years.\n  Mr. President, I also wish to take a moment in closing to highlight \nthe several specific projects included in the recently passed bill \nwhich will benefit my home state of Michigan. They include an Army \nCorps feasibility study of improvements to the Detroit River waterfront \nas part of the ongoing revitalization of the area.

Mr. President, one of the key virtues of living in a free \nsociety such as our own is that it's harder\n\n[[Page S3912]]\n\nfor injustice to remain hidden and unreported. Unlike Communist and \nfascist countries--countries where the government can control access to \ninformation, and cover up genocide and war crimes for years--in our \ncountry, people are allowed to stand up and tell the truth. They can \nreveal inconvenient and unpleasant facts about moral evils that are \ntaking place in our society.\n  To speak the truth--to distinguish right from wrong, you don't have \nto be a President, or a Senator, or a famous human rights crusader like \nMartin Luther King, Jr. You can be anybody. You can be a medical \ntechnician in Cincinnati, OH.\n  Mr. President, let me tell you a story about how--very recently, in \nmy home State of Ohio--some disturbing truths were revealed that many \nAmericans simply wish would go away.\n  On April 6, a young woman went into an abortion clinic in Montgomery \nCounty, OH, to undergo a procedure known as partial-birth abortion. \nThis is a procedure that usually takes place behind closed doors, where \nit can be ignored, its moral status left unquestioned.\n  But this particular procedure was different. In this procedure, on \nApril 6, things did not go as planned. Here's what happened.\n  The Dayton, OH, abortionist, Dr. Martin Haskell, started a procedure \nto dilate her cervix, so the child could eventually be removed and \nkilled. He applied seaweed to start the procedure. He then sent her \nhome--because this procedure usually takes 2 or 3 days. In fact, the \npatient is supposed to return on the second day for a further \napplication of seaweed--and then come back a third time for the actual \npartial-birth abortion--a 3-day procedure.\n  So the woman went home to Cincinnati, expecting to return to Dayton \nand complete the procedure in 2 or 3 days. But her cervix dilated far \ntoo quickly. Shortly after midnight on the first day, after \nexperiencing severe stomach pains, she was admitted to Bethesda North \nHospital in Cincinnati.\n  The child was born. After 3 hours and 8 minutes, this little girl \ndied.\n  The cause of death was listed on the death certificate as \n``prematurity secondary to induced abortion.''\n  True enough, Mr. President. But also on the death certificate is a \nspace for ``Method of death.'' And it says, in the case of this child, \n``Method of death: natural.''\n  I do not mean to quarrel, talk about whether this is true in the \ntechnical sense. But if you look at the events that led up to her \ndeath, you'll see that there was really nothing natural about them at \nall.\n  The medical technician who held that little girl for the 3 hours and \n8 minutes of her short life named her Baby Hope. Baby Hope did not die \nof natural causes. She was the victim of a barbaric procedure that is \nopposed by the vast majority of the American people. A procedure that \nhas twice been banned by act of Congress--only to see the ban \nrepeatedly overturned by a Presidential veto.\n  The death of Baby Hope did not take place behind the closed doors of \nan abortion clinic. It took place in public--in a hospital dedicated to \nsaving lives, not taking them. Her death reminds us of the brutal \nreality and tragedy of what partial-birth abortion really is.\n  When we voted to ban partial-birth abortions, we talked about this \nprocedure in graphic detail. The public reaction to this disclosure--\nthe disclosure of what partial-birth abortion really is--was loud and \nit was decisive. And there is a very good reason for this. The \nprocedure is barbaric.\n  One of the first questions people ask is ``why?''\n  ``Why do they do this procedure? Is it really necessary? Why do we \nallow this to happen?''\n  Dr. C. Everett Koop speaks for the consensus of the medical \nprofession when he says this is never a medically necessary procedure. \nEven Martin Haskell--the abortionist in the Baby Hope case--has \nadmitted that at least 80 percent of the partial-birth abortions he \nperforms are elective.\n  The facts are clear. Partial-birth abortion is not that rare a \nprocedure. What is rare is that we--as a society--saw it happen. It \nhappened by surprise at a regular hospital where it wasn't supposed to \nhappen.\n  Baby Hope was not supposed to die in the arms of a medical \ntechnician. But she did. And this little baby cannot be easily ignored. \nWe cannot turn our back on this reality.\n  This procedure is not limited to mothers and fetuses who are in \ndanger. It is performed on healthy women--and healthy babies--all the \ntime.\n  The goal of a partial-birth abortion is not to protect somebody's \nhealth but to kill a child. That is what the abortionist wants to do.\n  Dr. Haskell himself has said as much. In an interview with the \nAmerican Medical News, he said:\n\n       You could dilate further and deliver the baby alive but \n     that's really not the point.\n       The point is, you are attempting to do an abortion, and \n     that is the goal of your work, is to complete an abortion, \n     not to see how do I manipulate the situation so I get a live \n     birth instead.\n\n  Now Dr. Haskell has admitted what the reality is. Why don't we?\n  Again, let's hear Dr. Haskell in his own words, a man who performed \nthis abortion on Baby Hope. This is what Dr. Haskell says about this \n``procedure.''\n  These are Dr. Haskell's words:\n\n       I just kept on doing the D's [dilation and extraction] \n     because that is what I was comfortable with, up until 24 \n     weeks. But they were very tough. Sometimes it was a 45-minute \n     operation. I noticed some of the later D were very, very \n     easy. So I asked myself why can't they all happen this way. \n     You see the easy ones would have a foot length presentation, \n     you'd reach up and grab the foot of the fetus, pull the fetus \n     down and the head would hang up and then you would collapse \n     the head and take it out. It was easy.\n\n  It was easy, Mr. President. Easy for Dr. Haskell. He does not say it \nwas easy for the mother, and he certainly does not say it was easy for \nthe baby. I suspect he doesn't care. His goal is to perform abortions. \nBut is he the person we are going to trust to decide when abortions are \nnecessary? Dr. Haskell has a production line going in Dayton, OH. \nNothing is going to stop him from meeting his quota.\n  Dr. Haskell continues. Again, the words of Dr. Haskell:\n\n       At first, I would reach around trying to identify a lower \n     extremity blindly with the tip of my instrument. I'd get it \n     right about 30-50 percent of the time. Then I said, ``Well, \n     gee, if I just put the ultrasound up there, I could see it \n     all and I wouldn't have to feel around for it.'' I did that \n     and sure enough, I found it 99 percent of the time. Kind of \n     serendipity.\n\n  Serendipity, Mr. President.\n  Let me conclude. We need to ask ourselves, what does our toleration \nin this country of this ``procedure'' say about us as a nation? Where \ndo we draw the line? At what point do we finally stop saying, ``Well, I \ndon't really like this, but it doesn't really matter to me, so I will \nput up with it''? When do we stop saying that as a country, Mr. \nPresident? At what point do we say, ``Unless we stop this from \nhappening, we cannot justly call ourselves a civilized Nation''?\n  When you come right down to it, America's moral anesthetic is wearing \noff. It really is. We know what is going on behind the curtain, and we \ncannot wish that knowledge away. We have to face it, and we have to do \nwhat is right.\n  This week, some of my colleagues and I will be reintroducing the \nPartial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Twice in the last 3 years, Congress has \npassed this legislation with strong bipartisan support, only to see it \nfall victim to a Presidential veto. Once again, I am confident Congress \nwill do the right thing and pass this very important legislation. But \nthat is not enough. Passing this legislation in Congress is not enough. \nFor lives to be saved, the bill must actually become law.\n  Mr. President, if something happens behind the iron curtain of an \nabortion clinic, it is easier to pretend it simply did not happen. But \nthe death of Baby Hope in Cincinnati, OH, in the last few days has torn \nthat curtain, revealing the truth of this barbaric procedure.\n  Let people not ask about us 50 years from now: How could they not \nhave known? or ask: Why didn't they do anything? because, Mr. \nPresident, the fact is, we do know and we must take action.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/20/senate-section/article/S3912-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3912-S3913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S3913]]\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/20/senate-section/article/S3913-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT ON FEDERAL CLIMATE CHANGE EXPENDITURES--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 19\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with section 573 of the Foreign Operations, Export \nFinancing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1999, as contained \nin the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations \nAct, 1999 (Public Law 105-277), I transmit herewith an account of all \nFederal agency climate change programs and activities.

A bill to extend the commercial space launch damage \nindemnification provisions of section 70113 of title 49, United States \nCode; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n       commercial space launch industry indemnification extension\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to extend the \ncommercial space launch indemnification.\n  As a result of the discussions over the last year on the alleged \nChina technology transfer situation, the need to ensure that the United \nStates launch companies maintain a competitive position in the \nInternational launch market has never been greater. One of the more \nimportant features of the Commercial Space Launch Act (``CSLA'') to the \ncommercial industry is the comprehensive risk allocation provisions. \nThe provisions are comprised of: (1) cross-waivers of liability among \nlaunch participants; (2) a demonstration of financial responsibility; \nand (3) a commitment (subject to appropriations) by the U.S. Government \nto pay successful third party claims above $500 million.\n  Since its establishment, this three-pronged approach has been \nextremely attractive to the customers, contractors, and subcontractors \nof the U.S. launch licensee and to the contractors and subcontractors \nof its customers, as they are all participants in and beneficiaries of \nCSLA. As such, it has enabled the U.S. launch services industry to \ncompete effectively with its foreign counterparts who offer similar \ncoverage.\n\n[[Page S3915]]\n\n  This ability to compete effectively will be threatened on December \n31, 1999. At that time, the most important element of the CSLA \ninsurance section, the U.S. Government payment of claims provision, is \nscheduled to sunset. Without this provision, the advances in market \nshare that this burgeoning U.S. industry has made--an industry that is \ncritical to U.S. national security, foreign policy and economic \ninterests--will be lost.\n  The indemnification has been extended previously for a period of 5 \nyears. This bill extends the authorization for this indemnification for \nan additional 10 years. With this length of extension, companies will \nbe able to finalize strategic plans in a more stable environment.\n  Therefore, I, along with my cosponsors, urge the Members of this body \nto support this bill and to provide the needed legislation which will \nallow this key industry continuous operation in a safe and responsible \nmanner.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 834. A bill to withhold voluntary proportional assistance for \nprograms and projects of the International Atomic Energy Agency \nrelating to the development and completion of the Bushehr nuclear power \nplant in Iran, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n             the iran nuclear nonproliferation act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I address an issue that is of \nvital importance to the national security of our country and the \nstability of the Middle East. While Iran's development of nuclear \ntechnologies has been a growing concern for the last few years, recent \ndevelopments demand a response to this serious situation.\n  Last November, Iran signed an accord with Russia to speed up \ncompletion of the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, calling for an expansion \nof the current design and construction of the $800 million, 1,000 \nmegawatt light-water reactor in southern Iran. Despite serious United \nStates objections and concerns about the project, Russia maintains its \nlongstanding support for the project and the development of Iran's \nnuclear program. Though Russian and Iranian governments insist that the \nreactor will be used for civilian energy purposes, the United States \nnational security community believes that the project is too easy a \ncover for Iran to obtain vital Russian nuclear weapons technology. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu condemned the Iranian-Russian \nnuclear cooperation accord as a threat to the entire region, stating:\n\n       The building of a nuclear reactor in Iran only makes it \n     likelier that Iran will equip its ballistic missiles with \n     nuclear warheads. . . . Such a development threatens peace, \n     the whole region and in the end, the Russians themselves.\n\n  On January 13 of this year, the administration underscored the \ngravity of this situation and imposed economic sanctions against three \nRussian institutes for supplying Iran with nuclear technology. But, I \nbelieve more needs to be done.\n  While the Khatami government in Iran has made some reform efforts \nsince it was elected in 1997, Iran continues to oppose the Middle East \npeace process, has broadened its efforts to increase its weapons of \nmass destruction, and remains subject to the influences of its hard-\nline defense establishment. As reports of Iran's human rights \nviolations continue, State Department reports on international \nterrorism indicate Iran's continued assistance to terrorist forces such \nas Hamas, Hizballah, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. This clear and \nconsistent record of behavior seriously calls to question Iran's active \npursuit to enhance its nuclear facilities.\n  Though Iran's efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction have \nbeen a growing global concern for several years, international fears \nwere confirmed when in July of last year, Iran demonstrated the \nstrength of its offensive muscle by test-firing its latest Shahab-3 \nmissle. Capable of propelling a 2,200-pound warhead for a range of 800 \nmiles, this missile now allows Iran to pose a significant threat to our \nallies in the Middle East.\n  The potential results of Iran's successful development of effective \nnuclear technologies hold horrific implications for the stability of \nthe Middle East. As an original cosponsor of the Iran Missile \nProliferation Sanctions Act of 1997, and signatory of two letters in \nthe 105th Congress to the administration to raise this issue with the \nRussian leadership, I believe the Senate must continue the effort in \nlight of this growing threat.\n  Today I am joined by Senator Sessions in introducing the Iran Nuclear \nProliferation Prevention Act of 1999 as a means to hinder the \ndevelopment of Iran's nuclear weapons program. The House version of \nthis legislation is also being introduced today by Congressman Menendez \nof New Jersey. This bill requires the withholding of proportional \nvoluntary United States assistance to the International Atomic Energy \nAgency (IAEA) for programs and projects supported by the Agency in \nIran. This legislation specifically aims to limit the Agency's \nassistance of the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant.\n  Last October, this legislation was passed in the House by a recorded \nvote of 405 to 13, but was not considered by the Senate before the \nadjournment of the 105th Congress. In the interest of United States \nnational security and for that of our allies, it is vital we ensure \nthat United States funds are not promoting the development of Iran's \nnuclear capabilities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks and I urge my colleagues to support passage of \nthis bill.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 834\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Iran Nuclear Proliferation \n     Prevention Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Iran remains the world's leading sponsor of \n     international terrorism and is on the Department of State's \n     list of countries that provide support for acts of \n     international terrorism.\n       (2) Iran has repeatedly called for the destruction of \n     Israel and Iran supports organizations, such as Hizballah, \n     Hamas, and the Palestine Islamic Jihad, which are responsible \n     for terrorist attacks against Israel.\n       (3) Iranian officials have stated their intent to complete \n     at least three nuclear power plants by 2015 and are currently \n     working to complete the Bushehr nuclear power plant located \n     on the Persian Gulf coast.\n       (4) The United States has publicly opposed the completion \n     of reactors at the Bushehr nuclear power plant because the \n     transfer of civilian nuclear technology and training could \n     help to advance Iran's nuclear weapons program.\n       (5) In an April 1997 hearing before the Subcommittee on \n     Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs of the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations of the Senate, the former Director of the \n     Central Intelligence Agency, James Woolsey, stated that \n     through the operation of the nuclear power reactor at the \n     Bushehr nuclear power plant, Iran will develop substantial \n     expertise relevant to the development of nuclear weapons.\n       (6) Construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant was \n     halted following the 1979 revolution in Iran because the \n     former West Germany refused to assist in the completion of \n     the plant due to concerns that completion of the plant could \n     provide Iran with expertise and technology which could \n     advance Iran's nuclear weapons program.\n       (7) In January 1995, Iran signed a $780,000,000 contract \n     with the Russian Federation for Atomic Energy (MINATOM) to \n     complete a VVER-1000 pressurized-light water reactor at the \n     Bushehr nuclear power plant and in November 1998, Iran and \n     Russia signed a protocol to expedite the construction of the \n     nuclear reactor, setting a new timeframe of 52 months for its \n     completion.\n       (8) In November 1998, Iran asked Russia to prepare a \n     feasibility study to build 3 more nuclear reactors at the \n     Bushehr site.\n       (9) Iran is building up its offensive military capacity in \n     other areas as evidenced by its recent testing of engines for \n     ballistic missiles capable of carrying 2,200 pound warheads \n     more than 800 miles, within range of strategic targets in \n     Israel.\n       (10) Iran ranks tenth among the 105 nations receiving \n     assistance from the technical cooperation program of the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency.\n       (11) Between 1995 and 1999, the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency has provided and is expected to provide a total of \n     $1,550,000 through its Technical Assistance and Cooperation \n     Fund for the Iranian nuclear power program, including \n     reactors at the Bushehr nuclear power plant.\n       (12) In 1999 the International Atomic Energy Agency \n     initiated a program to assist Iran in the area of uranium \n     exploration. At the same time it is believed that Iran is \n     seeking to acquire the requisite technology to enrich uranium \n     to weapons-grade levels.\n\n[[Page S3916]]\n\n       (13) The United States provides annual contributions to the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency which total more than 25 \n     percent of the annual assessed budget of the Agency, and the \n     United States also provides annual voluntary contributions to \n     the Technical Assistance and Cooperation Fund of the Agency \n     which total approximately 32 percent ($18,250,000 in 1999) of \n     the annual budget of the program.\n       (14) The United States should not voluntarily provide \n     funding for the completion of nuclear power reactors which \n     could provide Iran with substantial expertise to advance its \n     nuclear weapons program and potentially pose a threat to the \n     United States or its allies.\n       (15) Iran has no need for nuclear energy because of its \n     immense oil and natural gas reserves which are equivalent to \n     9.3 percent of the world's reserves, and Iran has \n     73,000,000,000 cubic feet of natural gas, an amount second \n     only to the natural gas reserves of Russia.\n\n     SEC. 3. WITHHOLDING OF VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE \n                   INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY FOR PROGRAMS \n                   AND PROJECTS IN IRAN.\n\n       Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2227) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d) Notwithstanding subsection (c), the limitations of \n     subsection (a) shall apply to programs and projects of the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency in Iran, unless the \n     Secretary of State determines, and reports in writing to the \n     Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n     Senate, that such programs and projects are consistent with \n     United States nuclear nonproliferation and safety goals, will \n     not provide Iran with training or expertise relevant to the \n     development of nuclear weapons, and are not being used as a \n     cover for the acquisition of sensitive nuclear technology. A \n     determination made by the Secretary of State under the \n     preceding sentence shall be effective for the 1-year period \n     beginning on the date of the determination.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act and on an annual basis thereafter for 5 \n     years, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the \n     United States representative to the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency, shall prepare and submit to Congress a report \n     that--\n       (1) describes the total amount of annual assistance to Iran \n     provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency, a list of \n     Iranian officials in leadership positions at the Agency, the \n     expected timeframe for the completion of the nuclear power \n     reactors at the Bushehr nuclear power plant, and a summary of \n     the nuclear materials and technology transferred to Iran from \n     the Agency in the preceding year which could assist in the \n     development of Iran's nuclear weapons program; and\n       (2) contains a description of all programs and projects of \n     the International Atomic Energy Agency in each country \n     described in section 307(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (22 U.S.C. 2227(a)) and any inconsistencies between the \n     technical cooperation and assistance programs and projects of \n     the Agency and United States nuclear nonproliferation and \n     safety goals in these countries.\n       (b) Additional Requirement.--The report required to be \n     submitted under subsection (a) shall be submitted in an \n     unclassified form, to the extent appropriate, but may include \n     a classified annex.\n\n     SEC. 7. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States should \n     pursue internal reforms at the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency that will ensure that all programs and projects funded \n     under the Technical Cooperation and Assistance Fund of the \n     Agency are compatible with United States nuclear \n     nonproliferation policy and international nuclear \n     nonproliferation norms.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mr. Dodd, Mr. Edwards, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Graham, Mr. Kerry, \n        Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Mack, Mr. \n        Moynihan, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, Mr. Robb, Mr. Sarbanes, and \n        Mr. Warner):\n  S. 835. A bill to encourage the restoration of estuary habitat \nthrough more efficient project financing and enhanced coordination of \nFederal and non-Federal restoration programs, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n          estuary habitat restoration partnership act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprotect our nation's estuaries--the Estuary Habitat Restoration \nPartnership Act of 1999. I am pleased to introduce this bill with \nSenator Breaux and so many other distinguished members of the Senate. I \nam particularly pleased that there is strong bipartisan support among \nthe 16 cosponsors of this bill. Such support underscores the importance \nof estuaries to our economy and to our environment.\n  To understand the importance of this bill, we must first understand \nexactly what estuaries are and why they are so significant. Estuaries \nare the bays, lagoons, and inlets created when rivers and oceans meet, \nmixing fresh and salt water, creating one of our most economically and \nenvironmentally valuable natural resources. They support diverse \nhabitats--from shellfish beds to beaches to sea grass meadows. \nEstuaries are a crucial component of unique and fragile ecosystems that \nsupport marine mammals, birds, and wildlife.\n  There are many commercial and recreational uses that depend upon \nestuaries, making them integral to our economy as well. Coastal waters \ngenerate $54 billion in goods and services annually. The fish and \nshellfish industries alone contribute $83 million per year to the \nnation's economy. Estuaries are vital to more than 75 percent of marine \nfisheries in the United States, making those regions important centers \nfor commercial and sport fishing, while supporting business and \ncreating jobs.\n  The great natural beauty of estuaries coupled with the sporting, \nfishing, and other outdoor recreational activities they provide make \ncoastal regions important areas for tourism. People come to hike, swim, \nboat, and enjoy nature in the 44,000 square miles of outdoor public \nrecreation areas along our coasts. In fact, 180 million Americans visit \nour nation's coasts each year. That is almost 70 percent of the entire \nU.S. population. The large number of visitors has a strong economic \nimpact. Coastal recreation and tourism generate $8 to $12 billion \nannually.\n  Estuaries are home to countless species unique to these ecosystems, \nincluding many that are threatened or endangered. From birds such as \nthe bald eagle, to shellfish such as the American Oyster, to vegetation \nsuch as eelgrass--an amazing variety of wildlife relies upon those \nareas.\n  It's not only plants and animals that make their homes near \nestuaries. People are moving to these areas at a rapid rate. While \ncoastal counties account for 11 percent of the land area of the \ncontinental U.S., at least half of all Americans call coastal and \nestuarine regions home. Coastal counties are growing at three times the \nrate of non-coastal counties. It is estimated that 100 million people \nlive in such areas now, and by 2010 that number is expected to jump to \n127 million.\n\n  Unfortunately, because so many of us enjoy living, working, and \nplaying near estuaries, we have stressed the once-abundant resources of \nmany of these water bodies. Population growth has been difficult to \nmanage in a manner that protects estuaries. Housing developments, \nroads, and shopping centers have moved into areas crucial to the \npreservation of estuaries. They have also placed a more concentrated \nburden on estuaries from pollution caused by infrastructure required by \ngreater number of people: more sewers, cars, and paved roads, among \nother things.\n  The result of this population growth is painfully evident. Estuary \nhabitats across the nation are vanishing. Almost three-quarters of the \noriginal salt marshes in the Puget Sound have been destroyed. Ninety-\nfive percent of the original wetlands in the San Francisco\n\n[[Page S3917]]\n\nBay are gone. Louisiana estuaries are losing 25,000 areas of coastal \nmarshes each year. That's an area about the size of Washington, D.C.\n  Those habitats that remain are beleaguered by problems and signs of \ndistress can be seen in virtually every estuary. The 1996 National \nWater Quality inventory reported that nearly 40 percent of the nation's \nsurveyed estuarine waters are too polluted for basic uses, such as \nfishing and swimming. Falling finfish and shellfish stocks due to over-\nharvesting and pollution from nutrients and chemicals, proliferation of \ntoxic algal blooms, and a reduction in important aquatic vegetation has \nsignaled a decline in the condition of many estuaries.\n  Nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen carried from city treatment \nworks and agricultural land flow down our rivers and into our \nestuaries, leading to over-enrichment of these waters. As a result, \nalgal blooms flourish. These blooms rob the water of the dissolved \noxygen and light that is crucial to the survival of grass beds that \nsupport shellfish and birds.\n  Nutrients have also contributed to the disappearance of eelgrass beds \nin Narragansett Bay on Rhode Island. While once eelgrass beds covered \nthousands of acres of the Bay floor, today that figure has fallen to \nonly 100 acres or so. Sadly, the disappearance of eelgrass is not the \nonly problem facing the Bay. Its valuable fish runs are disappearing. \nSalt marshes are also in decline. Fifty percent of the salt marsh \nacreage that once existed has been filled, and 70 percent is cut off \nfrom full tidal flow.\n  Nowhere has the problem of nutrient over-enrichment been demonstrated \nmore dramatically of late than in the nation's largest estuary: the \nChesapeake Bay. Nutrient pollution in the Bay has contributed to the \ntoxic outbreak of the algae pfiesteria, or ``fish killer'', which has \nbeen responsible for massive fish kills in the Bay's waterways. While \nscientists believe pfiesteria has existed for thousands of years, only \nrecently have we witnessed an alarming escalation in the appearance of \nthe algae in its toxic, predatory form.\n\n  Unfortunately, the effects of pfiesteria have not been confined to \nthe Chesapeake Bay region. Pfiesteria has also been identified in \nwaters off the coast of North Carolina, indicative of a longer trend of \nharmful algal blooms in the U.S. and around the world. This trend \ncorrelates to an increase in nutrients in our waterways. Perhaps more \ndistressing than the environmental threat posed by pfiesteria is the \nfact that pfiesteria has also been linked to negative health effects in \nhumans.\n  Estuaries are also endangered by pathogens. Microbes from sewage \ntreatment works and other sources have contaminated waters, making \nshellfish unfit for human consumption. In Peconsic Bay on Long Island, \nfor instance, more than 4,700 acres of bay bottom is closed either \nseasonally or year-round due to pathogens.\n  Toxic chemicals such as PCBs, heavy metals, and pesticides degrade \nthe environment of estuaries as well. Runoff from lawns, streets, and \nfarms, sewage treatment plants, atmospheric deposition, and industrial \ndischarges expose finfish and shellfish to the chemicals. The chemicals \nare persistent and tend to bioaccumulate, concentrating in the tissues \nof the fish. The fish may then pose a risk to human health if consumed.\n  In Massachusetts Bays, for instance, diseased lobster and flounder \nhave been discovered in certain areas, prompting consumption \nadvisories. Unfortunately, this problem is not an isolated one. In many \nof our nation's urban harbors polluted runoff creates ``hot spots'' of \ntoxic contamination so severe that nothing can survive.\n  Estuaries are also threatened by newly introduced species. \nOverpopulation of new species can eradicate native populations. \nEradication of even one native species has the potential to alter the \nfood web, increase erosion, and interfere with navigation, agriculture, \nand fishing. In Tampa Bay, for example, native plant species have been \nreplaced by newly introduced species, altering the Bay's ecological \nbalance.\n  All of these changes to the condition of our estuaries threaten not \nonly our environment, but the economies and jobs that rely upon \nestuaries. Indeed, the stresses we have placed on estuaries in the past \nmay jeopardize our future enjoyment of the benefits they provide, \nunless we continue to strengthen the commitments we have made to \nprotecting this resource. Thankfully, the fate of the nation's \nestuaries is far from decided. We are beginning to see signs that \nefforts made by many to restore and protect our estuaries are having a \npositive effect and turning the tide against degradation.\n\n  Nutrient levels in the Chesapeake Bay are declining due in part to \nprograms designed to better manage fertilizer applications to farmland \nand lawns and to reduce point source discharges. People in New York \nhave targeted sewer overflows, non-point runoff, and sewage treatment \nplants by implementing techniques to prevent stormwater pollution and \nmitigate runoff. By doing so, they hope to reduce the threat of \npathogen contamination in Long Island Sound.\n  In Rhode Island, a non-profit group, Save the Bay, has partnered with \nschool kids to do something about the loss of eelgrass beds in \nNarragansett Bay. The children are growing eelgrass in their schools \nand it is then planted in the Bay by Save the Bay. In this way, they \nhope to encourage growth of the beds that provide a home for shellfish \nand a food source for countless other Bay creatures.\n  In Florida, a partnership of volunteers, students, businesses, and \nfederal, state, and local governments prepared sites and planted native \nvegetation on six acres of newly-constructed wetlands in a park \nadjacent to Tampa Bay. The students received job training, education, \nand summer employment, and the Bay received a helping hand fighting the \ninvasive species that threaten those native to it.\n  The ``Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act'' will further \nthese efforts to preserve and restore estuaries. The Act is designed to \nmake the best use of scarce resources by channeling them directly to \nthose citizens and organizations that best know how to restore \nestuaries. It will help groups like those in Rhode Island and Tampa Bay \ncontinue their work while encouraging others to join them in projects \nof their own.\n  The ultimate goal is to restore 1,000,000 acres of estuary habitat by \n2010. To achieve this goal, the bill establishes a streamlined council \nconsisting of representatives from citizen organizations and state and \nfederal governments. This ``Collaborative Council'' will serve two \nfunctions. The first function is to develop a comprehensive national \nestuary habitat restoration strategy. The strategy will be the basis \nfor the second function of the Council: efficient coordination of \nfederal and non-federal estuary restoration activities by providing a \nmeans for prioritizing and selecting habitat restoration projects.\n  In developing the strategy, the Council will review existing federal \nestuary restoration plans and programs, create a set of proposals for \nmaking the most of incentives to increase private-sector participation \nin estuary restoration, and make certain that the strategy is developed \nand implemented consistent with existing federal estuary management and \nrestoration programs.\n  The Council's second function is to select habitat restoration \nprojects presented to the Council by citizen organizations and other \nnon-federal entities, based on the priorities outlined under the \nstrategy. Those projects that have a high degree of support from non-\nfederal sources for development, maintenance, and funding, fall within \nthe restoration strategy developed by the Council, and are the most \nfeasible will have the greatest degree of success in receiving funding.\n\n  A project must receive at least 35 percent of its funding from non-\nfederal sources in order to be approved. Priority will be given to \nthose projects where more than 50 percent of its support comes from \nnon-federal sources. Priority status also requires that the project is \npart of an existing federal estuary plan and that it is located in a \nwatershed that has a program in place to prevent water pollution that \nmight re-impair the estuary if it were restored.\n  To achieve its 1,000,000 acre goal, the Act does not establish \nmandates or create a new bureaucracy. Instead, the Act encourages \npartnerships between\n\n[[Page S3918]]\n\ngovernment and those that are most concerned and best able to \neffectively preserve estuaries--citizens. It will make the most of \nfederal dollars by providing those citizens and organizations that are \nmost affected by the health of our estuaries the opportunity and the \nincentive to continue their efforts to improve them through projects \nthat they develop, implement, and monitor themselves.\n  This approach has several advantages. All estuaries are not the same, \nnor are the problems that face each estuary the same. Therefore, the \nAct allows citizens to tailor a project targeted to meet the specific \nchallenges posed by the particular estuary in their region. In this \nway, we are doing the most to help protect estuaries while wasting none \nof our scarce federal funds. The Act also ensures the continued prudent \nuse of funds through information-gathering, monitoring, and reporting \non the projects.\n  Estuaries contribute to our economy and to our environment, and for \nthese reasons alone they should be protected. But, they also contribute \nto the fabric of many of the communities that surround them. They \ndefine much of a region's history and cultures as well as the way \npeople live and work there today.\n  For all of these reasons, then, we must make efficient use of the \nresources we have in order to assist those people that are protecting \nand restoring our estuaries. The Estuary Habitat Restoration \nPartnership Act is the best, most direct way to do just that. \nTherefore, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \nanalysis of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the analysis was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n     Section 1. Short title\n       This section cites provides that the Act may be cited as \n     ``The Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1999''.\n     Section 2. Findings\n       This section establishes Congress' findings. Congress finds \n     that estuaries provide some of the most ecologically and \n     economically productive habitat for an extensive variety of \n     plants, fish, wildlife, and waterfowl. It also finds that \n     estuaries and coastal regions of the United States are home \n     to one-half the population of the United States and provide \n     essential habitat for 75 percent of the Nation's commercial \n     fish catch and 80 to 90 percent of its recreational fish \n     catch.\n       It further finds that estuaries are gravely threatened by \n     habitat alteration and loss from pollution, development, and \n     overuse. Congress finds that successful restoration of \n     estuaries demands the coordination of Federal, State, and \n     local estuary habitat restoration programs and that the \n     Federal, State, local, and private cooperation in estuary \n     habitat restoration activities in existence on the date of \n     enactment of this Act should be strengthened. Also, new \n     public and public-private estuary habitat restoration \n     partnerships should be established.\n     Section 3. Purposes\n       The bill establishes a program to restore one million acres \n     of estuary habitat by the year 2010. the bill requires the \n     coordination of existing Federal, State and local plans, \n     programs, and studies. It authorizes partnerships among \n     public agencies at all levels of government and between the \n     public and private sectors. The bill authorizes estuary \n     habitat restoration activities, and it requires monitoring \n     and research capabilities to assure that restoration efforts \n     are based on sound scientific understanding.\n       This measure will give a real incentive to existing State \n     and local efforts to restore and protect estuary habitat. \n     Although there are numerous estuary restoration programs \n     already in existence, non-Federal entities have had trouble \n     sifting through the often small, overlapping and fragmented \n     habitat restoration programs. The bill will coordinate these \n     programs and restoration plans, combine State, local and \n     Federal resources and supplement needed additional funding to \n     restore estuaries.\n     Section 4. Definitions\n       This section defines terms used throughout the Act. Among \n     the most important definitions are:\n       ``Estuary'' is defined as a body of water and its \n     associated physical, biological, and chemical elements, in \n     which fresh water from a river or stream meets and mixes with \n     salt water from the ocean.\n       ``Estuary Habitat'' is defined as the complex of physical \n     and hydrologic features within estuaries and their associated \n     ecosystems, including salt and fresh water coastal \n     marshes, coastal forested wetlands and other coastal \n     wetlands, tidal flats, natural shoreline areas, sea grass \n     meadows, kelp beds, river deltas, and river and stream \n     banks under tidal influence.\n       ``Estuary Habitat Restoration Activity'' is defined as an \n     activity that results in improving an estuary's habitat, \n     including both physical and functional restoration, with a \n     goal toward a self-sustaining ecologically-based system that \n     is integrated with its surrounding landscape. Examples of \n     restoration activities include: the control of non-native and \n     invasive species; the reestablishment of physical features \n     and biological and hydrologic functions; the cleanup of \n     contamination; and the reintroduction of native species, \n     through planting or natural succession.\n     Section 5. Establishment of the Collaborative Council\n       This section establishes an interagency Collaborative \n     Council composed of the Secretary of the Army, the Under \n     Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, Department of Commerce, \n     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and \n     the Secretary of the Interior, through the Fish and Wildlife \n     Service. The two principal functions of the Council are: (1) \n     to develop a national strategy to restore estuary habitat; \n     and (2) to select habitat restoration projects that will \n     receive the funds provided in the bill.\n       The Army Corps of Engineers is to chair the Council. The \n     Corps is to work cooperatively with the other members of the \n     Council.\n     Section 6. Duties of the Collaborative Council\n       This section establishes a process to coordinate existing \n     Federal, State and local resources and activities directed \n     toward estuary habitat restoration. It also sets forth the \n     process by which projects are to be selected by the Council \n     for funding under this Title.\n       Habitat Restoration Strategy.--This section requires the \n     Council to draft a strategy that will serve as a national \n     framework for restoring estuaries. The strategy should \n     coordinate Federal, State, and local estuary plans programs \n     and studies.\n       In developing the strategy, the Council should consult with \n     State, local and tribal governments and other non-Federal \n     entities, including representatives from coastal States \n     representing the Atlantic, Pacific, and the Gulf of Mexico; \n     local governments from coastal communities; and nonprofit \n     organizations that are actively participating in carrying out \n     estuary habitat restoration projects.\n       Selection of Projects.--This section also requires the \n     Council to establish application criteria for restoration \n     projects. The Council is required to consider a number of \n     factors in developing criteria. In addition to the factors \n     mentioned in the legislation, the Council is to consider both \n     the quantity and quality of habitat restored in relation to \n     the overall cost of a project. The consideration of these \n     factors will provide the information required to evaluate \n     performance, at both the project and program levels, and \n     facilitate the production of biennial reports in the \n     strategy.\n       Subsection (b) of section 105 requires the project \n     applicant to obtain the approval of State or local agencies, \n     where such approval is appropriate. In States such as Oregon, \n     where coastal beaches and estuaries are publicly owned and \n     managed, proposals for estuary habitat restoration projects \n     require the approval of the State before being submitted to \n     the Council.\n       Priority Projects.--Among the projects that meet the \n     criteria listed above, the Council shall give priority for \n     funding to those projects that meet any of the factors \n     cited in subsection(b)(4) of this section.\n       One of the priority factors is that the project be part of \n     an approved estuary management or restoration plan. It is \n     envisioned that funding provided through this legislation \n     would assist all local communities in meeting the goals and \n     objectives of estuary restoration, with priority given to \n     those areas that have approved estuary management plans. For \n     example, the Sarasota Bay area in Florida is presently \n     implementing its Comprehensive Conservation and Management \n     Plan (CCMP), which focuses on restoring lost habitat. This is \n     being accomplished by: reducing nitrogen pollution to \n     increase sea grass coverage; constructing salt water \n     wetlands; and building artificial reefs for juvenile fish \n     habitat. Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island also is in the \n     process of implementing its CCMP. Current efforts to improve \n     the Bay's water quality and restore its habitat address the \n     uniqueness of the Narraganset Bay watershed.\n     Section 7. Cost sharing of estuary habitat restoration \n         projects\n       This section strengthens local and private sector \n     participation in estuary restoration efforts by building \n     public-private restoration partnerships. This section \n     establishes a Federal cost-share requirement of no more than \n     65 percent of the cost of a project. The non-Federal share is \n     required to be at least 35 percent of the cost of a project. \n     Lands, easements, services, or other in-kind contributions \n     may be used to meet non-Federal match requirement.\n     Section 8. Monitoring and maintenance\n       This section assures that available information will be \n     used to improve the methods for assuring successful long-term \n     habitat restoration. The Under Secretary for Oceans and \n     Atmosphere (NOAA) shall maintain a database of restoration \n     projects carried out under this Act, including information on \n     project techniques, project completion, monitoring data, and \n     other relevant information.\n       The Council shall publish a biennial report to Congress \n     that includes program activities, including the number of \n     acres restored; the percent of restored habitat monitored \n     under a plan; and an estimate of the long-term success of \n     different restoration techniques used in habitat restoration \n     projects.\n\n[[Page S3919]]\n\n     Section 9. Cooperative agreements and memoranda of \n         understanding\n       This section authorizes the Council to enter into \n     cooperative agreements and execute memoranda of understanding \n     with Federal and State agencies, private institutions, and \n     tribal entities, as is necessary to carry out the \n     requirements of the bill.\n     Section 10. Distribution of appropriations for estuary \n         habitat restoration activities\n       This section authorizes the Secretary to disburse funds to \n     the other agencies responsible for carrying out the \n     requirements of this Act. The Council members are to work \n     together to develop an appropriate mechanism for the \n     disbursement of funds between Council members. For instance, \n     section 107 of the bill requires the Under Secretary to \n     maintain a data base of restoration projects carried out \n     under this legislation. NOAA shall utilize funds disbursed \n     from the Secretary to maintain the data base.\n     Section 11. Authorization of appropriations\n       The total of $315,000,000 for fiscal years 2000 through \n     2004 is authorized to carry out estuary habitat restoration \n     projects under this section. The $315,000,000 would be \n     distributed as follows: $40,000,000 for fiscal year 2000; \n     $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, and $75,000,000 for each of \n     fiscal years 2002 through 2004.\n     Section 12. National estuary program\n       This section amends section 430(g)(2) of the Federal Water \n     Pollution Control Act to provide explicit authority for the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to issue \n     grants not only for assisting activities necessary for the \n     development of comprehensive conservation and management \n     plans (CCMPs) but also for the implementation of CCMPs. \n     Implementation for purposes of this section includes managing \n     and overseeing the implementation of CCMPs consistent with \n     section 320(b)(6) of the Act, which provides that management \n     conferences, among other things, are to `monitor the \n     effectiveness of actions taken pursuant to the [CCMP].' \n     Examples of implementation activities include: enhanced \n     monitoring activities; habitat mapping; habitat acquisition; \n     best management practices to reduce urban and rural polluted \n     runoff; and the organization of workshops for local elected \n     officials and professional water quality managers about \n     habitat and water quality issues.\n       The National Estuary Program is an important partnership \n     among Federal, State, and local governments to protect \n     estuaries of national significance threatened by pollution. A \n     major goal of the program has been to prepare CCMPs for the \n     28 nationally designated estuaries. To facilitate preparation \n     of the plans, the Federal Government has provided grant \n     funds, while State and local governments have developed the \n     plans. The partnership has been a success in that 18 of 28 \n     nationally designated estuaries have completed plans.\n       In order to continue and strengthen this partnership, grant \n     funds should be eligible for use in the implementation of the \n     completed plans as well as for their development. \n     Appropriations for grants for CCMPs are authorized at \n     $2,5000,000 for each of fiscal years 2000 and 2001. This \n     increase reflects the growth in the National Estuary Program \n     since the program was last authorized in 1987. In 1991 when \n     the authorization expired, 17 local estuary programs existed; \n     now there are 28 programs. The cost of implementing the 28 \n     estuary programs will require significant resources. However, \n     State and local governments should take primary \n     responsibility for implementing CCMPs.\n     Section 13. General provisions\n       This section provides the Secretary of the Army with the \n     authority to carry out responsibilities under this Act, and \n     it clarifies that habitat restoration is one of the Corps' \n     mission.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to join with my \nfriend and colleague, Senator John Chafee, Chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, to introduce legislation to \nrestore America's estuaries. Our bill is entitled the ``Estuary Habitat \nRestoration Partnership Act of 1999.''\n  In the 105th Congress, on October 14, 1998, the Senate passed by \nunanimous consent S. 1222, the ``Estuary Habitat Restoration \nPartnership Act of 1998.'' I joined with Senator Chafee and 15 other \nSenators to introduce the bill on September 25, 1997. On July 9, 1998, \nI testified on its behalf during hearings held by Senator Chafee and \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  I am pleased that the Senate gave its unanimous approval to the \nbill's passage in the last Congress and look forward to such consent in \nthe 106th Congress.\n  Estuaries are a national resource and treasure. As a nation, \ntherefore, we should work together at all levels and in all sectors to \nhelp restore them.\n  Other Senators have joined with Senator Chafee and me as original \ncosponsors of the bill. Together, we want to draw attention to the \nsignificant value of the nation's estuaries and the need to restore \nthem.\n  It is also my distinct pleasure today to say with pride that \nLouisianians have been in the forefront of this movement to recognize \nthe importance of estuaries and to propose legislation to restore them. \nThe Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, an organization which is \nwell-known for its proactive work on behalf of the Louisiana coast, has \nbeen from the inception an integral part of the national coalition, \nRestore America's Estuaries, which has proposed and supports the \nrestoration legislation.\n  The Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana and Restore America's \nEstuaries are to be commended for their leadership and initiative in \nbringing this issue to the nation's attention.\n  In essence, the bill introduced today proposes a single goal and has \none emphasis and focus. It seeks to create a voluntary, community-\ndriven, incentive-based program which builds partnerships between the \nfederal government, state and local governments and the private sector \nto restore estuaries, including sharing in the cost of restoration \nprojects.\n  In Louisiana, we have very valuable estuaries, including the \nPonchartrain, Barataria-Terrebonne, and Vermilion Bay systems. \nLouisiana's estuaries are vital because they have helped and will \ncontinue to help sustain local communities, their cultures and their \neconomies.\n  I encourage Senators from coastal and non-coastal states alike to \nevaluate the bill and to join in its support with Senator Chafee, me \nand the other Senators who are original bill cosponsors.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Chafee and other Senators on \nbehalf of the bill and with the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana \nand Restore American's Estuaries.\n  By working together at all levels of government and in the private \nand public sectors, we can help to restore estuaries. We can, together, \nhelp to educate the public about the important roles which estuaries \nplay in our daily lives through their many contributions to public \nsafety and well-being, to the environment and to recreation and \ncommerce.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. \n        Robb):\n  S. 836. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act, the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 to require that group health plans and health insurance issuers \nprovide women with adequate access to providers of obstetric and \ngynecological services; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n\n\n               access to women's health care act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss an \nissue of great importance, and an issue on which I believe we can all \nagree. Regardless of health insurance type, payer, or scope, it is \ncritical that women have direct access to caregivers who are trained to \naddress their unique health needs. To help us ensure that all women \nhave direct access to providers of obstetric and gynecological care \nwithin their health plans, I am joined by Senator Bob Graham in \nintroducing the ``Access to Women's Health Care Act of 1999.'' This \nlegislation will allow women direct access to providers of obstetric \nand gynecological care, without requiring them to secure a time-\nconsuming and cumbersome referral from a separate primary care \nphysician. Senator Graham and I are also pleased to have Senators \nCochran and Robb as original cosponsors of this vital legislation. I \nwould like to extend thanks to the American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists, whose members have worked diligently with Senator \nGraham and myself in crafting this bill.\n  While many managed care plans provide some form of direct access to \nwomen's health specialists, some plans limit this access. Other plans \ndeny direct access altogether, and require a referral from a primary \ncare physician. Under the ``Access to Women's Health Care Act of \n1999,'' women would be permitted to see a provider of obstetric and \ngynecological care without prior authorization. This approach is \nprudent and effective because it ensures that women have access to the \nbenefits they pay for, without mandating a structural change in the \nplan's particular ``gatekeeper'' system.\n\n[[Page S3920]]\n\n  It is important to note that 37 states have enacted laws promoting \nwomen's access to providers of obstetric and gynecological care. \nHowever, women in other states or in ERISA-regulated health plans are \nnot protected from access restrictions or limitations. For many women, \ndirect access to providers of obstetric and gynecological care is \ncrucial because they are often the only providers that women see \nregularly during their reproductive years. These providers are often a \nwoman's only point of entry into the health care system, and are \ncaregivers who maintain a woman's medical record for much of her \nlifetime.\n  I believe it is clear that access to women's health care cuts across \nthe intricacies of the complicated and often divisive managed care \ndebate. During the past few years, Congress has debated many proposals \nwhich attempt to address growing problems in managed health care \ninsurance. These proposals have been diverse, not only in their \napproach to the problems, but in the scope of the problems they seek to \naddress. Most recently, during the 105th Congress, the House of \nRepresentatives passed a managed care reform proposal which, among many \nother reforms, included provisions requiring health plans to allow \nwomen direct access to obstetrician/gynecologists which participate in \nthe plan. I would also note that this direct access provision has been \nincluded, in varying forms, in all of the major managed care reform \nproposals introduced in the Senate this year, including the bipartisan \nmanaged care reform bill, the ``Promoting Responsible Managed Care Act \nof 1999'' (S. 374), which I cosponsored. It is for these reasons that I \noffer this legislation today.\n  Only through bipartisanship and consensus-building can we come to an \nagreement on the difficult issue of addressing managed care reform. I \nbelieve that cutting through the cumbersome gatekeeper system to ensure \nwomen have access to the care they need is a good place to start, and I \nurge swift adoption of this legislation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators Specter, \nCochran and Robb, to introduce the Access to Women's Health Care Act of \n1999. This important legislation would provide women with direct access \nto providers of obstetric and gynecological services. It is critical \nthat women have direct access to health care providers who are trained \nto address their unique health care needs.\n  Women's health has historically received little attention and it is \ntime that we correct that. An obstetrician/gynecologist provides health \ncare that encompasses the woman as a whole patient, while focusing on \ntheir reproductive systems. Access to obstetrician/gynecologists would \nimprove the health of women by providing routine and preventive health \ncare throughout the woman's lifetime. In fact, 60 percent of all visits \nto obstetrician/gynecologists are for preventive care.\n  According to a survey by the Commonwealth Fund, preventive care is \nbetter when women have access to obstetrician/gynecologists. The \nspecialty of obstetrics/gynecology is devoted to the health care of \nwomen. Primary and preventive care are integral services provided by \nobstetrician/gynecologists. Complete physical exams, family planning, \nhypertension and cardiovascular surveillance, osteoporosis and smoking \ncessation counseling, are all among the services provided by \nobstetrician/gynecologists. For many women, an obstetrician/\ngynecologist is often the only physician they see regularly during \ntheir reproductive years.\n  Congress, so far, has been more reluctant to ensure direct access to \nwomen's health care providers than states. Thirty-seven states have \nstepped up to the plate and required at least some direct access for \nwomen's health care. We should commend these states for their efforts \nand work together so that women across the nation are afforded this \nimportant right.\n  I hope that with the help of my colleagues in Congress we will be \nable to improve women's health, by increasing their access to providers \nof obstetric/gynecological care. This provision has been included in \nvarying forms in many of the managed care reform proposals this \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Lieberman, and \n        Mr. McCain):\n  S. 837. A bill to enable drivers to choose a more affordable form of \nauto insurance that also provides for more adequate and timely \ncompensation for accident victims, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                         auto choice reform act\n\n  Mr. McConnell. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a \nprogressive, bipartisan bill to allow hard-working Americans to keep \nmore of what they earn.\n  Imagine for a moment a tax cut that could save families $193 billion \nover the next five years. Better yet, this tax cut would not add a \nsingle penny to the deficit. Sound impossible? Not really. It's called \nAuto Choice.\n  The Auto Choice Reform Act offers the equivalent of a massive across-\nthe-board tax cut to every American motorist. Based on a study by the \nRAND Institute for Civil Justice, the Joint Economic Committee \n(``JEC'') in Congress issued a 1998 report estimating that Auto Choice \ncould save consumers as much as $35 billion a year--at no cost to the \ngovernment.\n  In fact, the 5-year net savings described in the JEC report could \nreach $193 billion. Let me say that again, Mr. President: a potential \nsavings of $193 billion--that is $50 million more than five-year tax \ncut savings projected in our budget resolution.\n  So what does this mean for the average American?\n  It would mean that the average American driver could keep more of \nwhat he or she earns to the tune of nearly $200 per year, per vehicle. \nAnd, Mr. President, low-income families would be the greatest \nbeneficiaries of this bill. According to the JEC, the typical low-\nincome household spends more on auto insurance in two years than the \nentire value of their car. Auto choice would change that by allowing \nlow-income drivers to save 36 percent on their overall automobile \npremium. For a low-income household, these savings are the equivalent \nof five weeks of groceries or nearly four months of electric bills.\n  And, Mr. President, let me say again--Auto Choice would not add one \npenny to the deficit. It wouldn't cost the government a cent.\n  I expect that there will be a good deal of discussion over the next \nfew months about Auto Choice and the effort to repair the broken-down \nautomobile insurance tort system. But, Mr. President, everything you \nwill hear about Auto Choice can be summed up in two words: Choice and \nSavings.\n  Consumers want, need, and deserve both.\n  Very simply, the Auto Choice Reform Act offers consumers the choice \nof opting out of the current pain and suffering litigation lottery. The \nconsumers who make this choice will achieve a substantial savings on \nautomobile insurance premiums by reducing fraud, pain-and-suffering \nlitigation and lawyer fees.\n  Mr. President, before you can truly comprehend the benefits of this \npro-consumer, pro-inner city, pro-tax cut bill, you must understand the \nterrible costs of the current tort liability system.\n  The current trial-lawyer insurance system desperately needs an \noverhaul. And nobody knows this better than the American motorist--who \nis now paying on average nearly $800 per year per vehicle for \nautomobile insurance. Between 1987 and 1994, average premiums rose 44 \npercent--nearly one-and-a-half times the rate of inflation.\n  Why are consumers forced to pay so much?\n  Because the auto insurance tort system is fundamentally flawed. It is \nclogged and bloated by fraud, wasteful litigation, and abuse.\n  Fundamental flaw #1: The first flaw of the current system is rampant \nfraud and abuse. In 1995, the F.B.I. announced a wave of indictments \nstemming from Operation Sudden Impact, the most wide-ranging \ninvestigation of criminal fraud schemes involving staged car accidents \nand massive fraud in the health care system. The F.B.I uncovered \ncriminal enterprises staging bus and car accidents in order to bring \nlawsuits and collect money from innocent people, businesses and \ngovernments. In fact, F.B.I. Director Louis Freeh has estimated that \nevery American household is burdened by an additional $200 in \nunnecessary insurance premiums to cover this enormous amount of fraud.\n  In addition to the pervasive criminal fraud that exists, the \nincentives of our\n\n[[Page S3921]]\n\nlitigation system encourage injured parties to make excessive medical \nclaims to drive up their damage claims in lawsuits. The RAND institute \nfor Civil Justice, in a study released in 1995, concluded that 35 to 42 \npercent of claimed medical costs in car accident cases are excessive \nand unnecessary. Let me repeat that in simple English: well over one-\nthird of doctor, hospital, physical therapy and other medical costs \nclaimed in car accident cases are for nonexistent injuries or for \nunnecessary treatment.\n  The value of this wasteful health care? Four billion dollars \nannually. I don't need to remind anyone of the ongoing local and \nnational debate over our health care system. While people have \nstrongly-held differences over the causes and solutions to that \nproblem, the RAND data make one thing certain--lawsuits, and the \npotential for hitting the jackpot, drive overuse and abuse of the \nhealth care system. Reducing those costs by $4 billion annually, \nwithout depriving one person of needed medial care, is clearly in our \nnational interest.\n  Why would an injured party inflate their medical claims, you might \nask. It's simple arithmetic. For every $1 of economic loss, a party \nstands to recover up to $3 in pain and suffering awards. In short, the \nmore you go to the chiropractor, the more you get from the jury. And, \nthe more you get from the jury, the more money your attorney puts in \nhis own pocket.\n  Which leads us to Fundamental Flaw #2--that is, the excessive amounts \nof consumer dollars that are wasted on lawsuits and trial lawyers. \nBased on data from the Insurance Information Institute and the Joint \nEconomic Committee, it is estimated that lawyers rake in nearly two \ntimes the amount of money that injured parties receive for actual \neconomic losses. Surely we would all agree that a system is broken down \nwhen it pays lawyers more than it pays injured parties for actual \neconomic losses.\n  Fundamental Flaw #3: Seriously injured people are grossly \nundercompensated under the tort system. A 1991 RAND study reveals that \npeople with economic losses $25,000 and $100,000 recover on average \nbarely half of their economic losses--and no pain-and-suffering \ndamages. People with losses in excess of $100,000 recover only 9 \npercent of their economic losses--and no pain-and-suffering damages. \nSo, the hard facts demonstrate that seriously-injured victims do not \nreceive pain-and-suffering damages today--event though they are paying \nto play in a system that promises pain-and-suffering damages.\n  Fundamental Flaw #4: Not only does the current system force you to \ntypically hire a lawyer just to recover from a car accident, it also \nforces you to wait for that payment. One study indicates that the \naverage time to recover is 16 months, and of course, it takes much \nlonger in serious injury cases.\n  Auto Choice gives consumers a way out of this system of high \npremiums, rampant fraud, and slow, inequitable compensation. Our bill \nwould remove the perverse incentives of lawsuits, while ensuring that \naccident victims recover fully for their economic loss.\n  So, what is auto choice? Let me first answer with what it is not. It \ndoes not abolish lawsuits, and it does not eliminate the concept of \nfault within the legal system. Undoubtedly, there will be more \nequitable compensation of injured parties, and thus less reason to go \nto court--but the right to sue will not be abolished.\n  Auto Choice allows drivers to decide how they want to be insured. In \nestablishing the choice mechanism, the bill unbundles economic and non-\neconomic losses and allows the driver to choose whether to be covered \nfor non-economic losses (that is, pain and suffering losses).\n  In other words, if a driver wants to have the chance to recover pain \nand suffering, he says in the current system. If he wants to opt-out of \nthe pain and suffering regime and receive lower premiums with prompt, \nguaranteed compensation for economic losses, then he chooses the \npersonal injury protection system.\n  This choice, which sounds amazingly simple and imminently reasonable, \nis, believe it or not, currently unavailable anywhere in our country. \nAuto Choice will change that.\n  Let me briefly explain the choices that our bill will offer every \nconsumer. A consumer will be able to choose one of two insurance \nsystems.\n  The first choice in the Tort Maintenance System. Drivers who wish to \nstay in their current system would choose this system and be able to \nsue each other for pain and suffering. These drivers would essentially \nbuy the same type of insurance that they currently carry--and would \nrecover, or fail to recover, in the same way that they do today. The \nonly change for these tort drivers would be that, in the event that \nthey are hit by a personal protection driver, the tort driver would \nrecover both economic and noneconomic damages from his own insurance \npolicy. This supplemental first-party policy for tort drivers will be \ncalled tort maintenance coverage.\n  The second choice is the Personal Injury Protection System. Consumers \nchoosing this system would be guaranteed prompt recovery of their \neconomic losses, up to the levels of their own insurance policy. \nPersonal protection drivers would achieve substantially reduced \npremiums because the personal injury protection system would \ndramatically reduce: (1) fraud, (2) pain and suffering lawsuits, and \n(3) attorney fees. These drivers would give up the chance to sue for \npain and suffering damages in exchange for lower premiums, guaranteed \ncompensation of economic losses, and relief from pain and suffering \nlawsuits.\n  Under both insurance systems--tort maintenance and personal \nprotection--the injured party whose economic losses exceed his own \ncoverage will have the chance to sue the other driver for excess \neconomic losses. Moreover, tort drivers will retain the chance to sue \neach other for both economic and noneconomic loss. Critics who say the \nright to sue is abolished by this bill are plain wrong.\n  The advantages of personal protection coverage are enormous.\n  First, personal protection coverage assures that those who suffer \ninjury, regardless of whether someone else is responsible, will be paid \nfor their economic losses. The driver does not have to leave \ncompensation up to the vagaries of how an accident occurs and how much \ncoverage the other driver has. A driver whose car goes off a slippery \nroad will be able to recover for his economic losses. Such a blameless \ndriver could not recover under the tort system because no other person \nwas at fault. No matter when and how a driver or a member of his family \nis injured, the driver will have peace of mind knowing that his \ninsurance will help protect his family.\n\n  Second, the choice as to how much insurance protection to purchase is \nin the hands of the driver, who is in the best position to know how \nmuch coverage he and his family need. He can choose as much or as \nlittle insurance as his circumstances require, from $20,000 to $1 \nmillion of protection.\n  Third, people who elect the personal protection option will, in the \nevent they are injured, be paid promptly, as their losses accrue.\n  Fourth, we will have more rational use of precious health care \nresources. Insuring on a first-party basis helps eliminate the \nincentives for excess medical claiming. When a person chooses to be \ncompensated for actual economic loss, the tort system's incentives for \npadding one's claims disappear. If there's no pain-and-suffering \nlottery, then there's no reason to play the game.\n  Fifth, Auto Choice offers real benefits for low-income drivers \nbecause the savings are both dramatic and progressive. Low-income \ndrivers will see the biggest savings because they pay a higher \nproportion of their disposal income in insurance costs. A study of low \nincome residents of Maricopa County, Arizona, revealed that households \nbelow 50 percent of the poverty line spent an amazing 31.6 percent of \ndisposable income on car insurance.\n  For many low-income families the choices are stark: car insurance and \nthe ability to get to the job, or medicine, new clothing and extra food \nfor the children. Too often these families feel forced to drive without \nany insurance. In fact, some areas in our country have uninsured \nmotorist rates exceeding ninety percent. I would hope that this Senate \nwould not sit back and allow our litigation system to promote this kind \nof lose-lose scenario for consumers.\n  Moreover, Auto Choice offers benefits to all taxpayers, even those \nwho don't\n\n[[Page S3922]]\n\ndrive. For example, local governments will save taxpayer dollars \nthrough decreased insurance and litigation costs. This will allow \ngovernments to use our tax dollars to more directly benefit the \ncommunity. Think of all the additional police and firefighters that \ncould be hired with money now spent on lawsuits, Or, schools and \nplaygrounds that could be better equipped. New York City spends more on \nliability claims than it spends on libraries, botanical gardens, the \nBronx Zoo, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Department of Youth \nServices, combined. Imagine the improved quality of life in our urban \nareas if governments were free of spending on needless lawsuits.\n  The bottom line? We think that consumers should be able to make one \nsimple choice: ``Do you want to continue to pay nearly $800 per year \nper vehicle for auto insurance and have the chance to recover pain and \nsuffering damages? Or would you rather save roughly $200 per year per \nvehicle, be promptly reimbursed for your economic losses, and forego \npain and suffering damages?''\n  It's really that simple. And, we're not even going to tell them which \nanswer is the right one. Because that's not up to us. It's up to the \nconsumer. We simply want to give them the choice.\n  In closing, I'd like to quote The New York Times, which has summed up \nthe benefits, and indeed, the simplicity of our bill: ``[Auto Choice] \nwould give families the option of foregoing suits for nonmonetary \nlosses in exchange for quick and complete reimbursement for every blow \nto their pocketbook. Everyone would win--except the lawyers.''\n  Mr. President, this bill is bipartisan and bicameral. I am proud \ntoday to again have the support of Senators Moynihan  and Lieberman. We \nfirst introduced this bill in the 104th Congress, and I want to take a \nminute to say how much I appreciate their ongoing commitment to provide \nmeaningful relief for consumers across the country, especially low-\nincome families. And, we have now added another heavy hitter to our \nlist of original cosponsors, Senator John McCain, the chairman of the \nSenate Commerce Committee.\n  I also want to thank House Majority Leader Dick Armey and Congressman \nJim Moran. They joined our team in the last Congress, and I am pleased \nto say that they will again be leading the charge in the House.\n  Auto Choice has broad support from across the spectrum. It should be \nobvious by the support and endorsements that Auto Choice is not \nconservative or liberal legislation. It is consumer legislation. To \nshow this range of support, I ask unanimous consent that the Record \ninclude the statements in support of Auto Choice from the Republican \nMayor of New York City, Rudolph Giuliani; the former Massachusetts \nGovernor and Democratic presidential candidate, Michael Dukakis; and \naward-winning consumer advocate Andrew Tobias. I also ask unanimous \nconsent that the Record include statements on behalf of Americans for \nTax Reform, Citizens for a Sound Economy, and the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                             The City of New York,\n\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                                     New York, NY, April 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing to you in support of \n     Auto-Choice insurance reform, which will dramatically reduce \n     automobile insurance premiums for American motorists.\n       Drivers across the country are struggling with the burden \n     of unjustly high automobile insurance premiums caused by \n     excessive pain and suffering damages awarded in personal \n     injury actions. Three out of every four dollars awarded in \n     these actions are spent on this subjective component of tort \n     recovery. Also contributing to high premiums are inflated and \n     fraudulent insurance claims. The Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation has estimated that more than $200 of an \n     American family's average annual premiums go to pay for \n     automobile insurance fraud. Because insurance companies have \n     to cover these payments, our premiums are significantly \n     higher than they ought to be.\n       New York City has proposed State legislation to remedy some \n     of the ills afflicting our tort recovery system, such as \n     capping pain and suffering awards. However, your assistance \n     is needed nationwide to protect ordinary drivers who suffer \n     from the incentives that invite plaintiff attorneys to sue \n     without restraint, in the hope of obtaining a large, unearned \n     contingency fee from a large pain and suffering recovery. \n     Attorneys receive one third or more of a tort recovery, a sum \n     that often bears no relationship to the amount of time or \n     effort invested by the attorney, while drivers often pay \n     premiums that are not commensurate with the protection \n     actually afforded. That is grossly unfair.\n       I support Auto-Choice because it would be a major step \n     forward in tort reform and would provide billions of dollars \n     in relief to taxpayers. Auto-Choice gives motorists the \n     option to choose between two insurance coverage plans. The \n     personal protection plan permits drivers to insure for \n     economic loss only. Under this option, injured drivers \n     recover from their own insurance carrier for economic loss \n     without regard to fault. No lawsuit would be required unless \n     an injured driver seeks recovery of economic loss exceeding \n     his or her own policy's coverage. Under the second plan, \n     traditional tort liability coverage, motorists insure for \n     economic and non-economic damages, and recover both from \n     their own insurance carrier. Under either plan, drivers may \n     sue uninsured or inebriated drivers for economic and non-\n     economic damages. The result is a first party recovery \n     framework that separates pain and suffering damages from tort \n     recovery. With litigation incentives eliminated, motorists \n     will pay only for protection actually provided at a price \n     they can better afford. Injured drivers recover medical \n     bills, lost wages and other pecuniary loss without the \n     headache of protracted litigation. For those that think pain \n     and suffering recovery is an important part of insurance \n     coverage, that option is available to them in the bill--at \n     the price they are willing to pay, for the amount of coverage \n     they wish to have.\n       Families throughout the country would benefit considerably \n     from savings on automobile insurance premiums generated by \n     this bill. According to the Congressional Joint Economic \n     Committee, within a five year period, Auto-Choice could give \n     motorists a total of over $190 billion in disposable income \n     that otherwise would go to insurance companies. The average \n     annual premium nationwide would be reduced by $184, and in \n     New York, drivers would see a $385 decrease in the average \n     annual insurance premium. That means more disposable income \n     available to spend and more incentive to save. Until now, the \n     insured have had to endure paying what is, for all intents \n     and purposes, an ``automobile insurance tax'' to subsidize \n     non-economic tort awards and inflated insurance claims. With \n     these new reforms, drivers will realize what is essentially a \n     huge tax cut, without any countervailing decrease in \n     government service delivery.\n       Without the benefits of Auto-Choice, drivers will continue \n     to pay high premiums. As I have stated previously in \n     testimony submitted in 1997 to the Senate Committee on \n     Commerce, Science and Transportation concerning the \n     introduction of Auto-Choice legislation in the Senate: \n     ``Residents, as taxpayers, lose money that could otherwise be \n     spent on essential services. Residents, as individuals, lose \n     money otherwise available as disposable income. Residents, as \n     consumers, lose money because the cost of goods and services \n     increases as businesses have to pay higher insurance \n     premiums. Finally, and perhaps most disturbingly, residents \n     lose faith in our judicial system as a result of courts \n     clogged with tort litigation only to be out-done by hospital \n     emergency rooms clogged with ambulance-chasing lawyers.''\n       In short, Auto-Choice would make an important difference in \n     the lives of New Yorkers and drivers throughout the country. \n     I look forward to opportunities to work with you in support \n     of this important reform.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Rudolph W. Giuliani,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Northeastern University,\n\n\n                              Department of Political Science,\n\n                                        Boston, MA, April 7, 1999.\n       I enthusiastically endorse the ``choice'' auto insurance \n     bill you are jointly sponsoring. Your action is an important \n     act of bipartisan leadership on an issue that significantly \n     affects all Americans.\n       The issue you address has been a great concern of mine \n     throughout my political career ever since I sponsored the \n     first no-fault auto insurance bill in the nation.\n       Given the horrendous high costs of auto insurance, coupled \n     with its long delays, high overhead, and rank unfairness when \n     it comes to payment, your ``choice'' reform takes the \n     sensible approach of allowing consumers to choose how to \n     insure themselves. In other words, your reform trusts the \n     American people to decide for themselves whether to spend \n     their money on ``pain and suffering'' coverage or food, \n     medicine, life insurance or any other expenditure they deem \n     more valuable for themselves and their families.\n       The bill is particularly important to the people who live \n     in American cities where premiums are the highest. It is no \n     surprise that the cost studies done by the Joint Economic \n     Committee indicate that while your reform will make stunning \n     cost savings available to all American consumers, its largest \n     benefit will go to low income drivers living in urban areas.\n       The bill will also help resolve the country's problems with \n     runaway health costs. By allowing consumers to remove \n     themselves from a system whose perverse incentives trigger \n     the cost of health care costs, your reform will lower the \n     cost of health care for all Americans while ensuring that \n     health care\n\n[[Page S3923]]\n\n     expenditures are more clearly targeted to health care needs.\n       I look forward to assisting you to the fullest degree as \n     you exercise your vitally needed leadership on behalf of \n     America's consumers.\n     Michael S. Dukakis.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                    Miami, FL,\n\n                                                   March 25, 1999.\n       To Whom It May Concern: As an independent journalist and \n     private citizen, I have been studying and working for \n     automobile insurance reform for twenty years. I have written \n     a book on the subject.\n       It astounds and saddens me that the system in Michigan--a \n     state that knows something about automobiles--has not been \n     adopted anywhere else in America. Michigan's coverage \n     provides the seriously injured accident victim VASTLY better \n     insurance protection than anywhere else. Yet it costs less \n     than average. It has worked well for 25 years, more than \n     proving itself. It is not perfect, but most consumer \n     advocates agree it is by far the most humane, efficient, and \n     least fraud-ridden system in the country.\n       And yet the coalition of labor unions and consumer groups \n     that helped pass the Michigan law has failed to duplicate \n     this success anywhere else. And over time, things in most \n     states have only gotten worse. More uninsured motorists, more \n     fraud, higher premiums, and even more shamefully inadequate \n     compensation to those most seriously injured.\n       Given that reality, Senators Lieberman and Moynihan, and \n     Jim Moran in the House, have got it absolutely right in \n     supporting Auto Choice legislation. It is not perfect either. \n     But it allows the man or woman who earns $9 an hour, let \n     alone less, to opt out of a system that forces him or her, in \n     effect, to shoulder the cost of the $125-an-house insurance \n     company lawyer who will fight his claim . . . shoulder also, \n     the enormous cost of padded and fraudulent claims . . . and \n     then, if he wins, typically fork over 33% or 40% of the \n     settlement, plus expenses, to his own attorney.\n       These attorneys are good people. But as virtually every \n     disinterested observer from Richard Nixon in 1934 to \n     Consumers Union in 1962 and periodically thereafter has said, \n     the current lawsuit system of auto insurance makes no sense. \n     It makes no sense that more auto-injury premium dollars in \n     many states go to lawyers than to doctors, hospitals, \n     chiropractors and rehabilitation specialists combined. Yet \n     that is the case. Give consumers the choice to opt out of \n     this system. The only difference from 1934 and 1962 and 1973 \n     (when Michigan enacted its good system) is . . . it's gotten \n     worse.\n           Sincerely,\n     Andrew Tobias.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Americans For Tax Reform,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 29, 1999.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Russell Senate\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: Americans for Tax Reform \n     wholeheartedly endorses the ``Auto Choice Reform Act'' \n     legislation to provide consumer choice in automobile \n     insurance.\n       Automobile insurance rates have skyrocketed during the last \n     ten years. Between 1987 and 1994, premiums rose more than 40 \n     percent--one-and-a-half time the rate of inflation. In 1995, \n     the average policy cost more than $750. Clearly, these costs \n     must be reduced, and we believe your legislation will achieve \n     this goal.\n       Auto choice provides savings of about 45 percent on average \n     for personal injury premiums for drivers that choose the PIP \n     option. Especially, auto choice aids low-income drivers, who \n     would save about 36 percent on their overall premiums. Not \n     only does this plan give savings, but it will enable more \n     low-income workers to get better paying jobs.\n       Most importantly, your bill gives consumers something they \n     really want--a chance to choose the kind of auto insurance \n     that fits their individual needs.\n       Auto choice is an idea whose time has come. ATR supports \n     your efforts to make it a reality.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Grover G. Norquist,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Citizens for a Sound Economy,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 13, 1999.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of Citizens for a Sound \n     Economy and its 250,000 members, I wish to convey our strong \n     support for the Auto Choice Reform Act of 1999.\n       Most Americans rightly believe that they pay too much for \n     auto insurance. And year after year, state legislatures and \n     insurance departments respond with price controls and \n     underwriting restrictions, which only make matters worse. The \n     Auto Choice Reform Act of 1999 is based on the realization \n     that to reduce the cost of auto insurance, two elements of \n     the accident compensation system must be addressed: Losses \n     resulting from bodily injury, including damages for ``pain \n     and suffering''; and the tort-based system for redressing \n     those losses.\n       Under the tort-based compensation system that operates in \n     most states, accident victims may not file bodily injury \n     claims with their own insurance company. Instead, they must \n     try to collect from the other driver's insurer--which they \n     can do only if they succeed in establishing that the other \n     driver was legally at fault for their injuries. Compensating \n     accident victims in this way is costly, inefficient, and time \n     consuming. Trial lawyers, who constitute one of the most \n     powerful special interests in America, are the primary \n     beneficiaries of the current system.\n       Those eligible for compensation under the current tort-\n     based system are subject to a perverse pattern of recovery. \n     People with minor injuries are often vastly overcompensated, \n     while in many cases the seriously injured cannot recover \n     nearly enough to cover their economic losses.\n       ``Contingency'' fee arrangements, whereby insureds agree to \n     pay their attorneys a percentage of whatever sum they receive \n     as compensation for their losses, siphon away about a third \n     of an injured person's recovery award. Meanwhile, insurance \n     costs are driven up because of the tort system's promise to \n     compensate victims for their ``noneconomic damages.'' A \n     catchall term that generally refers to ``pain and \n     suffering,'' noneconomic damages are wildly subjective and \n     impossible to quantify. Usually the successful claimant \n     simply collects some multiple of his economic losses--\n     typically three times--as compensation for pain and \n     suffering.\n       This system creates a powerful incentive to inflate \n     economic damages, typically by claiming unverifiable soft-\n     tissue injuries. In Michigan, where third-party liability for \n     pain and suffering has been virtually eliminated thanks to \n     the state's strong no-fault law, auto accident victims suffer \n     about seven soft-tissue injuries (sprains, strains, pains and \n     whiplash) for every 10 ``hard'' injuries (such as broken \n     bones). By contrast, in California, where auto accident \n     victims are compensated through the tort system, injured \n     motorists claim about 25 soft-tissue injuries for every 10 \n     verifiable hard injuries. The ratio of soft-tissue injuries \n     to hard-tissue injuries is similar in other tort states and \n     states with weak no-fault laws. Obviously, these disparities \n     raise troubling questions about the legitimacy of many soft-\n     tissue injury claims--troubling, because ultimately the cost \n     of inflated medical damages is passed on to all drivers in \n     the form of higher premiums.\n       If the Auto Choice Reform Act becomes law, drivers will be \n     able to choose either pure no-fault coverage, or a package \n     that would allow them to collect pain and suffering damages \n     from their own insurer, or from the insurers of other drivers \n     with similar premium coverage. ``Pain and suffering'' would \n     thus become an insurable risk, limiting legal liability to \n     cases involving egregious behavior, or where both parties \n     have agreed to pay, in the form of higher premiums, for the \n     privilege of engaging the legal system. Meanwhile, truly \n     negligent drivers--those who cause accidents intentionally, \n     or while impaired by drugs or alcohol--would continue to be \n     liable for their behavior, in addition to being subject to \n     criminal sanctions.\n       By curtailing litigation and attorney involvement in the \n     claim-settlement process, the Auto Choice Reform Act would \n     have a dramatic impact on auto insurance rates. The RAND \n     Institute for Civil Justice estimates that drivers choosing \n     the no-fault option would reduce their premiums by 21 percent \n     on average.\n       The Auto Choice Reform Act would yield even greater \n     benefits to low-income motorists, who are increasingly \n     dependent upon personal auto transportation at a time when \n     welfare rolls are being cut and jobs are being transferred \n     from the central city to the suburbs. Happily, the \n     Congressional Joint Economic Committee has determined that \n     low-income drivers could cut their premiums by as much as 48 \n     percent if the Auto Choice Reform Act becomes law.\n       In sum, by allowing policyholders to opt out of the tort \n     system, the Auto Choice Insurance Reform Act would rely on \n     market forces--rather than price controls and hidden cross-\n     subsidies--to drive down auto insurance premiums.\n       Serious efforts to reform auto insurance at the state level \n     have been stymied repeatedly by the trial lawyers' lobby. \n     Inflated medical bills, attorney fees, court costs, and \n     exorbitant pain-and-suffering awards continue to impose \n     tremendous costs on the automobile insurance system--costs \n     that insurers must pass on to consumers in the form of \n     escalating premiums. Because they profit handsomely from the \n     inefficiencies wrought by this system, trial lawyers and \n     their political allies will doubtless make every effort to \n     defeat the Auto Choice Reform Act of 1999. Their desire to \n     maintain the status quo must not be permitted to prevail over \n     the interests of America's motorists.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                   Robert R. Detlefsen, Ph.D.,\n\n                                               Director, Insurance\n     Reform Project.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Chamber of Commerce,\n\n\n                              of the United States of America,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 15, 1999.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing on behalf of the U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation, \n     representing more than three million businesses and \n     organizations of every size, sector, and region, to commend \n     you for your continued leadership and sponsorship of the Auto \n     Choice Reform Act.\n\n[[Page S3924]]\n\n       This legislation would provide motorists and businesses \n     with a very valuable option. They could cut their automobile \n     insurance premiums by over 20 percent by voluntarily opting \n     out of coverage for pain and suffering injuries in auto \n     accidents. Those choosing this option would continue to \n     receive full compensation for medical bills, lost wages and \n     other economic losses, and would receive payment quickly--\n     within 30 days. Those who wish to retain coverage similar to \n     that presently available could do simply by paying higher \n     rates.\n       As the largest business federation, the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce supports this legislation and a similar bill in the \n     House of Representatives because they provide a more \n     affordable and efficient insurance option for businesses and \n     motorists. Last year, the Joint Economic Committee (JEC) \n     estimated that enactment of Auto Choice legislation could \n     allow consumers to receive an annual auto insurance premium \n     reduction of over $27 billion. This amounts to an average \n     annual savings of $184 per car. Of particular importance to \n     businesses, the JEC also estimated that commercial vehicle \n     owners could see their auto insurance premiums decline by \n     over 27 percent for a total business savings of $8 billion \n     per year. This is equivalent to a huge tax cut for all \n     Americans.\n       The U.S. Chamber pledges to continue to support this \n     important legislation. Through our grassroots network and \n     media outreach, we will inform the business community and \n     public about the key benefits of this proposal. We thank and \n     commend you for your leadership on the Auto Choice Reform Act \n     and look forward to working with you for its successful \n     passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  B. Bruce Josten.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof the Auto Choice Reform Act of 1999, a bill submitted by my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator McConnell. This legislation is \ndesigned to create a new option in auto insurance for consumers who \nwould prefer a system that guarantees quick and complete compensation. \nThis alternative system would change most insurance coverage to a \nfirst-party system from a third-party system and it would separate \neconomic and noneconomic compensation by unbundling the premium. \nTherefore, drivers would be allowed to insure themselves for only \neconomic loss or for both economic and noneconomic loss.\n  I simply would remark that this issue has been with us for 30-odd \nyears and I wish to provide some of the background and a particular \nperspective.\n  The automobile probably has generated more externalities, as \neconomists and authors Alan K. Campbell and Jesse Burkhead remarked, \nthan any other device or incident in human history. And one of them is \nthe issue of insurance, litigation, and compensation in the aftermath \nof what are called ``accidents'' but are nothing of the kind and are \nthe source of so much misunderstanding.\n  When a certain number of ``accidents'' occur (I think that in 1894, \nif memory serves, there were two automobiles in St. Louis, MO, and they \nmanaged to collide--at least, it has been thought thus ever since), \nthey become statistically predictable collisions--foreseeable events--\nin a complex transportation system such as the one we have built.\n  This began to be a subject of epidemiology in the 1940's, and by the \n1950's, we had the hang of it. We knew what we were dealing with and \nhow to approach it.\n  The first thing that we did--I think it fair to say it was done in \nNew York under the Harriman administration, of which I was a member--\nwas to introduce the concept of passenger safety into highway and \nvehicle design. Safety initiatives were undertaken, first at the State \nlevel. The, in 1966, Congress passed two bills, the National Traffic \nand Motor Vehicle Safety Act and the Highway Safety Act, to establish \npervasive Federal regulation. At the time, the last thing in the world \nan automobile manufacturer would suggest was that its product was a car \nin which one could safely have an accident! Perhaps other motorists, \ndriving other companies cars, had accidents. It took quite a bit of \nlearning--social learning--but eventually it happened: safety features \nsuch as padded steering wheels and dashboards, seat belts, and airbags \nbecame integral design considerations. Now it is routine; we take such \nfeatures for granted. It wasn't always thus. Social learning.\n  And then the issue of insurance and litigation and so forth arose. In \n1967, if I could say, which would be 32 years ago, I wrote an article \nfor The New York Time Magazine, which simply said, ``Next, a new auto \ninsurance policy.'' By ``next,'' I meant a natural evolution, building \non the epidemiological knowledge we had developed regarding the \nincidence of collisons and the trauma they caused to drivers, \npassengers, and pedestrians. And I had a good line here, I think: \n``Automobile accident litigation has become a twentieth-century \nequivalent of Dickens's Court of Chancery, eating up the pittance of \nwidows of orphans, a vale from which few return with their respect for \njustice undiminished.''\n\n  The are several fundamental problems with the current system of auto \ninsurance, as I explained back then. First, determining fault, \nnecessary in a tort system, is no easy task in most instances. \nTypically, there are few witnesses. And the witnesses certainly aren't \n``expert.'' The collisions are too fast, too disorienting. And \nadjudicating a case typical occurs long after the collision. Memories \nfade.\n  More important, as I remarked at the time, is that ``no one involved \n(in the insurance system) has any incentive to moderation or \nreasonableness. The victim has every reason to exaggerate his losses. \nIt is some other person's insurance company that must pay. The company \nhas every reason to resist. It is somebody else's customer who is \nmaking the claim.'' This leads to excessive litigation, costly legal \nfees, and inefficient, inequitable compensation.\n  A 1992 survey of the nation's most populous counties by the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice found that tort cases make up about one-half of \nall civil cases filed in state courts. Auto collision-related lawsuits \naccount for 60 percent of these tort cases--more than all other types \nof tort lawsuits combined. Such lawsuits are time consuming: 31 percent \nof automobile tort cases take over one year to process. They are \nclogging our courts, displacing other types of civil litigation far \nmore important to society.\n  And for all the time, money, and effort these lawsuits consume, they \ndo not compensate victims adequately. On average, victims with losses \nbetween $25,000 and $100,000 recover just over half (56 percent) of \ntheir losses, and those persons with losses over $100,000 receive just \nnine cents on the dollar in compensation.\n  ``Auto Choice,'' as our legislation is known, will curtail excessive \nlitigation by changing insurance coverage to a first-party system--at \nthe driver's option. Individuals will insure themselves against \neconomic damages regardless of fault. They can, if they wish, insure \nfor non-economic losses, too. They simply pay a higher premium. In the \nevent they sustain damages in a collision, under Auto Choice, they \nbypass litigation altogether, and they receive just and adequate \ncompensation in a timely fashion.\n  I earnestly hope that Congress will enact this important legislation \nthis year. It will benefit all American motorists. Its savings are \nbigger than any tax cut Congress is likely to enact, and they won't \naffect our ability to balance the budget. But even more important, I \nthink, is the fact that ``auto choice'' will take some of the strain \noff our overburdened judiciary. I don't know if we can calculate the \nvalue of such a benefit.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the bill we \nare introducing today: the Auto Choice Reform Act of 1999. If enacted, \nthis bill would save American consumers tens of billions of dollars, \nwhile at the same time producing an auto insurance system that operates \nmore efficiently and promises drivers better and quicker compensation.\n  America's drivers are plagued today by an auto accident insurance and \ncompensation system that is too expensive and that does not work. We \ncurrently pay an average of approximately $775 annually for our auto \ninsurance per car. This is an extraordinarily large sum, and one that \nis particularly difficult for people of modest means--and almost \nimpossible for poor people--to afford. A study of Maricopa County, AZ, \ndrives this point home. That study found that families living below 50 \npercent of the poverty line spend nearly one-third of their household \nincome on premiums when they purchase auto insurance.\n  Perhaps those costs would be worth it if they meant that people \ninjured in\n\n[[Page S3925]]\n\ncar accidents were fully compensated for their injuries. But under the \ncurrent tort system, that often is not the case, particularly for \npeople who are seriously injured. Because of the need to prove fault \nand the ability to receive compensation only through someone else's \ninsurance policy, some injured drivers--like those in one car accidents \nor those who are found to have been at fault themselves--are left \nwithout any compensation at all. Others must endure years of litigation \nbefore receiving compensation for their injuries. In the end, many \npeople who suffer minimal injuries in auto accidents end up \novercompensated, while victims of serious injuries often fail to \nreceive full restitution. Indeed, the extent to which seriously injured \ndrivers are undercompensated in the current tort system is staggering: \nvictims with economic losses--things like lost wages and medical \nbills--between $25,000 and $100,000 recover only 56 percent of their \nlosses on average, while those with over $100,000 in economic losses \nget only about 9 percent back on average. Recite those numbers to \nanyone who tells you the current system works just fine the way it is.\n  The current system most hurts the very people who can afford it the \nleast--the nation's poor and drivers who live in the nation's inner \ncities. The $775 average premium I mentioned is already far too much \nfor people of modest means to afford. But for many residents of the \ninner cities a $775 premium is just a dream. As a report issued by \nCongress' Joint Economic Committee last year starkly detailed, inner \ncity residents pay what can only be called a ``tort tax''--insurance \nrates that are often double those of their suburban neighbors. For \nexample, a married man with no accidents or traffic violations living \nin Philadelphia pays $1,800 for an insurance policy that would cost him \nless than half that if he moved just over the line, out of Philadelphia \nCounty. The average annual premium for a 38-year old woman with a clean \ndriving record living in central Los Angeles approaches $3,500. The \nstatistic that I think best drives home the disproportionate amount \npoor people spend on auto insurance is this one: the typical low-income \nhousehold spends more on auto insurance over two years than the entire \nvalue of their car.\n\n  The results of these high costs shouldn't surprise us. They lead many \ninner-city drivers to choose to drive uninsured, which is to say our \nauto insurance system makes outlaws of them and puts the rest of us in \njeopardy, because people injured by an uninsured driver may have no \nplace to go for compensation. Other inner-city residents simply decide \nnot to own cars, something that in itself should trouble us. As the \nJEC's Report details, the lack of car ownership, combined with the \ndearth of jobs in the inner-cities, severely limits the ability of many \ncity residents to find employment and lift themselves out of poverty.\n  The Auto Choice bill would go a long way towards solving all of these \nproblems. By simply giving consumers a choice to opt out of the tort \nsystem, Auto Choice would bring all drivers who want it lower premiums. \nAuto Choice would save drivers nationally an average of 23 percent, or \n$184, annually--a total of over $35 billion. Connecticut drivers would \nsee an average savings of $217 annually. Low-income drivers would see \neven more dramatic savings--an average of 36 percent nationally or 33 \npercent in Connecticut.\n  Here's how our plan would work: All drivers would be required to \npurchase a certain minimum level of insurance, but they would get to \nchoose the type of coverage they want. Those drivers who value \nimmediate compensation for their injuries and lower premiums would be \nable to purchase what we call ``personal injury protection insurance.'' \nIf the driver with that type of coverage is injured in an accident, he \nor she would get immediate compensation for economic losses up to the \nlimits of his or her policy, without regard to who was at fault in the \naccident.\n  If their economic losses exceeded those policy limits, the injured \nparty could sue the other driver for the extra economic loss on a fault \nbasis; The only thing the plaintiff could not do is sue the other \ndriver for noneconomic losses, the so-called pain and suffering \ndamages.\n  Those drivers who did not want to give up the ability to collect pain \nand suffering damages could choose a different option, called tort \nmaintenance coverage. Drivers with that type of policy would be able to \ncover themselves for whatever level of economic and noneconomic damages \nthey want, and they would then be able to collect those damages, also \nfrom their own insurance company, after proving fault.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the savings from this new Choice system would \nbe dramatic--again, an average of $184 annually nationally, up to $35 \nbillion each and every year under our proposal.\n  Our Auto Choice plan ensures that most injured people would be \ncompensated immediately and that we all can purchase auto insurance at \na reasonable rate. Mr. President, this bill would be a boon to the \nAmerican driver and to the American economy. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to see it enacted into law.\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in \nintroducing legislation to provide consumers with a true choice when \nthey purchase auto insurance. Not simply a choice between to insurance \ncompanies, but a choice between two different systems of insurance.\n  The current tort based liability system is expensive and inefficient. \nIt pays more money to lawyers than for victims legitimate medical bills \nand lost wages. A study conducted in my home state of Arizona found \nthat a low-income family spends as much as 31 percent of their \ndisposable income on car insurance. As a result, families put off basic \nnecessities such as rent, medical care and sometimes groceries. The \ncurrent system needs to be changed.\n  The system proposed in our bill would allow consumers a more \naffordable alternative designed to provide adequate and timely \ncompensation for accident victims and less need for layers. Under the \nnew system when an accident occurs, the consumer's insurance company \nwould compensate them for their economic losses, such as repair costs, \nmedical bills and lost wages. In exchange, the consumer forgoes the \nright to sue for non-economic losses such as pain and suffering.\n  Consumers choosing to remain in the current system can bring suit as \nthey do now. These consumers would purchase additional coverage to \ncover their non-economic damages in the event they have an accident \nwith someone in the new system.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to allow consumers to choose the \ntype of insurance that meets their needs. It also provides state \nlegislatures a choice. This legislation allows states to ``opt out'' \nshould they disagree with this proposal. States can ``opt out'' in two \nways. First, the legislature can enact legislation declaring they will \nnot participate in the new system. Secondly, the state insurance \ncommissioner can find that the measure will not reduce bodily injury \npremiums by 30 percent. This opt out provision is reasonable and will \ngive states a true choice.\n  Again, I am pleased to join my colleagues in introducing this \nmeasure. I look forward to moving it through the legislative process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 838.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Juvenile \nCrime Control and Community Protection Act of 1999.'' I believe that \njuvenile crime is one of the most important issues facing our nation \ntoday. It's one we should address in the 106th Congress.\n\n  In recent years, I have held field hearings in my home state of New \nMexico to hear the concerns and problems faced by all of the people \naffected by juvenile crime--the police, prosecutors, judges, social \nworkers and most importantly--the victims who reside in our \ncommunities.\n  I think that the sentiments expressed by most of my constituents at \nthe hearing are the same ones felt by people all over the country:\n  (1) many of our nation's youth are out of control;\n  (2) other children and teenagers do not have enough constructive \nthings to\n\n[[Page S3926]]\n\ndo to keep them from falling into delinquent or criminal behavior;\n  (3) the current system does very little, if anything, to protect the \npublic from youth violence; and\n  (4) the current system has failed victims.\n  The time has come for a new federal role to assist the states with \ntheir efforts to get tough on violent young criminals.\n  The federal government can play a larger role in punishing and \npreventing youth violence without tying the hands of state and local \ngovernments or preventing them from implementing innovative solutions \nto the problem.\n  This new federal role should, however, expect states to get tough on \nyouth violence and reward them for enacting law enforcement and \nprosecution policies designed to take violent juvenile criminals off of \nthe street.\n  With those goals in mind, the bill I introduce today makes some \nfundamental changes to the crime fighting partnership which exists \nbetween the states and the federal government.\n  It combines strict law enforcement and prosecution policies for the \nmost violent offenders with more federal resources--more than three \ntimes the amount available under current law--to help states fight \ncrime and prevent juveniles from entering the justice system in the \nfirst place.\n  This bill authorizes a total of $500 million to provide the states \nwith two separate grant programs--one, with virtually no strings \nattached, based on the current state formula grants--and a second new \nincentive grant program for states which enact certain ``best \npractices'' to combat and prevent juvenile violence. I want to talk a \nlittle bit about each.\n  The bill authorizes $300 million, divided into two $150 million pots, \nfor a new grant program for states which enact certain ``get tough'' \nreforms to their juvenile justice systems. States will have access to \nthe first $150 million if they enact three practices:\n  (1) Mandatory adult prosecution for juveniles age 14 and older who \ncommit certain serious violent crimes;\n  (2) Graduated sanctions, so that every offense, no matter how small, \nreceives some punishment; and\n  (3) Adult records, including fingerprints and photographs, for \njuvenile criminals.\n  States which implement these practices and enact another five of 20 \nsuggested reforms will be eligible to receive additional funds from the \nsecond $150 million. Some of these suggested reforms include:\n  (1) Victims' rights, including the right to be notified of the \nsentencing and release of the offender;\n  (2) Mandatory victim restitution;\n  (3) Public access to juvenile proceedings;\n  (4) Parental responsibility laws for acts committed by juveniles \nreleased to their parents' custody;\n  (5) Zero tolerance for deadbeat juvenile parents--a requirement that \njuveniles released from custody attend school or vocational training \nand support their children;\n  (6) Zero tolerance for truancy;\n  (7) Character counts training programs; and\n  (8) Mentoring.\n  These programs are a combination of reforms which will positively \nimpact victims, get tough on juvenile offenders, and provide states \nwith resources to implement prevention programs to keep juveniles out \nof trouble in the first place.\n  The bill also increases to $200 million the amount available to \nstates under the current OJJDP grant program. It also eliminates many \nof the strings placed on states as a condition of receiving those \ngrants.\n  While the Justice Department has said that the overall juvenile crime \nrate in the United States dropped again last year, the juvenile crime \nstatistics also tell us that our young people are more violent than \never. In 1996 in my home state of New Mexico, there were 36,927 \nreferrals to the state juvenile parole and probation office. 39% of \nthose referred have a history of 10 or more contacts with the justice \nsystem. The number of these referrals for VIOLENT offenses, including \nmurder, robbery, assault and rape increased 64 percent from 1993 to \n1997.\n  I mention these numbers not only because they make it clear that many \nof our children are more violent than ever, but also because they have \nled to a growing problem in my home state, a problem which this bill \nwill help fix. More juvenile arrests create the need for more space to \nhouse juvenile criminals. But, because of burdensome federal ``sight \nand sound separation'' rules, New Mexico has been unable to implement a \nsafe, reasonable solution to alleviate overcrowding at its juvenile \nfacilities.\n  Instead, the state has been forced to consider sending juvenile \nprisoners to Iowa and Texas to avoid violating the federal rules and \nlosing their funding. That is unacceptable and this bill will fix that.\n  Mr. President, juvenile crime is the number one concern in my state. \nFrom Albuquerque to Las Cruces, Roswell to Farmington, and in even \nsmaller cities like Clovis and Silver City, I hear the same thing from \nmy constituents: our children are out of control and we need help. This \nbill will provide that help, in a way which will preserve the \ntraditional role state and local law enforcement authorities play in \nthe fight against crime. More resources to get tough on violent \noffenders and provide youth with more constructive things to do to keep \nthem out of trouble, with fewer strings from the federal government. \nThat's what this bill will do, and I hope my colleagues will support my \nefforts to make this a priority issue for this Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 838\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, to provide for \nhealth care and employee benefits, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                         bankruptcy legislation\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would modify our bankruptcy laws to deal with bankruptcies in the \nhealth care sector. According to testimony I received in the \nSubcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, almost one-\nthird of our hospitals could face foreclosure because they are not \nfinancially sound. And a number of nursing homes are in terrible \nfinancial trouble. I believe that chapter 11 and chapter 9 of the \nBankruptcy Code could be vitally important in keeping troubled \nhospitals in business. The bill we are proposing will ensure that \nchapter 11 will work fairly and efficiently in the unfortunate event \nthat we face a rash of health care bankruptcies. The bill will also \nmake sure the health care businesses which liquidate under Chapter 7 \ndon't just throw patients by the wayside in a rush to sell assets and \npay creditors.\n  Currently, the Bankruptcy Code does an adequate job of helping \ndebtors reorganize and helping creditors recover losses. However, the \ncode does not provide protection for the interests of patients. This \nbill contains several important reforms to protect patients when health \ncare providers declare bankruptcy. Specifically, the bill addresses the \ndisposal of patient records, the costs associated with closing a health \ncare business, the duty to transfer patients upon the closing of a \nhealth care facility and the appointment of an ombudsman to protect \npatient rights.\n  Section 102 covers the disposal of patient records. The legislation \nprovides clear and specific guidance to trustees who may not be aware \nof state law requirements for maintaining the patient records or the \nconfidentiality issues associated with patient records. Section 102 is \nnecessary given the patient's need for the records and the apparent \nlack of clear instruction, whether statutory or otherwise, describing a \nproper procedure in dealing with patient records when closing a \nfacility.\n  Section 103 brings the costs associated with closing a health care \nbusiness, including any expenses incurred by disposing of patient \nrecords and transferring patients to another health care facility, \nwithin the administrative expense umbrella of the Bankruptcy Act.\n  Section 104 provides for an ombudsman to act as an advocate for the \npatient. This change will ensure that judges are fully aware of all the \nfacts when they guide a health care provider through bankruptcy. Prior \nto a chapter 11 filing or immediately thereafter, the debtor employs a \nhealth care crisis consultant to help it in its reorganization effort. \nThe first step is usually cutting costs. Sometimes, this step may \nresult in a lower quality of patient care. The appointment of an \nombudsman should balance the interests between the creditor and the \npatient. These interests need balancing because the court appointed \nprofessionals owe fiduciary duties to creditors and the estate but not \nnecessarily to the patients. There will be occasions which illustrate \nthat what may be in the best interest of creditors may not always be \nconsistent with the patients' best interest. The trustee's interest, \nfor example, is to maximize the amount of the estate to pay off the \ncreditors. The more assets the trustees disburses, the more his payment \nwill be. On the other hand, the ombudsman is designed to insure \ncontinued quality of care at least above some minimum standard. Such \nquality of care standards currently exist throughout the health care \nenvironment, from the health care facility itself to State standards \nand Federal standards.\n  Consider the following excerpt from the Los Angeles Times on \nSeptember 28, 1997 which describes the unconscionable, pathetic, and \ntraumatizing consequences of sudden nursing home closings:\n\n       It could not be determined Saturday how many more elderly \n     and chronically ill patients may be affected by the health \n     care company's financial problems. Those at the Reseda Care \n     Center in the San Fernando Valley, including a 106-year-old \n     woman, were rolled into the street late Friday in wheelchairs \n     and on hospital beds, bundled in blankets as relatives \n     scurried to gather up clothes and other personal belongings.\n\n  The presence of an ombudsman probably would result in fewer instances \nsimilar to what I just described, where trustees quickly close health \ncare facilities without notifying appropriate state and federal \nagencies and without notifying the bankruptcy court.\n  Section 1105 requires a trustee to use reasonable and best efforts to \ntransfer patients in the face of a health care business closing. This \nprovision is both useful and necessary in that it outlines a trustee's \nduty with respect to a transfer of vulnerable patients.\n  For all these reasons, I urge you to join me and my colleagues in \nsupporting this bill which will protect the interests of patients in \nhealth care bankruptcies.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Grassley and \nSenator Torricelli in introducing legislation to protect patient \nprivacy when a hospital, nursing home, HMO or other institution holding \nmedical records is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding that leads to \nliquidation.\n  Of course, in the best case scenario any institution holding patient \nhealth care records would continue to follow applicable state or \nfederal law requiring proper storage and safeguards. The fact is, \nhowever, under current law during a business liquidation an individual \nwould have to wait until there has been a serious breach of their \nprivacy rights before anyone stepped in to ensure that patient privacy \nis protected. Under current law it is questionable what protection \nthese most sensitive personal records would have during a liquidation.\n  The reality of this situation and the practical questions of what \nrecourse an individual would have if their personal medical records \nwere not properly safeguarded against a business that is going out of \nbusiness makes this provision essential. Our legislation would\n\n[[Page S3931]]\n\nset in law the procedure that an institution holding medical records \nwould have to follow during a liquidation proceeding.\n  The bottom line is that we do not want to have to wait until there \nhas been a breach of privacy before steps are taken to protect patient \nprivacy. Once privacy is breached--there is nothing one can really do \nto give that back to an individual.\n  I have been working on the overall issue of medical privacy for many \nyears. I look forward to working with Senator Grassley and Senator \nTorricelli on this issue to make sure that patient privacy rights are \nprotected in bankruptcy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 841. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of outpatient prescription drugs under the \nMedicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            ACCESS TO Rx MEDICATIONS IN MEDICARE ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today Senator Jay Rockefeller and I are \nintroducing the Access to Rx Medications in Medicare Act. This \nlegislation will add a long overdue benefit to Medicare--coverage of \nprescription drugs. Medicare is a promise to senior citizens. It says \n``Work hard, contribute to Medicare during your working years, and you \nwill be guaranteed health security in your retirement years.'' But too \noften that promise is broken, because of Medicare's failure to protect \nthe elderly against the high cost of prescription drugs.\n  Our legislation will provide every senior citizen or disabled person \nwith Medicare coverage for up to $1,700 worth of prescription drugs a \nyear, and additional coverage for those with very high drug costs. \nMedicare will contract with the private sector organizations in regions \nacross the country to administer and deliver the new coverage. \nBeneficiaries in traditional Medicare will select an organization to \nprovide them with the benefit. Beneficiaries enrolled in \nMedicare+Choice organizations will receive coverage through their plan. \nSeniors who have equivalent or greater coverage through retiree health \nplans can continue that coverage or enroll in the new program. The bill \nwill also required private Medigap plans to include supplemental \ncoverage.\n  Fourteen million beneficiaries have no prescription drug coverage. \nMillions more have coverage that is unaffordable, inadequate, or \nuncertain. The average senior citizen fills 18 prescriptions a year, \nand takes four to six prescription drugs daily. Many of them face \nmonthly bills of $100, $200, or even more to fill their prescriptions. \nThe lack of prescription drug coverage condemns many senior citizens to \nsecond-class medicine. Too often, they decide to go without the \nmedication essential for effective health care, because they have to \npay other bills for food or heat or shelter. These difficult choices \nwill only worsen in the years ahead, since so many of the miracle cures \nof the future will be based on pharmaceutical products.\n\n  This legislation is a lifeline for every senior citizen who needs \nprescription drugs to treat an illness or maintain their health. It \nassures that today's and tomorrow's senior citizens will be able to \nshare in the medical miracles that we can expect in the new century of \nthe life sciences. It addresses the greatest single gap in Medicare--\nand the one that is the greatest anachronism in Medicare today.\n  When Medicare was first enacted in 1965, its coverage was patterned \nafter typical private insurance policies at the time--when only a \nminority of such policies covered prescription drugs. Today, \nprescription drug coverage is virtually universal in private plans, but \nMedicare is still caught in its 1965 time warp.\n  This legislation has been carefully developed to respond to the \nlegitimate concerns of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. \nWe have consulted with many leading firms on the development of this \nplan, and we believe that the industry will work with us to refine it \nand enact it. The most profitable industry in America has a strong \ninterest in assuring that the miracle cures it creates are affordable \nfor senior citizens.\n  Prescription drug coverage under Medicare will not come cheaply, and \nI intend to work with my colleagues in Congress to find the fairest way \nto pay for this benefit. It may well be necessary to allocate a portion \nof the budget surplus to defray the cost. The hard work of American \nfamilies has created the surplus. Assuring it should be as high a \npriority for the Congress as it is for the American people. We know \nthat improper or inadequate use of prescription drugs now costs \nMedicare an estimated at least $20 billion annually in avoidable \nhospital and physician costs. Clearly, a well-constructed prescription \ndrug benefit can achieve large savings by reducing these avoidable \ncosts. The bottom line is that there are many possible ways to pay for \nthis benefit. A consensus on the best financing will develop as \nCongress considers this issue.\n  This legislation is literally a matter of life and death for millions \nof elderly and disabled citizens served by Medicare in communities \nthroughout America. It is time for Congress to listen to their voices, \nand the voices of their children and grandchildren, too.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation and \naccompanying materials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 841\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Now, virtually all employment-based \n     policies provide prescription drug coverage, but Medicare \n     does not.\n       More than one-third of Medicare beneficiaries have no \n     coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. While other \n     elderly and disabled beneficiaries have some level of \n     outpatient prescription drug coverage through Medicare+Choice \n     plans, individually purchased Medigap or retiree health \n     coverage, too often that coverage is inadequate, expensive or \n     unreliable.\n\n\n                          legislative proposal\n\n       This legislation would create a new outpatient prescription \n     drug benefit under Part B. The benefit has two parts--a basic \n     benefit that will fully cover the drug needs of most \n     beneficiaries and a stop-loss benefit that will provide much \n     needed additional coverage to the beneficiaries who have the \n     highest drug costs.\n       The proposal administers and delivers the benefit through \n     private entities and private sector performance benchmarks--\n     rather than HCFA or federally designated price controls. All \n     beneficiaries would be covered by the new benefit. \n     Beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare+Choice plans would receive \n     the benefit through their plan. Beneficiaries in conventional \n     Medicare would enroll with an approved program in their area \n     of residence, following the general model of Medicare+Choice \n     enrollment.\n       In addition, the proposal would preserve and improve \n     existing coverage in the private market that is equal to or \n     greater than the new coverage under Medicare. Beneficiaries \n     with equivalent coverage through a retiree health plan would \n     be able to keep that coverage and HHS would provide payment \n     to the plan equal to the payment that would otherwise be paid \n     on behalf of the beneficiary to one of the new private \n     entities.\n\n[[Page S3935]]\n\n                              The benefit\n\n       Outpatient drugs covered under this Act are FDA-approved \n     therapies that are dispensed only by prescription, including \n     insulin and biologics, and that are reasonable and necessary \n     to prevent or slow the deterioration of, and improve or \n     maintain the health of covered individuals. This Act would \n     not cover over-the-counter products or therapies that are \n     currently covered under Medicare (e.g., those that are \n     administered ``incident to'' physician services).\n       After beneficiaries meet a separate drug deductible of \n     $200, coverage is generally provided at levels similar to \n     regular Part B benefits--with the beneficiary paying not more \n     than 20 percent of the program's established price for a \n     particular product. The basic benefit would provide \n     coverage up to $1,700 annually. Medicare would provide \n     ``stop-loss'' coverage (i.e., Medicare would pay 100 \n     percent) once annual out-of-pocket expenditures exceed \n     $3,000. Beneficiaries with drug costs in excess of the \n     basic benefit--but below the stop-loss trigger--would be \n     allowed to self-pay for additional medications at the \n     private entity's discounted price.\n       This benefit package provides a new and much needed \n     guarantee of coverage for all beneficiaries, and will fully \n     cover the prescription drug needs of approximately 80 percent \n     of beneficiaries.\n\n         Use of private sector and support of existing coverage\n\n       Coverage would be provided through private entities under \n     contract with HHS. Eligible entities include pharmaceutical \n     benefit management companies, insurers, networks of wholesale \n     and retail pharmacies, and other appropriate organizations. \n     Eligible entities would submit competitive bids to the \n     Secretary for regional coverage--regions would be determined \n     by the Secretary and structured in such a way as to encourage \n     participation by and competition among private entities. \n     Service areas would consist of at least one state whenever \n     possible.\n       Bids would be awarded based on shared risk, capitation or \n     performance to entities that meet the requirements of the Act \n     and provide for discounts comparable to those garnered by \n     other large private sector purchasers. There is no fee \n     schedule or rebate structure. The Secretary shall award at \n     least two bids in an area, if such bids meet the requirements \n     of the Act, encourage competition and improve service for \n     beneficiaries.\n       Entities may employ a variety of cost-containment \n     techniques used in the private sector (e.g., formularies, \n     differential cost-sharing for certain products, etc.), \n     subject to guidelines and beneficiary protections established \n     in the Act. Entities must contract with a sufficient number \n     and distribution of retail pharmacies throughout the plan's \n     service area to assure convenient access for covered \n     beneficiaries.\n\n           Additional assistance for low-income beneficiaries\n\n       Beneficiaries with incomes between the level for Medicaid \n     eligibility and 135 percent of poverty would receive \n     comprehensive wrap-around coverage through Medicaid, \n     including assistance with cost-sharing and premiums.\n\n         Incentive to maintain current private market coverage\n\n       To maintain coverage in the retiree health market, \n     employers who offer retiree drug coverage that is equal to or \n     better than the new Medicare benefit would be eligible for a \n     payment equal to the payment that would otherwise be made to \n     the local private entity. This would help beneficiaries with \n     comprehensive drug coverage in retiree health plans to keep \n     their current coverage.\n\n               Measures to decrease drug-related problems\n\n       Improper use of or lack of access to prescription drugs is \n     estimated to cost Medicare more than $20 billion annually \n     (primarily through avoidable hospitalizations and admissions \n     to skilled nursing facilities.) Participating private \n     entities must use systems to assure appropriate prescribing, \n     dispensing and use of covered therapies. These programs must \n     include on-line prospective review and methods to identify \n     and educate pharmacists, providers and beneficiaries on (1) \n     instances or patterns of unnecessary or inappropriate \n     prescribing or dispensing or substandard care, (2) potential \n     adverse reactions, (3) inappropriate use of antibiotics, (4) \n     appropriate use of generic products, and (5) patient \n     compliance.\n\n                            Medigap reforms\n\n       The Secretary and the National Association of Insurance \n     Commissioners would be required to revise the standard \n     Medigap packages to reflect the new Medicare benefit, and \n     provide for coverage that compliments, but does not \n     duplicate, such coverage in an appropriate number of standard \n     packages.\n\n\n                      estimated cost and financing\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office has not yet estimated the \n     costs or potential savings associated with this proposal. The \n     proposal does not specify the financing mechanism, but viable \n     options include (1) recovering--through legislation or \n     litigation--the Medicare costs attributable to treating \n     tobacco-related diseases and conditions, (2) an increase in \n     the federal tobacco tax, (3) a small portion of the \n     unallocated surplus, or (4) savings achieved as part of the \n     financing of more comprehensive Medicare reform legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Access to Rx Medications in Medicare Act of 1999 Fact Sheet\n\n       The greatest gap in Medicare coverage in the lack of a \n     prescription drug benefit. The time has come to modernize \n     Medicare's benefits by including coverage for outpatient \n     prescription drugs.\n\n\n                                Coverage\n\n       When Medicare was enacted in 1965, outpatient prescription \n     drug coverage was not a standard feature of private insurance \n     policies. Today, however, virtually all employment-based \n     policies provide prescription drug coverage.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Approximately one-third of Medicare beneficiaries have no \n     prescription drug coverage. Coverage among the remaining \n     beneficiaries is often inadequate, unaffordable and \n     uncertain. Approximately 12 percent receive limited coverage \n     through individually purchased Medigap policies, which are \n     extremely expensive and often difficult to obtain. About six \n     percent of Medicare beneficiaries have limited drug coverage \n     through Medicare HMOs, but many plans are cutting back or \n     eliminating drug coverage. Only about one-third of \n     beneficiaries have reasonably comprehensive coverage, through \n     an employment-based retirement plan or through Medicaid--and \n     the proportion with employment-based coverage is \n     declining.\\2\\\n\n\n                        spending and utilization\n\n       Purchase of prescription drugs accounts for the largest \n     single source of out-of-pocket health costs for Medicare \n     beneficiaries.\\3\\\n       About 85 percent of the elderly use at least one \n     prescription medicine during the year. The average senior \n     citizen takes more than four prescription drugs daily and \n     fills an average of eighteen prescriptions a year. It is not \n     uncommon for seniors to face prescription drug bills of at \n     least $100 a month.\\4\\\n       The elderly, who make up 12 percent of the population, are \n     estimated to use one-third of all prescription drugs.\\5\\\n       Lack of Medicare coverage disproportionately increases the \n     financial burden on women, rural residents, low-income \n     beneficiaries and older beneficiaries.\\6\\\n       A 1993 study, before the most recent surge in drug costs, \n     reported that one in eight senior citizens said they were \n     forced to choose between buying food and buying medicine.\\7\\\n       Medicare beneficiaries without supplemental private \n     coverage for prescription drugs spend twice as much on \n     prescription drugs as their counterparts with private \n     insurance.\\8\\\n       Increasingly, the miracle cures of the future will depend \n     on pharmaceuticals developed through new breakthroughs in \n     biology and biotechnology. These cures will generally save \n     money overall, but the individual products will be expensive. \n     The dollar volume of drug sales last year increased 16.6%, \n     but most of the increase was due to greater use of costly new \n     drugs, rather than price increases.\\9\\\n       Medicare beneficiaries pay exorbitant prices for the drugs \n     they buy, because they generally do not have access to \n     discount programs available to other buyers. A study of five \n     commonly prescribed drugs found that Medicare beneficiaries \n     paid twice as much as the drug companies' favored \n     customers.\\10\\\n       Elderly persons without drug coverage are among the last \n     purchasers who pay full price. According to a recent Standard \n     and Poor's report on the pharmaceutical industry, \n     ``[d]rugmakers have historically raised prices to private \n     customers to compensate for the discounts they grant to \n     managed care consumers.'' Because Medicare beneficiaries are \n     among the only private patients without additional coverage, \n     they shoulder most of the burden generated by the industry's \n     preference for cost-shifting.\\11\\\n\n\n    adequate coverage and improved utilization are wise investments\n\n       Assuring Medicare beneficiaries access to drugs in a well-\n     managed program can produce immense savings for the Medicare \n     program. Savings arise because seniors are able to afford to \n     take the drugs that have been prescribed for their condition \n     and because it is easier to encourage compliance with drug \n     regimens and avoid complications or interactions because of \n     inappropriate use. Improper use of prescription drug costs \n     Medicare more than $20 billion annually, primarily through \n     avoidable hospitalizations and admissions to skilled nursing \n     facilities.\\12\\\n       One study found that hospitals costs for a preventable \n     adverse drug event run nearly $5,000 per episode.\\13\\\n       GAO reported in June 1996 that Medicaid's automated drug \n     utilization review system reduced adverse drug events and \n     saved more than $30 million a year in just five states.\n\n\n                        research and development\n\n       The Pharmaceutical industry spent more than $21 billion in \n     research and development in 1998.\\14\\ Ensuring access for the \n     elderly through this proposal will provide a natural market \n     for new and innovative therapies, promoting additional \n     investments in research and development.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Department of Labor, Employee Benefits in Small Private \n     Establishments.\n     \\2\\ The Lewin Group, ``Current Knowledge of Third Party \n     Outpatient Drug Coverage for Medicare Beneficiaries,'' \n     November 9, 1998, cited in staff documents, Medicare \n     Commission; Margaret Davis, et al., ``Prescription Drug \n     Coverage, Utilization, and Spending Among Medicare \n     Beneficiaries,'' Health Affairs, January-February, 1999.\n     \\3\\ AARP, ``Out-of-Pocket Spending.''\n     \\4\\ Stephen H.

Of the 4,000-man force, 749 were lost \nin this short battle.\n  On April 23, Exercise Tiger veterans will be honored at Crown Hill \nCemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana in commemoration of the 55th \nanniversary of the engagement. Tom Glynn, a retired US Navy veteran of \nExercise Tiger, will lay a wreath at the grave of Frederick C. Carr, US \nNavy, LST-531, who died in the operation at Slapton Sands. The toll of \na US Navy ship's bell will bring the ceremony to a close, ringing once \nfor each of the eight ships involved in Exercise Tiger.\n  Because of the sensitive nature of the mission, veterans of Exercise \nTiger were not properly recognized after the operation. Today's \nceremony in Indianapolis is the first tribute in Indiana to honor the \nmemory of fallen heroes of the battle. I ask my colleagues to join me \ntoday in honoring these courageous servicemen for their valiant service \nto the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/20/senate-section/article/S3947-4", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3947-S3948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JAMES P.

A lifelong resident of Outagamie\n\n[[Page S3948]]\n\ncounty, Mr. Schuette has shown great commitment to serving the region \nwhere he was raised.\n  During his years of public service, Mr. Schuette has been an integral \npart of many committees that have seen Outagamie county become one of \nthe fastest growing regions in Wisconsin. He has been a member of the \nProperty Committee and witnessed the county's first recycling facility \nand the purchase and acquisition of land for public parks. While on the \nlegislative committee, he saw region become more politically active on \nthe state level as the area grew and became more prosperous. In the \nfinal two years of his career, he attained the venerable position of \nCounty Executive.\n  Mr. Schuette is also a patriot. For nine years he served as a \nsergeant and drill instructor with the United States Marine Corps. \nAfter leaving the Marines, he continued his commitment to the armed \nforces with the United States Army Reserves, serving for 19 years and \nachieving the rank of Sergeant First Class.\n  James Schuette is an exemplary member of the Outagamie County \ncommunity and a tribute to his country. We must applaud his dedication \nand devotion to the community where he grew up as we wish James all the \nbest for his retirement and congratulate him on his many years of \nservice in our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/20/senate-section/article/S3948-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE RETIREMENT OF DAVID WOLFE\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I bring to the Senate's attention \nthe retirement of Mr. David Wolfe, the Deputy District Engineer for \nProject Management at the Memphis District of the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers.\n  Mr. Wolf held several positions during his 39 years with the \nDistrict, including Assistant Chief of Planning Division, Chief of the \nInformation Management Office, and Chief of the Planning Division. He \nhas served as Deputy District Engineer since 1994.\n  During his time at the Memphis District, Mr. Wolf initiated several \nprojects unique to the District and the Corps of Engineers. The Grand \nPrairie Region and Bayou Meto Basin, Arkansas Project provides \nirrigation for agriculture and reverses the depletion of groundwater \nsupply in central Arkansas. The Magnolia Street Project in Hickman, \nKentucky is a soil-saving, bluff stability project. Serving as a member \nof the Mississippi Valley Division's Resource Management Board, Mr. \nWolfe led the merging of Memphis District's Planning Division with the \nPrograms and Project Management Division.\n  Mr. Wolfe's outstanding technical and leadership capabilities have \nmade him a vital resource for my office and the people of Mississippi. \nIn particular, he should be recognized for his assistance to the flood \ncontrol needs of northwest Mississippi.\n  Upon his retirement on March 31, 1999, Mr. Wolfe was presented with \nthe Bronze de Fleury Medal in recognition of his contributions to the \nEngineer Regiment.\n  I know that all Senators join me in thanking David for his many years \nof service and in wishing him our best for his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/20/senate-section/article/S3948-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ERIC TYLER, THE NEWEST MEMBER OF THE STEPHENSON FAMILY\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to recognize an \nexceptionally special event that occurred yesterday, April 19, 1999. \nJohn Stephenson, Deputy Staff Director for the Senate Special Committee \non the Year 2000 (Y2K) Technology Problem, and his wife welcomed the \narrival of Eric Tyler, the newest member of the Stephenson family. Eric \narrived yesterday at 11:53 a.m. weighing in at a healthy 6 pounds 15 \nounces and measuring 19 inches long. I am extremely pleased to offer my \nsincere congratulations to John, Penny, and Eric's older sister, \nKaitlyn.\n  I must say that the staff leadership within the Y2K committee has \nbeen a prolific one. Late last year on September 17, 1998, Robert \nCresanti, Committee Staff Director, and Colleen, his wife, introduced \nKatja Maria, their first-born child, who arrived measuring 20.5 inches \nand a hearty 8 pounds 10 ounces. This is an excellent opportunity to \nexpress my personal heartfelt congratulations to Robert and Colleen.\n  As I ponder these events, I wonder if there is any connection to the \nfact that we now have another member of the committee professional \nstaff that is expecting their third child. You might question if the \ndue date is targeted for January 1, 2000. I will tell you that at this \npoint, the expected delivery date is much earlier, November 26th. We \nwill anxiously await yet another addition to the committee staff's \noffspring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/20/senate-section/article/S3948-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REGISTRATION OF MASS MAILINGS\n\n  The filing date for 1999 first quarter mass mailings is April 26, \n1999.
