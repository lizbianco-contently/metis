Mr. President, when a remarkable North Carolina native \ndied on March 16, a more perfect world would have dictated that his \ndeath be given far more attention than it received, attention that \nwould have invoked memories of a distinguished, decorated war veteran; \na career Air Force officer; and a conscientious, hard-working real \nestate agent; and most importantly, it would have kindled memories of a \nkind, gentle grandfather who enjoyed bass fishing and tending to his \nbeloved roses.\n  But, when death came to Thomas Wilson Ferebee, some of the media \nmentioned these fine personal qualities only in passing, but many \nothers will remember Tom Ferebee's carrying out his awesome, solemn \nresponsibility as\n\n[[Page S1696]]\n\nlead bombardier on the Enola Gay. It was he, on duty that fateful day \nwhen the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, helping to bring, \nfinally, an end to the costly, destructive, most terrible conflict that \nhistory records as World War II.\n  The decision to use the atomic bomb was an extraordinarily difficult \none. And, too often, revisionist historians have tried to rewrite the \nlessons of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with unjustified suggestions that \nHarry Truman's decision to use the bomb to end the war was immoral.\n  What would have been immoral, of course, would have been to force the \nworld into a further, protracted, bloody struggle when the means were \navailable to end it--with, in the end, less suffering, destruction, and \nkilling.\n  The weight of that decision was placed on the shoulders of the crew \nof the Enola Gay, among whom was a farm boy from Davie County, NC. In \nnearby Mocksville, where Tom Ferebee went to school, nobody could have \npredicted that this four-sport star of baseball, football, basketball, \nand track would be remembered one day around the world.\n  Throughout his later years, Tom Ferebee was often questioned about \nhis Enola Gay role. One journalist after another with their minds made \nup in advance tried to press Tom Ferebee to admit guilt about his \nrole--which Tom Ferebee rejected, saying, for example in 1995:\n\n       I'm sorry an awful lot of people died from that bomb, and I \n     hate that something like that had to happen to end the war. \n     But it was war, and we had to do something to end it.\n       None of us who were on the Enola Gay ever lost a minute's \n     sleep over it. In fact, I sleep better because I feel a large \n     part of the peace we have had in the last 50 years was what \n     we brought about. If we hadn't forced the surrender, there \n     would have had to be a land invasion of Japan and the \n     estimates are that a million Americans and as many Japanese \n     would have died in it.\n\n  Which is absolutely correct. The fact is, Mr. President, that Tom \nFerebee and his comrades deserve better than to be symbols of phony \nguilt resulting from an absolute necessity of war. Tom Ferebee knew--as \nwe do--that he did the right thing by carrying out his mission.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last year we spent a great deal of time \ntalking about whether or not we should have an $800 billion tax cut. We \nspent an inordinate amount of time working on that. The minority, the \nDemocrats, thought we should not do that, that it was too much; that \ninstead of having this large tax cut, we should have some targeted tax \ncut, much, much, much smaller. This debate went on for months. The sad \npart about it is, when we came to the appropriations bills, the 13 \nappropriations bills, suddenly there was no money. Even though there \nhad been $800 billion set aside, supposedly for tax cuts, there was no \nmoney to take care of the expenses that were necessary in the funding \nof this country.\n  Day after day we were talked to--some say talked down to--by our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle, that the economy would come to \na grinding halt if we did not pass this $800 billion tax bill. Of \ncourse, that has not happened. Not only did the minority not buy the \nplan of the majority, but the American people did not buy the plan. In \nany poll taken, the American people decided there were more important \npriorities.\n  What were those priorities?\n  Education--when you have 3,000 children dropping out of high school \nevery day, you would think that would be a priority.\n  Social Security is a priority. We have to make sure in the outyears \nSocial Security is as good to people as it is today. Social Security is \ngoing to be doing just fine until the year 2035, maybe 2036. But after \nthat period of time, people will only be able to draw 75 percent or 80 \npercent of their benefits. We need to make sure after that time they \ncan draw all their benefits.\n  We have to make sure Medicare is taken care of, that we do something \non this program that has been in existence for 35 years to take care of \npeople who need prescription drugs; that is, all seniors. The average \nsenior over age 65 fills 18 prescriptions a year. So we have to make \nsure Medicare, a very important program that has done a great deal to \nhelp the American senior population, that has allowed them to live \nlonger and live more productive lives--we have to make sure that as a \ncomponent of that there are some benefits for prescription drugs.\n\n  We have to make sure the debt is paid down. During the Bush-Reagan \nyears, we accumulated a huge debt of some $5 trillion. It is time we \nstarted paying down that debt. We are not going to have the rosy \neconomic scenario we now have forever. We are in the longest economic \ngrowth period in the history of this country. We are now in the 108th \nor 109th month, but that does not mean it will go on forever. It will \nnot. I hope when the economic downturn comes, we will have paid down \nthat debt and not have voted for irresponsible tax cuts.\n  It is interesting that the demagoguery and rhetoric has not stopped. \nIt is at full blast--again, talking about tax cuts. Governor George W. \nBush has recently proposed tax cuts which would add up to $1 trillion \nover 10 years. House Majority Whip DeLay from Texas--Congressman \nDeLay--last week, when asked about this, said let's do that and even \nmore. He wants even larger tax cuts than George W. Bush has called for. \nI think there could be no better example of ignoring the wishes of the \nAmerican people and ignoring what the economy needs.\n  As justification for this $1 trillion worth of tax cuts over programs \nsuch as saving Social Security, doing something about education, \nMedicare, and of course doing something about the national debt, the \nGovernor and others in the majority continually point to the \noverwhelming tax burden on the American people. I imagine there were a \nfew people around America this past Sunday wondering why have we been \ntalking about that after reading newspapers all over America.\n  A column in the Washington Post from the front page reads: ``Federal \nTax Level Falls for Most; Studies Show Burden Now Less Than 10%.''\n  This was not a partisan poll put out by the Democrats or some liberal \nthink tank. This information is from a series of studies by liberal and \nconservative tax experts. It shows that taxes are at their lowest point \nin more than 40 years; Federal income taxes are at their lowest point \nin more than 40 years.\n  I ask unanimous consent the article that appeared in the Washington \nPost and other newspapers around the country be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, March 26, 2000]\n\nFederal Tax Level Falls For Most; Studies Show Burden Now Less than 10%\n\n                           (By Glenn Kessler)\n\n       For all but the wealthiest Americans, the federal income \n     tax burden has shrunk to the lowest level in four decades, \n     according to a series of studies by liberal and conservative \n     tax experts, the Clinton administration and two arms of the \n     Republican-controlled Congress.\n       Each of the studies slices the data in different ways, but \n     the bottom line is the same: Most Americans this year will \n     have to fork over less than 10 percent of their income to the \n     federal government when they file federal income taxes.\n       The Congressional Budget Office estimates the middle fifth \n     of American families, with an average income of $39,100, paid \n     5.4 percent in income tax in 1999, compared with 8.3 percent \n     in 1981. The Treasury Department estimates a four-person \n     family, with the median income of $54,900, paid 7.46 percent \n     of that in income tax, the lowest since 1965. And the \n     conservative Tax Foundation figures that the median two-\n     earner family, making $68,605, paid 8.8 percent in 1998, \n     about the same as 1955.\n       Federal income taxes are so low for so many Americans that \n     it is little wonder many voters place tax cuts near the \n     bottom of their priorities in many opinion polls.\n       ``It's a shocker,'' said Bill Ahern, spokesman of the Tax \n     Foundation, of the group's calculation that families paid \n     just 8.8 percent of their income in federal tax. Low federal \n     taxes make it harder to make a case for tax cuts, he added. \n     ``With the lower- to middle-income taxpayers paying so little \n     . . . there won't be pressure'' for change.\n       George Velasquez agrees. ``I don't have any complaints on \n     the federal side,'' said the 29-year-old network engineer as \n     he left an H Block office in Falls Church last week. \n     Velasquez, who says he makes about $50,000, said he got hit \n     with unexpected state taxes\n\n[[Page S1697]]\n\n     when he moved recently, but thinks his federal taxes are \n     fair.\n       The low effective rates are the result of years of \n     tinkering with the tax code by Congress and various \n     administrations--rates were cut in the 1980s, millions of \n     Americans were removed from the tax rolls in 1990s by an \n     expansion of a tax credit for the working poor, and a bevy of \n     tax credits for children and education was added in 1997. \n     More than one-third of eligible taxpayers pay no income \n     taxes, according to the congressional Joint Committee on \n     Taxation.\n       These effective tax rates don't include payroll taxes to \n     fund Social Security and Medicare, which have risen since the \n     1970s, now taking on average about 9 percent of income, the \n     CBO says. Most Americans, however, now receive far more in \n     benefits after retirement than they paid while working. \n     Federal excise taxes for such items as alcohol, gasoline and \n     cigarettes--on average 1 percent of income--also aren't \n     included; neither are state and local taxes.\n       But federal income taxes are a key point of contention \n     between Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Gore in \n     the presidential race. Bush has proposed a tax cut estimated \n     to cost from $1.1 trillion to $1.7 trillion over 10 years as \n     the centerpiece of his economic plan, much of it aimed at \n     cutting tax rates for all taxpayers.\n       Gore has countered with what is now $350 billion in tax \n     cuts targeted at middle-income Americans. The size of Gore's \n     package has grown in recent months as the vice president has \n     added tax breaks aimed at what a spokesman describes as other \n     burdens, such as the rising cost of college.\n       Neither man has suggested changing payroll taxes or \n     significantly altering excise taxes. Bush has called for \n     repealing 23 percent--4.3 cents--of the 18.4 cent federal gas \n     tax.\n       ``I look at the data all the time,'' said Bruce Bartlett, \n     senior policy analyst at the Dallas-based National Center for \n     Policy Analysis, a conservative group. ``Taxes are never \n     showing up as a major factor. As far as people wanting a big \n     Reaganesque tax cut, I just don't see it. People are \n     satisfied with their economic situation.''\n       In the latest Battleground 2000 poll, conducted March 10-13 \n     by the Tarrance Group and Lake, Snell Perry & Associates, \n     only 6 percent of respondents listed reducing taxes as a very \n     important issue--behind restoring moral values, improving \n     education, strengthening Social Security and improving health \n     care.\n       Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, conducted a series of \n     focus groups earlier this year that in part looked at \n     attitudes toward taxes. She said that in contrast to previous \n     years, ``there was a lot less energy'' to the tax issue, in \n     part because people are cynical about whether they will \n     personally ever get much from a tax cut.\n       People appear more interested in government benefits that \n     would put money in their pocket--such as for prescription \n     drugs or college loans. Interestingly, Lake said, blue-collar \n     workers were more interested in tax breaks than more \n     affluent, college-educated workers who pay the bulk of taxes.\n       There now are five tax brackets that range from 15 percent \n     to 39.6 percent, depending on income level. But deductions, \n     exemptions and tax credits help to dramatically reduce the \n     effective rate for many taxpayers. Bush has proposed \n     replacing the current brackets with four ranging from 10 \n     percent to 33 percent because, as he put it earlier this \n     month, ``after eight years of Clinton-Gore, we have the \n     highest tax burden since World War II.''\n       Bush acknowledged that polls show little support for tax \n     cuts, but said: ``I'm not proposing tax relief because it's \n     the popular thing to do; I'm proposing it because it's the \n     right thing to do.''\n       Bush's assertion that the tax burden is so high is based on \n     dividing tax revenue into the nation's gross domestic \n     product. According to the Clinton administration's latest \n     budget, anticipated federal tax revenue from both corporate \n     and personal taxes will represent 20.4 percent of gross \n     domestic product this year, which is the highest since 1945.\n       The booming economy has added millions of jobs to the work \n     force, boosting tax revenue, and many economists also \n     attribute the surge in tax revenue in part to increased \n     capital gains revenue from the booming stock market.\n       But the gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the \n     economy, does not include capital gains income, thus \n     overstating the impact of increased capital-gains revenue. \n     And taxpayers making more than $200,000 pay more than three-\n     quarters of all capital gains taxes, according to \n     calculations by the Institute on Taxation and Economic \n     Policy, which uses a computer model to calculate the impact \n     of tax policy for Citizens for Tax Justice, a progressive \n     organization.\n       John Cogan, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a \n     Bush economic adviser, said the ratio of taxes to the \n     nation's goods and services is an accurate way to measure the \n     nation's tax burden. But he acknowledged that taxes have \n     declined for many low- and middle-income Americans.\n       ``That's a point worth talking about,'' Cogan said. The \n     burden of paying taxes has mostly shifted to high-income \n     Americans while taxes have decreased for others, he said.\n       The CBO estimates the wealthiest 20 percent of families \n     (with average income of $132,000) paid 16.1 percent of their \n     income in federal taxes in 1999--about the same as the late \n     1970s, before the Reagan tax cuts took effect. The top 1 \n     percent (with average income of $719,000) paid more, 22.2 \n     percent--but still far from the 39.5 percent top rate.\n       Sen. William V. Roth Jr. (R-Del.), chairman of the Senate \n     Finance Committee, acknowledged that federal taxes have \n     declined for many working Americans. ``We made some progress \n     because of the Republican Congress,'' he said, ``and we are \n     very proud of that fact.'' But he said taxes are still too \n     high, citing the ratio of tax revenue to the gross domestic \n     product.\n       In many of Bush's speeches, he expresses concern for the \n     tax burden of ordinary Americans, such as a waitress trying \n     to raise two children on $22,000 a year, as their incomes \n     increase. Larry Lindsey, Bush's chief economic adviser, \n     agrees that tax credits and the like have reduced effective \n     tax rates. But Lindsey said there is ``an egregious problem'' \n     of higher marginal rates--how much of additional income goes \n     to taxes--as the credits begin to phase out.\n       Bush's World Wide Web site (www.georgewbush.com) includes a \n     ``Bush Tax Calculator,'' which also demonstrates how low \n     taxes are for most Americans. A family of four making $56,000 \n     pays 8.3 percent of its income in federal tax, according to \n     the Bush online site, which Cogan said is based on the tax \n     code.\n       The online site's calculator also says a single parent with \n     two children making $22,000 a year pays $110 in federal \n     income taxes, or 0.05 percent of her wages. But the Bush \n     calculator doesn't include the impact of the earned-income \n     tax credit, which results in a rebate of $1,700 for this \n     wage-earner. A single parent with two children actually \n     doesn't owe federal tax until her income reaches nearly \n     $27,000.\n       Bush's plan would take many Americans who already pay \n     relatively low taxes off the tax rolls. But because Bush has \n     focused on cutting tax rates, the largest share of the tax \n     savings would go to Americans who pay most of the taxes.\n       The institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimated \n     that the wealthiest 10 percent of taxpayers would receive \n     more than 60 percent of the tax cuts in the Bush plan. \n     Someone making $31,100 would receive a tax cut of $501, about \n     1.6 percent of income, while a taxpayer making $915,000 would \n     receive a tax cut of $50,166--5.5 percent of income.\n       The Bush online calculator doesn't calculate taxes--or tax \n     cuts--for people making more than $100,000.\n\n  Mr. REID. I draw my colleagues' attention to this front-page story \nand a few of the statistics the article discusses.\n  The middle fifth of American families with average incomes of $39,100 \npaid 5.4 percent in income tax in 1999, down from 8.3 percent in 1981. \nFamilies with an income of $54,900 paid 7.46 percent in income tax, the \nlowest level since 1965. Even the median two-earner families making \n$68,605 a year were at 8.8 percent, paying their lowest level of income \ntax in 50 years.\n  According to the Washington Post and other newspapers around America, \neven conservative think tanks see the writing on the wall. A \nspokesperson for the Conservative Tax Foundation said:\n\n       It's a shocker.\n\n  That was referring to the 8.8-percent income tax level.\n\n       Low Federal taxes make it harder to make a case for tax \n     cuts. With the lower- to middle-income tax payers paying so \n     little there won't be pressure [for change].\n\n  Bruce Bartlett, senior policy analyst at the Dallas-based National \nCenter for Policy Analysis, another conservative group:\n\n       Taxes are never showing up as a major factor. As far as \n     people wanting a big Reaganesque tax cut, I just don't see \n     it. People are satisfied with their economic situation.\n\n  It is time we start addressing the real problems facing this country. \nSure, we would all like less taxes, but let's look where the taxes are \ncoming from. They are coming from State and local government, not from \nthe Federal Government. Take a look at payroll taxes, but get off the \nincome tax kick. The taxes are the lowest they have been in some 40 to \n50 years, according to your tax category. Even a Bush adviser \nacknowledges that taxes have declined for many low- and middle-income \nAmericans. I don't know if this adviser for Governor Bush will continue \nworking for him.\n  The problem, which is what we have been saying, as quoted in the \narticle:\n\n       Federal income taxes are so low for so many Americans that \n     it is little wonder many voters place taxes near the bottom \n     of their priorities in many opinion polls.\n\n  Why are our friends on the other side of the aisle not listening to \nthe American people? The public continues to demand first things first. \nWhat are they? Save Social Security, especially when we have the budget \nsurpluses which allow extending Social Security's long-term solvency. \nThe fact\n\n[[Page S1698]]\n\ncan't be ignored. We must do something about Social Security in the \noutyears. Republicans basically want to ignore Social Security, ignore \nthe debt of $5 trillion, and squander this surplus with rhetoric which \nchampions more than $1 trillion worth of tax cuts.\n  Remember, we have the lowest taxes in some 40 to 50 years, according \nto your tax category, yet most of the rhetoric on that side of the \naisle has been: Lower Federal income taxes.\n  As I said on numerous occasions, paying down the debt is a tax cut \nfor everyone. If we cut down the $5 trillion debt, which means we pay \nless interest every year as the Federal Government's biggest \nobligation, other than military, we would save billions and billions of \ndollars every month. It seems to me that is where we should put our \npriorities. Paying down the debt is a tax cut for everyone. Interest \nsaved from paying down the debt could be credited to the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds, which would extend their solvency \nand give us flexibility to target tax cuts. In other words, let's do \ntax cuts we can afford.\n  Certainly, there are some tax cuts that are necessary. We can \nincrease the standard deduction for both single and married filers. We \ncan provide tax relief to married couples who suffer as a result of \ntheir having been married. We can offer a long-term tax credit, \nproviding a deduction for long-term-care insurance premiums. In America \ntoday, people are living longer, more productive lives. As a result, \nthere are a lot of people going to extended-care facilities. It has \nbecome a tremendous burden for people placed in these institutions. We \nneed to provide some tax credits for people who buy insurance for their \ngolden years. This tax cut makes it easier not only for the people who \nbuy the insurance but for families who care for their elderly family \nmembers.\n  We need to increase deductions to make health insurance more \naffordable and accessible, especially for self-employed Americans. We \nneed to increase the maximum amount of child care expenses eligible for \ntax credit. These are targeted, reasonable tax cuts that would more \nevenly distribute the load.\n  I think it is remarkable we can pick up the paper Sunday and get the \ngood news. The good news is, Federal income taxes are the lowest they \nhave been in America for 40 to 50 years. I think that says a lot for \nthe 1993 Budget Deficit Reduction Act that passed without a single \nRepublican vote; we passed it. The Vice President came to the Senate \nand broke the tie. As a result of that, America has been put on a long-\nterm economic upturn. Not only has there been great economic news in \nthat the economy is doing well for a record amount of time but, in \naddition to that, taxes are lower than they have been in 40 to 50 \nyears.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand we have 45 minutes in morning \nbusiness set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I could be notified after 12 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/27/senate-section/article/S1698-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1698-S1700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NEED FOR ACTION ON PRESSING HEALTH ISSUES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to talk about two issues we must \naddress in this Congress before the end of the year, both dealing with \nhealth care. I will describe very briefly why these are important and \nwhy many have been pushing for some long while to try to get the Senate \nto act on this issue.\n  First is prescription drugs and Medicare. On Friday of the past week, \nI was in New York City with Senator Chuck Schumer holding a hearing on \nthe issue of prescription drugs and Medicare. I have held similar \nhearings in Chicago, in Minneapolis, and various places around the \ncountry as the chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee. We have had \nvirtually identical testimony no matter what part of the country we \nwere in. Senior citizens say drug prices are very high. When they reach \ntheir senior years, living on fixed incomes, they are not able to \naccess prescription drugs that they need.\n  In Dickinson, ND, a doctor told me of a patient of his who had breast \ncancer.\n  He told the woman after her surgery that she was going to have to \ntake some prescription drugs in order to reduce the chances of the \nrecurrence of breast cancer. When she found out what the cost of the \nprescription was, she said: I can't afford to take these drugs.\n  The doctor said: Taking them will reduce the risk of recurrence of \nbreast cancer.\n  The woman said: I will just have to take my chances.\n  Why did she say that? Because there is no coverage in the Medicare \nprogram for prescription drugs and because many of these prescription \ndrugs cost a significant amount of money. Senior citizens in this \ncountry are 12 percent of America's population, but they consume 33 \npercent of the prescription drugs in our country.\n  Last year, spending on prescription drugs in the United States \nincreased 16 percent in 1 year. Part of this increase is the increase \nin drug prices and part is greater utilization of prescription drugs.\n  What does that mean? It means that everyone has a rough time paying \nfor prescription drugs, especially senior citizens who live on fixed \nincomes. Many of us believe that were we to create a Medicare program \ntoday in the Congress, there is no question we would have a \nprescription drug benefit in that program.\n  Most of these lifesaving prescriptions were not available in the \nsixties when Medicare was created. But a lifesaving prescription drug \ncan only save a life if those who need it can afford to access it. That \nis the point. That is why many of us want to include in the Medicare \nprogram a benefit for prescription drugs. We do not want to break the \nbank. We want to do it in a thoughtful way. We would have a copayment. \nWe would have it developed in a manner that allows senior citizens to \nchoose to access it or not. They could either participate in this \nMedicare prescription drug program or they could decide not to do it.\n  In any event, we ought to do something on this subject. Those of us \nwho have come to the floor over and over again saying this is a \npriority believe with all our hearts this is something we should do for \nour country.\n  I will take a moment to describe part of the pricing problem with \nprescription drugs. The U.S. consumer pays the highest price for \nprescription drugs of anyone else in the world.\n  I ask unanimous consent to show a couple of pill bottles on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, these are two pill bottles. They are a \ndifferent shape, but they contain the same pill made in the same \nfactory, made by the same company.\n  This happens to be a pill most of us will recognize. It is called \nClaritin. It is commonly used for allergies. This bottle of 100 \ntablets, 10 milligrams each, is sold in the United States for $218. \nThat is the price to the customer in the United States. This pill \nbottle is sold in Canada. It is the same pill made by the same company, \nin the same number of tablets and the same strength, but this bottle \ncosts only $61. The same bottle of pills is $218 to the U.S. consumer; \nto the Canadian consumer, $61. By the way, the Canadian price has been \nconverted into U.S. dollars.\n  One must ask the question: Do you think the pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers are losing money in Canada selling it for $61? I \nguarantee you they would not sell it there if they were losing money, \nbut they charge 358 percent more to the U.S. consumer. I will \ndemonstrate another drug.\n  These two bottles contain Cipro. It is a common medicine to treat \ninfection. This time, the drug is actually packaged in the same type of \nbottle, with the same marking, same coloring, and containing the same \npills made by the same company. Incidentally, both were from facilities \ninspected by the FDA in the United States. Cipro, purchased in the \nUnited States, 500 milligram tablets, 100 tablets, costs $399. If one \nbuys the pills in the same bottle in Canada, it is $171. The U.S. \nconsumer is charged 233 percent more.\n\n  We need to do something about two issues: One, we need to put some \ndownward pressure on pharmaceutical drug prices and to ask the \nlegitimate question: Why should the American consumer pay higher \nprescription drug\n\n[[Page S1699]]\n\nprices than anyone else in the world? Is that fair? The answer, of \ncourse, is no.\n  What does it mean to those who can least afford it? It means \nlifesaving medicine is often not available to those who cannot afford \naccess to it. I can tell my colleagues story after story of folks who \ncame to hearings I held in Chicago, New York, and all around the \ncountry describing their dilemma. There were people who had double lung \ntransplants, heart transplants and cancers, talking about $2,000 a \nmonth in prescription drug costs.\n  This is serious, and this is trouble for a lot of folks. We need to \ndo something about putting downward pressure on prescription drug \nprices.\n  I have a solution for that, and that is to allow US pharmacists and \ndistributors access to the same drugs in Canada and to bring it down \nand pass the savings along to the US consumers. We have to pass a law \nto do that. We are having a little trouble passing that bill.\n  Second, we need to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare \nprogram.\n  I will now turn to the Patients' Bill of Rights, which is the second \npiece of legislation we ought to get done. The Senate has passed a \nbill, some call it the ``Patients' Bill of Goods'' because it did not \ndo much and it covered few people. The House passed a bipartisan bill, \nthe Dingell-Norwood bill. Democrats and Republicans joined to pass this \nbill. It is a good bill.\n  The Senate and House bills are in conference. The House appointed \nconferees who voted against the House bill because the House leadership \ndoes not support the bipartisan bill that passed the House. We have a \nparadox of conferees from the House who, by and large, do not support \nthe House bill, which is the only good bill called the Patients' Bill \nof Rights.\n  I will describe a couple of the elements of the Patients' Bill of \nRights, which are so important.\n  First is the situation with Ethan Bedrick. One might say: You have \ndone that before; that is unfair. It is not unfair. Health care denied \nto individuals is a very personal issue. When we have a framework for \nhealth care delivery in this country that denies basic health care \nservices under certain HMOs and certain policies to people who need it, \nit is perfectly fair to talk to people in the Senate about the need to \nchange public policy.\n  This is little Ethan Bedrick from Raleigh, NC. When he was born, his \ndelivery was very complicated. It resulted in severe cerebral palsy and \nimpaired the motor functions in his limbs. As you can see, he has \nbright eyes and a wonderful smile. When he was 14 months old, his \ninsurance company curtailed his physical therapy. Why? Because they \nsaid he only had a 50-percent chance of walking by age 5. A 50-percent \nchance of walking by age 5 is not enough, they said. This is a matter \nof dollars and cents, so Ethan shall not get his physical therapy.\n  Is it fair to raise these questions? Of course it is. Should someone \nlike Ethan with a 50-percent chance of walking by age 5 have an \nopportunity for the physical therapy he needs? You bet. Should we have \na Patients' Bill of Rights that will guarantee him that access under an \nHMO contract? You bet.\n  We have in the House of Representatives Dr. Greg Ganske, a \nRepublican, and very courageous fellow, I might add. He is one of the \nkey sponsors of the Patients' Bill of Rights in the House of \nRepresentatives. Dr. Ganske is also someone who has done a substantial \namount of reconstructive surgery.\n  He used this photograph, which is quite a dramatic photograph showing \na baby born with a very serious defect, a cleft lip shown in this \npicture. Dr. Ganske was a reconstructive surgeon before he came to \nCongress. He said he routinely saw HMOs turn down treatment for \nchildren with this kind of defect because they said it was not \nmedically necessary.\n  I thought when I heard Dr. Ganske make that presentation the first \ntime: How can anyone say correcting this is not medically necessary?\n  Then Dr. Ganske used a picture which showed what a correction looks \nlike when reconstructive surgery is done. Isn't it wonderful what can \nhappen with good medicine? But it can only happen if that child has \naccess to that reconstructive surgery.\n  Is it a medical necessity? Is it fair for us to discuss and debate \nthe Republican policy? The answer is clearly yes.\n  Let me also mention a case I have discussed before on the floor of \nthe Senate, young Jimmy Adams. Jimmy is now 5. When he was 6 months \nold, he developed a 105-degree fever. When his mother called the \nfamily's HMO, they were told they should bring James to an HMO-\nparticipating hospital 42 miles away, even though there were emergency \nrooms much closer.\n  On that long trip to the hospital, this young boy suffered cardiac \nand respiratory arrest and lost consciousness. Upon arrival, the \ndoctors were able to revive him, but the circulation in his hands and \nfeet had been cut off. As you can see, he lost his hands and feet.\n  Why didn't they stop at the first emergency room or the second \nemergency room that was closer? Because the HMO said: We will only \nreimburse you if you stop at the emergency room we sanction. So 42 \nmiles later, this young boy had these very serious problems and lost \nhis hands and feet.\n  What are we to make of all this? We have very significant differences \nin the Patients' Bill of Rights between the House and the Senate. The \ndifferences in the bill of rights in the House and the Senate are the \ndifferences dealing with medical necessity. As used in HMO contracts:\n\n       Medical necessity means the shortest, least expensive or \n     least intense level of treatment, care or service rendered or \n     provided, as determined by us.\n\n  The fact is, health care ought not be a function of someone's bottom \nline. Young Ethan, young Jimmy, or the young person born with a severe \nbirth defect, like the cleft palate defect of the type I described, \nought not be a function of some insurance company's evaluation of \nwhether their profit or loss margin will suffer by providing treatment \nto these patients.\n  A woman fell off a cliff in Virginia, dropped 40 feet and was \nrendered unconscious. She went into a coma and was brought into an \nemergency room and treated for broken bones and a concussion. They \nwheeled her into the emergency room on a gurney, while unconscious, yet \nthe HMO later, after she survived, said: We will not pay for your \nemergency room treatment because you did not have prior approval.\n  This is a woman, unconscious, in a coma, wheeled into an emergency \nroom, but she did not get prior approval. That is the sort of thing \nthat goes on too often in this country in health care. It ought to be \nstopped. It can be stopped if we pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. Not \nif we pass a patients' bill of goods that someone tries to misname to \ntell their constituents they have done something when, in fact, they \nstood up with the insurance companies, rather than with patients. We \nneed a Patients' Bill of Rights that really digs in on these issues: \nWhat is a medical necessity? Do patients have a right to know all of \ntheir options for treatment, not just the cheapest? Do they have those \nrights?\n  The piece of legislation that was passed in the House gives patients \nthose rights. The piece of legislation the majority passed in the \nSenate does not. We are going to continue to fight to try to get \nsomething out of this conference committee that medical patients in \nthis country, that the American people can believe will give them some \nbasic protection, some basic rights, so that the kinds of circumstances \nI have described will not continue to exist in this country.\n  Health care ought not be a function of someone's profit and loss \nstatement. People who need lifesaving treatment ought to be able to get \nit. The ability to access an emergency room during an emergency ought \nnot be something that is debatable between a patient and an HMO.\n  Those are the issues we need to deal with in the coming couple of \nmonths--both of them health care issues, both of them important to the \nAmerican people. I hope that as this debate unfolds, we will have some \nbipartisan help in trying to address prescription drugs in Medicare, \nNo. 1, and, No. 2, passing a real Patients' Bill of Rights, to give \nreal help to the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be able to \nproceed in morning business for a period of 12 minutes.\n\n[[Page S1700]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/27/senate-section/article/S1700-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1700-S1701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BUDGET PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, this week the Senate Budget Committee is \nabout to proceed with a markup of the budget resolution, an effort that \nis overdue. Nonetheless, it will be taken up this week. I think we \nshould examine the context in which the budget resolution will be \nconsidered in the Senate.\n  There was some awfully good news for American families this weekend. \nIt was announced this weekend that the Federal income tax burden for \nAmerican families has shrunk to the lowest level in 40 years. Who says \nthis? Studies by both liberal and conservative tax experts, the \nadministration, and two arms of the Republican-controlled Congress \nconfirmed that the Federal income tax burden for families in America is \nlower than it has been for 40 years.\n  The middle fifth of American families, with an average income of \n$39,100, paid 5.4 percent in income tax last year compared to 8.3 \npercent in 1981.\n  A four-person family, with a median income of $54,900, paid 7.46 \npercent of their income in income tax--the lowest since 1965. And a \nmedian two-earner family, making $68,605, paid 8.8 percent in 1988, \nwhich is about the same as in 1955.\n  In fact, one-third of American families no longer pay income tax.\n  That is the context in which we need to take up what we are going to \ndo as a people relative to our newfound economic prosperity that is \nbeing projected by so many.\n  We need to remember, too, how we arrived at this point.\n  In 1993, when President Clinton took office, he inherited a budget \nwith a record deficit of $290 billion per year. In 1993, we passed the \nBudget Act without a single Republican vote--none in the House; none in \nthe Senate. In fact, Vice President Al Gore cast the deciding vote on \nthis floor in the Senate and created a framework for a remarkable \nturnaround.\n  From almost 30 years of continuing hemorrhaging red ink and growing \ndeficits, we then had 7 years in a row of declining deficits--in fact, \nthe last 3 in surplus, even over and above that required for Social \nSecurity.\n  For fiscal year 2000, we are looking at a $26 billion surplus over \nand above Social Security. In the meantime, that set the framework for \n107 consecutive months of economic growth. There have been 20.4 million \nnew jobs since 1993. Home ownership is up a record 67 percent. Real \nwages have increased since the beginning of the Clinton administration \nby 6.6 percent, reversing a two-decade-long trend of declining real \nwages.\n  From 1993 to 1998, the number of poor people in America declined by \n4.8 million and the number of poor children went down by 2.1 million. \nIn these past 7 years, 7.2 million have left the welfare rolls--a 51-\npercent decline in the welfare rolls. Welfare recipients now account \nfor the lowest percentage of the U.S. population since 1967, the height \nof the Vietnam war.\n  In 1999, Federal spending was the smallest share of our gross \ndomestic product since 1966. Lower- and middle-income Americans had the \nsmallest tax burden in 40 years, as noted by the study that came out \nthis weekend. And we are now paying down debt.\n  By the end of fiscal year 2000, the Treasury expects to have reduced \nour debt held by the public by about $300 billion--that is ``billion'' \nwith a ``B''--from where it was only 3 years ago.\n  Now we have this great national debate. The experts in both the House \nand the Senate are projecting about a $3 trillion surplus over the \ncoming 10 years, thanks, in very large part, to the decision made in \n1993 to set that framework for prosperity and growth. We are talking \nabout a $3 trillion surplus. And $2 trillion of that is attributable to \nSocial Security. To the good credit of the President of the United \nStates, he said: Save Social Security first. Our Republican friends \nhave concurred. That is off the table.\n  The next question is, then: What do you do about the remaining $1 \ntrillion over the coming 10 years? The first thing is to be very \ncautious. Indeed, we have a hard time projecting 1 year in advance, \nmuch less 10 years in advance, what is going to happen to our economy.\n  We cannot get too giddy about how to spend or give back or do \nwhatever with $1 trillion that may or may not materialize. But that is \nthe debate that is going on today. It is going on between the two \nPresidential candidates. It has been going on between the parties. The \nAmerican public themselves are trying to digest what kind of vision we \nhave for America in the first 10 years of this century, the first 10 \nyears of this millennium.\n  George W. Bush has said he knows what to do with the $1 trillion \ndollars: essentially give it all back in a tax cut, commit to that now. \nIf $1 trillion doesn't actually show up, too bad, because Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and virtually everything else we do will be in \njeopardy.\n\n  There are others, including myself, who say, first, be prudent about \nwhether this trillion is going to materialize. To the degree that it \ndoes, let us look at making sure that we protect the long-term \nviability of Medicare, which is in shaky financial condition. Most \nconcur. Secondly, let us put some additional dollars towards paying \ndown the debt. That will keep the interest rates down. It will continue \nto foster economic growth and prosperity. It will make the ability to \nbuy a car, a house, to create new jobs, to run a farm or ranch all cost \nless. It will do more than many other things the Federal Government \ncould do.\n  Third, let's make sure we do make key investments in our schools. We \nhave crumbling schools all across the country. We have schools that \nhave a greater need for better technology. We have teacher pay \nproblems. We have problems all the way from Early Head Start through \nour graduate programs and research programs, including our technical \nand vocational programs. Let's put some dollars there as well. That \nwill create a foundation for continued economic growth and prosperity, \nif we continue to invest in the minds of American citizens.\n  We are in a global economy today. The world is full of people who \nwork as hard as any American for a dollar a day. The question is, Do \nAmerican workers bring to the table more than just a willingness to \nwork hard but also bring with them the technical skills and \nintellectual abilities to do things other people in the world cannot \ndo? That is where we need this growing, developing, and constructive \npartnership between the Federal, State, and local government, public \nand private, whereby we empower more American citizens to take care of \ntheir own needs, to grow the economy, and to make sure America remains \nthe foremost economic power in the world bar none.\n  Yes, in the context of how to use this $1 trillion, let's try to find \nsome room for tax relief, too, but let's target it to middle-class and \nworking families, families who have the most difficult time meeting \ntheir bills. When you look at George W. Bush's proposal, it is blown on \na tax cut, with nothing for the schools, nothing to invest, nothing to \nreduce the deficit, nothing to protect Medicare, at least not to the \ndegree that it needs to be done. Then look and see who are the winners \nand losers on this.\n  The typical middle-class family gets about a $500 tax cut; a-million-\ndollar-a-year income gets about a $50,000 tax cut. That is not fair, \nnot when we are being told we don't have the money to build new \nschools. We can't pass a bond issue in most of the counties in my State \nof South Dakota. Real estate taxes are through the roof. Our ag economy \nis not doing well. We are wondering how to replace all those 1910, 1920 \nvintage schools across my State. We are looking at still a great many \nchildren who would benefit from Early Head Start programs, Head Start \nprograms. We are looking at the need for better law enforcement. We are \nlooking at the need for investing in our infrastructure, including our \nrural water. We are looking at all the things we need to do to prepare \nourselves for the increasingly challenging economy of this coming \ncentury, the coming millennium.\n  That is where the American public is in concurrence with those of us \nwho say, first be prudent about that $1 trillion, making sure that we \nstay in the black, that we don't go back into the bad red-ink days of \nthe Reagan-Bush\n\n[[Page S1701]]\n\nyears and the years before that which were bipartisan; both parties \nwere in the red prior to 1993, for over 30 years. We don't want to go \nback to those days.\n\n  To the degree we have these dollars to utilize, let's make sure we \ncover an array of needs we have: paying down further debt; protecting \nMedicare; investing in our schools, education, making us a more \ncompetitive society; doing some things for our families; and, yes, some \ntax relief as well. But let's do it all in that package rather than \nsome sort of radical libertarian vision of America where the role of \nthe Federal Government is to guard the border and deliver the mail. \nMany of our friends seem to think we shouldn't be delivering the mail \nanymore either.\n  I think most Americans have a more moderate, mainstream view. The \nAmerican people are not ideologues. They are not far to the left. They \nare not far to the right. They don't want the Government to do \neverything, and they don't want a situation where the Government does \nnothing. They are commonsense about their vision of where we need to \nbe. I think we should use caution in taking public opinion polls too \nseriously around this place.\n  Time after time, poll after poll taken reveals the American public is \non the side of this more balanced, thoughtful, deliberative approach to \nhow we are going to position ourselves to be in a situation of strength \nin the years to come. A lot of people's eyes glass over when we talk \nabout budget issues, dollars and cents, talking about trillions of \ndollars. It is almost unfathomable. Yet at the heart of it all, where \nour real values and priorities lie is determined by those dollars-and-\ncents decisions we make in this body and on which we are about to begin \nthis week.\n  The rhetoric is never lacking. The rhetoric is always in favor of \nalmost everything. But when it comes time to see whether we are going \nto protect the environment, whether we are going to help our kids, \nwhether we are going to rebuild schools, strengthen Medicare, whether \nwe are going to do something about prescription drugs and health care, \nas Senator Dorgan from North Dakota has noted, whether we are going to \ndo these kinds of things is, in large measure, dictated by the dollar-\nand-cents decisions we make on this floor.\n  This is going to be a very crucial week. We will be establishing a \nbudget resolution. I am fearful from what I see headed our way that \nthere is a likelihood that it will be another partisan political \nexercise at a time when the American public is rightfully frustrated by \nthe lack of ability of the two parties to work together as well as they \nshould. If that is the case, we will see, as we go through the 13 \nseparate appropriations bills or omnibus bill in the end, as may wind \nup being the case, whether we come out in a way that is, in fact, \nbalanced, which does, in fact, use the resources necessary.\n  It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Two generations have gone by \nwaiting for this opportunity to have our Federal Government in the \nblack and to make some policy decisions about how we can partner \ntogether to continue opportunity and prosperity for all of our citizens \nand not just a few. How tragic it would be if we were to lose this \nopportunity, if we would say, no, there is no role for the Federal \nGovernment to improve Medicare, to keep our rural hospitals open with a \ndecent level of reimbursement, to rebuild our schools, to do the things \nthat need to be done while at the same time providing some tax relief \nand paying down debt. What a loss that would be if we were to miss that \nopportunity.\n\n  There is no more fundamental decision to be made in this the 2nd \nsession of the 106th Congress than these budget issues that are before \nus this week. We can be proud and we can take some satisfaction in the \nfact that taxes for middle-class families are now the lowest in 40 \nyears, that we have had 3 years in a row of budget surpluses over and \nabove that required for Social Security, and that our economy has had 8 \nyears in a row of continuous GDP growth. But there is no automatic \npilot on which to put our economy. It requires difficult decisions to \nbe made each and every year by the Congress to set the stage for \ncontinued prosperity.\n  That is the challenge before us. I am hopeful that before we adjourn \nat the end of this year, we will be able to look back at this 2nd \nsession of the 106th Congress as truly a watershed time, a fork in the \nroad where we chose the right road to go down in terms of strengthening \nour society and creating a framework for continued growth and \nprosperity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss our long-term energy \nneeds and the energy problems we are currently facing in this country \nand to express my dismay with the Clinton administration last week \nbecause of the neglect of the long-term energy needs of our Nation's \neconomy and its energy consumers.\n  I spent a great deal of time outlining my concern with the \nadministration's failure to develop a coherent plan for reducing our \nreliance on foreign oil and for increasing our nation's energy \nsecurity. I outlined my disgust for how this administration has ignored \nour nuclear waste storage crisis, moved to breach hydropower dams in \nthe northwest, forced regulation upon regulation on other energy \nproduction technologies, and displayed a complete disregard for the men \nand women who find and produce domestic supplies of oil and natural \ngas.\n  In fact, this administration has virtually ensured that the oil price \ncrisis we're now facing will pale in comparison to the electricity \nprice and supply problems that are just around the corner for our \nnation's electricity consumers. I know both the energy producers and \nconsumers of Minnesota are astutely aware of the generation and \ntransmission problems that will grip our state in the not-too-distant \nfuture. Those problems are not confined to Minnesota. Many States in \nthe upper Midwest face generation and transmission shortages, as do \nStates across the country. Those problems are rooted in the failure of \nthis administration to comprehend the generation needs of a growing \neconomy and the transmission requirements of that growing demand.\n  While I strongly believe that, in the absence of a coherent \nadministration energy policy, Congress needs to step in and forge its \nown path for meeting the long-term energy needs of our economy, I've \ncome to the floor today to talk about the need for some short-term \nmeasures to address high oil prices.\n  In Minnesota, farmers are preparing to enter the fields for spring \nplanting. They're trying to budget for the year and put in place a \nbusiness plan that will put food on the table and put their children \nthrough school. As everyone knows, doing these most basic things is no \neasy task when commodity prices are low, the weather is uncooperative, \nand government regulations eat away at the ability to show a profit. \nThis year, however, farmers have a new worry that threatens to make \nmatters even worse--the growing price of diesel fuel and gasoline. \nFarming is an extremely energy intensive industry. Everything farmers \ndo require energy; from plowing the field to milking the cows, energy \nis an essential part of a farm's bottom line.\n  Likewise, truckers throughout America are essential to delivering the \nproducts we use in our everyday lives to markets across the country. \nWithout truckers, we wouldn't have access to most of the things we all \ntake for granted on a daily basis. Even the internet becomes virtually \nworthless to consumers if truckers can't deliver to our doorsteps the \nproducts we buy. Like farmers, truckers rely heavily upon stable energy \ncosts to make a living and run their businesses. When fuel prices go \nup, truckers feel the impact first. Too often, they have to absorb the \nincreases in fuel prices, but it's not long before everything from \nfruits and vegetables to our children's school supplies begin to rise \nin price as a result of climbing fuel costs. We need look no further \nthan the surcharges now being placed on delivery services to see the \ncompounding negative impacts of increased transportation costs.\n\n[[Page S1702]]\n\n  Many of us in the Senate have witnessed the stream of truckers from \nacross the country who have descended upon Washington, DC, in recent \nweeks. They have come to their Nation's Capitol not because they want \ngovernment to give them something, but because they cannot make a \nliving when the Department of Energy is caught napping on the job. They \nexpect, demand, and deserve an Energy Department that comprehends the \nimportance of energy costs to our economy and has a long-term plan for \nmeeting the needs of energy consumers.\n  Mr. President, I know I do not have to remind my colleagues of how \nthe rising cost of oil threatens almost every aspect of our economy and \ncommunities. Senior citizens on fixed incomes cannot absorb wild \nfluctuations in their energy costs. Business travelers and airlines \ncannot afford dramatic increases in airline fuel costs. Families \nstruggling to feed and educate their children cannot withstand higher \nheating bills, increasing gasoline costs, or the domino effect this \ncrisis has on the costs of goods and services.\n  To begin addressing this problem, I have joined Majority Leader Trent \nLott, Senator Larry Craig, and a number of my colleagues in offering \nlegislation to repeal the 4.3-cent gas tax while protecting the Highway \nTrust Fund and not spending any of the Social Security surplus. Our \nlegislation is aimed at getting some short-term relief directly into \nthe hands of energy consumers. Our bill will eliminate 4.3-cent tax on \ngasoline, diesel, and aviation fuel so the American consumer can see \nsome relief at the pump when they fuel up for a day on the road, in the \nfield, or traveling to and from school or work. Our bill will eliminate \nthe 4.3-cent tax starting on April 16 through January 1, 2001. For \nfarmers, truckers, airlines, and other large energy consumers, this \naction will have an even greater positive impact because of the large \namounts of fuel they consume.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues argue that 4.3 cents a gallon has \na negligible impact on consumers. To them, I say look at the amount of \nfuel a farmer or trucker consumes during an average week. Look at the \nthousands of gallons of diesel fuel required to operate a family farm \nor deliver products from California to Maine. Or look at the tight \nprofit margins that can make the difference between going to work and \nbeing without a job. I'm convinced this action is going to help \nfarmers, truckers, businesses, and families in Minnesota and that's why \nI strongly support it.\n  For those who are concerned that eliminating the 4.3-cent gas tax is \ngoing to deplete important highway and infrastructure funding, we've \nincluded language in this legislation that will ensure the Highway \nTrust Fund is completely protected. The Highway Trust Fund will be \nrestored with on-budget surplus funds from the current fiscal year as \nwell as the fiscal year 2001.\n  If gas prices reach $2 a gallon, on-budget surplus funds will allow \nadditional reductions in the gas tax without impacting the Highway \nTrust Fund in any way. Depending on the size of the on-budget surplus, \nour legislation could provide a complete reduction of federal gas taxes \nuntil January 1, 2001 if prices rise to, and remain above, the $2 mark. \nLet me make this very clear: we are not going to raid the Highway Trust \nFund with this legislation. In fact, we've ensured that the on-budget \nsurplus will absorb all of the costs of the gas tax reduction. I also \nwant to assure my colleagues and my constituents that this legislation \nwalls off the Social Security surplus. We will not spend any of the \nSocial Security surplus to pay for the gas tax reduction.\n\n  Our legislation is quite simply a tax cut for the American consumer \nat a time when it's needed most. We're going to use surplus funds--\nfunds that have been taken from the American consumer above and beyond \nthe needs of government--and give them back to consumers every day at \nthe gasoline pumps.\n  For me, this legislation boils down to a very simple equation. Are we \ngoing to sit by and do nothing as farmers prepare to enter the fields \nthis spring, or are we going to take whatever short-term actions we can \nto support our farmers and provide them with a needed boost? Are we \ngoing to help those most impacted by high fuel costs, or are we going \nto ignore their needs and let them absorb thousands of more dollars in \nfuel costs this summer? There is overwhelming proof that the Clinton \nadministration's complete rejection of a national energy policy has \ncaused this mess, so I believe the Congress must step in and help get \nthem out of it.\n  I joined my colleagues in the Senate earlier this year in requesting \nand receiving emergency releases of Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nfunding. We did so on at least three separate occasions, and I've \nsupported the President's request for $600 million in additional \nfunding this year. This crucial funding for Minnesota and many other \ncold weather States was a vital short-term approach to mitigating the \nimpact high fuel costs have had on senior citizens and low-income \nfamilies. Our constituents were in need, and we responded exactly as we \nshould have. Right now, even more of our constituents are in need, and \nby responding with a reduction in the Federal gasoline tax, Congress \ncan again act in a way that is expected, even demanded, by our \nconstituents.\n  As I started earlier, the gasoline crisis requires that Congress act \nnow to stem rising energy costs in the near term. It also requires that \nelected officials and bureaucrats across Washington take a serious look \nat the direction in which our Nation is headed with its energy policy. \nI am prepared to take a hard look at any options that might help my \nconstituents right now, and I demand that this administration explore \noptions to ensure that our nation reduces its reliance on foreign oil \nand establishes a much more sound energy policy for decades to come, to \nmake this country energy independent and not so dependent on foreign \nsources of energy that when they turn them on or off, it can have \ndramatic impact on our economy. While those solutions will not happen \novernight, I believe a reduction in the gas tax will help. It is going \nto help now, and it is going to help when that help is needed the most.\n\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to talk a little bit about oil \nprices. I guess most everyone wants to talk about oil prices and gas \nprices at the pump--those things that affect each of us. First of all, \nI have had the opportunity to meet in the Chamber this morning and hear \na little discussion about taxes. So I will comment for a moment on \nthat.\n  We are now dealing with the budget, which of course is one of the \nbasic responsibilities of Congress, and the question of how much money \nwe spend in the Federal Government. That has to do with the whole \nphilosophical question of how large a Government we want and the things \nwe want the Federal Government to be involved in, how much involvement \nwe want in all of those things--what is the division between the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government, local government, and State \ngovernment. I think these are obviously some of the most important \nissues with which we deal. These are broad issues. These are \nphilosophical issues. The budget has a great deal to do with it.\n  In fact, I suspect that the total amount of expenditures is probably \nthe most important issue we deal with all year, depending on how you \nview the role of Government. Keep in mind this year we will spend about \n$1.8 trillion. That is $1,800 billion in the Federal budget. About a \nthird of that will be so-called discretionary funding, which is \ndetermined by the Congress. The remainder, two-thirds of that, $1,800 \nbillion, will be mandatory spending--\n\n[[Page S1703]]\n\nthings such as Social Security, Medicare, and others.\n  We are dealing with setting a budget that basically is an expenditure \nlimit on that discretionary spending, which last year, as I recall, \nrose about 7.5 percent more, much more than inflation. This year I \nthink there is an effort being made to see if we can control that level \nof spending. It has to do with the size of Government. Clearly, \neveryone has different views, of course, as to how to adequately fund \nprograms we think are most important--the priorities the public sets \nthrough their representatives in terms of Government programs.\n  One of the things it seems to me we haven't done as well as we might \nis to review programs that have been in place for a very long time. \nSome of them, obviously, are important programs that need to go on. \nOthers were designed to do something for a relatively short time, but \nthey are always there. They never go away because we do not have the \nopportunity to have the oversight to see if, in fact, those programs \nhave accomplished the things they were designed to accomplish, and if, \nindeed, those dollars can be spent more productively in some other \nprograms.\n  We find ourselves in a situation of having these programs that have \nbeen in place forever and are almost automatically funded and the \nobvious need for new programs from time to time as time and needs \nchange. It is simply an accumulation of programs. Those of us who \noccasionally say to ourselves that we ought to control the size of \nGovernment, have to take a look at those kinds of issues.\n  I hear my friends talk about the evils of tax reduction. They ought \nto review that a little bit, it seems to me.\n  First of all, we ought not spend Social Security dollars for \noperating funds. We have been doing that for 40 years, but we have not \ndone that in the last 2 years. We hear our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle and the administration and President Clinton saying: Save \nSocial Security. Not one program has come from them as to how to do \nthat.\n\n  These young pages sitting here will pay out of their first paycheck \n12.5 percent for Social Security. The likelihood is, if we don't do \nsomething, that they will not have benefits when they are eligible for \nthem.\n  We need to do something. We have a plan. We set aside at least a \nportion of that for individual retirement accounts. Let it belong to \nthe persons who made it, and, indeed, let them invest in private sector \nequities or bonds so that the return is much higher.\n  The choices we have are fairly simple. We can reduce benefits. Nobody \nwants to do that. We can increase taxes. I don't know of anybody who \nwants to do that. Social Security taxes are the highest that most \npeople pay of any tax. Or we can increase the return for the trust \nfunds. We are for that. The administration has no plan at all other \nthan to say: Save Social Security.\n  We need to do something about paying down the debt. Most everyone \nwould agree with that. The debt that the President brags about paying \ndown is taking Social Security money and putting it into debt. It would \nbe replacing public debt. But it is still debt. It is debt to the \nSocial Security trust fund.\n  What I propose and what I think we ought to do is set money aside \njust like with a home mortgage, and each year we will take so much \nmoney. It will take this amount of money to pay this year's obligation \nto pay off the debt in real dollars. So instead of being replaced by \nSocial Security dollars, that debt is being reduced. That is what we \nare for. The President has no plan. All we hear is this great talk \nabout it but nothing is happening.\n  Then, quite frankly, we talk about taxes. What we are talking about, \nat least to some extent, is not simply reducing debt. It is a fairness \nissue. The marriage penalty tax is a fairness issue. Why should two \npeople who work independently and are married pay this amount of tax? \nThat isn't fair. It is a fairness issue. It is not just tax reduction.\n\n  There are ways to change the estate taxes. The Presiding Officer has \na proposal that estate taxes ought to be paid when they pay taxes as a \nmatter of capital gains. Good idea. Then there is money left, unless \none continues to spend it.\n  People talk about taxes and balancing the budget and the economy \ngrowing starting in 1993. I am sorry, it didn't start in 1993; it \nstarted in 1991. It has been going on for a good long time. I cannot \nimagine the President's tax increase has contributed a great deal to \nthe economic growth.\n  People have different views. That is what it is all about. We have \ndifferent views of how we best serve this country. There are many \nviews.\n  We talk about energy. Thirteen leaders of the OPEC nations are \nmeeting in Vienna to discuss boosting oil production. I appreciate the \nefforts of Secretary Richardson. I hope the answer is they will \nincrease production. That is a good thing to have happen.\n  We have to talk about how we got ourselves in a position of having to \ngo over to OPEC, saying: We have real problems; will you help us out? \nAnd then we do not get much of a response from the very group we have \ncontributed so much to, not only in dollars but in the gulf war. Then \nwe find them deciding whether they will do us a favor by increasing oil \nproduction.\n  How did we get where we are? I think we have had a lack of a policy \nregarding energy, not only in petroleum but in the whole sphere of \nenergy. I come from the largest coal-producing State. This \nadministration has made it increasingly difficult to produce energy as \nit has sought to close down energy powerplants because of maintenance.\n  We find ourselves depending on others and that puts at risk not only \nour economy but also our security. We find ourselves now in the \nneighborhood of 57-percent dependent on foreign oil. We see consumption \ngoing up each year; domestic production is going down at the same time.\n  What are some of the reasons? Some are what have happened in the last \nfew months in terms of this administration which has set about to leave \na ``land'' legacy--and I understand Presidents desire to have different \nlegacies. This is called a land legacy where they will set aside more \nand more private lands and put them into public ownership to have a \nbillion dollars a year they can spend at their own discretion without \ngoing through the process of Congress and appropriations to acquire \nmore Federal lands.\n  In my State of Wyoming, nearly 50 percent of our land belongs to the \nFederal Government. Selfishly, it makes a lot of difference if the land \ncan be used as multiple-use public lands, if we can protect the \nresource, protect the environment, but also use those lands--whether \nfor hunting, for recreation, for grazing, whether it be for coal and \ngas production. We can do these things in such a way that we have \nmultiple use as well as protection of the environment.\n  This administration has moved in a different direction. I have been \non the Energy Committee since I came here in 1994. We have not had from \nthe Energy Department a coherent policy on energy for a very long time. \nWe had a meeting this morning on the Kyoto treaty, the meeting in Japan \nwhere we were supposed to sign a treaty which would reduce our energy \nby about 40 percent, while asking less of the rest of the world. Of \ncourse that has not been agreed to. As a matter of fact, this Senate \nvoted 95-0 not to agree to it--not that we shouldn't be doing something \nabout clean air, not that we shouldn't be doing something to reduce the \neffect of economic growth--but not to just sign a treaty that says we \nare going to put ourself at a disadvantage.\n\n  This is part of where we are, including access to Federal lands, \nwhere we have 40 million acres, using the Antiquities Act, to set aside \nother lands for single purpose uses. We have had for some time offshore \noil drilling, one of the great opportunities to provide domestic oil. \nWe have tried from time to time to do something to give a tax advantage \nfor marginal oil wells so they would produce, but the administration is \nopposed.\n  We talked about looking at ANWR, to do something in Alaska, to \nprovide more domestic oil so we are not totally dependent on foreign \ncountries to provide that energy source. That is not only good for the \neconomy and jobs, but it is a security measure.\n  Since 1992, oil production is down 17 percent in the United States; \nconsumption is up 14 percent. In just 1 year under this administration, \noil imports\n\n[[Page S1704]]\n\nincreased almost 8 percent; they are now getting close to 60 percent. \nDOE predicts a 65-percent oil dependency on foreign oil by the year \n2020. We have become even more dependent.\n  The United States spends about $300 million each day on imported \ncrude oil, $100 billion each year. We are concerned the trade deficit \nfrom oil amounts to about one-third of the trade deficit. Now we are \nlooking at short-term issues when what we have to do is take a look at \nthe longer term resolution to these problems.\n  The policy that would change this, and one we look forward to, is \nincreased access to public land, continuing to emphasize, however, the \nidea that we need also to protect the environment. We can do that.\n  I mentioned tax incentives that would increase production. We need to \nlook at the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act which is being used \nto reduce the use of lands as well. It has a real impact to a lot of \npeople in my State which is largely a State that has mineral \nproduction.\n  In 1990, U.S. jobs exploring and producing oil amounted to over \n400,000; in 1999, these jobs are down to 293,000, a 27-percent \nreduction in the ability of America producing our own oil. In 1990, we \nhad 657 working oil rigs; now it is down to 153, a 77-percent decline.\n  I think we need to take a long look at where we are and where we want \nto go. Any government looking at energy has to recognize the \nstewardship responsibility that we have for the environment. We do \nthat. At the same time, we have to be able to produce for ourselves so \nwe have the freedom and opportunity to continue to have the strongest \neconomy in the world, the greatest for jobs, while strengthening our \nsecurity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to join \nmy colleague from Wyoming who has so clearly outlined in the last few \nmoments part of the problems our country faces at this time in our \nhistory relating to energy policy, or a lack thereof.\n  As I speak on the floor, as my colleague has just completed his \ncomments, all eyes are turned on Vienna. That is not Vienna, NY, that \nis Vienna, Austria, where the OPEC nation members are meeting to decide \nwhether they will be generous enough to turn their valves on a little \nmore and increase crude oil production to a million or a million and a \nhalf barrels a day so that our gas prices will come down at the \npump. How can a great nation such as ours now find itself so dependent \nupon a group of nations, almost all of them quite small but all of them \nvery rich in crude oil? How do we find ourselves dependent on their \nthinking? What is the reason we find ourselves dependent? This is part \nof what my colleague from Wyoming was talking about. It is the loss of \nproduction units and the drop in number of rigs out exploring, and that \nis all our fault, our fault collectively as a nation, for having failed \nover the last several decades to put in place an energy policy that \nhad, as its first criterion, relative independence from other nations \nof the world as suppliers of our fundamental energy-based need for \ncrude oil, crude oil production for our petrochemical industry.\n\n  I have been to the floor several times in the last couple of weeks to \nspeak about this because the price at the pump today is not an \naberration. It is not something that was just quick in coming. We, as a \ncountry, have known for some time this day would be at hand. Several \nyears ago, we asked our Government to investigate whether a lack of \ndomestic production would put us at some form of vulnerability as to \nour ability to defend ourselves. The answer was yes. Those studies were \nplaced on the desk of our President, Bill Clinton. Nothing was done. A \nyear ago similar studies were done, and they reside on the President's \ndesk as we speak. They have been there since last November, and nothing \nhas been done.\n  Only in the last month has the President sent his Secretary of Energy \nout and about the world, with his tin cup in hand, begging--begging \nproducing nations to turn their valves on a little bit.\n  What is the consequence of turning your valve on at the pump? The \nconsequence is a reduction in the overall world spot price of crude \noil. When you do that, the cash-flow pouring out of this country to the \nOPEC nations of the world declines; oil production goes up, cash-flow \ndeclines. Why would they want to do that? Out of the generosity of \ntheir hearts?\n  For the last year-and-a-half or 2, they have been in political \ndisarray. During that time, they were largely pumping at will into the \nworld market. A year ago, we saw crude oil prices at $10 a barrel on \nthe world market. Today, they are over $30. Now $10 a barrel is \nprobably too low, but $30 is a huge and bountiful cash-flow to the \ntreasuries of these countries--Saddam Hussein's country, the man whose \ncountry we fought against to free Kuwait and the Kuwaiti oil fields \nless than a decade ago.\n  In fact, it was Northeastern Senators who, some months ago, wrote a \nletter to our President asking him to become sensitive to this issue \nbecause they were aware, with the run-up in oil prices--and we knew it \nwas coming the minute the OPEC nations got their act together--the \nNortheastern Senators would see their States hit by heavy home heating \noil costs. Sure enough, that is what happened. It happened because of \nthe run-up in price. It also happened because of a loss of refinery \ncapacity that has been going on for some time.\n  What was going on in the Northeast, 2 and 3 months ago, is now going \non across America. I come from the West, where energy prices are \nextremely high and the impact on goods and services, and our citizens, \ncan be dramatic. So even if the OPEC oil countries decide to raise \ncrude oil output, my guess is it will be just a little bit. It may \nsound like a lot to the average listener--a million, million-and-a-half \nbarrels a day--and it could bring crude oil prices down a little bit. \nBut the OPEC nations' goal is to keep crude oil prices above $20 a \nbarrel and therefore keep regular gas at the pumps at somewhere in the \n$1.40 to $1.50 range. That is still a dramatic increase, nearly \ndoubling east coast prices. It will be even higher on the west coast.\n\n  The failure of the Clinton-Gore administration to recognize it, to \nunderstand it, and therefore to deal with it, is one of the great \ndomestic and foreign policy tragedies of the decade. I say that from an \neconomic point of view, but it is true also from a defense point of \nview--our ability to defend ourselves and stand as an independent \nnation in a community of nations around the world.\n  Here are some statistics. Probably everyone's eyes glaze over a \nlittle bit when you use statistics, but it is important for the record. \nU.S. crude oil production is down by 17 percent since 1992. We have \nactually had wells shut off and shut in. What does that mean? The price \nof oil got so low, they could not afford to pump them. It cost money to \nproduce. So they turn the well off and they shut the well in, meaning \nit no longer has the capability of producing.\n  U.S. crude oil consumption during that same period of time went up 14 \npercent: 17 percent down in production, 14 percent up in consumption. \nIt sounds like a ready-made situation for a crisis, and that is exactly \nwhere we find ourselves today. The United States is 55-percent \ndependent upon those nations that are meeting in Vienna at this moment; \n55-percent dependent for so much of what we do. That is dramatically up \nfrom just a couple of decades ago when we were in the mid-30s, relating \nto dependency.\n  While all of this is going on and nothing is being done by this \nadministration, and most of what we are trying to do here has either \nbeen denied or vetoed or blocked by this administration, the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy estimates we will have a 65-percent dependency on \nforeign producers by the year 2020. Some would say that is good because \nwe will not have the environmental risks in this country; we will not \nbe drilling and we will not be refining as much, and therefore the \nenvironmental risks will be gone.\n  What they did not tell you is, it puts hundreds of new supertankers \nout there on the open ocean on a daily basis--even if our foreign \nneighbors will produce and even if they will sell to us, hundreds more \nof those huge supertankers out there in the open ocean,\n\n[[Page S1705]]\n\ncoming into our ports, offloading. Let me tell you, there are greater \nenvironmental consequences for that than the use of today's technology \non our land or out in our oceans, drilling, finding, and shipping to \nour refineries.\n  The United States is spending $300 million a day on imported crude \noil. That is $100 billion a year flowing out of this country to the \ncoffers of the OPEC nations. That is big money, huge money, in any \nsense of the words. We sit here and wring our hands over a balance of \npayments, yet we do nothing to bring that production back to our shores \nand to be able to control our own destiny in the production of crude \noil.\n  As I mentioned, the world oil price reached over $30, about $34 a \nbarrel on March 7. It is down a little bit now on speculation that the \nOPEC nations today will make decisions that will increase production. \nBut, of course, we already know energy prices on the west coast are at \nnearly $2 a gallon at the pump and are certainly extremely high here. \nMore than half of all crude oil we use, about 18 million barrels per \nday, goes directly into home heating oil, motor gasoline, diesel fuel, \nand other transportation fuels.\n  The Clinton-Gore administration has failed to do one single thing to \ndevelop more of our Nation's crude oil reserves, of which we have an \nabundance. In fact, I was watching CNN a few moments ago. Some people \nin the oil industry would suggest only about half of the crude oil \ncapability of this Nation has been used since we first discovered crude \noil. Only about half of it has been used. The rest of it is under the \nground. It is more difficult to find, more expensive to produce, but it \nis still there, and the great tragedy is we are not producing it. In \nfact, we are doing quite the opposite.\n\n  Since this administration has come to town, there has been an anti-\noil attitude from a standpoint of domestic production. From the very \nbeginning, they pushed through a 4.3 percent gas tax increase. They \nargued it was for deficit reduction. But when one listens to the \nsoundings of the Vice President when he talks about crude oil and \ncombustion engines and how negative they are to the environment and we \nought to tax them out of existence--and he has said all of those \nthings; I am paraphrasing, but it is not new; he has been replete in \nthose expressions over the years--it is not unexpected that he cast the \nsingle vote that broke the tie between Democrats and Republicans on \nthis floor that put the gas tax in place.\n  We now are looking to try to take that gas tax off in the very near \nfuture, at least roll it back a ways, and give our consumers some \nflexibility. We are going to balance the budget this year and have \nsurpluses. Why not use some of that surplus money to offset the runup \nin expenses that consumers are now feeling at the gas pump at this \nmoment and that certainly our transportation industry is feeling? It \nought to be something we do.\n  I argue that we hold the highway trust fund fully offset. That is the \ntrust fund that funds the pouring of concrete for our roads and our \nbridges and creates hundreds of thousands of jobs a year in the \nbuilding and rebuilding of our infrastructure. Those need to be funded. \nI do not argue they should not be. But here we are dealing with a \nsurplus, fighting with our Democrat colleagues over whether we should \ngive tax relief to the taxpayers this year. What better way to give \nsome of it back than to reduce the cost at the pumps? Most Americans \ntoday who drive cars find themselves paying increasingly higher fuel \nbills.\n  For the next few moments, I will talk about rural America. I come \nfrom a rural State. Many of us do. While runups in energy costs are \ndramatically impacting urban America, it is even greater in rural \nAmerica. Why? It is quite simple. Many of my friends in Idaho drive 50, \n60, 70 miles a day to just get their kids to school or just to shop at \nthe local grocery store. That is not unusual in rural America.\n  All of the goods and services that flow to our farms and from our \nfarms travel on the backs of 18-wheeler trucks, all consuming diesel \noil.\n  Diesel oil is now being acquired by farmers across the Nation as they \nenter our fields for the spring farming season. All of that is going to \ndrive up the overall cost of the farmers this year. In agriculture, \nfarmers have experienced a 4-year run of very low commodity prices and \nhave found most of their farms and ranches below break even. Now, \nbecause of an absence of a national energy policy, they find their cost \nof production could double, at least in the energy field. Many of the \ntools they use--the insecticides, the pesticides, and the herbicides \nthat are made up of oil bases--are going to go up dramatically in cost.\n  In my State of Idaho, farming and ranching, logging and mining are \nalso an important part of the rural economy. All of them very energy \nintensive. Those industries have found themselves nearly on their backs \nfrom the last few years at a time when we see energy costs ready to \ndouble or triple.\n\n  We have heard it from the homeowner and the apartment dweller in the \nNortheast for the last several months, that their fuel costs have \ndoubled, their heating bills have doubled. Some are having to choose \nfood over warmth or warmth over food. Many are senior citizens on fixed \nincomes.\n  While we have tried to offset that some with help from Washington, we \nhave not been able to do it all. And in the next month and a half, we \nare going to hear it from the farmers and the ranchers as their fuel \nbills skyrocket.\n  We have already heard from the truckers. They have been to town \nseveral times, and many of our independent truckers are literally \ndriving their trucks into their driveways, shutting them down, and not \nturning them back on, therefore, risking bankruptcy and the loss of \nthat income-making property because they cannot afford to pay the fuel \nbills.\n  Why? It is time we ask why, as a country, and it is time Congress \ndealt with at least some short-term provisions while we look at and \nstrive for some long-term energy policy.\n  I do not think one can expect the Clinton-Gore administration to be \nvery helpful, except begging at the doorsteps of the palaces of the \nsheiks of the OPEC nations, because that is their only energy policy.\n  Those are the kinds of things we are going to look at and abide by. I \nthink this Congress will attempt to respond and respond in a positive \nway for the short-term provisions while we look at long-term policy to \nincrease production of crude oil inside the 50 States of our Nation in \na way that we can control it, we can shape our energy future without a \ngroup of energy nations meeting in Vienna having a choke hold around \nour very neck.\n  Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt is talking about taking down \nvaluable hydroelectric dams in the Pacific Northwest--the \nadministration does not consider hydropower a renewable resource. \nElectricity from hydro meets about 10 to 12 percent of U.S. needs.\n  Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner is trying \nto shut down coal fired electric generating plants in the midwest--\nwhich depends on those plants for 88 percent of its electricity. The \nU.S. depends on coal for 55 percent of its electricity needs.\n  While the Clinton-Gore administration tried to kill off the use of \ncoal fired electricity it is doing nothing to increase the availability \nof domestic natural gas which is the fuel generators will use if they \ncannot use coal. To replace coal the U.S. must increase its use of \nnatural gas by about 10 trillion cubic feet per year.\n  Federal land in the Rocky Mountain West could contain as much as 137 \nbillion cubic feet of natural gas but the Clinton-Gore administration \nrefuses to allow any oil and gas exploration on those lands.\n  Last week the President announced his plans for dealing with our \ncurrent energy problem. Once again, his emphasis focused on \nconservation and renewable energy sources like solar, wind and biomass. \nWe cannot put windmills on trucks or solar panels on trains or barges.\n  The Clinton-Gore administration has refused to even consider allowing \nexploration in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge which could contain \nup to 16 billion barrels of domestic crude oil which could easily be \nmoved to refineries in the lower 48 through the Alaska pipeline.\n  The Vice President has vowed to prohibit any future exploration for \noil and natural gas on the Federal outer continental shelf when there \nare clearly\n\n[[Page S1706]]\n\nareas that have great potential for new domestic energy supplies. The \nPresident recently closed most of the Federal OCS to any exploration \nuntil 2012.\n  The Clinton-Gore administration embraces the Kyoto Protocol which \nwould impose staggering economic costs on the United States. The \nProtocol would require the U.S. to vastly reduce its use of fossil \nfuels like oil, natural gas and coal to achieve reductions in emissions \nof carbon dioxide--which is not a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and \nhas not yet been proven to be the cause of climate change. The U.S. \nSenate voted 95-0 to reject it.\n  Clearly, there is a pattern.\n  It started in 1993 when the Clinton-Gore administration proposed a \n$73 billion 5-year tax to force U.S. use of fossil fuels down.\n  It continues with misguided Federal land use policies, environmental \npolicies designed not necessarily to protect the environment but to \nkill fossil fuel use, and continues with administration support for the \neconomically punitive Kyoto Protocol. This administration hates the \nfossil fuel industry and apparently the economic well-being these \nabundant and relatively cheap fuels have helped the U.S. economy \nachieve. These are the words of the Vice President:\n\n       Higher taxes on fossil fuels . . . is one of the logical \n     first steps in changing our policies in a manner consistent \n     with a more responsible approach to the environment.\n\n  That is by Senator Al Gore, from ``Earth in the Balance,'' 1992, page \n173.\n  To me it is pretty clear that this administration is unwilling to \ncommit to a rational energy policy that will help America's families.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/27/senate-section/article/S1706-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1706-S1737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FLAG DESECRATION CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to consider S.J. Res. 14, which the clerk will report by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 14) proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States authorizing Congress to \n     prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United \n     States.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the joint resolution.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the Constitution begins with the ringing \nwords--``We the People''--for a reason. In our great nation, the people \nare empowered to decide the manner in which we are to be governed and \nthe values we are to uphold. I join 80 percent of the American people \nin the belief the flag of the United States of America should be \nprotected from physical desecration. And I am blessed to live in a \nnation where the will of the people can triumph over that of lawyers \nand judges.\n  In light of the U.S. Supreme Court decisions Texas v. Johnson (1989) \nand United States v. Eichman (1990), which essentially abrogated flag \ndesecration statutes passed by the federal government and 48 states, a \nconstitutional amendment is clearly necessary to protect our flag. This \nwould take the issue of flag protection out of the Courts and back to \nthe legislatures where it belongs. As Chief Justice Rehnquist stated in \nhis dissent, ``Surely one of the high purposes of a democratic society \nis to legislate against conduct that is regarded as evil and profoundly \noffensive to the majority of people--whether it be murder, \nembezzlement, pollution, or flagburning.''\n  Mr. President, the fight to protect ``Old Glory'' is a fight to \nrestore duty, honor, and love of country to their rightful place. As \nJustice Stevens noted, ``The flag uniquely symbolizes the ideas of \nliberty, equality, and tolerance.'' These are the values that form the \nbedrock of our nation. We are a nation comprised of individuals of \nvarying races, creeds, and colors, with differing ideologies. We need \nto reinforce the values we hold in common in order for our nation to \nremain united, to remain strong.\n  Sadly, patriotism is on the decline. That's dangerous in a democracy. \nJust ask the military recruiters who can't find enough willing young \npeople to fill the ranks of our military during this strong economy. \nWhat happened to the pride in serving your country? Where are the \nAmericans willing to answer the call?\n  Protecting the flag reflects our desire to protect our nation from \nthis erosion in patriotism. It signals that our government, as a \nreflection of the will of the people, believes all Americans should \ntreat the flag with respect. The men and women of our armed forces who \nsacrificed for the flag should be shown they did not do so in vain. \nThey fought, suffered, and died to preserve the very freedom and \nliberty which allow us to proclaim that desecrating the American flag \ngoes too far and should be prohibited.\n  To say that our flag is just a piece of cloth--a rag that can be \ndefiled and trampled upon and even burnt into ashes--is to dishonor \nevery soldier who ever fought to protect it. Every star, every stripe \non our flag was bought through their sacrifice.\n  The flag of the United States of America is a true, national \ntreasure. Because of all that it symbolizes, we have always held our \nflag with the greatest esteem, with reverence. That is why we fly it so \nhigh above us. When the flag is aloft, it stands above political \ndivision and above partisanship.\n  Under our flag, we are united.\n  Most Americans cannot understand why anyone would burn a flag. Most \nAmericans cannot understand why the Senate would not act decisively and \noverwhelmingly to pass an amendment affording our flag the protection \nit deserves.\n  This simple piece of cloth is indeed worthy of Constitutional \nprotection. I urge my colleagues to follow the will of ``We the \nPeople'' and accord the American flag the dignity it is due by \nsupporting Senate Joint Resolution 14.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nKentucky, Mr. McConnell, is recognized to offer an amendment in the \nnature of a substitute.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2889\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for the protection of the flag of the United \n            States and free speech, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk \npursuant to the order previously entered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for himself, Mr. \n     Bingaman, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n     Torricelli, Mr. Byrd, and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2889.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Flag Protection and Free \n     Speech Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the flag of the United States is a unique symbol of \n     national unity and represents the values of liberty, justice, \n     and equality that make this Nation an example of freedom \n     unmatched throughout the world;\n       (2) the Bill of Rights is a guarantee of those freedoms and \n     should not be amended in a manner that could be interpreted \n     to restrict freedom, a course that is regularly resorted to \n     by authoritarian governments which fear freedom and not by \n     free and democratic nations;\n       (3) abuse of the flag of the Untied States causes more than \n     pain and distress to the overwhelming majority of the \n     American people and may amount to fighting words or a direct \n     threat to the physical and emotional well-being of \n     individuals at whom the threat is targeted; and\n       (4) destruction of the flag of the United States can be \n     intended to incite a violent response rather than make a \n     political statement and such conduct is outside the \n     protections afforded by the first amendment to the \n     Constitution.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide the \n     maximum protection against the use of the flag of the United \n     States to promote violence while respecting the liberties \n     that it symbolizes.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES AGAINST \n                   USE FOR PROMOTING VIOLENCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 700 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     Sec. 700. Incitement; damage or destruction of property \n       involving the flag of the United States\n\n       ``(a) Definition of Flag of the United States.--In this \n     section, the term `flag of the United States' means any flag \n     of the United States, or any part thereof, made of any \n     substance, in any size, in a form that is\n\n[[Page S1707]]\n\n     commonly displayed as a flag and that would be taken to be a \n     flag by the reasonable observer.\n       ``(b) Actions Promoting Violence.--Any person who destroys \n     or damages a flag of the United States with the primary \n     purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or \n     a breach of the peace, and under circumstances in which the \n     person knows that it is reasonably likely to produce imminent \n     violence or a breach of the peace, shall be fined not more \n     than $100,000, imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.\n       ``(c) Damaging a Flag Belonging to the United States.--Any \n     person who steals or knowingly converts to his or her use, or \n     to the use of another, a flag of the United States belonging \n     to the United States, and who intentionally destroys or \n     damages that flag, shall be fined not more than $250,000, \n     imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both.\n       ``(d) Damaging a Flag of Another on Federal Land.--Any \n     person who, within any lands reserved for the use of the \n     United States, or under the exclusive or concurrent \n     jurisdiction of the United States, steals or knowingly \n     converts to his or her use, or the use of another, a flag of \n     the United States belonging to another person, and who \n     intentionally destroys or damages that flag, shall be fined \n     not more than $250,000, imprisoned not more than 2 years, or \n     both.\n       ``(e) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to indicate an intent on the part of Congress to \n     deprive any State, territory, or possession of the Untied \n     States, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico of jurisdiction \n     over any offense over which it would have jurisdiction in the \n     absence of this section.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The analysis for chapter 33 of \n     title 18, United States Code, is amended by striking the item \n     relating to section 700 and inserting the following:\n\n``700. Incitement; damage or destruction of property involving the flag \n              of the United States.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there shall be 2 \nhours for debate on the amendment equally divided, with an additional \n30 minutes under the control of the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. \nByrd.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the amendment that I sent to the desk \nis on behalf of myself, Senator Bennett, Senator Conrad, Senator \nDorgan, Senator Dodd, Senator Torricelli, Senator Bingaman, Senator \nByrd, and Senator Lieberman.\n  I am glad we are having this debate today. The American flag is our \nmost precious national symbol, and we should be concerned about the \ndesecration of that symbol.\n  This debate is also about the Constitution which is our most revered \nnational document. Both the flag and the Constitution represent the \nideas, values, and traditions that define our Nation. Brave Americans \nhave fought and given their lives defending the truths these both \nrepresent. We should be concerned with defending both of them.\n  Today I am proud to offer, along with the colleagues I previously \nlisted--Senator Bennett, Senator Conrad, Senator Dorgan, Senator Dodd, \nSenator Torricelli, Senator Bingaman, Senator Byrd, and Senator \nLieberman--the Flag Protection Act as an amendment in the form of a \nsubstitute to the bill before us.\n  This amendment would ensure that acts of deliberately confrontational \nflag-burning are punished with stiff fines and even jail time. My \namendment will help prevent desecration of the flag, and at the same \ntime, protect the Constitution.\n  As all of us do, I revere the flag. Among my most prized possessions \nis the American flag which honored, as he was laid to rest, my father's \nservice in World War II. That flag rests proudly on the marble mantle \nin my Senate office. Further, one of my first acts as chairman of the \nRules Committee last year was to offer, along with the senior Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, an amendment to the Standing Rules of \nthe Senate to provide that we begin each day's business in the Senate \nChamber with the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag.\n  I want to be perfectly clear, I have no sympathy for those who \ndesecrate the flag. These malcontents are simply grabbing attention for \nthemselves by inflaming the passions of patriotic Americans. There is \nno reason we should respect them or what they are saying.\n  Speech that incites lawlessness or is intended to do so merits no \nfirst amendment protection, as the Supreme Court has made abundantly \nclear. From Chaplinsky's ``fighting words'' doctrine in 1942 to \nBrandenburg's ``incitement'' test in 1969 to Wisconsin v. Mitchell's \n``physical assault'' standard in 1993, the Supreme Court has never \nprotected speech which causes or intends to cause physical harm to \nothers.\n  That is the basis for this legislation. My amendment outlaws three \ntypes of illegal flag desecration. First, anyone who destroys or \ndamages a U.S. flag with a clear intent to incite imminent violence or \na breach of the peace may be punished by a fine of up to $100,000, or \nup to 1 year in jail, or both.\n  Second, anyone who steals a flag that belongs to the United States \nand destroys or damages that flag may be fined up to $250,000 or \nimprisoned up to 2 years, or both.\n  And third, anyone who steals a flag from another and destroys or \ndamages that flag on U.S. property may also be fined up to $250,000 or \nimprisoned up to 2 years, or both.\n  Some of my colleagues will argue that we have been down the statutory \nroad before and the Supreme Court has rejected that road. However, \nthose arguments are not valid with respect to this amendment I am now \ndiscussing. The Senate's previous statutory effort to address this \nissue wasn't tied to the explicit teachings and principles of the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  Put simply, my statutory approach for addressing flag desecration is \ncompletely compatible with the first amendment and in no way conflicts \nwith the Supreme Court's relevant rulings in the two leading cases: \nTexas v. Johnson, (1989) and U.S. v. Eichman, (1990).\n  In the Eichman case, the court clearly left the door open for \noutlawing flag burning that incites lawlessness.\n  As is made clear by these distinctions in cases and the direction \npondered by the Supreme Court in Eichman, my amendment will pass \nconstitutional muster. But you don't have to take my word on it. The \nCongressional Research Service has offered legal opinions concluding \nthat this initiative will withstand constitutional scrutiny. CRS said:\n\n       The judicial precedents establish that the [Flag Protection \n     Act], if enacted, while not reversing Johnson and Eichman, \n     should survive constitutional attack on First Amendment \n     grounds.\n\n  In addition, Bruce Fein, a former official in the Reagan \nadministration and respected constitutional scholar, concurs. He said:\n\n       [The Flag Protection Act] falls well within the protective \n     constitutional umbrella of Brandenburg and Chaplinsky . . . \n     [and it] also avoids content-based discrimination which is \n     generally frowned on by the First Amendment.\n\n  Several other constitutional specialists also agree that this \ninitiative respects the first amendment and will withstand \nconstitutional challenge. A memo by Robert Peck, formerly of the ACLU, \nand Professors Robert O'Neil and Erwin Chemerinsky concludes that this \nlegislation ``conforms to constitutional requirements in both its \npurpose and its provisions.''\n  And, these same three respected men have looked at the few State \ncourt cases which have been decided since we had this debate a few \nyears ago and have reiterated their original finding of \nconstitutionality.\n  As I am sure you will hear later today, opponents of my amendment \nhave asked a number of constitutional scholars to find constitutional \nconcerns with my bill. One of the most revealing responses was from \nProfessor William Van Alstyne, a professor at Duke Law School and a \ndean of constitutional law. Professor Van Alstyne wrote that although \nhe is not in favor of any law or constitutional amendment punishing \nthose who abuse the flag, he did not find any constitutional infirmity \nwith my legislation.\n  In closing, I would like to share some thoughts recently conveyed by \nGeneral Colin Powell, a great American. In a recent letter he so \neloquently expressed his sentiments which explain my own. He wrote:\n\n       I understand how strongly so many . . . veterans and \n     citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful \n     sentiment in state legislatures for such an [constitutional] \n     amendment. I feel the same sense of outrage. But I step back \n     from amending the Constitution to relieve that outrage. The \n     First Amendment exists to insure that freedom of speech and \n     expression applies not just to that with which we agree or \n     disagree, but also that which we find outrageous.\n       I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer \n     a few miscreants.

Peck, Esq. et al.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Fairfax Station, VA,\n\n                                                     May 11, 1999.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: Recently, Senator Hatch sent an \n     inquiry to a number of constitutional scholars raising \n     questions about the constitutionality of your bill, S. 931, \n     the Flag Protection Act of 1999. One of those scholars, \n     Professor William Van Alstyne, one of the deans of First \n     Amendment law, wrote back that he found no constitutional \n     infirmity in the legislation. In reaching that sound \n     conclusion, Professor Van Alstyne allied himself with the \n     Congressional Research Service and with Professor Robert \n     O'Neil of the University of Virginia, who also serves as the \n     Founding Director of an important First Amendment study \n     center, the Thomas Jefferson Center for Free Expression, \n     Professor Erwin Chemerinsky of the University of Southern \n     California, former Associate Attorney General Bruce Fein and \n     myself, a constitutional lawyer and law professor.\n       One letter received by Senator Hatch did raise several \n     questions about the legislation. It was jointly signed by \n     Professors Richard Parker and Laurence Tribe of Harvard. As \n     you know, Professor Parker is an advisor to the Citizens Flag \n     Alliance (CFA) and a supporter of the flag desecration \n     constitutional amendment that is the CFA's entire reason for \n     existence. In his advisory role, he has repeatedly staked out \n     a position, inconsistent with the explicit teachings of the \n     U.S. Supreme Court, that nothing short of a constitutional \n     amendment is valid or appropriate. Professor Tribe, however, \n     is an opponent of the constitutional amendment. His position, \n     as articulated in this May 5 joint letter, is similarly at \n     odds with existing precedent, as well as with testimony that \n     Professor Tribe himself has previously given in Congress. See \n     Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act of 1992: Hearings on \n     H.R. 4797 Before the Subcomm. on Crime and Criminal Justice \n     of the House Comm. on the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. 7 \n     et seq. (1992) (statement and testimony of Professor Laurence \n     Tribe). As this letter details, the concerns raised by \n     Professors Parker and Tribe should not give any pause to you \n     or to the bill's other supporters; S. 931 remains compatible \n     with the First Amendment and does not conflict with the U.S. \n     Supreme Court's relevant rulings.\n       I will answer the issues raised by Professors Parker and \n     Tribe one at a time.\n       Lack of Congressional Authority--Relying on the Supreme \n     Court's decision in Lopez, which struck down the Gun-Free \n     School Zones Act of 1990, Professors Parker and Tribe assert \n     that Congress ``probably lacks affirmative authority'' to \n     pass laws prohibiting use of the flag to incite violence. Not \n     only is their statement couched in uncertainty \n     (``probably''), but seems to suggest that Congress could \n     neither pass a law prohibiting violent crimes, as it has done \n     in a number of instances already, nor any laws relating to \n     the flag. If the latter were true, then Congress could not \n     have passed the statute that designates the familiar \n     scheme of stars and stripes as the flag of the United \n     States. If the federal government has no legal interest in \n     the flag that symbolizes our Nation, then it is difficult \n     to imagine what legal interest it has at all.\n       In discussing this issue, it is important to note that the \n     professors' reliance on Lopez is misplaced. Lopez was a \n     Commerce Clause decision. In that case, the Supreme Court \n     held that the problem of guns in schools did not have a \n     sufficient nexus to interstate commerce to allow Congress to \n     invoke federal authority; the guns-and-schools issue, it said \n     remains a state matter, as it has traditionally. Unlike the \n     law struck down in Lopez, your bill does not rest on the \n     commerce power, but instead relies on the unique nature of \n     the flag and the inherent federal interest in it. Only the \n     federal government has the authority to define what \n     constitutes a flag of the United States. And it retains the \n     primary interest in defining what constitutes proper use of \n     the flag. No one could plausibly contend that the asserted \n     interests more properly and traditionally reside within state \n     authority.\n       Moreover, nothing in the Supreme Court's Flag Burning Cases \n     suggest that the federal government may not assert such an \n     interest in the flag. In fact, the Court implicitly \n     recognized what it thought unnecessary to articulate: that \n     government has a real interest in the uses to which the flag \n     might be put. It indicated, in words that have real meaning \n     for the proposed statute, that the First Amendment would not \n     be violated by a law that prosecuted a person who drags ``a \n     flag through the mud, knowing that this conduct is likely to \n     offend others, and yet have no thought of expressing any \n     idea.'' Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 403 n.3 (1989). Note \n     that this articulation of a constitutional approach to \n     regulating flag-related conduct is extremely similar to S. \n     931's treatment of flag-related conduct that is intended and \n     likely to result in imminent violence.\n       The Johnson Court went on to say that it would not have \n     struck down the Texas flag desecration law if the government \n     had been able to assert truthfully that it was motivated in \n     its prosecution by a realistic concern for preventing \n     violence. Id. at 399. This statement, by itself, should be \n     viewed as definitive authority in favor of the \n     constitutionality of S. 931. As Ohio's Supreme Court held, \n     relying on Johnson, punishing use of the flag to incite \n     violence poses no constitutional problem. Ohio v. Lessin, 620 \n     N.E.2d 72 (Ohio 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 11194 (1994). \n     The U.S. Supreme Court was given an opportunity to correct \n     the Ohio decision, if correction was needed, but chose not to \n     take the case. Maryland has also enacted a flag statute aimed \n     at dealing with violence without any adverse court ruling as \n     to its constitutionality. Md. Ann. Code art. 27, Sec. 83 \n     (1990). If states can enact such a law, there is certainly no \n     bar on congressional enactment, where the federal authorizing \n     interest is significantly greater and such a statute would be \n     a valid exercise of the police power.\n       Section 3(b).--Professors Parker and Tribe also claim that \n     the bill's punishment for use of the flag to incite violence \n     draws an impermissible content-based line because it \n     effectively suppresses, through threat of punishment, those \n     forms of expressive use of the flag that are intended and \n     likely to incite violence. This is a remarkable assertion \n     because, if correct it would render all incitement and \n     conspiracy statutes that rely on criminal communications \n     invalid. Yet, as demonstrated by the Johnson Court's \n     language quoted above, the Supreme Court anticipated a \n     statute along the lines of S. 931 and found it valid.\n       Contrary to the implication made by the professors that \n     line-drawing by Congress is unconstitutional, all laws draw \n     lines. In the First Amendment area, the Supreme Court has \n     both recognized this reality and mandated that such lines be \n     drawn with utmost precision so that it is limited to those \n     evils that legislation may properly address. See, e.g., NAACP \n     v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433 (1963). In fact, the courts have \n     long experience upholding laws that punish certain types of \n     conduct that contains aspects of expression. In Cox v. \n     Louisiana, 379 U.S. 559 (1965), for example, the Supreme \n     Court upheld a statute that criminalized picketing or \n     parading near a state courthouse ``with the intent of \n     interfering with, obstructing, or impeding the administration \n     of justice.'' Picketing and parading are indisputably forms \n     of expressive conduct that are accorded full First Amendment \n     protection, yet could be made criminal when the governmental \n     interest is overriding, as it is when that interest is the \n     prevention of violence as it is in S. 931. Even earlier, the \n     Court had upheld a prohibition on picketing intended to \n     further unlawful objectives. International Brotherhood of \n     Electrical Workers v. NLRB, 341 U.S. 674 (1951). S. 931 is \n     indistinguishable from the laws upheld by these quite solid \n     precedents.\n       Similarly, anti-discrimination laws are not invalid just \n     because the discriminating party wishes to express racial or \n     sexual opinions. See Hishon v. King & Spaulding, 467 U.S. 69, \n     78 (1984), See also United States v. J.H.H., 22 F.3d 821, 826 \n     (8th Cir. 1994) (upholding civil rights laws prohibiting \n     conduct intended to deprive victims of their legal rights).\n       By relying on R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 (1992), for \n     a broad proposition that government has no power to \n     criminalize conduct that contains elements of expression, the \n     two professors make the same error that was made by the \n     Wisconsin Supreme Court and corrected by the U.S. Supreme \n     Court. In striking down a hate-crime sentencing enhancement \n     law on First Amendment grounds, the Wisconsin court asserted \n     that the U.S. Supreme Court's R.A.V. decision preordained the \n     result. The U.S. Supreme Court then unanimously reversed the \n     Wisconsin court. It recognized, as Professors Parker and \n     Tribe assert about S. 931, that the ``Wisconsin statute \n     singles out for enhancement bias-inspired conduct,'' but \n     found that this singling out posed no First Amendment issue \n     because such ``conduct is thought to inflict greater \n     individual and societal harm, Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U.S. \n     476 487-88 (1993). Among those legitimate concerns for harm \n     that validated the law which the Supreme Court enumerated \n     were: a concern for inspiring retaliatory crimes, the \n     distinct emotional harms visited upon victims, and the \n     likelihood that community unrest would be engendered. Id. at \n     488. The Court further\n\n[[Page S1709]]\n\n     found that the ``desire to redress these perceived harms \n     provides an adequate explanation for its penalty-enhancement \n     provision over and above mere disagreement with offenders' \n     beliefs or biases.'' Id.\n       S. 931 similarly focuses on conduct (incitement to violence \n     through the instrumentality of a flag) with substantial \n     potential harms that include the ones listed by the Mitchell \n     Court. In his congressional testimony on hate crimes \n     sentencing enhancement, Professor Tribe saw no constitutional \n     dilemma with a law that punished those who target their \n     victims by race or gender with longer sentences even if the \n     criminal act might be interpreted as an expression of racial \n     hatred. Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act of 1992. \n     Hearings on H.R. 4797 Before the Subcomm. on Crime and \n     Criminal Justice of the House Comm. on the Judiciary, 102d \n     Cong., 2d Sess. 7-30 (1992) (statement and testimony of \n     Professor Laurence Tribe). In taking his position in defense \n     of the use of bias motivation as a sentencing factor and \n     calling it properly narrow even though it singled out a \n     particular form of opinion, he anticipated the Mitchell \n     Court's finding of greater societal harm. Somehow, this time \n     around with respect to S. 931, Professor Tribe seems blinded \n     to the greater societal harm that is inherent in the use of a \n     symbol of freedom and national unity to provoke violence and \n     unrest. I cannot imagine the Court turning a blind eye to the \n     distinctive harms involved in using the national flag to \n     incite violence. As the Mitchell Court recognized, there is a \n     considerable difference between laws that control conduct and \n     those directed at controlling speech. Mitchell, 508 U.S. at \n     486-90.\n       Section 3(c).--The two professors part company, however, on \n     whether the government may especially punish the destruction \n     of certain kinds of government property, in this instance, \n     government-owned flags. Professor Tribe, consistent with his \n     hate-crime testimony and the Court's holding in Mitchell, \n     recognizes that a special form of emotional harm might be at \n     issue and that this translation of the government's interest \n     into law could be constitutional.\\1\\ Professor Parker takes \n     the opposite view because he finds the same flaw throughout \n     the bill: the singling out of the flag as something of \n     especial interest to the federal government. For the same \n     reasons stated in defense of Section 3(b), this argument \n     fails.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ He hesitates in his opinion, in part because he \n     mistakenly distinguishes the federal government (which has no \n     emotions) from the people that constitute that government \n     (who do have emotions). The assertion of an interest on \n     behalf of the people, as the Mitchell Court made evident, is \n     a valid one by the government.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Section 3(d).--Perhaps most remarkable of all is the two \n     professors' assertion that S. 931 cannot constitutionally \n     punish theft and destruction of another's U.S. flag on \n     federal property. Certainly, the theft and destruction of \n     property on federal land is well within the police power of \n     the federal government to punish. In their constitutional \n     analysis of this section, the professors wonder what especial \n     federal interest there is in protecting U.S. flags from theft \n     and destruction on federal land over, to use one of their \n     examples, ``great-grandmothers' wedding dresses.'' To pose \n     the question, though, is to answer it. There is, as the \n     Johnson and Eichman Courts conceded, a definite and unique \n     interest on the part of government in the flag of the United \n     States. For people to be invited onto government property, \n     perhaps, for example, to celebrate Armed Forces Day when they \n     are likely to engage in flag-waving, and be subjected to \n     theft and destruction of property produces a special and \n     distinctive harm that it is well within the government's \n     authority to punish. It is difficult to imagine the argument \n     that might be made to justify a similar federal interest in a \n     treasured family heirloom, such as a wedding dress, that \n     somehow made it onto federal property, was stolen and then \n     destroyed there.\n       Contrary to the letter drafted by the two distinguished \n     professors, the constitutionality of S. 931 should not give \n     any Member of Congress pause. The Supreme Court has virtually \n     invited Congress to pass such an Act and indicated its \n     validity. Because wise constitutional counsel and the lessons \n     of history indicate that amending our Constitution should not \n     be undertaken when a statutory resolution is available, it is \n     imperative that Congress give serious consideration to S. 931 \n     rather than embark on a constitutional journey that holds \n     implications for our freedoms that even the most foresighted \n     cannot anticipate.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert S. Peck, Esq.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Duke University,\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                       Durham, NC, March 31, 1999.\n     Senator Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n                      Dirksen Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I have reviewed S. 1335 styled ``The \n     Flag Protection and Free Speech Act of 1995.'' I have also \n     reviewed the November 8, 1995 Memorandum of the Congressional \n     Research Service, and the recent letters you received from \n     Professors Stephen Presser and Paul Cassell offering comments \n     and observations on the proposed act. My observations, such \n     as they are, are these--\n       I. If the principal provisions of this proposed bill are \n     narrowly construed--as I believe they might well be \\1\\--then \n     I am inclined to agree more nearly with the analysis provided \n     by the Memorandum of the Congressional Research Service than \n     with that provided by my able colleagues at Northwestern \n     (Steve Presser) and Utah (Paul Cassell). In brief, as \n     narrowly construed and rigorously applied, the principal \n     section of the act (Sec. 3(a)) may not be inconsistent with \n     the First Amendment and may withstand judicial scrutiny when \n     reviewed in the courts. I say this because as thus narrowly \n     construed and applied, Sec. 3(a) may apply only in \n     circumstances in which it would meet the requirements the \n     Supreme Court itself has laid down in the principal case \n     applicable to more general laws of this same sort.\\2\\ Herein \n     is how that analysis is likely to proceed:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnontes at end of letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       A. Specifically, Sec. 3(a) proposes to amend Sec. 700 of \n     title 18 (the Criminal Code of the United States). It does \n     so, however, by subjecting to criminal prosecution only such \n     person who--destroys or damages a flag of the United States \n     with the primary purpose and intent to incite or produce \n     imminent violence or a breach of the peace, and in \n     circumstances where the person knows it is reasonably likely \n     to produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace.\n       Fairly (albeit strictly) read, the statute thus may require \n     both of the following matters to be proved in any case \n     brought pursuant to this section--and both of these matters \n     must, as in any other criminal case, be proved beyond \n     reasonable doubt:\n       1. That ``the primary purpose'' (i.e., the principal \n     objective \\3\\) sought by the defendant was to incite \n     ``violence or a breach of the peace'' and, indeed, that it \n     was his specific intent to do just that;\n       2. That when he acted primarily to bring about that result \n     (and only secondarily, if at all, to achieve some other aim), \n     moreover, the circumstances were such that it was at least \n     ``reasonably likely'' in fact his actions would have \n     precisely that consequence (as he fully intended) even as he \n     himself fully understood.\n       3. Likewise, however, according to the plain implication of \n     its own terms as thus understood, nothing in this section \\4\\ \n     is meant otherwise to subject one to prosecution merely for \n     destroying or damaging a flag of the United States--no matter \n     how offensive or objectionable others may find any such act \n     to be. And, specifically, to make this latter matter quite \n     clear in a relevant fashion, Sec. 2(a)(4) (which immediately \n     precedes Sec. 3(a))--expressly distinguishes any and all \n     cases where one destroys or damages a flag when one does so \n     to ``make a political statement,'' rather then merely ``to \n     incite a violent response.'' \\5\\\n       4. Subsection (a)(3) of Sec. 2, separately declares that \n     ``abuse of the flag . . . may amount to fighting words,'' \n     which doubtless is true (i.e., it may, just as the provision \n     thus also equally acknowledges, however, that it may not.) To \n     avoid constitutional difficulties--difficulties that would \n     arise from any broader understanding of this provision--it \n     would be appropriate to interpret this provision merely to \n     declare that abuse of the flag may be a means chosen \n     deliberately to provoke a violent reaction and if undertaken \n     just for that purpose then--as in the instance of ``fighting \n     words'' (e.g., when ``fighting words'' are themselves used \n     not as a form of political statement but, rather, in order to \n     provoke a violent reaction)--it is the author's understanding \n     that such conduct when intended to incite a violent response \n     rather than to make a political statement is outside the \n     protections afforded by the first amendment. Again, taken \n     this was, the observation may be substantially correct--but \n     in being correct, it also covers very little ground.\\6\\\n       B. Necessarily, all of this should mean \\7\\ that even if \n     the circumstances were such that violence (or a breach of \n     peace) could reasonably be expected to result as a \n     consequence of the defendant's actions, so long as it was not \n     his primary purpose or intent to induce or incite it--when he \n     burned or destroyed a flag \\8\\--he is not to be subject to \n     any penalty under this law. Specifically, if this is correct, \n     all merely ``reactive'' violence--violence not sought as the \n     immediate object by the defendant (who burns a flag as a \n     political statement or as a public, politically demonstrative \n     act of protest) but violence by those who, say, are but \n     observors or passersby made angry or indignant by what they \n     regard as outrageous behavior by him, for example, is thus \n     not to be utilized as sufficient reason to seek his \n     imprisonment rather than theirs.--Or so, at least, I believe \n     the statute can be interpreted to provide. And if (and \n     probably only if) it is so interpreted as I believe it thus \n     can be understood, I think it will survive in the courts.\\9\\\n       II. The vast majority of all instances when the American \n     flag has been used in some fashion others find offensive (and \n     some may be inclined to react to it in ways involving \n     violence or a breach of the peace) have been so \n     overwhelmingly merely an inseparable part of some kind of \n     obvious political statement, however, that a criminal statute \n     reaching such a use of the flag (including defacing or \n     burning a flag) only when ``primarily . . . intended to \n     incite a violent response rather than [to] make a political \n     statement,'' will cover very little. For example, so far as I \n     can determine, it will cover no instance of public flag \n     ``desecration'' of any of the many (allegedly) offensive \n     kinds of ``flag abuse'' that have been a fairly commonplace \n     feature of our political landscape during the past fifty \n     years in point of fact. And unless these past practices \n     suddenly take a different turn, therefore, whatever\n\n[[Page S1710]]\n\n     the pretensions of the sponsors of the bill might be, there \n     will be little or no real work for this proposed act to \n     do.\\10\\\n       But permit me to get quite specific about this last \n     observation, since it may seem counterintuitive. Still, there \n     is frankly no question that this observation is fully \n     applicable, by way of example, both to the events involved in \n     Texas v. Johnson \\11\\ and to those also involved in United \n     States v Eichman,\\12\\ which events and cases previous bills \n     (and now this bill) were evidently meant to respond to in \n     some fashion, but that this bill could by its own terms not \n     affect at all.\\13\\ And I press this observation, because \n     precisely to the extent the bill has been drafted--and can be \n     construed--to avoid the constitutional infirmities of prior, \n     failed, ``flag protection'' acts--by being very narrowly \n     drawn as the sponsors have striven to do, it merely indicates \n     limitations in no way reflecting on its drafters, but merely \n     what the First Amendment itself protects--and will continue \n     to protect unless itself altered, amended, or abridged.\n       A. So, for example, in Texas v. Johnson, Justice Brennan \n     begins the Opinion for the Court by expressly noting that \n     Johnson was convicted for publicly burning an American \n     flag,\\14\\ but strictly as an expressive part and feature of a \n     public and political demonstration, neither more nor less, as \n     Justice Brennan expressly observed in the opening sentence of \n     the Court's Opinion in the case.\\15\\ Indeed, it was this \n     fact--that the particular acts of the defendant were so \n     entwined--that brought the first amendment to bear, and it \n     was also this fact that served as the basis of the Court's \n     decision reversing his conviction--nor would the proposed \n     bill apparently affect the case in any way at all.\\16\\ As \n     Justice Brennan also noted in the case,\\17\\ while \n     ``several witnesses testified they were seriously offended \n     by the flag-burning,'' it was also clear that ``[n]o one \n     was physically injured or threatened with injury'' by \n     anything Johnson said or did, including (among the things \n     he did) burning a flag.\n       B. Next, when this Congress nevertheless reacted to the \n     furor created by the Supreme Court's decision in Texas v. \n     Johnson, by enacting the Flag Protection Act of 1989 (as I \n     and others urged it at the time not to do and testified would \n     not withstand constitutional scrutiny consistent with the \n     Court's decision in Johnson), that act in turn was at once \n     tested by individuals who protested the act's enactment by \n     very publicly burning flags in demonstrative opposition to \n     the act itself.\\18\\ In reviewing the several convictions \n     obtained in the lower courts (under the new act of Congress) \n     in both these cases, the Supreme Court at once did all of the \n     following: (a) It expressly affirmed its decision in Johnson; \n     (b) applied it to these cases (which had been brought to it \n     for prompt review of those convicted under the new act of \n     Congress); (c) reversed both convictions; and (d) held the \n     act unconstitutional as applied.\\19\\\n       Nor--and here's the immediate point to which these \n     observations are meant to be pertinent--do I read or \n     understand the provisions of the proposed bill, S. 1335, as \n     presuming to try to dictate a different result in any case \n     involving similar facts and acts as were all present in these \n     cases--for, indeed, if it did, presumably the outcome would \n     once again be the same--the act as thus applied (were it \n     thought to apply) would be unconstitutional as applied unless \n     the Court itself is prepared simply to overrule itself as \n     there is no reason to think it would or should.\n       C. And again, in still a different case, in Spence v. \n     Washington,\\20\\ the alleged criminalized misuse of a flag \n     consisted of defendant's effrontery in having presumed to \n     tape a peace symbol onto the face of a flag--thus \n     ``defacing'' it--which flag he then displayed (as a political \n     demonstration of his views) outward from the window of his \n     apartment for public view. Here, again, the Supreme Court \n     reversed the conviction (a conviction obtained under a state \n     law forbidding such defacing and public display of a flag). \n     It reversed that conviction ``on the ground that as applied \n     to appellant's activity the Washington statute impermissibly \n     infringed protected expression.'' \\21\\\n       In brief, here, too, the facts involved a politically \n     expressive use of a physical flag, not burned, but \n     nevertheless altered in a manner the state statute forbade, \n     and then publicly displayed, as Spence saw fit to do. \n     Moreover, that Spence's use of his flag in this way may have \n     offended others (as indeed it did), or may have motivated \n     some even to want to act against him in some way, was neither \n     here nor there. As the Court itself observed in Spence: \\22\\ \n     ``We are unable to affirm the judgment below on the ground \n     that the State may have desired to protect the sensibilities \n     of passersby. `It is firmly settled that under our \n     Constitution the public expression of ideas may not be \n     prohibited merely because the ideas are themselves offensive \n     to some of their hearers.' '' \\23\\\n       D. The just-quoted portion of Spence, moreover, was itself \n     taken from a still earlier ``flag-abuse'' case, itself once \n     again, however, also involving a political demonstrative \n     destruction (burning) of a flag on the public street, with \n     the defendant's conviction once again reversed on First \n     Amendment grounds. In Street v. New York,\\24\\ as in each of \n     these other real cases, it was plain on the facts that the \n     incident was one involving the public expression of political \n     feelings (nor was there any evidence that Street presumed to \n     burn a flag when and as he did to incite lawless action \n     either against himself or anyone else). Indeed, however, I \n     have found no case at all where it was plain that the \n     ``destruction of the flag of the United States'' was in fact \n     ``intended to incite a violent response rather than make a \n     political statement,'' \\25\\ so to lift it out from First \n     Amendment protection, much less any that appear to meet the \n     full requirements of the act.\n       IV. Briefly Then To Sum Up: Unless the critical provision \n     of the act is applied more broadly than a tightly constrained \n     construction would approve \\26\\--\n       (a) If thus construed (as it can be construed) to apply \n     only in circumstances consistent with the requirements of \n     Brandenburg v. Ohio, within that restricted field of \n     application, it may well be sustained in the Supreme Court;\n       (b) However, as thus very tightly constrained, it will not \n     reach many--possibly not any--of the various kinds of ``flag \n     burning'' cases, or other ``flag desecration'' or ``flag \n     abuse'' cases involving varieties of political expression and \n     political demonstrations previously held by the Supreme Court \n     to be protected by the First Amendment.\n       (c) Moreover, the cases it--the act--may clearly reach \n     without substantial risk of being held unconstitutional as \n     applied, are cases involving acts already so subject to such \n     criminal penalties (e.g., for incitement to violence or riot) \n     as state and federal criminal law already cover, as to raise \n     as a fair question respecting the need for or propriety of \n     this legislation at all. And in brief, if this is so, one \n     must finally ask, just what is there, if anything, of a \n     constitutionally proper concern, that is honestly sought to \n     be served by the act?\n       V. I am frankly unable to answer this last question I have \n     just posed, and may be forgiven a reluctance to speculate. \n     Yet, whatever it is, it will be most unseemly, I cannot help \n     but believe, that Congress may exhibit no equal interest in \n     bringing to bear the full impact of harsh national criminal \n     sanctions against anyone mistreating the flags of other \n     nations in demonstrations of protest as may occur in this \n     country, as Congress appears so willing to provide for our \n     own. But evidently this is what some in Congress appear eager \n     and willing to do. Again, however, I cannot imagine why.\n       Yet, if so, is this, then, finally to be the example of \n     ``liberty'' and of ``freedom'' we now mean to broadcast to \n     the world?--That Americans are free to burn the English Union \n     Jack, or despoil the French Tricolor, or trample the flag of \n     Canada, South Africa, Iraq, Pakistan, India, or Mexico, as \n     they like, in messages and demonstrations of discontent or \n     protest as they may freely occur in this country, but \n     assuredly not (or not so far as this Congress will be given \n     license by the Supreme Court to prevent it) as to make any \n     equivalent use of our own? And indeed that this is how we now \n     want to present ourselves to the world?\n       But I would hope, Senator Hatch, that you and your \n     colleagues would think otherwise, and that you will conclude \n     that to ``wrap the flag'' in the plaster casts of criminal \n     statutes in this way--as this and virtually every similar \n     bill \\27\\ seeks to do--would be a signal mistake. Its \n     occasional burning, utterly unattended by arrest, by \n     prosecution, by sanctions of jail and imprisonment, is surely \n     a far better tribute to freedom than that it is never \n     burned--but where the explanation is not that no one is ever \n     so moved to do (we know some are) but are stayed from doing \n     so by fear of being imprisoned, as some would seek to have \n     done. That kind of inhibiting fear is merely the example even \n     now, half-way around the world. It is furnished in a place \n     called Tianamen Square. It is a quiet, well-ordered \n     place.\\28\\ But Tianamen Square is not what ought to appeal to \n     us--it is but a quietude of repression, it has a desuetude of \n     fear, it is a place occupied by the harsh regime of criminal \n     law. It furnishes no example whatever of a sort we should \n     desire to emulate or pursue.\\29\\\n       So, I hope in the end that you and your colleagues may come \n     to believe the flag of the United States is not honored by \n     putting those who ``abuse'' it, whether in some egregious or \n     in some petty incendiary fashion, in prison or in jail. \n     Rather, let us regard them even as Jefferson spoke more \n     generally to such matters in his first Inaugural Address,\\30\\ \n     leaving them ``undisturbed as monuments of the safety with \n     which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left \n     free to combat it,'' as surely is true.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              William Van Alstyne.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ It is the firm practice of the Supreme Court to construe \n     acts of Congress very stringently (i.e., narrowly) when any \n     broader construction would at once draw it into serious first \n     amendment question. (For useful and pertinent examples, see \n     National Endowment for the Arts v. Karen Finley et al., 118 \n     S.Ct. 2168 (1998); Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705 \n     (1969); Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 198 (1957).)\n     \\2\\ That controlling case is almost certain to be Brandenburg \n     v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969) (discussed infra, in footnote \n     9).\n     \\3\\ not a secondary or even related, co-equal, objective. . . \n     .\n     \\4\\ To be sure, other sections do reach some other acts \n     (e.g., ``damaging a flag belonging to the United States'' \n     (Sec. 700(b)) or stealing or knowingly converting and \n     destroying a third person's flag (Sec. 700(c)), but these \n     provisions are doubtless secondary in significance and so I \n     defer consideration for such slight discussion of these \n     provisions as they are worth. (Briefly, however, there is no \n     likely problem with the provision re ``a flag belonging to \n     the United States.'' (See e.g., Spence v. Washington, 418 \n     U.S. 405, 409 (1974) (dictum) (``We have no doubt that the \n     State or National Governments constitutionally may forbid \n     anyone from mishandling in any manner a flag that is public \n     property.'') As to a flag merely\n\n[[Page S1711]]\n\n     owned by a third party, that one ``steal[s], knowingly \n     convert[s], and destroy[s],'' there may be--as the other \n     commentators have noted--a federalism problem (the act in \n     this regard would not appear to meet any of the requirements \n     under United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1996), nor does \n     the act appear to be connected to any other enumerated power \n     provided in Article I Sec. 8 of the Constitution (e.g., the \n     spending power, tax power, etc.). It remains arguable, \n     however, that the same (merely implied) power providing \n     Congress with legislative authority to establish incidental \n     insignia of nationhood (e.g., a flag, motto, seal, etc.) \n     could conceivably permit it to draw on the ``necessary and \n     proper clause'' to protect personal flag ownership from \n     interference (including interference by theft or conversion), \n     so the ultimate answer to this question is a bit unclear. I \n     agree with the other commentators, however, that without \n     doubt state criminal (and tort) laws already reach all \n     instances that would come within this provision--so it is at \n     best redundant and may inadvertently?) represent still one \n     more instance of gratuitously piling federal criminal \n     sanctions on top of pre-existing state sanctions (a practice \n     the American Bar Association, as well as the Chief Justice of \n     the United States, has recently asked Congress to use more \n     sparingly if at all). In brief, neither need for, nor any \n     special utility of, these provisions has been shown.)\n     \\5\\ Subsection (a)(4) of Sec. 2, (``Findings and Purposes'') \n     declares (with emphasis and bracketed material added) that \n     ``destruction of the flag . . . can [but need not] be \n     intended to incite a violate response rather than make a \n     political statement and such conduct [presumably meaning by \n     `such conduct' only such conduct as is indeed intended to \n     incite a violent response and not intended to make a \n     political statement] is outside the protections afforded by \n     the first amendment. . . .'' As thus understood (i.e., \n     understood as aided by the words I have placed in brackets), \n     the subsection is not necessarily inaccurate as a strict \n     first amendment matter.\n     \\6\\ (See discussion infra in text at II.).\n     \\7\\ And to avoid first amendment objections, must probably be \n     construed to mean. . . .\n     \\8\\ Whether as ``a political statement'' or for any other \n     purpose. . . .\n     \\9\\ As thus construed and applied, it may meet the test \n     provided in Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 447 (1969) \n     (``[Our decisions] have fashioned the principle that the \n     guarantee of free speech . . . do not permit a State to \n     forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law \n     violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting \n     or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite \n     or produce such action.''). If such ``advocacy'' (i.e., such \n     ``speech act'' as one engages in) is directed to ``inciting \n     or producing'' imminent lawless action (and is ``likely to \n     incite or produce such action''), on the other hand, the \n     Court plainly implies that ``the guarantees of free speech'' \n     do not immunize one from arrest or from prosecution under a \n     suitably framed, properly applied law.\n     \\10\\ Moreover, to the extent there is any such useful work, \n     such as it might be thought to be, it would be largely merely \n     redundant of what is already subject to a multitude of state \n     and local criminal laws--laws that already reach incitement \n     to riot, violence, or breach of the peace, whether or not it \n     involves torching a flag. Nor is there any reason at all to \n     believe that any of the states--all of which already have \n     such laws--are either unable or unwilling to bring the full \n     force of any such merely standard criminal statutes to bear \n     when any actual case would arise of a kind any of these \n     criminal statutes can validly reach. In brief, this is simply \n     not a subject where state or local law enforcement \n     authorities lack encouragement or means to apply the regular \n     force of applicable state criminal law, nor do I think the \n     sponsors of the bill could readily provide examples of such \n     local or state prosecutorial laxity. Far from this being the \n     case, quite the opposite tends to be the rule--prosecutorial \n     zeal in this area is surely the more usual response. The \n     ``need'' for some overlapping, largely duplicative, criminal \n     statute by Congress in this area, in short, is thus fare from \n     clear.\n     \\11\\ 491 U.S. 397 (1989).\n     \\12\\ 486 U.S. 310 (1990).\n     \\13\\ Indeed, however, the observation is fully applicable as \n     well to virtually every other case the Supreme Court and \n     indeed the lower courts have had occasion to consider during \n     the past fifty years, involving politically controversial \n     uses of the flag. Some of these are discussed infra in the \n     text.\n     \\14\\ (--For which he was promptly prosecuted under the \n     relevant Texas statute punishing acts of physical desecration \n     of venerated objects including the American flag as one such \n     object, ultimately and successfully appealing that conviction \n     to the Supreme Court.).\n     \\15\\ 491 U.S. 397, 399 (1989).\n     \\16\\ Johnson was not arrested or prosecuted for ``inciting, \n     or attempting to incite, a riot or violence,'' nor is there \n     any reason to think he would not have been charged with that \n     offense had the arresting officers believed there were \n     suitable grounds (rather there was simply no evidence that \n     this was his intent--to incite or to provoke a riot--in \n     burning the flag in a public plaza--as an incident of \n     expressing bitter feelings for ongoing proceedings in the \n     Republican Convention then in progress, in Dallas).\n     \\17\\ 491 U.S. at 399.\n     \\18\\ In one instance the defiance of Congress' handiwork was \n     demonstrated very publicly indeed, specifically, as noted in \n     the Court's subsequent Opinion, by several persons who \n     ``knowingly set[] fire to several United States flags on the \n     steps of the United States Capital while protesting various \n     aspects of the Government's domestic and foreign policy'' and \n     virtually simultaneously by others, ``by knowingly setting \n     fire to a United States flag in Seattle while protesting the \n     Act's passage.'' (See United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 \n     at 312 (1990).\n     \\19\\ United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990).\n     \\20\\ 418 U.S. 405 (1974).\n     \\21\\ Id at 406.\n     \\22\\ Id at 412.\n     \\23\\ And in Spence, note, too, that the Court had also \n     declared: ``Nor may appellant be punished for failing to show \n     proper respect for our national emblem [citing still previous \n     decisions of the Court].'' There was no novelty in any of \n     this. The Court has for decades made it perfectly plain that \n     the first amendment protected uses of flags (e.g., incidental \n     to political demonstrations) were not to be made subject to \n     any offended person's veto; nor may the state use the \n     disturbance of the peace, much less the threat of riot, by \n     persons affronted or made angry over one's provocative use of \n     first amendment rights (including flag uses) as a \n     justification to arrest the person exercising those rights. \n     See e.g., R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 112 S. Ct. 2538 (1992); \n     American Booksellers v. Hudnut, 771 F.2d 323 (7th Cir. 1985), \n     summarily aff'd, 475 U.S. 1001 (1986); Houston v.

Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your recent letter asking \n     my views on the proposed flag protection amendment.\n       I love our flag, our Constitution and our country with a \n     love that has no bounds. I defended all three for 35 years as \n     a soldier and was willing to give my life in their defense.\n       Americans revere their flag as a symbol of the Nation. \n     Indeed, it is because of that reverence that the amendment is \n     under consideration. Few countries in the world would think \n     of amending their Constitution for the purpose of protecting \n     such a symbol.\n       We are rightfully outraged when anyone attacks or \n     desecrates our flag. Few Americans do such things and when \n     they do they are subject to the rightful condemnation of \n     their fellow citizens. They may be destroying a piece of \n     cloth, but they do no damage to our system of freedom which \n     tolerates such desecration.\n       If they are destroying a flag that belongs to someone else, \n     that's a prosecutable crime. If it is a flag they own, I \n     really don't want to amend the Constitution to prosecute \n     someone for foolishly desecrating their own property. We \n     should condemn them and pity them instead.\n       I understand how strongly so many of my fellow veterans and \n     citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful \n     sentiment in state legislatures for such an amendment. I feel \n     the same sense of outrage. But I step back from amending the \n     Constitution to relieve that outrage. The First Amendment \n     exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression \n     applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but \n     also that which we find outrageous.\n       I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer \n     a few miscreants. The flag will still be flying proudly long \n     after they have slunk away.\n       Finally, I shudder to think of the legal morass we will \n     create trying to implement the body of law that will emerge \n     from such an amendment.\n       If I were a member of Congress, I would not vote for the \n     proposed amendment and would fully understand and respect the \n     views of those who would. For or against, we all love our \n     flag with equal devotion.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Colin L. Powell.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may need to \nSenator Bennett.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am not happy rising in this situation \nbecause it puts me in a difficult personal conundrum. I have enormous \nrespect for my senior colleague, Senator Hatch, who is a primary \nsponsor of this resolution. He has been gracious to me as a junior \nSenator entering this Chamber. He has supported me and guided me and \ncounseled me in ways that are invaluable.\n  I do my very best, on every possible occasion, to stand with Senator \nHatch and to support him and recognize his great wisdom, particularly \nin matters relating to the law. I am unburdened with a legal education, \nand he is one of\n\n[[Page S1712]]\n\nthe better lawyers in this body, so I do what I can to listen to him \nand follow him. Unfortunately, on this issue, I am unable to follow \nhim. That is why there is some personal angst in the fact that I take \nthe floor to make this statement.\n  I am not a lawyer, but I do have an academic background as a \npolitical scientist. That was my degree in college. In that situation, \nI spent a good deal of time studying the Constitution, studying the \ncircumstances surrounding its adoption, and studying particularly the \nFederalist Papers, which were the political tracts written at the time \nto try to achieve ratification of the Constitution.\n  From that study, I have come to the conclusion that this amendment to \nthe Constitution would be a mistake. Because I have taken an oath in \nthis Chamber to uphold and defend the Constitution to the best of my \nability, and have come to the conclusion that I cannot be true to that \noath, as I understand it--I cast no aspersions on those who interpret \nthe oath differently--I will not vote for this amendment. People say: \nWhat is wrong with it? It is simply enabling language. You read the \nlanguage, and it is indeed relatively innocuous. Do I think it would \ndamage or mar the Constitution in some fundamental way if it were \nadopted? No, I don't. So why not go along with my colleague and go \nalong with public opinion and go ahead and put it in the Constitution?\n\n  Let me share with my colleagues my reasoning on this. The flag is a \nsymbol. By itself, intrinsically, it is nothing more than a piece of \ncloth or several pieces of colored cloth sewn together. It has great \npower as a symbol because of what it represents, and we must do what we \ncan to teach respect for that symbol among our youth and to maintain \nthat respect as we mature.\n  The Constitution is something more than a symbol. The Constitution is \nour fundamental basic law. Everything we do is measured against it. If \nwe do something in this body that does not meet that measure, it is \nappropriately struck down and made invalid. The Constitution is more \nthan a symbol.\n  We are dealing here with a nonissue. No one is burning the flag in \nAmerica today in any discernible numbers. No one is creating outcry \nthroughout our populace. No one is doing anything to incite any kind of \nreaction over this issue. This is a nonissue that came out of the 1960s \nand 1970s. We are 30 years beyond the time when this was something \nreally happening in this country.\n  If we adopt this amendment, we will be putting a symbol in the \nConstitution that I do not want my name attached to. The symbol will be \nthis: We will have decided that whenever the Congress, responding to \npublic opinion, disagrees with a Supreme Court decision, they will \namend the Constitution, and they will even do it if the issue is a \nnonissue. The words will lie there. I think they won't make much \ndifference one way or the other, but they will be there as a symbol of \nour willingness to overturn more than 200 years of tradition with \nrespect to individual rights as outlined in the first amendment. That \nis a symbol of what I consider to be our foolishness to which I do not \nwant my name attached.\n  For that reason, I am not in support of this amendment. I have taken \nthe floor opposing this amendment on a previous occasion and so do now.\n  I will make one other comment before I sit down. I have just come \nfrom a television interview where the issue was campaign finance \nreform. The Vice President has just made a very long and stirring call \nto arms that we must somehow protect the Nation against the rising \ncancer of what he calls ``special interest money.'' I think the Vice \nPresident is profoundly wrong in his understanding of what happens in \nthe campaign situation. I will save that discussion for another time.\n  The thing he did not say and that I tried to say in my television \nresponse to the Vice President was that he was ignoring the \nconstitutional implications of what he was proposing. As I pointed out \nto the television audience, one of the more honest members of the \nDemocratic Party, Senator Hollings, will be on the floor in this debate \nto recognize that you cannot do what the Vice President wants to do \nwith respect to campaign finance reform unless you amend the first \namendment, unless you amend the Constitution. There are some who are \nnot as honest as Senator Hollings who are saying you can do it without \namending the Constitution. Senator Hollings will have an amendment to \nthe Constitution. Again, I think he is profoundly wrong, but he is at \nleast honest and straightforward and open about his intentions.\n\n  An editorial ran in the Washington Post some years ago, speaking of \nmyself and other Republicans, and said: If they were really serious in \ntheir opposition to campaign finance reform on constitutional grounds, \nthey would oppose the flag amendment as well. I had already made up my \nmind and had already made public statement of my intention to oppose \nthe flag amendment. I say to those who are in favor of the flag \namendment but claim they want the Hollings amendment, they should adopt \nthe same kind of consistency that the Washington Post urged upon the \nrest of us. If they oppose the flag amendment, they should oppose the \nHollings amendment with respect to campaign finance reform as well.\n  The Hollings amendment on its history will lose. It will lose \noverwhelmingly because most people do not want to tinker with the first \namendment. One of my colleagues said: I don't want to look back on my \nhistory as a Senator and say the most significant vote I cast the whole \ntime I was there was one that weakened the Bill of Rights.\n  I don't either. I do not intend to vote for the Hollings amendment, \nand I do not intend to vote for the Hatch amendment. I think it is \nconsistent that we stand firm to protect the liberties of the people to \nexpress their views however much we disagree with them.\n  A final footnote, if it is that: The Senator from Kentucky has shown \ngreat leadership in crafting a bill that can solve this nonexistent \nproblem for those who insist that we must have a solution in a \nstatutory way. It will not amend the Constitution. It will lay down a \nstatutory marker to which all of us can repair. I urge the adoption of \nthe statutory solution to this situation as drafted by the Senator from \nKentucky and urge the Senate not to tinker with the first amendment and \nfirst amendment rights, either in the name of protecting the flag or in \nthe name of clean elections, both of which are worthwhile goals. There \nare better ways to do it. In this Chamber, we can debate those ways.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to the \ncomments of the junior Senator from Utah, with whom I agree on this \nissue entirely.\n  One of the items I would like to engage him on--I certainly didn't \ncover it in my comments, and in listening to his, neither did he--was \nthe definitional difficulty, in addition to all the other reasons why \nthe Constitution or the first amendment should not be amended for the \nfirst time in 200 years, for either one of these proposals.\n  Focusing on the flag desecration amendment, it leads the Senator from \nKentucky to ask the Senator from Utah if he understands what flag \ndesecration is, because I have always had a little difficulty trying to \nfigure out what that was. I remember I took my kids to the beach one \ntime and saw lots of flags on T-shirts. I even saw one on the behind of \nsome blue jeans. There are a variety of ways in which flags are \ndisplayed in this country that, it seems to me, might be arguably \ninappropriate.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Utah thinks if this amendment were to \nbecome part of the Constitution, we would have a definitional problem \nhere as well.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky has raised a \nvery interesting question because, as I understand it, the requirement \nfor a definition would fall to the Congress under this amendment, which \nmeans it would be decided by statute. It is the intention of the \nSenator from Kentucky to solve the whole problem by statute from the \nbeginning. The constitutional amendment would end up being subject to \ncongressional definition, as I understand it, and we would be right \nback where we are right now. We would have put this symbol in the \nConstitution and not have resolved any of the issues the Senator from \nKentucky raises.\n\n[[Page S1713]]\n\n  I think it is a very appropriate issue to be raised at this point. I \ncan't give you a definition of what constitutes desecration of the \nflag.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I had a marvelous friend who was a veteran of World \nWar I. He lived up until a couple years ago. He lived in my hometown of \nLouisville, KY. His mission, toward the end of his life, was to make \nsure that flag etiquette was always followed. He had become an expert \non the subject of flag etiquette, which is apparently quite complicated \nbecause it includes ways in which the flag can be displayed, in \naddition to what we are all familiar with as Boy Scouts, about folding \nthe flag properly. He was constantly irritated and offended by ways in \nwhich well-meaning citizens groups used the flag that he felt were a \nviolation of respect with which the flag should be treated in a \ncategory of behavior generally referred to as flag etiquette. Frankly, \nwe were all somewhat confused in trying to do that properly.\n  I wonder if we would not, here in the Congress, be right back in the \nsame soup, so to speak, as the Senator from Utah points out, in trying \nto determine what is and what isn't proper respect for the flag.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky reminds me of a \nsimilar individual in the State of Utah who constantly berates me every \ntime he gets the opportunity on what he considers to be a desecration \nof the flag, which is the addition of gold fringe to the edge of the \nflag. He insists that has a particular legal implication and, indeed, \nwent to the point of insisting that if a Federal judge presides in a \ncourtroom where the flag has gold fringe on its edge, the actions of \nthat Federal judge are not legal and that the flag, to be properly \ndisplayed, must have no gold edge.\n  I noted on one of the rare times I have been in the Oval Office with \nPresident Clinton, the flag that hangs behind the President's desk has \na gold edge on it. If indeed we were to come to the conclusion that \nthat was a desecration of the flag and that all acts taken in the \npresence of a flag thus desecrated were illegal, then every bill signed \nby the President in the Oval Office under that definition would be \nillegitimate. Obviously, I don't think it will go to that point. But I \nthink the Senator from Kentucky has made a legitimate point as to who \nis going to argue which position with respect to what constitutes \nimproper handling of the flag.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it could be argued that we might even \nneed ``Federal flag police'' to go around and look after proper respect \nto the flag under this amendment. It seems to me if we were going to \ntake it seriously and amend the first amendment for the first time in \n200 years and enshrine this in the Constitution, presumably we would \ntake this as a serious matter.\n  Mr. BENNETT. There is no question but that there would be pressures \nto move in the direction the Senator from Kentucky is talking about. I \ncome back to my same observation, which is that if we wanted to do \nthat, we could do it by statute. We could do it right now. We don't \nneed to amend the Constitution in order for the Congress to pass laws \nwith respect to appropriate flag etiquette and apply penalties to those \nwho violate the flag etiquette. I am not sure I would vote for those \nkinds of laws, but we have the authority to do that. I think the \nstatute offered by the Senator from Kentucky, of which I have the \nprivilege and honor of being a cosponsor, moves us in the sensible \ndirection to that extent, without leaving behind, as I say, a symbol \nof, in my view, overreaction in the Constitution itself.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Finally, I am not an expert on these matters, but I am \ntold that the appropriate way to dispose of a flag that is tattered and \nreally torn--in fact, I saw one recently at a school where I brought \nthem a flag that had been flown over the Capitol as a replacement for a \nflag that had flown at this elementary school for a long time; it was \nbattered and torn and was going to be destroyed. I am told the \nappropriate way to do that is to burn it. I wonder if the Senator from \nUtah shares my view with regard to if that is, in fact, the appropriate \nway to dispose of a flag that actually has reached the end of its \nuseful life, how would we determine which flag burning was a \ndesecration and which was actually an honor?\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator raises a very worthwhile point. It is my \nunderstanding as well that the appropriate way to destroy a flag that \nhas outlived its usefulness, or destroy its remnants, is to burn it. \nThat is considered an act of great respect. So it becomes a question of \ndetermining motive; and you can't simply regulate the act, you have to \ngo into an understanding of the motive of the act, and, once again----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. You have to understand intent, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes, intent. And, once again, if you are dealing with \nthe first amendment, the first amendment is very clear that Congress \nshall make no law that impacts on intent; it only has to do with actual \nacts. If you speak against the Government, that is fine. If you enter \ninto a conspiracy to actually overthrow the Government, it becomes an \novert act, and the act is dealt with, but not your intention to \ndemonstrate your disapproval.\n  So I think the Senator from Kentucky raises a very significant point \nas to how pernicious this could be if it were part of the Constitution \nas opposed to a statute.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his important \ncontributions. It reminds me of when we discussed this issue \npreviously. It leads me to believe that the appropriate way to deal \nwith someone who desecrates the flag might be a punch in the nose as \nopposed to evisceration of the first amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution, which we have not changed--and I think wisely--in the \n200-year history of our country.\n  I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  I yield such time as he may desire to the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky and the \nSenator from Utah. This has always been a very difficult issue for me. \nI voted against a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag desecration \nboth as a Member of the House of Representatives and also previously as \na Member of the Senate. But it has been very difficult, largely because \nI believe, as do most Americans, that desecrating our flag is \nrepugnant. It is an act that none of us would find anything other than \ndisgusting. Yet the question is not that; the question is, Shall we \namend the Constitution of the United States?\n  As I said on two previous occasions, I have voted against a \nconstitutional amendment to prohibit the desecration of the flag, not \nbecause I believe the flag is not worth protecting--I believe it is \nworth protecting--but because I believe the Constitution should be \naltered only rarely and only in circumstances where it is the only \nmethod available to achieve a desired result.\n  The Constitution was written by 55 men over a couple of centuries \nago. The room in which they wrote that document still exists, the \nassembly room in Constitution Hall. I was privileged to go back there \nfor the 200th birthday of the writing of the Constitution. On that day, \n55 of us went back into the chamber where they wrote the Constitution. \nMen, women, and minorities were among the 55 of us who went into that \nroom. Sitting in that room, I got the chills because I saw the chair \nwhere George Washington sat as he presided over the Constitutional \nConvention. You can see where Ben Franklin, Mason, Madison, and others \nsat as they discussed the development of a constitution for this new \ndemocracy of ours. That Constitution begins with the three words: We \nthe people. Then it describes the framework for self-government, \nrepresentative democracy.\n  That framework has served this country very, very well over a very \nlong period of time. As I understand it, there have been over 11,000 \nproposals to change the Constitution since the Bill of Rights. There \nhave been 11,000 different ideas on how to alter the U.S. Constitution. \nFortunately, over two centuries, 17 have prevailed. The framers of the \nConstitution actually made it fairly difficult to amend the \nConstitution. They did that for good reason. Only 17 of the 11,000 \nproposals have actually prevailed. Those 17, of course, are \nsignificant. Three of them are Reconstruction-era amendments that \nabolished slavery and gave African Americans and women the right to \nvote. There have been amendments\n\n[[Page S1714]]\n\nlimiting the President to two terms and establishing an order of \nsuccession for a President's death or departure from office.\n  We have had proposals, for example, to amend the Constitution to \nprovide that the Presidency shall be rotated with one term by a \nPresident from the southern part of the United States and then the next \nterm by a President from the northern part. That is just one example of \nthe 11,000 proposals to change the U.S. Constitution. It has been done \nonly very rarely.\n  I indicated to those who support a constitutional amendment that when \nwe are confronted with this question again--I greatly respect their \nviews; I know they have great passion in doing so; they are patriots--I \nwould do a significant review once again, and I have. I reviewed \nvirtually all of the writings of the constitutional scholars on this \nissue. I read almost anything anyone has written about it, evaluated \nall of the research, and concluded once again that I think the best \napproach would be to pass a statute of the type described by the \nSenator from Kentucky and the Senator from Utah, and provide protection \nfor the flag in that manner which constitutional scholars of the \nCongressional Research Service say will be upheld by the Supreme Court. \nI believe that is the more appropriate and right approach as opposed to \namending the Constitution.\n  I will read something from Gen. Colin Powell, former Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff. He puts it probably better than I can. I read it \nonly to describe again that there are some who say, well, if you are \nnot supporting a constitutional amendment to prohibit desecration of \nthe flag somehow you don't support the flag or you are unworthy. That \nis not the case at all. I hope all of us will respect the various \npositions on this.\n  Let me read the letter from Gen. Colin Powell.\n  He said:\n\n       I love our flag, our Constitution and our country with a \n     love that has no bounds. I defended all three for 35 years as \n     a soldier and was willing to give my life in their defense.\n       Americans revere their flag as a symbol of the Nation. \n     Indeed, it is because of that reverence that the amendment is \n     under consideration. Few countries in the world would think \n     of amending their Constitution for the purpose of protecting \n     such a symbol.\n       We are rightfully outraged when anyone attacks or \n     desecrates our flag. Few Americans do such things and when \n     they do they are subject to the rightful condemnation of \n     their fellow citizens. They may be destroying a piece of \n     cloth, but they do no damage to our system of freedom which \n     tolerates such desecration.\n       If they are destroying a flag that belongs to someone else, \n     that's a prosecutable crime. If it is a flag they own, I \n     really don't want to amend the Constitution to prosecute \n     someone for foolishly desecrating their own property. We \n     should condemn them and pity them instead.\n       I understand how strongly so many of my fellow veterans and \n     citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful \n     sentiment in state legislatures for such an amendment. I feel \n     the same sense of outrage. But I step back from amending the \n     Constitution to relieve that outrage. The First Amendment \n     exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression \n     applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but \n     also that which we find outrageous.\n       I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer \n     a few miscreants. The flag will be flying proudly long after \n     they have slunk away.\n       Finally, I shudder to think of the legal morass we will \n     create trying to implement the body of law that will emerge \n     from such an amendment.\n       If I were a member of Congress, I would not vote for the \n     proposed amendment and would fully understand and respect the \n     views of those who would. For or against, we all love our \n     flag with equal devotion.\n\n  I think this letter from Gen. Colin Powell says it well, particularly \nwhen he says:\n\n       I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer \n     a few miscreants. The flag will be flying proudly long after \n     they have slunk away.\n\n  The statute that has been introduced by my colleagues from Utah and \nKentucky, cosponsored by myself, Senator Conrad and others, is a \nstatute that offers some protection. I am convinced that it would be \nupheld constitutionally, and the constitutional scholars of the \nCongressional Research Service have written us with their opinion that \nit would be upheld as well.\n  I believe in every circumstance we ought to find ways to do that \nwhich is necessary and which is important without the resulting desire \nto change the framework of this democracy, the Constitution.\n  I greatly respect those who disagree with me, but I believe that over \na long period of time--a decade, a half a century, a century--America \nwill be better served if we resist the impulse to amend the \nConstitution in ways that will create unintended consequences.\n  Once again, that room in which George Washington, Madison, Mason, \nFranklin, and others wrote the Constitution of the United States with \nthe advice and consent of Thomas Jefferson, who was serving in Europe \nat the time and contributed most to the Bill of Rights, contains a \ngreat sense of history for those of us who have been there, as well as \nan understanding that the framework for our democracy, the U.S. \nConstitution, is a very special and very precious document. It should \nbe changed only in rare circumstances, and even then only when it is \nthe last method available for achieving a result we deem imperative for \nthis country.\n  I believe the statute that has been offered as an amendment is a \nstatutory approach that will solve this issue in an appropriate way, \nand will at the same time preserve the Constitution as intended, \nespecially with the Bill of Rights and most especially with the care \nthat Congress and the American people have nurtured over nearly two \ncenturies.\n  Mr. President, let me commend the Senator from Kentucky. I know this \namendment has been offered before on the floor of the Senate. I heard \nthe debate by the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Utah. I \nconcur with that discussion and hope we can achieve a positive vote on \nthis proposal when it is voted on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor his remarks. I listened carefully to them and am glad to have him \ncosponsor the amendment. I hope the amendment will prevail this time, \nas opposed to the constitutional amendment.\n  I thank my friend from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this is one of those \nissues that is very emotional. We have people on both sides who truly \nhave the same goals. We believe alike--that those who burn the flag or \ndesecrate the flag in any way are despicable people for whom we should \nhave no sympathy.\n  I say up front, before I make my remarks, that I certainly have the \ndeepest respect for all of my colleagues who believe that we do not \nneed a constitutional amendment, especially Senator McConnell for whom \nI have the greatest respect.\n  I think we need to look very carefully at this issue. The \nConstitution has been amended. Actually, it has been amended 27 times--\nnot 17--once with the first 10 amendments, of course, and 17 times \nlater. When it was amended, it was amended to clarify, to make clear. \nThat is why we have an amendment process. That is why the founders put \nit in there.\n  I do not think the constitutional Republic will tremble, shake, and \nfall because we decide to deal with an issue such as flag desecration \nwith an amendment. That seems to be the gist of what we are hearing, \nperhaps in an overly legalistic argument that somehow the \nconstitutional Republic will have acted irresponsibly to pass an \namendment to the Constitution which would stop the desecration of the \nflag.\n  I am an original cosponsor of the constitutional amendment introduced \nby Senator Hatch, S.J. Res. 14. I am proud to be a cosponsor of that \namendment.\n  The act of the desecration of the U.S. flag is an aggressive and a \nprovocative act. It is also an act of violence against a symbol of \nAmerica, our flag. Even more disturbing, it is an act of violence \nagainst our country's values and principles.\n  The Constitution guarantees freedom. There is no question about it. \nIt guarantees freedom of speech. But it also seeks to ensure, in the \nwords of the Preamble, ``domestic tranquility.''\n  Many Americans have given their lives to protect this country as \nsymbolized by that flag. My own family, as thousands of other families, \nendured\n\n[[Page S1715]]\n\nthe same thing. My dad died in World War II, and my family has that \nflag. It is a very important item in our home, as it is in Senator \nMcConnell's home when he mentioned his father.\n  I believe the flag deserves the constitutional protection because it \nis more than just a flag. It is more than just a symbol.\n  I use the example of a $5 bill which I happen to have in my hand. If \nthis is merely a symbol and has no other meaning, then I suppose I \ncould ask millions of Americans to send me $5 bills and I will be happy \nto send them back plain pieces of paper because it is just paper. This \nis paper, therefore it is a symbol, and it doesn't have any meaning. So \nI can take all these pieces of paper and send them back to you in \nreturn for $5 bills.\n  If anybody does choose to do this, I will be happy to provide it to \nsome charity. I am not looking for $5 bills to be mailed to me.\n  There is something beyond the meaning of just this piece of paper on \nthis $5 bill, and there is something beyond the meaning of just a piece \nof cloth with the flag of the United States. Some people believe \noutlawing the desecration, which this amendment would authorize \nCongress to do, will lead somehow to the destruction of freedom. I \ndisagree. Our Constitution was carefully crafted to protect our \nfreedoms, not to diminish them. It also was crafted to promote \nresponsibility. We are stepping on very dangerous ground when we allow \nreckless behavior such as flag desecration, whether burning, trampling, \nor whatever the desecration may be.\n  This Constitution has served the test of time very well. It has been \namended on 27 occasions. Interestingly enough, the first ten \namendments, the Bill of Rights, passed shortly after the Constitution \nitself was passed. Why? Because they wanted to clarify. They didn't \nwant anybody to misunderstand that we needed to have certain basic \nfreedoms such as the freedom of speech, freedom of religion; the second \namendment, the right to keep and bear arms, and so forth.\n  Oftentimes in the debates on the floor of the Senate many of my \ncolleagues pick and choose which amendments they choose to support and \nwhich they choose to ignore. It is all the Constitution.\n  Under our discussion, I don't think the Supreme Court has more power \nthan the people. If we were to vote today or tomorrow or the next day \non this constitutional amendment on flag desecration, it goes to the \npeople. It goes to the State legislatures. We are not making a final \njudgment. This is a constitutional process. It was very carefully laid \nout by the founders so that amendments would be very difficult to pass. \nIf the American people support Congress if it passes, then we will have \nan amendment to the Constitution, No. 28. If they don't, it will not \nhappen. All we are asking is the opportunity to let the people make the \ndecision.\n  Amending the Constitution is serious, but a simple statute is not \nenough. We tried that and the Court struck down the statute.\n  A little bit of history on the legal history of flag burning is \nrelevant. Over the years, Congress and the States have recognized the \ndevotion our diverse people have for the flag and they have enacted \nstatutes over the years that both promote respect for the flag and \nprotect the flag from desecration.\n  In the Texas v. Johnson case in 1989, by 5-4 vote, referred to \nearlier in the debate, the Supreme Court overturned a conviction of \nGregory Lee Johnson who desecrated an American flag. Johnson burned an \nAmerican flag at the 1984 Republican National Convention. A fellow \nprotester had taken a flag from a flagpole and had given the flag to \nJohnson. At Dallas City Hall, Johnson unfurled the flag, poured \nkerosene on it and burned it.\n\n  That is not speech, I say in all humbleness, candor, and with respect \nto my colleagues. That is not speech. That is an action. That is a \ndirect action of desecrating the symbol of America. While the flag \nburned, protesters chanted ``America, the red white and blue, we spit \non you.''\n  A few moments ago, my colleague from Utah, Senator Bennett, was \nsaying he didn't know whether we would be able to determine whether or \nnot somebody who takes the flag with respect and disposes of it the way \nwe are supposed to dispose of it under law --burning it in a respectful \nway--whether there would be any confusion. I do not think there is any \nconfusion between that act and what I just referred to, ``America, the \nred white and blue, we spit on you,'' when the flag was torn down from \na flagpole and kerosene was poured on it. I don't know why anybody \nwould be confused by that.\n  Johnson was convicted of desecration of a venerated object, in \nviolation of section 42.09 of the Texas Penal Code which, among other \nthings, made illegal the intentional or knowing desecration of a \nnational flag. The Court held the government's interest did not \noutweigh the interest of the flag burner. The act was not oral or \nwritten political speech; it was conduct. It was conduct, not speech. \nThere is a difference.\n  Justice Rehnquist, for himself and Justices White and O'Connor, \nstated in dissent: For more than 200 years, the American flag has \noccupied a unique position as the symbol of our Nation, a uniqueness \nthat justifies a governmental prohibition against flag burning in the \nway respondent Johnson did here.\n  The constitutional amendment would enable Congress to punish the next \nflag burner or the next flag desecrator. In 1989, Congress enacted a \nfairly neutral statute, the Flag Protection Act of 1989, with an \nexception for the disposal of worn or soiled flags as a response to the \nJohnson decision. Based on the new rule announced in Johnson, the \nSupreme Court struck down the statute by a 5-4 vote in United States v. \nEichman in 1990. S.J. Res. 14 would restore the traditional balance to \nthe Court's first amendment interpretation.\n  That is all it does. Only a constitutional amendment can restore the \ntraditional balance between a society's interest and the actor's \ninterest concerning the flag. The first amendment prohibits abridgement \nof freedom of speech. There is always a balancing of society's interest \nwith the individual's interest in expression.\n  A few examples have been used many times on the floor in debate. Here \nis a good example: Can you yell ``fire'' in a crowded theater?\n  Could anyone yell something out now? You would be removed if you were \nin the galleries making a loud comment that disrupted the proceedings. \nYou would be removed.\n  There are limits on speech. It is simply incorrect to say there are \nno limits to free speech. There are limits to free speech, and it has \nbeen held as being constitutional. ``Fire'' in a crowded theater was \nheld to be unconstitutional in Schenk v. U.S. in 1919.\n  There is no constitutional right to disclose State secrets. Some have \ngotten away with it, but we don't have the constitutional right to go \nout to the media and announce all the national secrets that we have \naccess to as Senators, along with many individuals who work for the \nU.S. Government who have access to U.S. secrets. They don't go out and \nhold press conferences, nor do they tell our enemies what those secrets \nare. There is not a constitutional right to disclose those secrets.\n  There is no constitutional right to defame or libel a person's \ncharacter. That was upheld in Gertz v. Welch. There is no \nconstitutional right to engage in partisan political activity in \nworking for the Federal Government.\n  There is no constitutional right to commercially promote promiscuous \nactivity by minors.\n  The American flag has not been given that protection by the Supreme \nCourt. Congress has a compelling interest in protecting the flag. \nCongress needs to preserve the values embodied by the flag--liberty, \nequality, freedom, and justice for all.\n  The flag enhances national unity and our bond to one another in our \naspiration for national unity. If we read history about the fall of the \nRoman Empire, it is when Rome lost the glue that held it together, when \nthey became too big, they became so splintered and there was no unity, \nno cohesion, that they lost their symbol of what the Roman Empire \nmeant.\n  When we lose the symbol of what we are about, we will lose this \ncountry. The flag enhances national unity. It enhances the bond. Even \nif we are wrong, even if we do not need the\n\n[[Page S1716]]\n\namendment--and I do not make that case--even if perhaps Senator \nMcConnell and others are correct that we do not need this amendment, so \nwhat? We err on the side of caution.\n  We survived an amendment on prohibition, and we survived an amendment \nto repeal prohibition. The Constitution and the constitutional Republic \ndid not fall and die as a result of those amendments which were \ncontroversial, to say the least. So good amendments and bad amendments \noccur, and the Constitution survives because that is the way it is \nsupposed to be.\n  Let's err on the side of caution. Let's err on the side of caution. \nIt sends a good message to everyone--to young and old, those who fought \nand died, those who survived, and those young people in first, second, \nand third grade classes, and all through our schools all across \nAmerica, that the flag is more than just a symbol. It represents that \ncohesion, that bond, that special thing that makes us Americans. We can \ncarry it into battle. We can have it standing behind the Presiding \nOfficer. We salute it every morning, as Senator McConnell said, before \nwe start our proceedings. If we can salute it, we can protect it. What \nis wrong with that?\n  I repeat for emphasis, err on the side of caution. It is not going to \ncause the destruction of America because we reinforce something we \nbelieve in by amending the Constitution.\n  James Madison stated that desecration of the flag is ``a dire \ninvasion of sovereignty.''\n  Thomas Jefferson considered violation of the flag worthy of a \n``systematic and severe course of punishment.''\n  S.J. Res. 14 would remove the Government sanction of flag desecration \nand flag burning. The Judiciary Committee found in hearings that there \nhave been between 40 and several hundred acts of flag desecration over \nthe past decade. Our Supreme Court has granted the flag burner a \nsanction under the first amendment to engage in the conduct of burning \nan American flag.\n  Forty-nine State legislatures and most of the American people want an \namendment to protect the American flag. All we are doing, if we can get \nthe requisite number of votes, is to pass an amendment on to the people \nand the legislatures to make a final decision.\n  Our heritage, sovereignty, and values are uniquely represented by \nthis flag.\n  The flag of the United States of America has long unified our \ncountrymen during times of great strife, upheaval, and during the more \ncommon times of prosperity and pride. It inspired men and women to win \nour independence in the Revolutionary War. Over the years, it has \nrepresented to a people of all nations freedom and all the values that \nhas made America the envy of the world.\n  I say to my colleagues, regardless of the technical/legal aspect of \nthis, as to whether or not it is legal, whether or not it is \nconstitutional, whether it is necessary or not, what is the message we \nsend to the world? They will not understand that the Congress of the \nUnited States, the Senate, refused to pass an amendment to protect the \nflag. It will be misperceived, in my view.\n  It is an inspiration. It has been praised in song and in verse. It \nhas been honored with a day of its own--Flag Day--and its own code of \netiquette on how to store it, how to salute it, and what to do with it. \nIt has been given allegiance by our schoolchildren and given honor by \nthe Supreme Court. The Supreme Court recognizes ``love both of common \ncountry and of State will diminish in proportion as respect for the \nflag is weakened.'' That was a Nebraska case in 1907.\n\n  How can one say it any better than that? Unfortunately, more recent \ncourt decisions have struck down State and Federal statutes banning the \ndesecration of Old Glory.\n  So we debate again. We have done this before. We are going to do it \nagain. We debate a constitutional amendment. We should remember the \nimportant relationship over the years the American flag has had with \nAmerican history, with American freedoms and, indeed, the American \nconscience.\n  On June 14, 1777, the Marine Committee of the Second Continental \nCongress adopted a resolution that read:\n\n       Resolved, that the flag of the United States be 13 stripes, \n     alternate red and white, that the union be 13 stars, white in \n     a blue field representing a new constellation.\n\n  Red for hardiness and courage; white for purity and innocence; and \nblue for vigilance, perseverance, and justice.\n  George Washington described the flag in much the same way:\n\n       We take the stars from heaven and the red from our mother \n     country, separating it by white stripes, thus showing that we \n     have separated from her; and the white stripes shall go down \n     to posterity representing liberty.\n\n  This new flag made one of its first appearances 2 months later at the \nBattle of Bennington. On August 16, 1777, the American soldiers faced \nthe dreaded Hessian mercenaries. While the two forces clashed, American \nGeneral John Stark rallied his troops by saying:\n\n       My men, yonder are the Hessians. They were bought for 7 \n     pounds and 10 pence a man. Are you worth more? Prove it. \n     Tonight the American flag floats from yonder hill or Molly \n     Stark sleeps a widow.\n\n  The brave Americans triumphed under their new flag at the Battle of \nBennington, and the new stars and stripes floated from the hill which \nthe Hessians once possessed.\n  It was the first time that liberty and freedom was advanced under the \nflag and, as we all know, it was most certainly not the last.\n  I can go on and on. Of course, we all know the story of the ``Star-\nSpangled Banner.'' How in 1814, Francis Scott Key, a Washington \nattorney, boarded a British warship in the Chesapeake Bay to negotiate \nthe release of a prisoner taken when British forces burned the Capitol \nin August.\n  While aboard the ship, the British fleet turned its attention to \nBaltimore, and that is where Key witnessed the bombardment of Fort \nMcHenry on September 13, 1814. It continued most of the day and night, \nuntil the British abandoned their failed attack and withdrew.\n  Shortly after dawn on the 14th, the morning fog parted and Key saw \nthe flag had survived its night of 1,800 13-inch bombshells and \nrockets. Its ``broad stripes and bright stars,'' he said, were still \n``gallantly streaming.''\n  Although the forces at Fort McHenry were like sitting ducks under the \nmerciless British assault, they withstood the volleys and emerged \nvictorious once again under the besieged but still-standing American \nflag.\n  Key was inspired by this. It was not a piece of canvas that inspired \nKey to write these things. It was not a piece of cloth. It was more \nthan that. It was a flag. There is a difference. It is the same reason \nthe $5 bill is not a piece of paper. It has meaning. The flag has \nmeaning.\n  In 1931, Congress made the ``Star-Spangled Banner'' the official \nnational anthem of the United States. We owe our flag, once again under \nsiege, constitutional protection. In May 1861, just before the Civil \nWar that would tear our Nation apart, Henry Ward Beecher gave a speech \non ``The National Flag.'' It is worth mentioning a few of the things he \nsaid in that 1861 speech, bearing in mind that our Nation was about to \nbe torn asunder in a war that almost destroyed us:\n\n       A thoughtful mind, when it sees a nation's flag, sees not \n     the flag, but the nation itself. . . .\n       Wherever [our flag has] streamed abroad men saw day break \n     bursting on their eyes. For the American flag has been a \n     symbol of Liberty, and men rejoiced in it. . . .\n       If one, then, asks me the meaning of our flag, I say to \n     him, it means just what Concord and Lexington meant, what \n     Bunker Hill meant; it means the whole glorious Revolutionary \n     War. . . .\n       . . . [it means] the right of men to their own selves and \n     to their liberties. . . .\n       . . . our flag means, then, all that our fathers meant in \n     the Revolutionary War; all that the Declaration of \n     Independence meant; it means all that the Constitution of our \n     people, organizing for justice, for liberty, and for \n     happiness, meant.\n\n  Whatever that meant, that is what the flag meant.\n\n       . . . our flag carries American ideas, American history and \n     American feelings. . . .\n\n  Again, my colleagues, err on the side of caution. If you think we do \nnot need the amendment to protect it, we will not rock the Republic \nthat much if we would just make that statement with the amendment.\n  Henry Ward said:\n\n       Every color [of our flag] means liberty; every thread means \n     liberty; every form of star and beam or stripe of light means \n     liberty; not lawlessness, not license; but organized \n     institutional liberty--liberty through law, and laws for \n     liberty!\n\n  I could not agree more. Because the highest court in the land will \nnot preserve the liberty represented by our\n\n[[Page S1717]]\n\nflag from lawlessness and license, we must protect it with a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  One of the most inspirational and emotional places to visit in \nWashington, DC, I say for those who are here who may be listening--you \nhave all kinds of things out there that you can visit, from the \nTreasury Building, to the White House, to the Washington Monument, to \nthe Lincoln Memorial, to the Jefferson Memorial. They are all \nwonderful. I have been to them all. Let me add one to the list you \nought to see before you leave: The raising of the flag on Iwo Jima; the \nIwo Jima Memorial right here in Washington--an image that signifies the \nsteep price of freedom.\n  On February 19, just last month, we remembered the 55th anniversary \nof that bloody battle. Six thousand Americans gave their lives on Iwo \nJima. What were they fighting for? Most of them probably did not know \nwhere Iwo Jima was when they went into the service.\n  After 4 days, some Marines finally made it to the top of Mount \nSuribachi. They tried twice to plug a wooden flag pole into the ground. \nBoth times it broke. The third time, they wrapped the flag to a metal \npole. Later during the battle, the second flag was ordered raised when \ncommanders on the beach could not easily recognize the first one, which \nwas considerably smaller.\n  A photographer captured the moment, which has become the U.S. Marine \nMemorial outside Arlington at the National Cemetery.\n  Marines later said they could see the flag from a quarter of a mile \naway, and it gave them the courage and inspiration to overcome their \nexhaustion and fear to keep fighting.\n  It is amazing. It is not just a flag; it is more than a piece of \ncloth. Ask those guys who were at Iwo Jima. Go see that memorial, and \nsee how you feel about an amendment after you see that monument.\n  It goes on. We could talk all day--``Buzz'' Aldrin, when he planted \nthe flag on the moon. The only good thing about it, I guess, is there \nis no oxygen on the moon so no one could burn it there. Maybe we ought \nto put a few more up there.\n  Obviously, there have been many treasured moments in American history \nintertwined with our flag. History shows our laws have reflected the \nvalues represented by our flag and our Government's interest in \npreserving it.\n\n  In 1634, Massachusetts colonists prosecuted, tried, and convicted a \nperson who defaced the Massachusetts State flag. The court concluded \nthat defacing the flag was an act of rebellion. This case, called the \n``Endicott's Case,'' reflects the traditional balance between the \ninterests of society in preserving the flag and freedom of expression.\n  We have early examples of why we can make a strong and powerful case \nfor a constitutional amendment. The colonists saw the need to punish \nthe act, flag desecration, that violated Government sovereignty.\n  The framers of our Constitution, through their words and actions, \nclearly showed the importance of protecting the flag as essential to \nAmerican sovereignty.\n  James Madison, in 1800, an expert certainly of the Constitution, if \nthere ever was one--he wrote it--denounced the hauling down of the \nAmerican flag from the ship the George Washington as a ``dire invasion \nof [American] sovereignty.''\n  In 1802, Madison pronounced an act of flag defacement in the streets \nof Philadelphia to be a violation of law.\n  We sometimes overanalyze and overdebate what the founders meant. I am \namazed by the people in the 20th, now in the 21st century, who know \nwhat the founders meant. They know all about what they meant. Even \nthough they said something different, they still know what they meant, \nwhich is the exact opposite of what they said. It seems to me we should \ngo back and look at what the founders said.\n  Madison wrote the Constitution. I think he had a little understanding \nabout what he meant. If he said something, then it ought to be pretty \ngood support to say: You know, he might have meant what he said. He \nsaid it. He said that an act of flag defacement in the streets of \nPhiladelphia was a violation of law.\n  In 1807, when a British ship fired upon and ordered the lowering of \nan American ship's flag, Madison told the British Ambassador that ``the \nattack on the [ship] was a . . . flagrant insult to the flag and the \nsovereignty of the United States.''\n  As the author of the first amendment, Madison knew what freedom of \nspeech was. However, his repeated stands for the integrity of the flag \nshow that he believed that there had been no intent to withdraw the \ntraditional physical protection from the flag.\n  Thomas Jefferson also believed in the sovereignty and the integrity \nof the flag. While he was Washington's Secretary of State, there were \nmany foreign wars and naval blockades. The American flag was a neutral \nflag during this time, and other countries wanted to fly it. Jefferson \ninstructed American consuls to punish ``usurpation of our flag.''\n  To prevent the invasion of the sovereignty of the flag, Jefferson did \nnot think that the first amendment was an obstacle to a ``systematic \nand severe'' punishment for people who violated the flag.\n  Both Madison and Jefferson considered protecting the flag and \npunishing its abusers very important.\n  There are all kinds of examples in American history from our greatest \nfounders, and all kinds of resources to draw from in support of this \namendment. They believed that sovereign treatment for the flag was not \ninconsistent with protecting free speech.\n  They consistently demonstrated that they wanted to protect commerce, \ncitizenship, and neutrality rights through the protection of the flag. \nThey did not mean to suppress ideas or views or free speech. That was \nnot what they were about. They just wanted to protect the Government's \ninterests in protecting the sovereignty of the Nation as personified in \nthe flag. Freedom of speech protects that, not conduct. There is a \ndifference.\n  William Rehnquist said:\n\n       The uniquely deep awe and respect for our flag felt by \n     virtually all of us are bundled off under the rubric of \n     ``designated symbols'' that the First Amendment prohibits the \n     government from ``establishing.'' But the government has not \n     ``established'' this feeling; 200 years of history have done \n     that. The government is simply recognizing as a fact the \n     profound regard for the American flag created by that history \n     when it enacts statutes prohibiting the disrespectful public \n     burning of the flag.\n\n  We have seen the Supreme Court defy the ``deep awe and respect'' that \nthe American people, through their elected representatives, have for \nthat flag.\n  The Supreme Court further denied the American people any voice in \nprotecting the integrity of the flag in the RAV v. City of St. Paul \ncase in 1992. In that decision, the Court ruled it will no longer \nbalance society's interest in protecting the flag against an \nindividual's interest in desecrating it.\n  The Court's recent decisions have led us down this path. In order to \npreserve the values embodied by our flag, in order to enhance national \nunity, and in order to protect our national sovereignty, we, the \npeople's representatives, have to take the first step here to amend the \nConstitution. It is going to be a slow and difficult process, as the \nFounding Fathers intended. They wanted it to be slow and difficult. It \nwas not supposed to be easy.\n  We should have this debate. We should rise up and take each other on \ndirectly. We should have a vote, and we should be recorded. If it \nprevails with the 67 votes necessary, it will move forward for the \npeople and the legislatures. It is a necessary process in order to \nremove the Government's seal of approval of flag burning and \ndesecration.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be equally deducted from both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, how much time remains on \nboth sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 25 minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from Kentucky has 20 minutes remaining.\n\n[[Page S1718]]\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Chair and yield myself 15 \nminutes.\n  Turning to the substance of the McConnell amendment, I find that it \nfails to protect the flag or the people who revere it. This is a very \nnarrow proposal. In order to be prosecuted under the statute Senator \nMcConnell has proposed, one must: No. 1, intentionally destroy or \ndamage the flag with an intent to incite or produce imminent violence \nor breach of the peace; No. 2, one must steal and intentionally destroy \na flag belonging to the United States; or, No. 3, one must steal or \nintentionally destroy someone else's flag on Federal property.\n  Now if you come to the conclusion that I have--and I think we all \nhave on both sides--that flag desecration is wrong, why limit the \ndesecration to those instances I just cited? Why make it legal to burn \na flag in front of a crowd that loves flag desecration or on television \nor at some safe distance and yet make it illegal to burn a flag in \nfront of people who would be upset? That is what is happening here.\n  Let me repeat that. Why make it legal to burn a flag in front of a \ncrowd that loves flag desecration and yet make it illegal to burn a \nflag in front of people who would be upset? That is pretty much what we \nhave here. Why make it illegal to burn a post office flag but not a \nflag belonging to the hospital across the street? Why make it illegal \nfor a lone camper to burn a flag at a campfire in Yellowstone Park when \nit is legal to burn a flag before hundreds of children at a public \nschool? To anybody who is interested in protecting the flag from \ndesecration, how does this make sense? It is not common sense.\n  There are other problems with this statute as proposed. First, the \nSupreme Court is likely to hold that the amendment's attempt to \nprohibit flag burning that may breach the peace is unconstitutional. In \nTexas v. Johnson, the State of Texas defended its flag desecration \nstatute on the ground that it was necessary to prevent breaches of the \npeace, and the Court rejected the argument because there was no showing \nthat a disturbance of the peace was a likely response to Johnson's \nconduct regardless of Johnson's intent. So in order to qualify for the \nbreach of the peace exception under Brandenberg v. Ohio, the Court said \nthe flag burning must both be directed to inciting or protecting \nimminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\n\n  Since the McConnell amendment fails to require any showing that the \ndestruction of a flag objectively is likely to incite or produce the \nbreach of peace, the Court will strike it down as unconstitutional. \nThis is a lot of legalese--legal gobbledygook, I might call it. This is \nwhat the lawyers like to do. But this is more than a legal issue. Your \nspeech cannot be suppressed because it might breach the peace, even if \nyou believe you are breaching the peace. You must have both intent and \nthe objective likelihood that others nearby will be compelled to \nviolent action because of your speech.\n  So in this regard, I note that the Court, in Johnson, found that the \nflag burning did not threaten to breach the peace, nor was there any \nfinding that Johnson intended to breach the peace. The Court also found \nthat no reasonable onlooker would have considered the flag burning to \nbe an invitation to a fight. In other words, the Court held that flag \nburning did not constitute fighting words. As a result, the McConnell \namendment would not even apply to the flag burning in Johnson.\n  Even if the McConnell statute satisfied the breach of peace exception \nto the first amendment, the other sections of the proposed statute \nwouldn't. The Johnson and Eichman cases seem to require that the same \ngeneral analysis apply. Could the Government say that all racist \nfighting words are illegal on Government property but that others are \nnot in some other location? Of course not. The Court has said that this \namounts to impermissible content-based discrimination. But that is the \neffect of the amendment Senator McConnell offers because it only \ncriminalizes stealing and destroying a flag rather than all Government \nproperty and because it only criminalizes the burning of a flag stolen \nfrom another on Government property rather than all other property that \ncould be stolen and destroyed. A lot of legal language, but it is \nimportant because this is what we would be dealing with if the statute \nSenator McConnell proposes were to pass as opposed to the amendment.\n  Even if these portions of the McConnell amendment could survive \nconstitutional scrutiny, which I doubt they could, they are no \nsubstitute for real flag protection. The McConnell statute would not \nhave punished Gregory Johnson's notorious flag burning. When he took it \ndown from that pole, burned it, and spat on it, he didn't steal the \nflag from the United States; so he wouldn't be punished. It was stolen \nfrom a bank building; therefore the statute would not apply. Johnson \ndidn't burn his stolen flag on Federal property; he burned it in front \nof city hall; therefore the bill would not apply. If the amendment \nwould not punish Johnson, who would it punish? We need to be \nreasonable. We would look foolish to take this kind of legalistic \napproach rather than the substance of what Madison and Jefferson and \nWashington and so many others so eloquently put many years ago when \nthey wrote this Constitution.\n\n  Now, some say it is better than an amendment because they want to \npreserve the first amendment rights. But if we are going to punish flag \ndestruction on Federal property during a political rally, if we are \ngoing to say that is not an infringement of free speech when the flag \nis stolen, then why does the first amendment protect desecrating the \nflag under the same circumstance?\n  The ownership of the flag is not relevant to the first amendment \nanalysis. It is not the ownership of the flag that matters, it is the \nflag. It is what it symbolizes. It is the act that matters. It seems to \nme that the statute by my friend from Kentucky is perfectly consistent \nwithout allowing flag desecration on city or State property regardless \nof whose flag it is. Once you make it a Federal crime to burn a flag, \nyou are reaching communicative conduct the Supreme Court says is \nconstitutionally protected. If you are prepared to punish flag \ndesecration based on the theft of the flag and the location of the \ndesecration as consistent with the first amendment, you cannot \nlogically argue that punishing the desecration of one's own flag on \nthat same property or other property is inconsistent with the first \namendment.\n  I think any Senator who can vote for this statute, frankly, can vote \nfor an amendment that authorizes broader protection of our flag. We \nneed to stop splitting hairs here and understand what we are talking \nabout, understand the incitive act that we are talking about in the \ndesecration of that flag and what it means to the fabric and fiber of \nour Nation. While the Federal connection to property may give you \njurisdiction for a Federal statute, it simply does not change the first \namendment analysis.\n  Why would anyone vote for an ineffective statute? It is a weak way to \nsay we don't want an amendment. It is not a good alternative. I would \nalmost prefer that you voted no on the basis of it being \nunconstitutional in your mind than to offer this amendment. But \nadoption of the McConnell amendment will amount to the government's \nunintended declaration of open season on all American flags. It says: \nDo what you want to the flag--whatever you want--but don't start a \nriot, whatever you do. Don't steal it from the government; steal it \nfrom a bank, and whatever you do, don't burn it on government property. \nOtherwise, have a good time, burn away, desecrate away. Pick and choose \nwhere you want to burn, where you want to desecrate, and you will be \nfine.\n  Now, really, does that make sense as an alternative to the amendment? \nWe can do better than that. The proposed constitutional amendment \nallows us to do better than that. By giving Congress the power to enact \na sensible flag protection statute, the flag amendment will allow for \nmeaningful flag protection that doesn't make silly, legalistic \ndistinctions. So let's have the courage of our convictions to say, yes, \nwe need the constitutional amendment because without it, the flag can \nbe desecrated, and this will have a harmful affect on our country and \non its fabric, if you will. Or say, no, we don't need the amendment, it \nwill have no impact, it doesn't matter, and let it go at that.\n  I urge my colleagues who support protection for the flag to vote no \non\n\n[[Page S1719]]\n\nthe McConnell amendment and to vote yes on the constitutional \namendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, opponents of the \namendment like to say that America is not facing an epidemic, that we \nhave a few acts of flag desecration. Depending on how you want to \ndefine them, they are usually by some crazy person or some nut, or \nwhatever term you want to apply to it, or someone who is demented. But \nI think opponents try to downplay the number of desecration incidents \nthat we have in this country. They not only use flawed statistics, but \nI think they also miss the point that numbers don't always tell the \nstory, and who is doing it is another issue. I would like to give an \nexample.\n  I am a former schoolteacher. You are never a former teacher. You are \nalways a teacher; once a teacher, always a teacher. I used to try to \ninstill in my students the patriotism and respect for the country. I \ntaught civics.\n  I wonder if you will hear the opponents of our amendment talk about \nwhat happened a few weeks ago in a town called Somerset, MA. Two \nteenagers--just two--smashed several dozen Civil War-era gravestones, \ntoppled several others, and burned and shredded 87 American flags that \nwere placed on 60 gravestones in that cemetery--Civil War veterans. \nSixty stones were toppled or vandalized. One hundred American flags \nmarking the graves of war veterans were either stolen, ripped, or \nburned, according to the Boston Herald.\n  Opponents who argue that no great and extraordinary occasions justify \nthe proposed amendment are simply off the mark, in my view. Eighty-\nseven burnt flags, particularly flags honoring heroes who made the \nsupreme sacrifice defending the Union in the Civil War, is a great and \nextraordinary occasion.\n  Regardless of how we count the number of desecration incidents, the \npoint of our discussion today is not statistics. It is not how many but \nrather the impact that this kind of incident has on our values, on our \nculture, and on our children. What do we say to those children who did \nthat? What do we say to the children who didn't do it, the vast \nmajority of children, I might add? What do our children learn by \nhearing that our Government is powerless to punish those vandals? What \ndo we want to teach our children about that incident? We can remain \nsilent. It didn't happen on Government property, unless it was a VA \ncemetery. Maybe it was. So we couldn't punish them under the statute \nbeing proposed.\n  If we don't have a constitutional amendment, maybe we can figure out \nsome other way to punish them. But it is more than punishment of the \nvandals that is at stake. It is a message to the rest of America why \nthis is wrong and why it is not right to go in there and desecrate \nthose flags and those graves.\n  Many people today--I am not alone--believe we live in a culture that \nsuffers profoundly from a lack of common values, ideals, morals, and \npatriotism. Further, many people believe if it continues, that, in and \nof itself, will destroy the constitutional Government that we have.\n  I will make this suggestion with all due respect. That kind of action \nand that kind of lack of statement or commitment to values will bring \nour country down a lot sooner than an amendment to the Constitution \nthat prevents the desecration of our flag.\n  My colleagues, an amendment doesn't mean the end of our \nconstitutional Republic. It reinforces. It says this Senate, this \ncountry, this Congress, the people of America, the legislatures, your \nparents, their parents, and people all across America say: You don't do \nthat. It is wrong. It can mean that our country may not survive with \nthis kind of disrespect.\n  The idea that everyone's viewpoint is just as good as anyone's can \ngrow just a little bit too large. Is that free speech? Is that what we \nwant to say in America, that it is free speech for two young people to \ngo into a cemetery where Civil War veterans are buried, take the flags \noff their graves, desecrate the flags, and desecrate the tombstones, \nand say it is OK, free speech? I say that is conduct. I don't think it \nhas one thing to do with speech. It is conduct, and it is conduct for \nwhich you should be held accountable.\n  The fact is, the founders of our country developed some ideas about \ngovernment that all Americans believe are the best, that all Americans \nfind some common ground upon the ideals for which this Nation was \nfounded--common ground, cement, glue--to bring us together. This \ndivides us in a way that goes right to the essence and to the heart of \nwhat our country stands for and what it is. Our flag, those flags, 87 \nof them on those graves, represent those ideals.\n  As much as our culture downplays our common beliefs--God knows we \nhear enough about it--everybody has a right to be a free spirit these \ndays; don't have anything in common; do what you want; instant \ngratification; you want to go desecrate a cemetery, go ahead; it is \njust free speech.\n  As much as our culture downplays those beliefs, it is our duty as \nAmericans--I am using the word ``duty''--to protect those beliefs and \nour duty to protect the one symbol that unites us. If you don't think \ndesecration of that flag threatens us, then maybe you had better take \nanother look.\n  It is our responsibility to ensure the integrity of our country and \nto say that there is at least one principle that unites our society. We \ndivide on every issue. You name it; we divide on it. There is somebody \nfor and somebody against everything we debate.\n  We need this amendment to say that our flag should be protected under \nthe law. It is not enough to say if somebody walked up here now--a \nstaff member, anyone--and took that flag, threw it on the floor and \nbegan to deface it, stomp on it, in the name of free speech that is OK. \nIt is not speech. I will say again. It is not speech. It is conduct, \nand conduct you should be responsible for and responsible to someone \nfor doing it. If we can't say that, if it is a threat to our \nconstitutional Republic to have an amendment that precludes that \naction, then I am not sure what we could have a constitution for that \nreally matters.\n\n  We have survived amendments that weren't that great. The Constitution \nsurvived, the people survived, the American Government survived, \nbecause the Founders gave us the opportunity, provided that for us in \nthe Constitution.\n  We see evidence of moral decay and a lack of standards all around. \nOur families are breaking down, our communities are divided, our \nleaders are not providing appropriate moral leadership for the American \npublic. Everyone knows what I am talking about--moral leadership comes \nfrom the White House. You can shake it off, you can say it doesn't \nmatter, there is no personal accountability, say whatever you want. The \nbottom line is, if you are going out for the weekend and you want to \nleave your 14-year-old daughter home, most of you say: I don't know if \nI want to leave her with the President of the United States. That is \npretty sad.\n  I will make people angry saying that, but we are dividing ourselves. \nWe have to stand for something. If we stand for something, we will \nstand up and be counted as a nation. If we don't stand for something, \nthen we stand for nothing.\n  We can laugh it off. We do it all the time. It is a gun's fault that \nchildren are dying. No, it is not the gun's fault the children are \ndying. The culture of death in this country is not about guns.\n  The desecration of the flag and all of the other things happening is \nabout us as a people. It is because we don't stand up often enough. If \nwe are threatened because we want an amendment to the Constitution to \nstop that, then we have a problem. We have moral decay in this country. \nWe are falling apart at the seams because people should be able to do \nwhat they want. There is no personal accountability.\n\n[[Page S1720]]\n\n Desecrate the graves, stomp the flag, disrespect the veteran. It is \nOK. Spit on the flag. That is OK, it is free speech.\n  Look at our culture. If you are a parent, look at movies to which \nyour kids have access. Look the at video games, look at the music, look \nat the TV. Our children are bombarded every day with messages of \nviolence, selfishness. The incidence of gun violence, particularly at \nour public schools, is a predictable result of a culture that is afraid \nto teach that certain ideas are right and certain ideas are wrong.\n  That is what this is about. It is wrong to desecrate the flag. Color \nit up any way you want, hide it any way you want, take another position \nand say the law is OK, I don't care. The point is, it is wrong to \ndesecrate the flag for the same reason it is wrong to overturn \ngravestones, it is wrong to be disrespectful to veterans, and it is \nwrong to leave your children alone and give them access to this kind of \nviolence. Frankly, it is wrong for some in society to give them access \nto that violence.\n  Why don't we do something about it? No, we have a right, they say, to \nbe free spirits.\n  Blame somebody else. It is not our fault. It must be the Government's \nfault, the church's fault, our minister's fault, the Senator's fault; \nit has to be somebody else's fault, not mine. It couldn't possibly be \nmy fault; I didn't do anything.\n  Do you see what is happening to this country? This is just a perfect \nexample of it. It is one symbol of what is wrong with America.\n  From the 1800s and the 1900s, wave after wave after wave of \nimmigrants came to this country; they built this country. It was the \nglue. They saw the Statue of Liberty. They became a part of the essence \nof America. That flag is the essence of America. We ought to pass a \nconstitutional amendment so it not be desecrated.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield whatever time the Senator from North Dakota \nmay desire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I thank Senator McConnell.\n  Madam President, I rise today to support the McConnell-Bennett-\nDorgan-Conrad effort to pass a statute to protect the flag, rather than \nto amend the Constitution of the United States for that purpose.\n  It seems to me that anybody who advances an amendment to the \nConstitution has to clear a very high threshold. I personally believe \nthe Constitution of the United States is one of the greatest documents \nin human history. It is not to be amended lightly. It is certainly not \nto be amended when there are other ways of addressing a problem.\n  I believe in this circumstance the issue is really quite clear. Flag \nburning and flag desecration are unacceptable to me and I think \nunacceptable to a majority of Americans, certainly unacceptable to the \npeople of the State that I represent. But the first answer cannot and \nshould not be to amend the Constitution of the United States.\n  In our history, more than 10,000 amendments to the Constitution have \nbeen proposed. Only 27 have been approved. Since I have been in the \nSenate, more than 850 constitutional amendments have been offered. \nThank goodness we have not adopted them. Many of them would have made \nthat document worse. Many of them would have taken positions that are \nreally things that ought to be done by statute.\n  The Constitution is a framework. It does not deal with specifics. It \ndeals with the larger framework of how this Government should operate. \nIndividual laws, individual statutes are meant to deal with the \nspecific problems that we encounter as a society within the framework \nprovided by the Constitution. Some would have us change that basic \norganic document to deal with this problem. I believe that would be a \nmistake, and we would look back on it in future years and say: My, that \nwas an overreaction.\n  Yes, it is unacceptable to engage in flag desecration. Yes, it is \nabhorrent to desecrate the flag. Those are obviously true statements \nand those are genuine feelings. But we have an alternative. The \nalternative is to pass a statute.\n  The proponents of the constitutional amendment will say to you: But \nthat will be ruled unconstitutional, as has the previous attempt to \npass a statute.\n  This statute has not been ruled unconstitutional, and the American \nLaw Division of the Library of Congress tells us it would be upheld as \nconstitutional.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the American Law \nDivision addressed to me be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 1995.\n     To: Honorable Kent Conrad Attention: Dan Kelly\n     From: American Law Division\n     Subject: Analysis of S. 1335, the Flag Protection and Free \n         Speech Act of 1995\n       This memorandum is furnished in response to your request \n     for an analysis of the constitutionality of S. 1335, the Flag \n     Protection and Free Speech Act of 1995. This bill would amend \n     18 U.S.C. Sec. 700 to criminalize the destruction or damage \n     of a United States flag under three circumstances. First, \n     subsection (a) of the new Sec. 700 would penalize such \n     conduct when the person engaging in it does so with the \n     primary purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent \n     violence or a breach of the peace and in circumstances where \n     the person knows it is reasonably likely to produce imminent \n     violence or a breach of the peace.\n       Second, subsection (b) would punish any person who steals \n     or knowingly converts to his or her use, or to the use of \n     another, a United States flag belonging to the United States \n     and who intentionally destroys or damages that flag. Third, \n     subsection (c) punishes any person who, within any lands \n     reserved for the use of the United States or under the \n     exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction of the United States, \n     steals or knowingly converts to his or her use, or to the use \n     of another, a flag of the United States belonging to another \n     person and who intentionally destroys or damages that flag.\n       The bill appears intended to offer protection for the flag \n     of the United States in circumstances under which statutory \n     protection may still be afforded after the decisions of the \n     Supreme Court in United States v. Eichman \\1\\ and Texas v. \n     Johnson.\\2\\ These cases had established the principles that \n     flag desecration or burning, in a political protest context, \n     is expressive conduct if committed to ``send a message;'' \n     that the Court would review limits on this conduct with \n     exacting scrutiny; and legislation that proposed to penalize \n     the conduct in order to silence the message or out of \n     disagreement with the message violates the First Amendment \n     speech clause.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of analysis.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Subsections (b) and (c) appear to present no constitutional \n     difficulties, based on judicial precedents, either facially \n     or as applied. These subsections are restatements of other \n     general criminal prohibitions with specific focus on the \n     flag.\\3\\ The Court has been plain that one may be prohibited \n     from exercising expressive conduct or symbolic speech with or \n     upon the converted property of others or by trespass upon the \n     property of another.\\4\\ The subsections are directed \n     precisely to the theft or conversion of a flag belonging to \n     someone else, the government or a private party, and the \n     destruction of or damage to that flag.\n       Almost as evident from the Supreme Court's precedents, \n     subsection (a) is quite likely to pass constitutional muster. \n     The provision's language is drawn from the ``fighting words'' \n     doctrine of Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire.\\5\\ In that case the \n     Court defined a variety of expression that was unprotected by \n     the First Amendment, among the categories being speech that \n     inflicts injury or tends to incite immediate violence.\\6\\ \n     While the Court over the years has modified the other \n     categories listed in Chaplinsky, it has not departed from the \n     holding that the ``fighting words'' exception continues to \n     exist. It has, of course, laid down some governing \n     principles, which are reflected in the subsection's language. \n     Thus, the Court has applied to ``fighting words'' the \n     principle of Brandenburg v. Ohio,\\7\\ under which speech \n     advocating unlawful action may be punished only if it is \n     directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and \n     is likely to incite or produce such action.\\8\\\n       A second principle, enunciated in an opinion demonstrating \n     this continuing vitality of the ``fighting words'' doctrine, \n     is that it is impermissible to punish only those ``fighting \n     words'' of which government disapproves. Government may not \n     distinguish between classes of ``fighting words'' on an \n     ideological basis.\\9\\\n\n[[Page S1721]]\n\n       Subsection (a) reflects both these principles. It requires \n     not only that the conduct be reasonably likely to produce \n     imminent violence or breach of the peace, but that the person \n     intend to bring about imminent violence or breach of the \n     peace. Further, nothing in the subsection draws a distinction \n     between approved or disapproved expression that is \n     communicated by the action committed with or on the flag.\n       There is a question which should be noted concerning this \n     subsection. There is no express limitation of the application \n     of the provision to acts on lands under Federal jurisdiction, \n     neither is there any specific connection to flags or persons \n     that have been in interstate commerce. Therefore, application \n     of this provision to actions which do not have either of \n     these, or some other Federal nexus, might well be found to be \n     beyond the power of Congress under the decision of the Court \n     in United States v. Lopez.\\10\\\n       In conclusion, the judicial precedents establish that the \n     bill, if enacted, while not reversing Johnson, and Eichman, \n     should survive constitutional attack on First Amendment \n     grounds. Subsections (b) and (c) are more securely grounded \n     in constitutional law, but subsection (a) is only a little \n     less anchored in decisional law.\n       We hope this information is responsive to your request.

Madam President, here we have the American Law Division \nof the Library of Congress, which houses the Congressional Research \nService, telling us this statute authored by Senator McConnell would be \nupheld as constitutional. That is the best advice we have available to \nus as Members of Congress. They are saying to us this statute would be \nupheld.\n  Why ever would we go out and amend the Constitution when we have a \nstatute that our own legal advisers inform us would be upheld as \nConstitutional. Why would we do that? It makes no sense to me. Not only \ndoes it make no sense to me, it makes no sense to veterans \norganizations. I ask unanimous consent that resolutions of support by \nveterans organizations in the State of North Dakota be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, these are resolutions in support of the \nFlag Protection Act of 1999 by AMVETS of North Dakota, by the AMVETS \nLadies Auxiliary of North Dakota, and by the North Dakota State Council \nof the Vietnam Veterans of America. All of these veterans \norganizations, some of the finest in my State, have said this is the \nproper approach; that we ought to attempt to pass this statute rather \nthan amend the Constitution of the United States.\n  I just got word, moments ago, that the editor of the 164th Infantry \nAssociation Newsletter, of my State, has contacted my office and agrees \nwith the position that I am taking, that it is not necessary to amend \nthe Constitution of the United States.\n  I think he is exactly right. I would just conclude by saying, not \nonly do veterans organizations back home support the position I am \ntaking, but many who are in the American Legion have contacted me and \ntold me they support the position that I am taking.\n  Finally, Gen. Colin Powell was quoted at length in a full page ad of \na major newspaper in my State today as saying that he does not believe \nthat the appropriate response is to amend the Constitution of the \nUnited States. Gen. Colin Powell, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, the man who led us in Desert Storm, a man for whom I have \nprofound respect, saying to us, yes, it is abhorrent to desecrate the \nflag, yes, it is abhorrent to burn the flag, but that flag is going to \nsurvive long after, as he describes it, these miscreants who desecrate \nthe flag are long gone. Long after they are gone, that flag is still \ngoing to be flying proudly over this great Nation.\n  One of the reasons this is a great Nation is because of the \nConstitution of the United States. What a brilliant document. I doubt \nvery much anything we are going to be doing in the next 2 days would \nimprove upon that Constitution that is the organic law for our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look--take a serious look --at the \nwork Senator McConnell has done and that the four of us, on a \nbipartisan basis, are offering our colleagues as an alternative to \ntaking the very drastic step of amending the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this approach.\n  I commend my colleagues who have joined in offering this--with a \nspecial thanks to Senator McConnell, who has drafted this approach--\nSenator Bennett, and Senator Dorgan.\n  I believe this is the wiser course. It is the right course. It is one \nthat will stand the test of time.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  AMVETS Ladies Auxiliary, Department of North Dakota, Resolution To \n              Support the ``Flag Protection Act of 1999''\n\n       Whereas: the delegates of the 15th Annual Convention of the \n     AMVETS Ladies Auxiliary, Department of North Dakota, \n     assembled in Minot on this 15th day of May, 1999, desire to \n     support Senator Dorgan and Senator Conrad on ``The Flag \n     Protection Act of 1999'' which they are co-sponsoring, \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved: We support the ``Flag Protection Act of 1999'' \n     for the protection of the flag, free speech, and other \n     purposes, to ensure our symbol of national pride and freedom \n     be protected, that the embodiment of our democracy and unity \n     be preserved, especially since our veterans fought for this \n     freedom, it further be\n       Resolved: That a copy of this courtesy resolution be spread \n     upon the records of this annual convention and a copy be \n     presented to the above mentioned.\n     Angie Lekander,\n       President.\n     Vickie Trimmer,\n       Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Vietnam Veterans of America,\n\n\n                                   North Dakota State Council,\n\n                                       Bismarck, ND, May 10, 1999.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: On behalf of the North Dakota State \n     Council of Vietnam Veterans of America, it is my honor to \n     inform you that at our quarterly meeting on May 8, 1999 in \n     Bismarck, the following action was taken regarding the Flag \n     Protection Act of 1999, which you are cosponsoring.\n       ``Bob Hanson moved that the North Dakota State Council of \n     the Vietnam Veterans of America support enactment of \n     legislation by Congress to protect the nation's flag, such as \n     that cosponsored by Senators Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad and \n     that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to our state's \n     entire Congressional delegation. Seconded by Richard Stark. \n     Approved unanimously.''\n       Thank you for continual support of veterans and we wish you \n     success in your endeavors in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bob Hanson,\n     State Secretary, ND VVA.\n                                  ____\n\n\nResolution No. 9911--A Resolution To Support the ``Flag Protection Act \n                               of 1999''\n\n       Whereas, a Constitutional amendment to protect the \n     desecration of the American flag has been before Congress for \n     several years and has failed to garner the votes for passage, \n     and\n       Whereas, those opposed to the Constitutional amendment \n     believe that a statute can effectively provide protection and \n     be upheld by the Supreme Court, and\n       Whereas, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has introduced \n     a statute, ``The Flag Protection Act of 1999'', cosponsored \n     by Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, Senator Byron Dorgan \n     of North Dakota, and Senator Bennett of Utah, and have been \n     assured by the Congressional Research Service and \n     constitutional scholars that it would be upheld by the \n     courts, and\n       Whereas, the AMVETS of North Dakota have consistently \n     supported a statutory remedy over a Constitutional amendment \n     at our annual conventions, now therefore be it\n       Resolved, that the AMVETS of North Dakota express \n     appreciation to Senators McConnell, Conrad, Dorgan and \n     Bennett and further supports the Flag Protection Act of 1999 \n     and urge the National Department to also support the Flag \n     Protection Act of 1999.\n\n       Submitted for consideration at the Department Convention by \n     the Department Commander.\n                                              Randall A.

The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota \nfor his outstanding remarks in support of\n\n[[Page S1722]]\n\nthe effort we have, on a bipartisan basis, put together to try to deal \nwith the flag desecration problem through statute rather than by \namending the first amendment to the United States Constitution for the \nfirst time in its 200-year history. It has been a pleasure working with \nthe distinguished Senator from North Dakota. I thank him for his \nsupport.\n  We hope all of our colleagues will take a look at a different \napproach to this problem when the vote occurs tomorrow afternoon.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield it back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I believe we are now about to move to the Hollings \namendment. Is that the next agenda item?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, \nstill controls 30 minutes of time which, under the previous order, was \nto occur prior to moving to the Hollings amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Are there 2 hours equally divided on the Hollings \namendment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I understand that the Senator from \nWest Virginia is not going to use that 30 minutes. So I am authorized \nto yield back that time. I yield back Senator Byrd's 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from South Carolina is to be \nrecognized to offer a first-degree amendment. Under the previous order, \nthere shall be 4 hours of debate on the amendment, equally divided, \nwith one of the 4 hours to be under the control of the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am prepared to yield the floor to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina and ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to have 30 \nminutes on this subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Thirty minutes when?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Whenever.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Out of the 2 hours that has been set aside?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. In the next hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Following Senator Hollings?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes. If we can finish in 1 hour.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2890\n\n  (Purpose: To propose an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n States relating to contributions and expenditures intended to affect \n                               elections)\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, has the amendment been reported?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is at the desk.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask that the clerk report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for \n     himself, Mr. Specter, and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2890.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, line 4, strike beginning with ``article'' \n     through line 10 and insert the following: ``articles are \n     proposed as amendments to the Constitution of the United \n     States, either or both of which shall be valid to all intents \n     and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the \n     legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within 7 \n     years after the date of submission for ratification:''.\n\n                             `` `Article --\n\n       `` `Section 1. Congress shall have power to set reasonable \n     limits on the amount of contributions that may be accepted, \n     and the amount of expenditures that may be made by, in \n     support of, or in opposition to, a candidate for nomination \n     for election to, or for election to, Federal office.\n       `` `Section 2. A State shall have power to set reasonable \n     limits on the amount of contributions that may be accepted \n     by, and the amount of expenditures that may be made by, in \n     support of, or in opposition to, a candidate for nomination \n     for election to, or for election to, State or local office.\n       `` `Section 3. Congress shall have power to implement and \n     enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\n\n                            ```Article--''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, this amendment is offered on behalf of \nmyself, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, and \nthe distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid.\n  Let me go right to the heart of some comments just made because I \nwant to emphasize what the distinguished Senator from North Dakota \nsaid.\n  One, with respect to the matter of actually passing a statute whereby \nthe statute would suffice, I only refer specifically, because I have \nbeen reading it at length, to the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in \nNixon v. Shrink, that for nearly a half century the Court has extended \nfirst amendment protection to a multitude of forms of speech, such as \nmaking false inflammatory statements, filing lawsuits, dancing nude, \nexhibiting drive-in movies with nudity, burning flags, and wearing \nmilitary uniforms. It goes on to cite even more examples.\n  That is why this Senator would not vote for the statute. I think that \nis dancing around the fire and a putoff. On the contrary, I intend to \nsupport the constitutional amendment. But I do agree with the \nobservation of the distinguished Senator from North Dakota that the \nConstitution should not be amended lightly, and, as the Senator stated, \nnot amended when there are other ways.\n  There is a definite difference between the matter of burning the \nflag--there is really no threat to the Republic. There is no threat to \nour democracy. There is no corruption. I do not like it; others do not \nlike it. I hope we can pass the amendment.\n  But there is basis for the concern that a constitutional amendment is \nnot in order because there is no threat to the Republic. We have seen \nand, unfortunately, been hardened in a sense to observing the flag \nbeing burned. I happen to be like the man: Convinced against his will \nis of the same opinion still. They can keep on saying that is \nconstitutional. I do not believe it.\n  I think an amendment to the Constitution is necessary. But only look \naround us. Where is everybody? Out raising money. The Senator from \nSouth Carolina is not charging that an individual is bribed. I know of \nno bribes. That is not my argument.\n  My argument and position is that this Congress, the process, and the \nGovernment have been corrupted by the money chase. We all know the \namount of money. But all you have to do is have been around here for \n30-some years and you get the feel, very definitely, that the money \nchase has taken over and we are thoroughly corrupted.\n  I say that because here it is Monday. It is really a wash day. There \nare no votes. There is nobody here to hear you. This is no deliberative \nbody. That is really a nasty joke on all of us because we do not \ndeliberate anymore. I remember over 30 years ago when we would come in \non Monday morning and work all day, have votes at 9 o'clock on Monday \nmorning, go throughout Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and hope \nto get through by 5 on Friday and take Saturday and Sunday off and go \nback to work on Monday. But we start the week here with no votes, \nnobody around, no deliberation, no exchange of ideas, no legislation, \njust a sort of fill-in so you can give those who are concerned their \ntime at bat, limited as it is, because it is only half time. Nobody is \nhere to listen, so you can learn the fallacy in your arguments or the \nsubstance thereof. But there is no really good exchange out here by the \nMembers themselves. Monday is gone, and Tuesday morning follows suit \nbecause we have to wait for everybody to get back from their Monday \nevening fundraisers. Then we have Tuesday afternoon, Wednesday, \nThursday, and Friday is gone.\n\n  If you don't think it is corrupted, go up and ask the majority \nleader, if you please, to take up a bill. ``Oh'', he says, ``wait a \nminute, that might take 3 or 4 days.'' It's a given, that you are not \ngoing to call a bill that is going to take 3 or 4 days of consideration \nand debate by colleagues. It is not going to be called. Nothing is \ncalled unless the jury is fixed.\n  Why haven't we taken up the budget? Because they haven't been able to \nfix the vote of the Senator from Texas. They fixed all the others. They \ngot them in line. I don't know what their budget is. There has been \ngive and take\n\n[[Page S1723]]\n\namong the members on the Budget Committee on the Republican side, but \nwe on the Democratic side have yet to see a budget, even though it is \nthe end of March. We are supposed to have had the markup for several \nweeks and be ready to report it out by this weekend. We do have notice, \nbut you can bet your boots if we come together tomorrow afternoon and \nThursday, they will use Thursday night and the threat of, ``wait a \nminute, you will have to work on Friday, so hurry up, let's vote until \n1 o'clock in the morning,'' whatever it is, because none of your \namendments is going to pass; we have the votes.\n  That is the most deliberative process. That is the corruption the \nmoney chase has gotten us into. You can't consider anything here. Come \nTuesday, they say, ``well, we will have a caucus.'' In the main, that \nis about money and how we are going to collect it, and how we will dock \neach other so many thousands of dollars, and who has been to meetings, \nand everything else of that kind. Otherwise, come evening, ``hurry up \nand let's adjourn early because I have a fundraiser Tuesday evening.'' \nOr, on Wednesday we have a window. ``Can we make sure; I have to go all \nthe way downtown at lunchtime, so let's not have any real conduct of \nthe Senate or work of the Congress because I want a window so we can go \ndown and have that fundraiser; or wait until the evening.'' The same \nthing occurs on Thursday.\n  By the way, there is a special Wednesday afternoon set up where we \nare supposed to go over to our campaign committees and get on the phone \nfor hours in the afternoon. To do what? To call for money. I thought \nwhen we got elected, the campaign was over and we were going to work \nfor the people. Instead, we go to work for ourselves. The entire \nprocess has been corrupted. That is why we need a constitutional \namendment.\n  No, not likely. We have tried for 25 years to get around Buckley v. \nValeo. We got a little squeak from Justice Stevens in the Nixon v. \nShrink decision. He said: Money is property, not speech. But he was \nonly one. The rest of the Court, in other words, had every opportunity \nto consider it being property and not speech, but they reiterated Nixon \nv. Shrink, that money is speech. My gracious, if you read that \ndissenting opinion with Scalia and the other two Justices, they read it \nto go with removing the limits on contributions. Just buy it. This \nthing is a real disaster; it is an embarrassment.\n  Just coming on the floor, they called my staff and said: Why in the \nworld would you want to amend the Constitution here but not with the \nflag? Well, of course, I corrected that. I would amend the Constitution \nwith the flag. But those who have some concern about the flag amendment \nto the Constitution need not hesitate with respect to this particular \namendment. Otherwise, they have been living in a cocoon somewhere, or \nthey have been in China during the last campaign, because all you have \nto do is look at the primaries and see that the one thing, whether it \nwas Independent, Democratic, Republican or any other kind of votes, \nthat they were trying to clean up this system.\n\n  Senator Gore, Vice President Gore, got the message. He said: The \nfirst thing I will do as President of the United States is introduce \nMcCain-Feingold and do away with soft money.\n  Governor George W. Bush said that was a terrible thing. I read that \nin the news. But I remembered back to January 23, in his interview with \nGeorge Will, when Governor Bush said soft money, both corporate and \nlabor, should be banned. I agree. But I will have to agree with the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky that it is patently \nunconstitutional according to the Court. All we are trying to do is \nconstitutionalize McCain-Feingold or any and every other idea you want, \nwhether you want to publicly finance, whether you want to give free TV \ntime, whether you want to limit, whether you want to not limit, whether \nyou want to increase the limit--whatever you want to do. Don't give me \nthe argument on this one because this only constitutionalizes your \nparticular idea.\n  Let me read exactly what it says:\n\n       Congress shall have the power to set reasonable limits on \n     the amount of contributions that may be accepted by, and the \n     amount of expenditures that may be made by, in support of, or \n     in opposition to, a candidate for nomination for election to, \n     or for the election to, Federal office.\n\n  We have had this up for over 10 years, Senator Specter and myself. I \nhave had it up for over 20 years. I can tell you, the States in \nunanimity, the Governors' conference and all, came and said: Please put \nus in. We have the same problem, not just for Federal office but for \nState office. It is costing $1 million to get elected to the city \ncouncil. It has corrupted the entire process over the land, and \neverybody knows it.\n  Section 2--this is why we added it--\n\n       A State shall have power to set reasonable limits on the \n     amount of contributions that may be accepted by, and the \n     amount of expenditures that may be made by, in support of, or \n     in opposition to, a candidate for nomination for election to, \n     or for election to, State or local office.\n\n  Of course, Congress is empowered to implement and enforce the article \nby appropriate legislation.\n  That is a very simple amendment. You can bet your boots it is far \nmore important at this particular hour of our history. The 27th \namendment has to do with our pay. Well, it is certainly more important \nthan the Fed raising his pay because if he votes that way, they are \ngoing to jump all over him at the next election. So they didn't even \nneed this. This was just puffing and blowing and demonstrating and \nflagellating. That is all we have been doing up here this year. We \nfigured as long as we could put the people off and sneak back in, we \ncould get the money to buy the time to buy the office.\n  The 22nd amendment, Presidential term limits. More important than \nthat. The 23rd amendment, D.C. electoral votes. This is more \nimportant--this particular corruption to be corrected. The elimination \nof the poll tax, the 24th amendment, and the 25th amendment, \nPresidential succession. The 26th amendment, giving 18-year-olds the \nright to vote. You have taken away the vote of all the people, not just \nthe 18-year-olds.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this short article be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 19, 2000]\n\n                               Pander Gap\n\n                           (By Richard Morin)\n\n       This may be really hard to believe: Neither Congress nor \n     the President panders to public opinion. And they don't craft \n     policy to match the latest poll numbers, either.\n       You scoff. But those are the claims of two political \n     scientists who have documented the gap between what Americans \n     say they want and what their politicians deliver. ``We have \n     found a dramatic decline of political responsiveness to the \n     wishes and preferences of the public on major policy \n     decisions in at least the past 20 years,'' assert Lawrence R. \n     Jacobs of the University of Minnesota and Robert Y. Shapiro \n     of Columbia University in their forthcoming book, \n     ``Politicians Don't Pander.''\n       The researchers tracked Americans' views on a range of \n     political issues and compared them with the relevant \n     legislation that Congress eventually approved. Twenty years \n     ago, lawmakers did what a majority of Americans wanted about \n     two-thirds of the time, they found. Today, Congress is on the \n     same page with the public only about 40 percent of the time. \n     This growing disconnect, the authors argue, is at the heart \n     of America's mistrust of politicians, government and the \n     political process.\n       The reputation that President Clinton has developed for \n     governing by poll isn't accurate, the contend. Certainly, \n     Clinton and other politicians do a lot of polling, but not to \n     make policy; instead, the authors say, the surveys are used \n     to figure out how to sell policies that have already been \n     constructed (much as market researchers convene focus groups \n     and sponsor surveys to find new ways to get you to buy soap).\n       Rather than hewing to the demands of voters, the \n     researchers say, today's lawmakers answer to ``the extreme \n     ideological elements of their parties, to their contributors, \n     and to special interests.'' They say the split between \n     politicians and the people accelerated in the 1990s, as \n     Congress became increasingly partisan.\n       In their book, Jacobs and Shapiro offer two revealing case \n     studies of how the sausage is really made in Washington. The \n     first was the failed Clinton health care plan; the second was \n     the ``Contract With America,'' led by former House speaker \n     Newt Gingrich. These peeks inside the process included \n     interviews with dozens of policymakers as well as access to \n     reams of memorandums and policy drafts.\n       ``Our research showed that public opinion played no role, \n     or [was] secondary at best,'' Jacobs said, `We don't trust \n     public opinion. . . . Constituencies are important to us.' ''\n       Remarkably, Jacobs said, Republicans told them ``much the \n     same thing, sometimes using nearly the same words.'' Partisan \n     concerns, special interest pleadings and narrow\n\n[[Page S1724]]\n\n     ideological concerns consistently trumped the vox pop. ``What \n     a majority of Americans really wanted was never a driving \n     factor,'' he said.\n       Jacobs says he's not suggesting that politicians should \n     march in lock step with the polls. ``There are times, like \n     Nixon's opening to China, when politicians should disregard \n     public opinion. But it should be part of a larger discussion \n     about why the public will is being ignored. These should be \n     the exceptions.''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. This is entitled ``Pander Gap.'' We are not pandering \nto the people. We have taken away the votes of all the people, not just \nthe 18-year-olds. The survey is used to figure out this so-called \npolling. They say we followed the polls. I am quoting this part of it:\n\n       . . . the surveys are used to figure out how to sell \n     policies that have already been constructed (much as market \n     researchers convene focus groups and sponsor surveys to find \n     new ways to get you to buy soap).\n       Rather than hewing to the demands of voters . . . today's \n     lawmakers answer to ``the extreme ideological elements of \n     their parties, to their contributors, and to special \n     interests.''\n\n  In short, to money, money, money, millions and millions. The year \nbefore last I was supposed to run a race in South Carolina on about $3 \nmillion at the most. I had to spend $5.5 million. Since the South has \ngone Republican, it made it more difficult. With two Republican \nSenators from Alabama, two from Mississippi, two from Texas, two from \nTennessee, it seems everywhere I look, I've got Republicans buzzing \naround me.\n  I am not critical because I got a lot of good Republican votes. I am \ngrateful for the Republicans who did vote for me. But, in essence, it \nwas tough to get those contributions because they didn't want their \nnames to appear, and then go to the club and have to explain why in the \nworld they contributed to that scoundrel Hollings? They were ready to \ngive me the money, but they could not. So I had to travel the land and \ntell my story. I was lucky. They gave me a rather hard-working fellow \nas an opponent who was all over the place. Didn't know what he was \ntalking about, about the polls and everything, and trying to take a \nfellow who had been in office almost 50 years, and being arrogant about \nit. You can't be arrogant and get elected seven times to the Senate. I \ncan tell you that. You respond to the people, and I happily do so. I am \nresponding to the people of this country.\n  I am not amending the Constitution lightly. I will yield in a moment \nto give my colleague from Alabama time. Let's hearken back to 1971 and \n1974, the Federal Election Campaign Practices Act. I will never forget \nin the 1968 race, Maurice Stans was running around almost like the \nChamber of Commerce. He told various businesses: Your fair share is \nthis. He came to the textile industry in South Carolina and said it is \n$350,000. This was 30-some years ago. They had never raised $350,000 \nfor this fellow, and I had done everything in the world for the textile \nindustry. They got together 10 of them with $35,000 apiece.\n  What happened was individuals gave a million, or $500,000, $2 \nmillion, different amounts in cash. And it so happened that after \nPresident Nixon had taken office, the Secretary of Treasury, John \nConnolly came to the President and said: Mr. President, a lot of people \nhave given you a lot of money. You haven't met them, you haven't shaken \ntheir hands, you haven't been able to thank them. I think it would be \nin order for you to come down to the ranch. I will put it on at the \nranch.\n  Nixon said: Fine business, that's what we will do.\n  A few weeks later, they turned into the ranch. But as they turned \ninto the ranch in Texas, there was old Dick Tuck with the Brinks \ntruck--you know the prankster from the Kennedy years. My heavens, the \nGovernment was up for sale. We were all embarrassed, Republican and \nDemocrat. We got to the floor and presented the 1974 Campaign Practices \nAct--we said to our friend, the Senator from Massachusetts: You can't \nbuy it. We looked over there to the Senator from New York, Mr. Buckley \nand he said: You can't tell me. I am going to buy it. We passed it with \nan overwhelming bipartisan majority. But Senator Buckley then sued the \nSecretary of the Senate and took it all the way to the Supreme Court. \nThat is where we got this distortion which causes the corruption. It \nwas by one vote, 5-4.\n\n  If you want to raid the erudite decisions on this particular matter, \nread Justice White and Justice Marshall in the dissenting opinion. They \nforesaw this corruption in the process, where we can't get anything \ndone, where we have the unmitigated gall to stand up and say: I am \ngoing to buy this office. Of course, they say: Freedom of speech; \nfreedom of speech. Nobody is listening to that. I never thought the day \nwould come when they would stand on the floor and proudly say, ``I am \ngoing to buy the office,'' or a particular party would come and say, \n``We are going to buy the Presidency.'' That is exactly what they have \ndone. The Republican Party said: Get out of the way, Steve Forbes, and \nall the rest of you; we are going to get our candidate, Governor Bush \ndown in Texas, and we are going to raise him $70 million. He has \nalready spent $63 million, and it is only March. We have almost 7 or 8 \nmonths to go before the election. They are not worried about that. We \njust never did think.\n  I can see Senator Long of Louisiana. Every mother's son ought to be \nable to run for the Presidency. That is why we have the checkoff on the \nincome tax return and the matching funds for those who qualify. We \nthought that was good and plenty. But they spent, by the first of \nMarch, $63 million, and they will spend another $63 million very \neasily. That crowd has an investment.\n  If I were going to run for the Presidency, I would run on one \nparticular message: Let the people of America know here and now this \noffice is not for sale. That ought to be a fundamental Americanism--\nthat you can't buy the office.\n  Now, we have several in the body who had millions in their campaigns \nand have gotten to the Senate. I will say in the same breath, I look at \nthem and their service, and they would have done the same without the \nmillions, but they did spend millions to get here. That is the kind of \nbody we are turning it into more and more each year. You can't consider \nanything. You can't debate anything. You can't take time to speak to \nyour colleagues. It is a veritable money chase. That is exactly why we \nare not doing anything this year. It is the year 2000, the year that \nthe U.S. Congress squats and does nothing. There is an old political \naxiom: When in doubt, do nothing, and stay in doubt all the time. That \nreelects a lot of people. That is what we are motivated by on this \nparticular afternoon.\n\n  I am going into the details of the amendment again out of necessity \nand will emphasize why we need a constitutional amendment, because we \nhave tried it every other way. The Court has found, more and more, free \nspeech implications in any and all legislation. Unless we can amend the \nConstitution to extract this cancer and this corruption from the body \npolitic, we are goners. I can tell you that democracy is gone.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlabama is recognized for up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I always enjoy the remarks of the \nSenator from South Carolina. I am glad he doesn't speak with an accent. \nI can understand him better than most around this body. He is a \nstraight shooter and a skilled lawyer who understands what the legal \nsystem is about and what we are doing in the Senate. I respect that.\n  I respect his conclusion, which I believe is legally sound, that most \nof the campaign proposals which have been proposed in recent years run \nafoul of the Constitution, according to a majority of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. That is a fact. I believe that is a good fact.\n  Some would say: Well, you want to limit free speech when you want to \nstop burning the flag and you want to prohibit that and that is free \nspeech. The Supreme Court, by a 5-4 majority, held that the act of \nburning a flag is free speech. I don't agree with that. In 1971, the \nSupreme Court didn't agree with that. For over 200 years they didn't \nagree with that. Over 40 States have laws against it.\n  When it passed this time recently, it was a 5-4 majority. But in my \nview, the flag of the United States is a unique object and prohibiting \nits desecration will not in any way fundamentally alter the free \nexpression of ideas in this country. You can speak about why the\n\n[[Page S1725]]\n\nflag ought to be burned and that sort of thing, but we know the act of \nit is different from speech. It seems to me if it is speech, and if the \nCourt is correct in saying it is speech, then the people of the United \nStates care deeply about protecting the flag. They have an avenue to \nadopt a restricted, narrow constitutional amendment that doesn't in any \nway jeopardize the ability of our people in this country to speak \nfreely but would allow States to prohibit the burning of a flag. That \nis what I think we ought to do.\n  I think it would be healthy for this country to adopt a \nconstitutional amendment that would allow the protection of the flag \nbecause people on the battlefield have died for that flag. More Medals \nof Honor have been awarded for preserving and fighting to preserve the \nflag than any other. We know the stories of battle when time after time \nthe soldier carrying the flag is the target of the enemy. When he fell, \nanother one would pick it up. When he fell, another one would pick it \nup. When he fell, another one would pick it up. That is the history.\n  We pledge allegiance to the flag, not the Constitution, not the \nDeclaration of Independence. We pledge allegiance to the flag because \nit is a unifying event. It is a unifying symbol for America, and having \na special protection for it is quite logical for me. I do not believe \nwe should never amend the Constitution. I do not think we amend the \nConstitution enough. But we want to have good amendments that are \nnecessary, that are important, that enrich us, and that make us a \nstronger nation. I support that.\n  With regard to the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina, I \nrespect his honesty and his direct approach. I think by his amendment \nhe recognizes in the most fundamental sense that when you constrain the \nright of people in this country to come together, raise money, and \nspeak out on an issue that they care deeply about, you are indeed \naffecting independent thought, free debate, and freedom of speech.\n  The Constitution of the United States says Congress shall make no law \nabridging the freedom of speech.\n\n  I am really surprised to look at this amendment. It goes in just the \nopposite way. It says Congress shall have the power to place reasonable \nlimits. So right away we are amending the first amendment. We are \nsaying Congress shall have the power to place reasonable limits on the \namount of contributions that may be made and accepted, and the amount \nof expenditures made by and in support of or in opposition to a \ncandidate for office in the United States, State and Federal--the two \nclauses of this amendment. We are saying incumbent politicians in this \nbody ought to be seeking to encourage laws that would prohibit people \nfrom gathering together and raising funds and speaking out. The Senator \nsaid we want a constitutional amendment because it will allow any other \nthing you want to do, whatever you want. He said it will allow that in \nterms of campaign finance. That is a scary thing to me--whatever we \nwant.\n  What do incumbents want? They want many times to keep down debate. \nThey want to keep from the people the errors they may have made, or the \nacts they have carried out with which the people do not agree. Many \ntimes the only way we can ever know what the truth is, is for people \nwho care about those issues to raise money and speak out against it.\n  I feel very strongly about this. I think this is a major event. If \nthe flag amendment is a 1 on a constitutional scale, this Hollings \namendment is a 9 or a 10. It is the first time in the history of this \ncountry I know of where we have submitted a constitutional amendment \nthat does not increase our freedom, our liberties, and our ability to \nact and speak as we choose. It will be the first time I know of where \nwe are proposing a constitutional amendment that would clearly dampen, \nreduce, and control the free rights of American citizens to speak out \non issues they care deeply about.\n  The Cato Foundation, a conservative think tank, and the ACLU, a \nliberal group, are horrified at the very thought of this.\n  This is basic constitutional law. We are talking about restricting \nthe right of people to run advertisements during a campaign season to \nsay why they care about issues. What more is free speech about?\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist, in talking about the flag burning, said, \n``At best, burning a flag is a grunt or a roar.'' It is not really \nspeech at all, if you consider it some sort of expression, which I \nthink is a stretch. But even then, you consider it inarticulate speech. \nThat is not of great value compared to the unifying symbol of the flag.\n  But when you talk about taking away the right of American citizens to \nrun ads on television, to buy newspapers, to print handbills and pass \nthem out, and to say they can't do that; why? Well, you just can't do \nit during an election cycle. When do you want to speak out? What good \nis it if you do not want to do it during an election cycle?\n  I do not want to use all the time I have. We have two excellent \nscholars who care deeply about this issue who wanted to speak before I \ngot unanimous consent. I don't want to take their time.\n  I will just say this before I yield the floor and ask that my time be \ngiven back to them.\n  We do not need to be retreating from freedom. We do not need to be \nretreating from free debate. We do not need to be adopting a \nconstitutional amendment that will allow our children and grandchildren \nnot to rise up, raise money, and speak out and condemn a group of \nincumbents who they believe are not doing the right thing in America. \nSometimes that is the only way you can get the message out.\n  Frankly, I am not one of those who believes our national news media \nis fair. I think it is ludicrous to expect and to suggest they are fair \nand objective. They are clearly, in my view, biased toward big \ngovernment and liberal activity.\n  I am not going to say I am going to subject my campaigns to constant \nreinterpretation of what I do to some media outlet that may get worse \nthan it is today. Apparently, they have unlimited rights to run their \nprograms every day and call it ``news'' if they want to. Somebody who \nhas a different view cannot raise money, buy time on their program, and \nrebut that?\n  This is fundamental stuff. This is right to the core of what the \nfirst amendment was all about. The first amendment is about intelligent \ndebate, argument, concern over policy issues--not whether or not you \nhave a ``grunt'' or a ``roar'' in burning a flag. I don't believe that \nwas ever intended to be covered by the Constitution.\n  If so, we don't need to go in this direction. It is one of the most \nadverse steps we could take. It would be an error of colossal \nproportions if this Senate were to vote to amend the great charter of \nfreedom, the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States, \nout of some vain, hopeless effort that we are going to suppress the \nright of free American citizens to raise money and speak out on what \nthey believe in.\n  I am prepared to vote on reasonable controls on campaign funding as \nlong as it can pass constitutional muster. I believe fundamentally our \nbest protection is to allow people to speak; if people give money, \ndisclose how much money they give, and let everybody know promptly and \nimmediately. If the public knows where the money is coming from, they \nmay judge the value of the ads.\n  In my Republican primary 3 years ago for the Senate, I had eight \nopponents. They spent $5 million among them. I spent $1 million. Two of \nmy opponents spent more than $1 million of their own money. I had to \nraise every dime I could raise, some $900,000. I worked hard, and I won \nthe race. John Connolly, mentioned earlier, spent more money per vote \nthan any man, and he got clobbered. Other senatorial candidates have \nspent tens of millions of dollars and have been clobbered in races.\n  I do not believe money always tells the tale. It was difficult for me \nwhen I faced the guy spending $1.5 million of his own money on a \nRepublican primary in Alabama, but that is the way it is. I do not see \nhow I can tell that person he cannot spend that money and express what \nhe believes and cares about in that election about why he would be an \noutstanding candidate.\n  Many gave to me because they believed I could be an effective voice \nfor their concerns. That is what America is all about. I don't believe \nit corrupts politicians. I believe it sucks them into\n\n[[Page S1726]]\n\nthe system and makes them be participants. They speak, run ads, and \nattack, sometimes, unfairly. If we can figure out a way to do a better \njob of disclosing how this money is spent and from whom it comes, I \nthink that will help the public.\n  I appreciate the leadership of Senators Bennett and McConnell, who \nare scholars on these issues. I believe the Senate should do well to \nlisten to them. I agree with the Senator from South Carolina, this is \nreally important. More Senators need to be paying attention to this \ncrucial issue in our Nation's history.\n  I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Alabama, who has faithfully \nparticipated in the campaign finance debates in the years he has been \nhere, always very skillfully. I am sure some of the things I will say \nwill be repetitious because he was right on the mark in his \nobservations about the Hollings amendment.\n  It is important to note at the beginning of the debate, the last time \nwe had a vote on the Hollings amendment was March 18, 1997. Only 38 \nSenators voted for the Hollings amendment, an effort to amend the first \namendment for the first time in the 200-year history of our country, \nrestricting avenues of political speech. Only 38 of the 100 Senators \nbelieve it necessary, no matter what our views on the various campaign \nfinance proposals before the Senate, to carve a chunk out of the first \namendment to give the Government this kind of truly draconian power to \ncontrol everybody's speech.\n  I know Senator Feingold of McCain-Feingold fame is also going to \noppose this amendment. I note that the Washington Post, with which I \nhave essentially never been aligned with on a campaign finance issue, \nalso opposes this amendment.\n  With due respect to the Senator from South Carolina, he has framed \nthe issue correctly by pointing out that in order to do what many of \nthe so-called reformers have tried to do, you do need to amend the \nfirst amendment. Of course, that is a terrible idea, I respectfully \nsuggest.\n  The campaign finance debate is all about constitutional freedom. Soft \nmoney, hard money, issue advocacy, express advocacy, PACs, independent \nexpenditures, bundling, and the other terms of art in the campaign \nfinance debate are euphemisms for freedoms of speech and association \nprotections under the first amendment to our Constitution, freedoms \nbelonging to citizens groups, candidates, and parties. It is no more \ncomplicated than that.\n  The measure before the Senate, the Hollings constitutional amendment \nto empower the Federal and 50 State governments to restrict all \ncontributions and expenditures ``by, in support of, or in opposition to \nFederal and State candidates,'' illustrates this simple fact \nbeautifully and succinctly. The Hollings amendment is a blunt \ninstrument. Where a statutory approach such as a Shays-Meehan or \nMcCain-Feingold and their ilk slices and dices at this freedom--a cut \nhere, an evisceration there--the Hollings amendment reaches out and \nrips the heart right out of the first amendment.\n  Before this week is out, we could be on our way to getting rid of the \nfirst amendment protection for everyone except pornographers. But I \nrather enjoy this debate. No pretense, no artifice, no question about \nit: If you believe that the Government, Federal and State, ought to \nhave the unchecked power to restrict all contributions and spending \n``by, in support of, or in opposition to Federal and State \ncandidates,'' then, by all means, vote for the Hollings amendment. If \nyou believe that the U.S. Supreme Court should be taken out of the \ncampaign finance equation, then the Hollings constitutional amendment \nis for you.\n  If the Hollings amendment had been in place 25 years ago, there would \nhave been no Buckley decision; Congress would have gotten its way. \nIndependent expenditures would be capped at $1,000. Any issue advocacy \nthat the FEC deemed capable of influencing elections would be capped at \n$1,000. Everyone would be under mandatory spending limits. There would \nbe no taxpayer funding. It would not be necessary because spending \nlimits would not have to be voluntary.\n  That is why the American Civil Liberties Union counsel, Joel Gora, \nwho was part of the legal team in the Buckley case, has called the \nHollings constitutional amendment a ``recipe for repression.''\n  The media, news and entertainment industries, ought to take note. \nThere is no exemption for them in the Hollings constitutional \namendment, no media loophole. Under the Hollings constitutional \namendment, the Federal and State governments could regulate, restrict, \neven prohibit the media's own issue advocacy, independent expenditures, \nand contributions just as long as the restrictions were deemed \nreasonable.\n  What we have traditionally done in order to assert what the Congress \nmight consider reasonable is look to the American people and their \nviews. Let's look at their views with regard to the press.\n  Eighty percent of Americans want newspapers' political coverage \nregulated. You cannot do that under the first amendment; you could \nunder the Hollings amendment.\n  Eighty-six percent want mandatory equal coverage of candidates by \nnewspapers. You cannot do that under the first amendment; you could do \nit under the Hollings amendment.\n  Eighty percent want newspapers required to give equal space to \ncandidates against whom they editorialize. You can't do that under the \nfirst amendment; you could under the Hollings amendment.\n  Seventy percent believe reporters' personal biases affect campaign \nand issue coverage.\n  They are right about that. Sixty-eight percent believe newspaper \neditorials are more important than a $10,000 contribution.\n  Sixty-one percent believe that a newspaper-preferred candidate trumps \nthe better-funded candidate.\n  Forty-two percent of Americans believe editorial boards ought to be \nforced to have an equal number of Republicans and Democrats.\n  Finally, 45 percent of Americans think newspapers should be required \nto give candidates free ad space.\n  I mention this survey to make the point that if Congress is going to \nhave the power to regulate all of this speech, presumably, it will \nrefer to the opinions of the American people in trying to make these \nregulatory decisions, and all of those items I mentioned could be fair \ngame in determining what is reasonable to be spent ``by and on behalf \nof or in opposition to a candidate.''\n  Again, I commend the Senator from South Carolina for offering this \namendment insofar as he lays on the table just what the stakes are in \nthe campaign finance debate. To do what the reformers say they want to \ndo, limit ``special interest influence,'' requires limiting the U.S. \nConstitution which gives special interests--all Americans--the freedom \nto speak, the freedom to associate, and the freedom to petition the \nGovernment for redress of grievances. That is called lobbying.\n  We have to gut the first amendment and throw on the trash heap that \nfreedom which the U.S. Supreme Court said six decades ago is the \n``matrix, the indispensable condition of nearly every other form of \nfreedom.''\n  Some would call that horror reform. A few dozen Senators may even \nvote for it. As I said, last time 38 voted for it. We can all agree to \ndisagree on campaign finance. We can even agree to disagree on what is \nreform. But surely we can also agree that this business of amending the \nConstitution whenever the Supreme Court hands down a result we do not \nlike is wrong and is dangerous. We trivialize that sacred document \nwhich so embodies the spirit of America, which guarantees the success \nof America, and we treat it as if it were a rough draft. To be \nseriously contemplating chopping off a huge chunk of the Bill of Rights \nmust seem incomprehensible to the casual viewer of this discussion.\n  This debate, like the debate over Shays-Meehan and McCain-Feingold, \nis not only about politicians' first amendment freedoms. The ``in \nsupport of or in opposition to'' components of the Hollings \nconstitutional amendment refer to the freedom of everyone else in \nAmerica--private citizens and groups and, yes, as I pointed out, even \nthe media, the entire universe of political speech.\n\n[[Page S1727]]\n\n  What makes the Hollings amendment on many orders of magnitude so much \nmore egregious than the statutory proposals is that the Supreme Court \ncannot intervene and save America from whatever folly we would engage \nin on the floor in defining what ``reasonable'' is.\n  As I said, I recoil in horror from the substance of the Hollings \namendment while I embrace the clarity of the choice it presents us. It \nexposes the fallacy of McCain-Feingold and other such speech \nsuppression schemes. If one believes that McCain-Feingold is \nconstitutional, as its advocates claim it is, then we do not need the \nHollings constitutional amendment. If my colleagues vote for the \nHollings constitutional amendment, then they have affirmed what so many \nof us inside and outside the Senate have been saying: That to do what \nMcCain-Feingold proponents want to do--restrict spending by, in support \nof, and in opposition to candidates--then we need to get rid of the \nfirst amendment. That is what the Hollings constitutional amendment \ndoes: No more first amendment protection of political speech for \nanyone, politician or not.\n  Fifteen years ago, when I first took the oath of this office to \nsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States against all \nenemies foreign and domestic, I had no idea how much time and energy I \nwould expend doing just that--defending the Constitution, not from \nforeign enemies, mind you, but from the Congress itself. I certainly \ncould not have imagined that the Senate would spend so much time \nseriously discussing whether we should wipe out core political \nfreedoms. We need to stop this, and I am confident and hopeful that the \nHollings amendment will be defeated overwhelmingly tomorrow, as it has \nbeen defeated overwhelmingly in the past.\n\n  I will mention a couple of recent letters in relation to this \namendment. One is from Roger Pilon at the Cato Institute who says in \npertinent part:\n\n       . . . I am heartened to learn that those who want to \n     ``reform'' our campaign finance law are admitting that a \n     constitutional amendment is necessary. But that very \n     admission speaks volumes about the present \n     unconstitutionality of most of the proposals now in the air. \n     It is not for nothing that the Founders of this nation \n     provided explicitly for unrestrained freedom of political \n     expression and association--which includes, the Court has \n     said, the right to make political contributions and \n     expenditures. They realized that governments and government \n     officials tend to serve their own interests, for which the \n     natural antidote is unfettered political opposition--in \n     speech and in the electoral process.\n       In the name of countering that tendency this amendment \n     would restrict its antidote. It is a ruse--an unvarnished, \n     transparent effort to restrict our political freedom and, by \n     implication, the further freedoms that freedom ensures. That \n     it is dressed in the gossamer clothing of ``reform'' only \n     compounds the evil--even as it exposes its true character.\n\n  I also have a letter from the ACLU, dated March 24, 2000, indicating \nits opposition to the Hollings constitutional amendment. In pertinent \npart, the ACLU says the constitutional amendment:\n\n       . . . would also give Congress and every state legislature \n     the power, heretofore denied by the first amendment, to \n     regulate the most protected function of the press--\n     editorializing. Print outlets such as newspapers and \n     magazines, broadcasters, Internet publishers and cable \n     operators would be vulnerable to severe regulation of \n     editorial content by the government. A candidate-centered \n     editorial, as well as op-ed articles or commentary printed at \n     the publisher's expense are most certainly expenditures in \n     support of or in opposition to particular political \n     candidates. The amendment, as its words make apparent, would \n     authorize Congress to set reasonable limits on the \n     expenditures by the media during campaigns, when not strictly \n     reporting the news. Such a result would be intolerable in a \n     society that cherishes the free press.\n       Even if Congress exempted the press from the amendment, \n     what rational basis would it use to distinguish between \n     certain kinds of speech? For example, why would it be \n     justified for Congress to allow a newspaper publisher to run \n     unlimited editorials on behalf of a candidate, but to make it \n     unlawful for a wealthy individual to purchase an unlimited \n     number of billboards for the same candidate? Likewise, why \n     would it be permissible for a major weekly news magazine to \n     run an unlimited number of editorials opposing a candidate, \n     but impermissible for the candidate or his supporters to \n     raise or spend enough money to purchase advertisements in the \n     same publication? At what point is a journal or magazine that \n     is published by an advocacy group different from a daily \n     newspaper, when it comes to the endorsement of candidates for \n     federal office? Should one type of media outlet be given \n     broader free expression privileges than the other? Should \n     national media outlets have to abide by fifty different state \n     and local standards for expenditures? These are questions \n     that Congress has not adequately addressed or answered.\n\n  All of which would be before the Congress if the Hollings amendment \nwere to become law.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the \nCato Institute, the ACLU, and an editorial from the Washington Post, \nalso opposing the Hollings amendment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Cato Institute,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 2000.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Chairman, Committee on Rules and Administration, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McConnell: Your office has invited my brief \n     thoughts on S.J. RES. 6, offered by Senator Hollings for \n     himself and Senators Specter, McCain, and Bryan, which \n     proposes an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States that would grant power to the Congress and the States \n     ``to set reasonable limits on the amount of contributions \n     that may be accepted by, and the amount of expenditures that \n     may be made by, in support of, or in opposition to, a \n     candidate for nomination for election to, or for election \n     to,'' any federal, state, or local office.\n       It is my understanding that on Monday next, Senator \n     Hollings is planning to offer this resolution as an amendment \n     to the flag-burning amendment now before the Senate. For my \n     thoughts on the proposed flag-burning amendment, please see \n     the testimony I have given on the issue, as posted at the web \n     site of the American Civil Liberties Union, and the op-ed I \n     wrote for the Washington Post, copies of which are attached.\n       Regarding the proposed campaign finance amendment, I am \n     heartened to learn that those who want to ``reform'' our \n     campaign finance law are admitting that a constitutional \n     amendment is necessary. But that very admission speaks \n     volumes about the present unconstitutionality of most of the \n     proposal now in the air. It is not for nothing that the \n     Founders of this nation provided explicitly for unrestrained \n     freedom of political expression and association--which \n     includes, the Court has said, the right to make political \n     contributions and expenditures. They realized that \n     governments and government officials tend to serve their own \n     interests, for which the natural antidote is unfettered \n     political opposition--in speech and in the electoral process.\n       In the name of countering that tendency this amendment \n     would restrict its antidote. It is a ruse--an unvarnished, \n     transparent effort to restrict our political freedom and, by \n     implication, the further freedoms that freedom ensures. That \n     it is dressed in the gossamer clothing of ``reform'' only \n     compounds the evil--even as it exposes its true character. If \n     the true aim of this amendment is incumbency protection, then \n     let those who propose it come clean. Otherwise, they must be \n     challenged to show why the experience of previous ``reforms'' \n     will not be repeated in this case too. Given the evidence, \n     that will not be an enviable task.\n       Fortunately, candor is still possible in this nation. This \n     is an occasion for it. I urge you to resist this amendment \n     with the focus that candor commands.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                      Roger Pilon,\n     Vice President for Legal Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n\n                                   Washington National Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: The American Civil Liberties Union strongly \n     opposes S.J. Res. 6, the proposed constitutional amendment \n     that permits Congress and the states to enact laws regulating \n     federal campaign expenditures and contributions.\n       Whatever one's position may be on campaign finance reform \n     and how best to achieve it, a constitutional amendment of the \n     kind here proposed is not the solution. Amending the First \n     Amendment for the first time in our history in the way that \n     S.J. Res. 6 proposes would challenge all pre-existing First \n     Amendment jurisprudence and would give to Congress and the \n     states unprecedented, sweeping and undefined authority to \n     restrict speech protected by the First Amendment since 1791.\n       Because it is vague and over-broad, S.J. Res. 6 would give \n     Congress a virtual ``blank check'' to enact any legislation \n     that may abridge a vast array of free speech and free \n     association rights that we now enjoy. In addition, this \n     measure should be opposed because it provides no guarantee \n     that Congress or the states will have the political will, \n     after the amendment's adoption, to enact legislation that \n     will correct the problems in our current electoral system. \n     This amendment misleads the American people because it tells \n     them that only if they sacrifice their First Amendment \n     rights, will Congress correct the problems in our system. Not \n     only is this too high a price to demand in the name of \n     reform, it is unwise to promise the American people such an \n     unlikely outcome.\n       Rather than assuring that the electoral process will be \n     improved, a constitutional\n\n[[Page S1728]]\n\n     amendment merely places new state and federal campaign \n     finance law beyond the reach of First Amendment \n     jurisprudence. All Congress and the states would have to \n     demonstrate is that its laws were ``reasonable.'' \n     ``Reasonable'' laws do not necessarily solve the problems of \n     those who are harmed by or locked out of the electoral \n     process on the basis of their third party status, lack of \n     wealth or non-incumbency. The First Amendment properly \n     prevents the government from being arbitrary when making \n     these distinctions, but S.J. Res. 6 would enable the Congress \n     to set limitations on expenditures and contributions \n     notwithstanding current constitutional understandings.\n       Once S.J. Res. 6 is adopted, Congress and local governments \n     could easily further distort the political process in \n     numerous ways. Congress and state governments could pass new \n     laws that operate to the detriment of dark horse and third \n     party candidates. For example, with the intention of creating \n     a ``level playing field'' Congress could establish equal \n     contributions and expenditure limits that would ultimately \n     operate to the benefit of incumbents who generally have \n     higher name recognition, greater access to their party \n     apparatus and more funds than their opponents. Thus, \n     rather than assure fair and free elections, the proposal \n     would enable those in power to perpetuate their own power \n     and incumbency advantage to the disadvantage of those who \n     would challenge the status quo.\n       S.J. Res. 6 would also give Congress and every state \n     legislature the power, heretofore denied by the First \n     Amendment, to regulate the most protected function of the \n     press--editorializing. Print outlets such as newspapers and \n     magazines, broadcasters, Internet publishers and cable \n     operators would be vulnerable to severe regulation of \n     editorial content by the government. A candidate-centered \n     editorial, as well as op-ed article or commentary printed at \n     the publisher's expense are most certainly expenditures in \n     support of or in opposition to particular political \n     candidates. The amendment, as its words make apparent, would \n     authorize Congress to set reasonable limits on the \n     expenditures by the media during campaigns, when not strictly \n     reporting the news. Such a result would be intolerable in a \n     society that cherishes the free press.\n       Even if Congress exempted the press from the amendment, \n     what rational basis would it use to distinguish between \n     certain kinds of speech? For example, why would it be \n     justified for Congress to allow a newspaper publisher to run \n     unlimited editorials on behalf of a candidate, but to make it \n     unlawful for a wealthy individual to purchase an unlimited \n     number of billboards for the same candidate? Likewise, why \n     would it be permissible for a major weekly newsmagazine to \n     run an unlimited number of editorials opposing a candidate, \n     but impermissible for the candidate or his supporters to \n     raise or spend enough money to purchase advertisements in the \n     same publication? At what point is a journal or magazine that \n     is published by an advocacy group different from a major \n     daily newspaper, when it comes to the endorsement of \n     candidates for federal office? Should one type of media \n     outlet be given broader free expression privileges than the \n     other? Should national media outlets have to abide by fifty \n     different state and local standards for expenditures? These \n     are questions that Congress has not adequately addressed or \n     answered.\n       Moreover, the proposed amendment appears to reach not only \n     expenditures by candidates or their agents but also the truly \n     independent expenditures by individual citizens and groups--\n     the very kind of speech that the First Amendment was designed \n     to protect.\n       If Congress or the states want to change or campaign \n     finance system, then it need not throw out the First \n     Amendment in order to do so. Congress can adopt meaningful \n     federal campaign finance reform measures without abrogating \n     the First Amendment and without contravening the Supreme \n     Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo. Some of these reform \n     measures include:\n       Public financing for all legally qualified candidates--\n     financing that serves as a floor, not a ceiling for campaign \n     expenditures,\n       Extending the franking privilege to all legally qualified \n     candidates,\n       Providing assistance to candidates for broadcast \n     advertising,\n       Improving the resources for the FEC so that it can provide \n     timely disclosure of contributions and expenditures,\n       Providing resources for candidate travel.\n       Rather than argue for these proposals, many members of \n     Congress continue to propose unconstitutional measures, such \n     as the McCain/Feingold bill that are limit-driven methods of \n     campaign finance reform that place campaign regulation on a \n     collision course with the First Amendment. Before Senators \n     vote to eliminate certain First Amendment rights, the ACLU \n     urges the Congress to consider other legislative options, and \n     to give these alternatives its considered review through the \n     hearing and mark-up processes.\n       The ACLU urges Senators to oppose S.J. Res. 6. As Joel \n     Gora, Professor of Law of the Brooklyn Law School recently \n     stated, ``This constitutional amendment is a recipe for \n     repression.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Laura W. Murphy,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 2, 1996]\n\n                     Wrong Way on Campaign Finance\n\n       Campaign finance reform is hard in part because it so \n     quickly bumps up against the First Amendment. To keep offices \n     and officeholders from being bought, proponents seek to limit \n     what candidates for office can raise and spend. That's \n     reasonable enough, except that the Supreme Court has ruled--\n     we think correctly--that the giving and spending of campaign \n     funds is a form of political speech, and the Constitution is \n     pretty explicit about that sort of thing. ``Congress shall \n     make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech'' is the \n     majestic sentence. So however laudable the goal, you end up \n     having to regulate lightly and indirectly in this area, which \n     means you are almost bound to achieve an imperfect result.\n       As a way out of this dilemma, Senate Minority Leader Tom \n     Daschle added his name the other day to the list of those who \n     say the Constitution should be amended to permit the \n     regulation of campaign spending. He wasn't just trying to \n     duck the issue by raising it to a higher level as some would-\n     be amenders have in the past. Rather, his argument is that \n     you can't win the war without the weapons, which in the case \n     of campaign finance means the power not just to create \n     incentives to limit spending but to impose spending limits \n     directly.\n       But that's what everyone who wants to put an asterisk after \n     the First Amendment says: We have a war to fight that we can \n     win only if given the power to suppress. It's a terrible \n     precedent even if in a virtuous cause, and of course, it is \n     always in a virtuous cause. The people who want a flag-\n     burning amendment think of themselves as defenders of civic \n     virtue too. These amendments are always for the one cause \n     only. Just this once, the supporters say. But have punched \n     the one hole, you make it impossible to argue on principle \n     against punching the next. The question becomes not whether \n     you have exceptions to the free speech clause, but which \n     ones?\n       Nor is it clear that an amendment would solve the problem. \n     It would offer a means but not the will. The system we have \n     is a system that benefits incumbents. That's one of the \n     reasons we continue to have it, and future incumbents are no \n     more likely to want to junk it than is the current crop.\n       The campaign finance issued tends to wax and wane, \n     depending on how obscene the fund-raising was, or seemed, in \n     the last election. The last election being what it was, \n     Congress is under a fair amount of pressure to toughen the \n     law. The Democrats doubtless feel it most, thanks to the \n     revelations of suspect fund-raising on the part of the \n     president's campaign, though the Republicans have their own \n     sins to answer for--not least their long record of resistance \n     to reform. With all respect to Mr. Daschle, a constitutional \n     amendment will solve none of this.\n       The American political system is never going to be \n     sanitized, nor, given the civic cost of the regulations that \n     would be required (even assuming that a definition of the \n     sanitary state could be agreed upon), should that be anyone's \n     goal. Rather, the goal should be simply to moderate the role \n     of money in determining elections and of course the policies \n     to which the elections lead. The right approach remains the \n     same: Give candidates some of the money they need to run, but \n     exact in return a promise to limit their spending. And then \n     enforce the promise. Private money would still be spent, but \n     at a genuine and greater distance from the candidates \n     themselves. It wouldn't be a perfect world, and that would be \n     its virtue as well as a flaw.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 32 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Utah \nwhatever time he may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I have enjoyed this discussion because \nit is always enlightening and is the kind of discussion the American \npeople need to hear in the present atmosphere, when there is a rush to \nblame all of our problems on our campaign finance system, and say: If \nwe only reform the campaign finance system, the millennium will come. \nEverything will be marvelous. We will vote on Mondays. Our political \nsystem will take care of itself. There will be purity throughout all \nthe land.\n  I come to this debate not as a lawyer but as a businessman. One of \nthe things I learned in the business world is: Find out if it works. It \nis very interesting to have the theory laid out before you, but the \nquestion is, Does it work? Will the situation be as advertised before \nyou make the purchase?\n  We have enough examples before us that I think make it clear that the \ncurrent reforms being talked about--whether it is a constitutional \namendment or McCain-Feingold, which I believe would be struck down as \nunconstitutional--do not work. Let's look at the evidence. Let's see \nwhat we have.\n  Stuart Rothenberg has a column in Roll Call, a newspaper with which \nall\n\n[[Page S1729]]\n\nof us on the Hill are familiar. This appeared on March 20, 1997, but it \nis still applicable. It is talking about campaign finance reform \napplied in the State of Colorado. The headline is: ``Look Before You \nLeap: Colorado's Lesson on Campaign Finance.'' It goes through and \ndescribes the reforms that were established in Colorado, backed by \nCommon Cause and the League of Women Voters, setting limits on \ncandidates and limits on contributions. To quote Rothenberg:\n\n       Now, however, most seasoned political operatives and many \n     candidates will tell you privately that they think the law is \n     terrible. They complain that the limits are too low . . . and \n     they note that the law doesn't address independent \n     expenditures, which will now balloon.\n\n  That is the point I want to make over and over again: ``independent \nexpenditures, which will now balloon.''\n  He goes on in the column to say:\n\n       So instead of making candidates more responsible for the \n     campaign environment, the law actually encourages independent \n     forces to become active.\n\n  Here is where they have tried it. They have found that special \ninterest power has gone up, not down, and that candidates have been \nforced out of the equation to a great degree, while special interests \nhave filled the vacuum.\n  He concludes his column by saying:\n\n       Clearly, the voters don't like the current campaign finance \n     system, and they are eager for change. But they haven't \n     considered the ramifications of many of the proposals, and \n     most of the suggestions for reform have ignored the realities \n     of political campaigns. Reformers would be well advised to \n     start at the beginning, not at the end.\n\n  If I may be a little parochial for a moment, there is an editorial \nthat appeared in the Salt Lake Tribune, my hometown newspaper, entitled \n``Don't Ban Soft Money.'' The Salt Lake Tribune is not known for its \nfriendliness to Republican candidates. But they have raised this issue, \nas is their first amendment right as a newspaper. They say:\n\n       The campaign-reform prescription of the moment is ``ban \n     soft money.'' Beware. The cure could be worse than the \n     disease.\n\n  They go on to describe all of that, and then they make the same point \nas Stuart Rothenberg:\n\n       A ban on soft money would simply encourage big donors to \n     run issue campaigns themselves. Then a candidate's supporters \n     could do a hatchet job on an opponent without any \n     accountability to anyone. Some groups already are adept at \n     this tactic.\n\n  I do not know if they ever met, but the Salt Lake Tribune and Stuart \nRothenberg are making the same point: If you put the campaign finance \nreform pressure on the candidate, you increase the power of independent \nexpenditures, you increase the power of special interest groups.\n  Here is a column by Dane Strother, a Democratic political consultant. \nI am trying to not just quote Republicans here. This appeared in the \nNew York Times on February 1, 1997. He said:\n\n       Limiting candidates' spending usually succeeds only in \n     giving special interests even more clout.\n\n  Once again, that is the same statement as these others. I will repeat \nit:\n\n       Limiting candidates' spending usually succeeds only in \n     giving special interests even more clout. Consider recent \n     ``reform'' efforts in Kentucky and the District of Columbia.\n\n  We are dealing with actual results here. We are not dealing with \ntheory. He describes how, when he was living in the District of \nColumbia, campaign contributions were limited. He says:\n\n       In 1993, Washington limited contributions in mayoral races \n     to $100--\n\n  Boy, that is draconian--\n\n     down from $2,000 per election cycle. Some candidates \n     struggled mightily to raise even $30,000, and couldn't get \n     their messages to the public. I lived in the District then, \n     and didn't receive a single political flier or piece of mail. \n     Some do-gooders would find this an improvement, but \n     information is the basis of an educated vote.\n\n  Then here is the punch line--the same point. He said:\n\n       Special interests filled the vacuum. Unions and big \n     business set up independent campaigns to help the candidates \n     of their liking, while politicians were reduced to begging \n     them for support. After the election, the City Council \n     returned to the old system.\n\n  ``Special interests filled the vacuum''--it is the pattern that has \nbeen repeated again and again. When you put limits on the ability of a \ncandidate to express himself, to raise the money and get his message \nout, you create an enormous opportunity for special interests to fill \nthe vacuum.\n  Here is another example. This one had to do with an election in \nChicago. It is written by R. Bruce Dold. He talks about the 1984 race \nwhere Charles Percy lost his seat to Paul Simon.\n  He said this was brought about, in large measure, because of a \ncampaign run by an outsider whom he identifies as a man named Michael \nGoland who had no connection whatsoever to Paul Simon but who did not \nlike Charles Percy's voting record. So he ran a series of ads. He spent \nmore than $1 million running his ads, independent of either Percy or \nDurbin, attacking Percy as a chameleon. He said, if you put pressure on \nthe candidates, you will see far more chameleon ads.\n  He points out that in 1996, the AFL-CIO spent millions of dollars to \nrun ``Mediscare'' ads against Republicans; and then, to balance it, he \nshows that the Christian Coalition and the National Rifle Association \ntried similar maneuvers. He says, summarizing once again:\n\n       If these groups want to express a political opinion, more \n     power to them. But McCain-Feingold would make them more \n     powerful than the candidates themselves.\n\n  That is another example, another place. You go to Colorado, you go to \nUtah, you go to Washington, DC, you go to Chicago--everywhere it is \ntried, it is demonstrated again and again, the more pressure you put on \nthe candidates in the name of campaign finance reform, the more you \ngive to the special interest groups who then, in the words of one of \nthe columnists there, fill the vacuum.\n  I have more that I would like to say, but I see my colleague from \nWashington is here, and I want to close so we can hear from him.\n  I simply want to commend to the Members of the Senate an article \nreprinted from the University of West Los Angeles Law Review written by \nJames Bopp, Jr., and Richard E. Coleson, in which I think they \nsummarize it all in the title of their article. The title is: ``The \nFirst Amendment Is Not A Loophole.'' I cannot think of a better summary \nof this entire debate than that title of this article by these lawyers \nin this law review: ``The First Amendment Is Not A Loophole.'' Then \nthey add the subhead: ``Protecting Free Expression In The Election \nCampaign Context.''\n  I may come back to this article at a later point in the debate. But \nas I say, now I wish to wind up so we can hear from the Senator from \nWashington. I cannot think of a better summary than that of this title, \nand I leave it at that: ``The First Amendment Is Not A Loophole.''\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, again I thank my good friend from \nUtah for his support and important contribution to this debate. We will \nhave another hour in the morning where I hope he will be available and \nwe will discuss that further.\n  How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 21 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Washington \nsuch time as he may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, Members of this body, in speaking \nagainst a similar, though not identical, attempt to amend the \nConstitution of the United States 2 or 3 years ago, I spoke of amending \nthe first amendment.\n  As I read this short and very simple proposal from the Senators from \nSouth Carolina and Arizona with respect to political speech, it does \nnot amend the first amendment. It repeals it. It states that the \nCongress of the United States has the power reasonably to limit \ncontributions or expenditures with respect to elections for Federal and \nState offices. That is exactly the power the Congress of the United \nStates would have were there no first amendment to the Constitution of \nthe United States. Our actions in that respect would have to meet some \ntest of reasonableness under the 14th amendment in that field as they \ndo in every other. But for all practical purposes, the first amendment \nto the Constitution of the United States, ratified by the States 209 \nyears ago, would be repealed with respect to political speech.\n  Now, it is not deemed that obscenity is a significant enough threat \nto the people of the United States to repeal or even to amend the first \namendment in that respect. It is not considered important enough to \nchange the first\n\n[[Page S1730]]\n\namendment with respect to tobacco or alcohol advertising. But it is \nconsidered that free and open political speech, through anything other \nthan an individual's voice, is now such a great threat to the free \ninstitutions of the United States that Congress--that is to say, \nincumbent officeholders--ought to be able to limit it in any way they \ndeem reasonable. This is clearly, as was its predecessor in 1997, the \nmost profound threat to first amendment rights, literally, since that \nConstitution was adopted.\n  The Alien and Sedition Acts in the last decade of the 18th century \nwere, after all, only statutes that were subject to challenge under the \nConstitution. They also had an automatic termination date to them. They \nare nonetheless constant examples of how a Congress can misuse its \npowers to limit speech and are considered such in almost any thorough \nhistory of the Constitution and of the United States itself.\n  Now, what is it that leads us to this moment? Clearly, it is the \nfeeling, the opinion, that too much money is spent on politics, that \nthere is too much political speech, and that it is clearly too free. \nThe distinguished colleague who sits in front of me and was recently a \ncandidate for President was, I think, rightly critical of two Texas \nmillionaires who advertised in a way he considered misleading and \nfalse. This proposal would say that they could be completely muzzled, \nthat they could be denied the right to speak at all, if it was deemed \nunreasonable. And certainly the candidate who was the victim of such \nspeech deems it to be unreasonable, as would many incumbents in many \nCongresses in the United States.\n  We are here dealing with this proposition: Too much money is being \nspent on politics. Not that too much money is being spent on regulating \nthe activities of the people of the United States, not that too much \nmoney is being spent on social or political programs of the United \nStates, but that too much money is spent in responding to those \nprograms and to that regulation and that somehow or another the power \nof the Federal Government to regulate economic, environmental, and \nsocial activities is so benign that we can muzzle the criticisms of \nthose who are adversely affected by that regulation. At least we can \nmuzzle those expressions which are directed at changing the people who \nwrite the very laws that impose those regulations.\n  We can at the very least ascribe consistency and thoughtfulness to \nthe promoters of this constitutional amendment who are also eloquent \nspokespersons for the original McCain-Feingold legislation, legislation \nthat limits, that comes close to eliminating the right of an outside \nperson so much as to mention the name of a candidate 6 weeks before an \nelection.\n  Yes, if you want to say that anyone--including a newspaper \neditorialist but even more significantly, someone who does not own a \nnewspaper--who wants to criticize a candidate for office in the 6 weeks \nbefore an election, if you want to eliminate that right, if you think \nit is desirable to limit or to eliminate that right, you do, in fact, \nneed this constitutional amendment.\n  McCain-Feingold, as it came before this body, in that respect at \nleast is clearly and blatantly and openly in violation of a \nconstitutional provision, the first amendment, that says: ``Congress \nshall make no law respecting freedom of speech or of the press.'' That \nmay be the single most quoted line in the entire Constitution of the \nUnited States. But the proponents of this amendment here today propose \neffectively to strike it from the Constitution as it relates to \nelection campaigns for Federal or State or local office.\n  The statement of the case should assure its defeat. The statement of \nthe case that somehow or another we are too political, that campaigns \nfor office are too robust as they deal with this massive engine of the \nFederal Government, and that we should repeal one of the founding \ntheories of this Government, the right of completely untrammeled and \ntotally free political speech, to state that proposition is to defeat.\n  We should not repeal the first amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States with respect to free political speech. We should not \nmodify the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States \nwith respect to free political speech. We should, though we may lack \nthe imaginations of James Madison and his colleagues in the first \nCongress, at least have the wisdom and the humility not to destroy what \nthey wrought at the very founding of this constitutional Republic.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, how much time does my side have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am not sure I will use the entire 9 \nminutes. I thank the Senator from Washington for his contribution to \nthis debate once again, and also my friend from Utah, and remind \neveryone the last time we voted on the Hollings amendment, it only got \n38 votes. Even the Washington Post, with whom I am seldom aligned on \nthis subject, opposes the measure. Senator Feingold opposes the \nmeasure.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator from Kentucky yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the Senator from Washington for a question.\n  Mr. GORTON. Is it appropriate, I ask my friend from Kentucky, to \ndescribe 38 votes to repeal the first amendment to the Constitution as \n``only'' 38?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Washington, it is discouraging \nthat there were even 38, but I say also to my friend from Washington, \nin earlier Congresses the Hollings amendment got greater support, \nincluding up to 52 votes in favor of the proposition back in 1988. So I \nprefer to look at the bright side of this, I say to the Senators. It \nmakes progress. We are moving in the right direction and, hopefully, \ntomorrow there will be even fewer than 38 votes. I think we are heading \nin the right direction. We have some time remaining. I don't know \nwhether the Senator from Utah would like to speak further. I would be \nhappy to give him the remainder of the time. It is my understanding \nthere are 2 hours equally divided in the morning?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator is correct in that \nassumption.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is not yet determined when that would begin, is it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 9:30.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Two hours equally divided beginning at 9:30 a.m.?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That's correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the remainder of the time on this side to the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I wish to add another point to the points \nI made earlier when I said that holding down the ability of candidates \nto express themselves in terms of the amount of money they can raise \nand the amount of advertising they can do only creates an opportunity \nfor special interests to fill the vacuum. There is one other point I \nneed to make with respect to the perceptions on this issue. The first \nperception, which I have attacked, is that holding down the \nexpenditures and the contributions will somehow control the special \ninterests. I am sure the results of where it has been tried has been in \nthe opposite direction.\n  The special interest rule now through campaign contributions --I want \nto share this with the Senate. A survey was done in Fortune magazine, \npublished in December of 1999, byline, Jeffrey Birnbaum, who, again, is \nnot normally known for his sympathy of the positions of this Senator, \nhe talks about the impact of money on politics in Washington in this \narticle. Fortune magazine does an annual survey of who has the most \nclout in Washington, which special interests are the most powerful.\n  For 3 years running now--and in this article it is the same one--the \nNo. 1 special interest that has the most power in Washington, rated by \nthose who have done the survey, is--the envelope please--the AARP, \nwhich is a group that, by its rules, does not give any campaign \ncontributions to anyone. The group that is considered the most powerful \nspecial interest in Washington by this independent survey is a group \nthat does not give campaign contributions, hard or soft.\n  One of the individuals involved in pulling together the survey, a man \nfrom the Mellman Group--Mark Mellman is his name--he is one of the\n\n[[Page S1731]]\n\npollsters. He normally polls on the Democratic side of the aisle. I \nthink my Democratic colleagues might recognize his name. He made this \ncomment, ``We couldn't find any direct relationship between campaign \ndonations and clout.''\n\n  I think that is worth repeating in this superheated atmosphere about \nhow campaign contributions are ``buying'' the Congress. Here is an \noutsider coming in to do a survey of the most powerful special interest \ngroups in Washington and how they got their power, and he says: ``We \ncouldn't find any direct relationship between campaign donations and \nclout.''\n  The question arises: if their clout does not come from the campaign \ncontributions, why does the AARP have so much power? It is because they \nhave so many members. It is voters who make the difference.\n  What is the group in second place behind the AARP. It is the National \nFederation of Independent Businessmen. Why do they have so much power? \nBecause they have so many members. It is voters who make the \ndifference.\n  I am sure that no one would want to say to the AARP, in the name of \ncampaign finance reform, we are going to forbid you to tell your \nmembers what you think about how people vote in Washington. Are we \ngoing to say to the NFIB we are going to forbid you to talk to your own \nmembers in the name of campaign finance reform? Those are the groups \nthat are 1 and 2 in this independent survey.\n  You can go through the whole thing and you will begin to realize that \nall of the conversation about contributions and power in Washington is \nconversation that takes place in the press gallery. In the reality of \nwhere we compete in the election process, it misses the mark.\n  I remember during the hearings someone said: Senator, with this \nprocess you are allowing people to buy access to you. I responded then \nas I respond now: The best way for you to get access to me is to \nregister to vote in the State of Utah. If you are a voter in the State \nof Utah, I will do my best to get access to you, greet you, sign \nautographs, make you feel good about me. It will not cost you anything, \nparticularly if you live in Utah. If you don't live in Utah, it would \nbe a little hard to register there. So I think there are some myths \nthat need to be dispelled.\n  The final one I want to address has to do with this question of the \namount of money that is flowing and is being raised. I am quoting now \nfrom a paper presented by Professor Joel Gora from the Brooklyn Law \nSchool, another Democrat, a man who was heavily involved in Senator \nEugene McCarthy's insurgent campaign for the Presidency in 1968. He \nmakes this point:\n\n       Senator McCarthy's landmark and principled 1968 \n     Presidential campaign raised more money, adjusted for \n     inflation, than George W. Bush's campaign this year . . .\n\n  I didn't hear anybody complaining in 1968 that Eugene McCarthy was a \ntool of special interests bought with special interest money. He raised \nmore money, adjusted for inflation, than George W. Bush has raised this \nyear. And Professor Gora goes on to say:\n\n       . . . and did so relying on an extremely small handful of \n     extremely wealthy individuals who shared the ideals and \n     values of Senator McCarthy and his supporters. Only in the \n     perverted post-Watergate world of campaign ``reform'' would \n     the word ``corruption'' or ``the appearance of corruption'' \n     possibly be used to describe that noble endeavor.\n\n  I didn't support Eugene McCarthy in 1968, but I agree that nobody \nwould have said that Eugene McCarthy in 1968 was a tool of special \ninterests or that he was part of corruption or the appearance of \ncorruption? Why? He disclosed every dollar immediately when it was \nreceived, and everybody knew who his supporters were and why they were \nwith him. They were with him because they opposed the war in Vietnam.\n  There is much more that can be said, and undoubtedly will be said, \nbut I want to leave it at that. A number of myths are swirling around \nthis whole debate. We need to look at the reality, which is that every \ntime campaign finance reform has been tried at the State level, the \npower of special interest groups have gone up, not down, as a result. \nThe reality of it is that we do not have an inordinate amount of money \nwashing through politics today. If you take it on an inflation-adjusted \nbasis, it is the same today as it was back in 1968. We do have a great \ndeal of hysteria which, if we don't puncture the balloon of that \nhysteria, could lead us to make a seriously significant mistake. I \ndon't want us to do that. That is why I am as vigorous as I can be to \nsee to it that we do not pass the Hollings amendment and we do not, \nsubsequent to that, pass McCain-Feingold.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield such time as is necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague from South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, on January 30, 1976, the Supreme Court of the United \nStates handed down a most extraordinary decision equating freedom of \nspeech with money. That was a shock to me on the day the decision came \ndown, and it remains a shock, because in a democracy political power \nought not to be determined by who has the most money.\n  Since 1988, for more than 12 years, Senator Hollings and I have \nproposed a very basic constitutional amendment which would permit \nCongress to regulate contributions and expenditures. There is nothing \nin this amendment which would limit political speech otherwise, but \ndeals solely with the issue of contributions and expenditures.\n  The amendment states Congress shall have the power to set reasonable \nlimits on the amount of contributions that may be accepted by and the \namount of expenditures that may be made by or in support of or in \nopposition to a candidate for nomination or election to or for election \nto Federal office. Section 2 gives similar power to the States in \nidentical language.\n  In 1976, the day Buckley v. Valeo was handed down, I was an announced \ncandidate for the Republican nomination for the Senate in the State of \nPennsylvania. I had entered into that contest on the basis of the 1974 \nCampaign Finance Act, which said that a candidate for nomination for \nthe Senate in the State the size of Pennsylvania would be limited to \nspending of $35,000. My opponent in that primary contest was \nCongressman John Heinz. On January 30, the Supreme Court said that John \nHeinz could spend millions, which he did, and my brother, Morton \nSpecter, who might have been able to finance my campaign, was limited \nto $1,000. I had a little bit of a hard time understanding at that \npoint why Congressman Heinz's speech was different from Morton \nSpecter's speech.\n  When I came to the Congress, I pursued this issue. As I say, since \n1988, Senator Hollings and I have pursued this constitutional \namendment. This is the 106th Congress. It was in the 105th Congress and \nthe 104th Congress, et cetera. I believe it is a very important \namendment if we are to eliminate certain dangers, and certainly the \nperception of dangers, in our election system.\n  In the 1996 Presidential campaign, the expenditures were some $400 \nmillion. In the congressional campaigns in 1996, there was almost $300 \nmillion in the Senate, and more than $477 million in the House. In the \n1988 congressional campaigns, the Senate spending level remained at \nabout the same, while the House spent about $452 million. The time that \nit takes Members of Congress to raise the money has been well \ndocumented. There is a perception in the land that Members of \nCongress--Senators and Representatives--are for sale. I think that \nvotes are not for sale, but I believe there is no doubt of the public \nperception to the contrary.\n  The amendment which has been presented is necessary because of the \ndecision in the Buckley case, and it is improperly characterized as an \namendment to the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution. In my \npersonal view, the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution is \ninviolate. Those words have stood this country tremendously well, and I \nwould fight any effort to change the language of the first amendment. \nBut a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in \ninterpreting the first amendment is not inviolate. It is not Holy Writ. \nThese judgments are handed down by individuals who are nominated and \nconfirmed in the Senate, and they write opinions because that is their \nopinion as to what the first amendment means.\n\n[[Page S1732]]\n\n  I submit that to say speech is equivalent to money is basically \noutrageous. But until that is changed and our Constitution requires \nthat in the form of a constitutional amendment, it ought more \naccurately to be said that it is the opinion of the Congress by a two-\nthirds vote backed up by the opinion of the State legislatures, three-\nfourths of which are necessary to have the amendment come through, that \nthe opinion of the Supreme Court is not correct.\n  We are debating at the same time a constitutional amendment on the \nflag-burning issue. Here again, it is not the Constitution which says \nthat in the first amendment a citizen or anyone has a constitutional \nright to burn a flag. But five Justices said in opinions the first \namendment raises that implication. Four Justices said the first \namendment did not raise that implication. They are opinions. With all \ndue respect to the men and women who occupy the chambers of the Supreme \nCourt, with the columns lining directly up with the Senate Chamber, \nhaving participated in my tenure in eight confirmation proceedings, \ntheir opinions are not inviolate. And their opinions are subject to \nmodification. As our Constitution is written, they have the last word \nunless the provisions of the Constitution are followed to have a change \nand an amendment.\n  When the Constitution was formulated, the Congress was in the first \narticle, and I think the drafters of the Constitution thought that \nCongress was the primary article I body. The executive branch came in \nin article II. The Court came in in article III. There is nothing in \nthe Constitution which says the Supreme Court of the United States has \nthe power to invalidate an act of Congress. There is nothing in the \nConstitution which says that. But the Supreme Court of the United \nStates, in 1803, in perhaps the most famous of all Supreme Court \ndecisions, in Brown v. Board of Education--perhaps some others--said \nthat the Supreme Court had that authority. I believe it was a wise \ndecision because someone has to have the last word. But their \npronouncements are not statements from the tabernacles, from the Ten \nCommandants, or Holy Writ. They are their opinions. It is a very tough \nmountain to climb to have this amendment adopted because it brings \ntogether a coalition of people who articulate the sanctity of the first \namendment really misstating it as the sanctity of the opinions of the \nJustices.\n  Buckley v. Valeo was a split decision. Those individuals, \ninstitutions, agencies, are combined with the people who want to \nmaintain the money chase for elective office the way it is at the \npresent time, so there is no doubt it is a very tough proposition.\n  Go into the Cloakrooms of both parties and you find in common \nparlance the people who say they are for campaign finance reform really \nare not but say so because it will not pass. It is like the \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget that requires 67 votes. \nThere are people who say they are going to vote for it, but until it \ngets to 66, nobody will cast that 67th vote, so there is a fair amount \nof posturing on the issue before anything can be adopted.\n  It is important to focus on the fact that this provision, this \namendment, this change in the opinions of the Justices of the Supreme \nCourt in Buckley v. Valeo does not adopt any specific kind of change in \nthe campaign laws. It does not say what will happen to soft money, it \ndoes not say what will happen to corporate contributions, it does not \nsay what will happen to the union money, it does not say what will \nhappen to money of millionaires or billionaires.\n  As we speak, there are campaigns underway for $25 million in one \nState in a primary. Is a seat in the Senate something that ought to be \nup for sale? I think $25 million for a primary is too high. Our seats \nought not to be up for sale. There is too much of a public trust here \nfor any individual to buy a seat in the Senate or the House of \nRepresentatives. That is the practical fact of life.\n  When the Supreme Court of the United States decided Buckley v. \nValeo--and it is one of the most challenging opinions to read; it goes \non for 128 pages of single-spaced opinions--the Court said at one \npoint:\n\n       We agree that in order to preserve the provision against \n     invalidation on vagueness grounds, section 608(e)1 must be \n     construed to apply only to expenditures for communications \n     that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a \n     clearly identified candidate for Federal office.\n\n  Then they have a footnote which says: The Constitution would restrict \nthe application to communications containing express words of advocacy \nof election or defeat such as ``vote for, elect, support, cast your \nballot for, Smith for Congress, vote against, defeat, reject,'' et \ncetera.\n  That interpretation, on what is called express advocacy, has led to \nextraordinary approval of political advertisements, so-called ``issue \nadvertisements,'' not regulatable by campaign finance and which can be \npaid for by soft money which corporations or individuals or unions or \nanyone can put up in large amounts--millions of dollars.\n  Let me read a couple of commercials from the 1996 election early on \npurchased with soft money, which really turned the election. This is \nnot a Democrat issue or a Republican issue. Both sides comport \nthemselves about the same.\n  This is a commercial for President Clinton's reelection.\n\n       American values. Do our duty to our parents. President \n     Clinton protects Medicare. The Dole/Gingrich budget tried to \n     cut Medicare $270 billion. Protect families. President \n     Clinton cut taxes for millions of working families. The Dole/\n     Gingrich budget tried to raise taxes on eight million of \n     them. President Clinton proposes tax breaks for tuition. The \n     Dole/Gingrich budget tried to slash college scholarships. \n     Only President Clinton's plan meets our challenges, protects \n     our values.\n\n  Could anybody with hearing and sanity say that is not an \nadvertisement for President Clinton? The Supreme Court of the United \nStates says it is not. That is an issue ad. Why? Because it doesn't say \n``elect Clinton.'' It doesn't say ``defeat Dole.'' But it says \nPresident Clinton protects Medicare. It says Dole-Gingrich tried to \nraise taxes on 8 million citizens.\n  Try another one:\n\n       60,000 felons and fugitives tried to buy handguns--but \n     couldn't--because President Clinton passed the Brady bill--\n     five-day waits, background checks. But Dole and Gingrich \n     voted no. One hundred thousand new police because President \n     Clinton delivered. Dole and Gingrich? Vote no, want to repeal \n     'em. Strengthen school anti-drug programs. President Clinton \n     did it. Dole and Gingrich? No, again. Their old ways don't \n     work. President Clinton's plan. The new way. Meeting our \n     challenges, protecting our values.\n\n  Try this one on for size:\n\n       Protecting families. For millions of working families, \n     President Clinton cut taxes. The Dole-Gingrich budget tried \n     to raise taxes on eight million. The Dole-Gingrich budget \n     would have slashed Medicare 270 billion. Cut college \n     scholarships. The President defended our values. Protected \n     Medicare. And now, a tax cut of 1,500 a year for the first \n     two years of college. Most community colleges are free. Help \n     adults go back to school. The President's plan protects our \n     values.\n\n  That is not a commercial for President Clinton, that is an issue \nadvertisement, so says the law of the land handed down by the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. To say it is ridiculous or to say it is \noutrageous or to say it is nonsensical, to say it is stupid is an \nunderstatement. Those are the laws we are operating under now.\n  We face very determined opposition. I heard a lot of arguments about \nmyths and facts, arguments that the Constitution's right to freedom of \nspeech would be changed by what Senator Hollings and I and others are \nproposing. That is not so. It doesn't deal with the right to freedom of \nspeech under the Constitution. It deals with campaign contributions and \ncampaign expenditures.\n  When you talk about a good bit of the legislation which is pending, \nit is not going to do the job even if it is enacted. Better to try than \nnot to try, but if you are dealing with soft money, it is going to be \nrejected under the clear-cut language of Buckley v. Valeo on what is \nexpress advocacy contrasted with what is issue advocacy.\n  The only way to get this job done is to adopt an amendment. We call \nit a constitutional amendment, but it really is not a constitutional \namendment. It is not a constitutional amendment because it does not \nseek to change the words of the Constitution. It does not seek to \nchange the words of the first amendment. It seeks only to say the \nopinions of the Justices in a split Court\n\n[[Page S1733]]\n\nare not correct. Those are men and women, not too dissimilar from \nSenator Hollings, a very distinguished lawyer who could have been on \nthe Supreme Court if he had chosen to be on the Supreme Court. In a \nfact not widely known, you don't have to be a lawyer to be on the \nSupreme Court.\n  Parenthetically, I tried to urge Senator Hatfield to become a Supreme \nCourt Justice at one stage because I thought he had extraordinary \nqualifications, one of which was he wasn't a lawyer, but there are \nothers who have different opinions.\n  When you equate money with speech, Justice Stevens said in his \nconcurring opinion in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC: Money is \nproperty, it is not speech.\n  It seems fundamental that in a democracy the power of a person with \nmoney is greater than the power of a person without money. The \nproportion of the power goes directly in line with how much money that \nperson has. It is not good for America.\n  Senator Hollings and I are going to be around for a while pushing \nthis constitutional amendment. We may even push it until Senator \nHollings is a senior Senator. He has only been here since 1966. He has \na record of being the senior junior Senator in the history of the \nSenate. I say that only in a moment of light jest. We have a very \ndistinguished senior Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Thurmond, who is \nthe longest serving Senator in the history of the Senate.\n  We intend to keep pushing this. The votes go up and down as the \nconstituency of the Senate changes. We believe very strongly that we \nare right and that money is not speech. One day we will prevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nPennsylvania. He is so learned in the law and so long on common sense. \nHe just laid out what the situation is and how we are going about, in a \nvery deliberate, constitutional way, repairing the tremendous damage \ndone by Buckley v. Valeo.\n  There is no question about the process being corrupted. He mentioned \na minute ago that I have been here since 1966. I have been here when we \nhave had everybody here at 5:30 and we would debate these things and, \nyes, on a Monday. But we do not meet on Mondays. Why? Because we have \nbeen corrupted by the money chase.\n  I have gone to the leaders on both sides: Give me a window; how about \nseeing if we do not go late on Thursday night because I have to get \nback to South Carolina for a fundraiser. Every Senator has done it. We \nare not here on Monday. We are not here on Friday. In 1966 and 1967, \nunder Senator Mansfield, I can tell you right now, we worked until late \nFriday afternoon and we reported back for rollcalls at 9 o'clock on \nMonday morning.\n  We worked the full time. We worked the full months. We did not have \nJanuary off and then another big break in February and another break in \nMarch and another break in April and another break in May-June and \nanother break of a month in August. Why the breaks? To raise the money. \nIf you are not raising it for yourself, you are supposed to go out and \nraise it for your colleagues.\n  The whole process has been corrupted. Recognize it. We cannot get a \nbill. We cannot get debate. We cannot talk to each other. Nobody is \nhere. They are not expected to be here. TV has corrupted that. If one \nwanted to know what was going on in the Chamber, they had to get out of \ntheir office and come to the floor. We always had 15 or 20 Members on \none side and 20 or 30 Members on the other side listening and joining \nin, and we had debates on serious matters. We debated. The most \ndeliberative body in the world was our reputation.\n  Now we do not bring up a serious matter unless it is fixed. We cannot \nproduce a budget unless the vote is fixed in the Budget Committee, and \nwhen they can get it through it is late Thursday evening, when it is \nquite obvious none of the amendments are going to be adopted. The vote \nis fixed. The jury is fixed. There is no deliberation. They will bring \nthat up, and then they have fixed time on it.\n  Go to the leader and say: We want to take up this measure, and it \ntakes 3 or 4 days; and he will look at you as if you are stupid: Don't \nyou know better, we don't have time to deliberate, we don't have time \nto debate.\n  The system is corrupted. Get a life. Get along. Go out. Collect some \nmoney. After all, it is the money chase. We have to work for ourselves \nto stay in office or to keep our colleagues in office. That is the name \nof the game.\n  Important issues, I can go down the list--but when they want money, \noh, wait a minute, there is an exception. That sham, that fraud, that \ncharade of Y2K. For 30 years, the computer industry had notice of the \nyear 2000. For 30 years, they all could have changed. They still have 7 \nmonths or so to change.\n\n  There was a big debate. Why? Because the lawyers got the Chamber of \nCommerce to gin up Silicon Valley. The gentleman from Intel told me \nthere was not a real problem, and everybody else said there was not a \nreal problem. But we had a problem. It was a money chase for getting \nSilicon Valley's money in Y2K, and the media covered it: How much Bush \nhad received, how much Gore had received, how much this group had \nreceived, and we continue to invite Silicon Valley here for special \nsessions. We are really interested.\n  That is not middle America, and they are not going to create our \nindustrial backbone. We admire their ingenuity and their talent. We are \nnot jealous of the money. Let them all make millions. We just want our \nshare.\n  Y2K came, and we passed it. Nothing happened. In opposition to the \nStates, in opposition to the States' supreme court justices, in \nopposition to the American Bar Association, we repealed 200 years of \nState tort law. Why? Because of the money. Why, we spent 4 days on that \none. That was highly important. Just put up a straw man, knock it down, \nand then go home, boldly and proudly saying: Look what we have done; we \ntook care of Y2K.\n  Yet, on the other hand, if we have a real problem, they will not call \nit up. Why? On account of the money. I have a TV violence bill. There \nis no mystery to this. Europe, Australia, and New Zealand do not have \nchildren shooting each other in schools. They have a safe harbor \npractice so that violence appears on television after hours.\n  I introduced the same thing, and it was in the Commerce Committee in \nthe last two Congresses. Senator Dole was there. When he went out to \nthe west coast, he came back and said: Oh, this is terrible. I said: \nSenator Dole, why don't you be the chief sponsor, you run it, you take \ncredit for it. It has already been debated and we have had testimony on \nit, and it was reported out by a vote of 19-1 from the Commerce \nCommittee. It is on the calendar. Call it.\n  Oh, no, it wasn't called. We needed the Hollywood money. I have it on \nthe calendar now. Again, we debated it. We brought out the study the \nindustry conducted, and the motion picture industry itself found that \nviolence was on the rise.\n  It is a real problem in this country, but we talk a little bit here \nand there. When we want to get a tried and true approach and it is on \nthe calendar, they say: Wait a minute, don't call that, let's not \ndebate it.\n  It is not called up because of the money. This attitude has corrupted \nthe process, and we have a gang over there that loves the corruption. \nThey come here with their octopus defense. I have seen it before. We \nused to try cases, and if you do not have the facts and you do not have \nthe lawyer beaten on the desk, you squirt out that dark ink of freedom \nof speech, first amendment, 2,000 years, 20,000 amendments. This is a \nshocking thing.\n  They were not shocked when the 1976 decision of Buckley v. Valeo came \ndown because that decision is what amended the freedom of speech. It \nsaid: If you have the money, you have all the speech you want. If you \ndon't have the money, you get lockjaw. Shut up. You don't have speech.\n  In that Buckley v. Valeo decision, read what they said in this \ndistortion: ``Money is property; it is not speech,'' said Justice \nStevens.\n  Then Justice Kennedy:\n\n       The plain fact is that the compromise the Court invented in \n     Buckley set the stage for a new kind of speech to enter the \n     political system. It is covert speech.\n\n  This is, of course, the famous case of Nixon v. Shrink, the most \nrecent decision of this Court:\n\n\n[[Page S1734]]\n\n\n       The Court has forced a substantial amount of political \n     speech underground, as contributors and candidates devise \n     ever more elaborate methods of avoiding contribution limits, \n     limits which take no account of rising campaign costs. The \n     preferred method has been to conceal the real purpose of the \n     speech. . ..\n       Issue advocacy, like soft money, is unrestricted, see \n     Buckley, supra, at 42-44, while straightforward speech in the \n     form of financial contributions paid to a candidate, speech \n     subject to full disclosure and prompt evaluation by the \n     public, is not. Thus has the Court's decision given us covert \n     speech. This mocks the First Amendment.\n\n  That is what Justice Kennedy talks about. That is what I am talking \nabout. Don't give me this: Freedom of speech and first amendment. What \na shocking thing it is with that black ink like the octopus, putting up \nall the billboards about the freedom of the press and how people want \neditorial writers to be equally Democratic and Republican--what kind of \nnonsense is all of that? And what about getting up and saying: All I \nwant is for you to register and vote.\n  Quoting further:\n\n       The current system would be unfortunate, and suspect under \n     the First Amendment, had it evolved from a deliberate \n     legislative choice; but its unhappy origins are in our \n     earlier decree in Buckley, which by accepting half of what \n     Congress did (limiting contributions) but rejecting the other \n     (limiting expenditures) created a misshapen system, one which \n     distorts the meaning of speech.\n\n  The Senator from North Dakota said: Let's don't do it lightly. Let's \ndon't amend the Constitution willy-nilly. I agree. But what about when \nyou have a threat to the democracy, to the Republic itself, this \ncorruption of the process here, where the Congress does nothing because \nof the money chase that we are in.\n  Quoting further:\n\n       The irony that we would impose this regime in the name of \n     free speech ought to be sufficient ground to reject Buckley's \n     wooden formula in the present case. The wrong goes deeper, \n     however. By operation of the Buckley rule, a candidate cannot \n     oppose this system in an effective way without selling out to \n     it first.\n\n  We all have to sell out. I am running around trying to get money to \nhelp my colleagues right this minute.\n\n       Soft money must be raised to attack the problem of soft \n     money.\n\n  Listen to this sentence:\n\n       In effect, the Court immunizes its own erroneous ruling \n     from change.\n\n  Let me quote that one more time:\n\n       In effect, the Court immunizes its own erroneous ruling \n     from change.\n\n  That is why you need a constitutional amendment. That is why we are \nhere. If you enjoy the corruption, if you want to continue on, not \nbeing able to debate anything around here, not having to amend, just \ngoing through the motions of arriving and going home, and getting \nanother break and going home to collect some more money, and coming \nback and going back to collect more money, and acting as if you are \ndoing the people's business--it is an embarrassment.\n\n  They sure know embarrassment when they try to equate it with free \nspeech, when they can jump on Vice President Gore and the Buddhist \ntemple. The Christian right, that fellow Pat Robertson with the \nChristian right, I have had to face that insidious trickery in all of \nmy campaigns--that Bob Jones crowd. I am glad it is out from under the \nradar.\n  Let me tell you, it has been going on. I wish Senator McCain had had \na chance to get organized in the State because that is the only way I \nsurvived. You have to sort of out-organize it. But they had Ralph Reed \nin there, and he had been working in there since last June. He had it \nall greased.\n  They had the poor Senator from Arizona's family in the Mafia. They \nhad him fathering illegitimate children. And he was in prison. They had \nhim getting along with the North Vietnamese and going against the \nveterans. They had more dirty rumors--totally false--of anything you \ncan think of. I mean, you never heard such things. He had no chance.\n  The Christian right and Pat Robertson: They come on Sunday. They \nbrag. I can show you the statement, 75 million leaflets. They come out \nand give them out to the church on Sunday morning. They distort your \nrecord, and everything else of that kind. You cannot answer because the \nvote is on Tuesday.\n  He said he spent $500,000 carrying Virginia for George W. Bush. Pat \nRobertson, he gets respect. He's on TV. We think that is great. He is a \nbum, I can tell you. I know him. I knew his father Willis. He was a \nreal gentleman. Willis Robertson was one of the finest gentlemen you \nwould ever meet. That fellow is a scoundrel, whining and weaseling and \ndealing around.\n  But then, of course, the poor Buddhists, they want to get in the act. \nThere is nothing wrong with the Buddhists getting in the act. They tell \nme now what had happened is that this young lady, she had gotten \ncontributions from everybody and then reimbursed them. They found her \nguilty of the--what?--contributions, not of free speech.\n  See, when we find Johnny Huang guilty, that is in violation of the \ncontribution laws. That is not free speech. That is money. Oh, boy, I \nwish I was a lawyer before the jury with that crowd.\n  When they held the committee here with Charlie Trie, we had the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee conduct the activities. I do not know \nhow many months, but 70 witnesses, 200 witness interviews, 196 \ndepositions under oath, 418 subpoenas, with a final report published in \n1998 with six volumes, 9,575 pages--about contributions, not free \nspeech.\n  But now this afternoon, we pushed that aside. The Senator from Texas \nsays, You Democrats have all the labor unions and we have the corporate \nmoney. However, in South Carolina, I don't have either one. So let me \ngive you George W. Bush's statement on soft money, because he's an \nauthority on the subject.\n  This is on January 23. George Will, questioning Governor Bush:\n\n       In which case would you veto the McCain-Feingold bill or \n     the Shays-Meehan bill?\n\n  Governor Bush:\n\n       That is an interesting question. Yes, I would. And the \n     reason why is two for one. And I think it does restrict--\n\n  I am quoting it verbatim here as written.\n\n     --free speech for individuals. As I understand how the bill \n     was written, I think there has been two versions of it. But \n     as I understand, the first version restricted individuals \n     and/or groups from being able to express their opinion. I've \n     always said that I think corporate soft money and labor union \n     soft money--which I do not believe is individual free speech, \n     this is collected free speech--ought to be banned.\n\n  We have Vice President Gore. He got the message about the corruption. \nHe said: The first thing I will do when I am your President is submit \nto Congress the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  The people are tired of this political mess up here. I am tired of \nbeing a part of it. They will hear from me again and again. The reason \nyou hadn't heard about it is that they forbid a joint resolution from \ncoming up. I studied the calendar and waited for a joint resolution so \nthat my joint resolution won't be objected to on a point of order. It \nis finally in order and so we can hear it. But then I had to go along \nor else I wouldn't have had a chance to introduce it at all because \nthen they would have brought the flag amendment up and the cloture \nvote.\n  So you bag around here, this most deliberative body, for an hour or 2 \nhours to get some work done and nobody is here. Nobody wants to be here \nbecause they are supposed to be out raising money and having \nfundraisers and breakfasts in the morning and windows at lunchtime and \nin the evening. It's taking a few hours on Wednesday afternoon to call \non behalf of your campaign committee and come up with thousands of \ndollars, your fair share. It is money, money, money, money. It is \ncorruption.\n  You tell me about the Washington Post; that crowd still calls the \ndeficit a surplus. You tell me about the ACLU and all these other \nauthorities running around and the scare tactics, that octopus defense, \nand the dark ink and all of those other irrelevant matters. We are \ntalking sense. We are talking law. We are talking about what the \nJustices have just stated. There is no question why Justice Stevens \nsaid money is property and not speech. He was only one of the nine. The \nothers could have gone along and reversed Buckley, and we would be out \nof this dilemma. We would go back to the original intent, which was to \ncontrol spending. Now we are proudly hollering about this and that and \nfreedoms, and now we are going to take the newspapers and do away with \nthe editorialists and control\n\n[[Page S1735]]\n\nthe press. This amendment doesn't use the word ``speech.'' It says \n``contributions.'' It is money. That is exactly what we have controlled \nthroughout and that is what is intended.\n  The Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, stood up there and started \nreading this. He said that is limiting speech. It is not limiting \nspeech. You can't limit speech. But you can limit the freedom of the \ncontributions. You and I know that. That is what we are trying to do.\n  Under the 1974 act that computed spending limits by the number of \nregistered voters, Senator Thurmond and I would have had $670,000. \nDouble that to a million or a half or give us 2.5 million. That is a \ngracious plenty. When I first ran for office I ran against a \nmillionaire--a most respected gentleman, but he had the money. But we \noutworked him, just like we out-organized my opponent the year before \nlast in South Carolina. That is why I am still here and able to talk.\n  I don't buy cars in campaigns, but it was suggested that a lot of \nother candidates do. When they rent, lease, and then later buy a piece \nof property, all of that is not freedom of speech. That is money. It is \ncontributions. It is where you ought to try to control the spending \nlimits so we don't become a bunch of millionaires and instead go back \nto what Russell Long said: Every mother's son would be able to run for \nthe highest office in the land.\n  I could go on and on. The afternoon is late. To repeal the first \namendment, the Senator from Washington turned to the Senator from \nKentucky and said, read that word, that is to ``repeal'' the first \namendment. Now, if you believe that, you go ahead and vote against \nthis. But you know and I know, it is to repeal the corruption. That is \nwhat I am about; I am trying to repeal the corruption. I am trying to \nget back to the original intent. Yes, you might say we had 38 votes. I \nremember when we had 52 votes, a majority, for this. I remember when I \nhad a dozen Republican cosponsors.\n  I admire my colleague from Pennsylvania for sticking with me on this, \nmaking it bipartisan. But I don't know of another one over there, \nbecause they have been disciplined and put right into the trough and \ntold: You stick with us. This is a party vote, and this is it. It is \nfreedom of speech and don't you forget it.\n  It is not freedom of speech. It is money. We are trying to control \nthe purchase of the office. We are trying to correct the corruption. We \nare trying to get back to our work on behalf of the people, which is \nvery difficult to do with the pressures now on Senators up here. It is \ndisgraceful. It is absolutely disgraceful. Everybody knows it. I want \nsomebody to contest it. They are not around. They are not going to \ncontest it. They are going to make these comments about so many years \nand so many amendments and the freedom of speech and the hallowed \ndocument and everything else.\n  I have gone down five of the last six amendments; all had to do with \nelections, less important than this corruption to be corrected, far \nless a threat. I admit, recognize, agree with the Senator from North \nDakota that we shouldn't do it lightly, and we are not doing it \nlightly. If it was only a minor problem, whereby we could merely pass a \nstatute, I would do it. But all of these statutes, McCain-Feingold, as \nthe Senator from Kentucky has contended each time, is patently \nunconstitutional. You can tell from reading this most recent decision \non soft money how they are equating everything with speech. You can see \nhow they have immunized their mistake from change. Those are not my \nwords. Those are Justice Kennedy's words. They have ``immunized'' their \nmistake from change.\n  So we have to have a constitutional amendment. This is written very \ncarefully, very deliberately, and very reasonably, where we don't take \nsides one way or the other, whether you are for or against McCain-\nFeingold, whether you are for or against free TV time, whether you are \nfor or against public financing, whether you are for or against your \nidea you have on campaign finance. This will constitutionalize it so we \ncan quit this sham of beating around the bush. It is hit and run \ndriving with a, yes, I am for reform, knowing good and well that the \nCourt is going to throw it out when it gets there. So we can find out \nwho is who and what is what. I understand that this corruption should \ncease.\n  I want to complete the thought I was making with respect to various \ncomments of the Senator from Washington, Mr. Gorton, who said they are \nbeing denied under the Hollings amendment the right to speak at all. \nNot so. The person being denied the right to speak at all in political \ncampaigns is the individual without the money.\n  Take a campaign against a very affluent or wealthy person, and they \nbuy up all the time. At the end, you do not have the money to match it. \nThe TV station calls you and says: Here are all of these time slots \ngotten by your opponent, and you have the right to equal it. I don't \nhave the money. Before long, with all of the friends, the family says: \nWell, I don't understand why John doesn't answer him. He is not \ninterested in this race. He is not working. He looks slovenly. Why? \nBecause he doesn't have the money.\n  That is the point. Right now, I am trying to prepare, along with the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, for being denied the right to \nspeak at all. That is under the Buckley v. Valeo decision. If you have \nmoney, you can speak until the sky is the limit and for how long your \nmoney will take you. If you do not have the money, you have the right \nto get lockjaw, shut up, and sit down, that ends it, because 85 percent \nof your money goes to television and you are not there.\n  The people do not know you are in the race. They keep talking about \nrepealing the first amendment.\n  The distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, said that limiting \ncandidates would give special interests more power. It would create a \nvacuum, and the special interest would fill the vacuum. There isn't any \nvacuum, except for the poor. The special interests are in there to the \ntune of millions and millions. That is what we all know. We are trying \nto limit the special interests. We are not trying to create a vacuum \nthey can fill.\n  That is exactly the point of this particular amendment. You go over \nagain and again. They raise these straw men of exactly the opposite of \nwhat is intended and what is provided for in the Hollings-Specter \namendment; namely, to limit spending in Federal elections, and limit \nspending, of course, in State elections.\n  With respect to the cases, I cited the case where the individual got \ncaught trying to go around. I refer now to James W. Brosnan's article \nin The Commercial Appeal dated November 8, 1998.\n  The indictment of Chattanooga developer Franklin Haney highlights \nwhat some campaign reformers believe could be a frequent, but hard to \nprove, crime--companies reimbursing their employees for contributions.\n  The indictment charges that Haney and his administrative assistant, \nwho was not named in the indictment, instructed company employees to \nmake contributions of $1,000 apiece, filled out the donor cards \nthemselves and then wrote Haney Company checks to reimburse the \nemployees.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Commercial Appeal, Nov. 8, 1998]\n\n                Funneling to Campaigns May Be Widespread\n\n                         (By James W. Brosnan)\n\n       The indictment of Chattanooga developer Franklin Haney \n     highlights what some campaign reformers believe could be a \n     frequent, but hard to prove, crime--companies reimbursing \n     their employees for contributions.\n       ``I suspect it is a lot more widespread than foreign donors \n     trying to press dollars into the hands of American \n     politicians,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the \n     Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign watchdog group.\n       Haney Wednesday became the 14th person indicted by the \n     Justice Department's campaign finance task force. He is \n     charged with 42 counts of using his company's employees, \n     friends and relatives to make $86,500 in illegal corporate \n     contributions to the Clinton-Gore campaigns in 1992 and 1995, \n     and the Senate campaigns of former Tennessee Sen. Jim Sasser \n     and former Tennessee congressman Jim Cooper in 1994.\n       Haney has said he is innocent. The Justice Department said \n     none of the campaigns were aware of the deception. Sasser--\n     who lost to Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and became U.S. \n     ambassador to China--said in a statement: ``Although I myself \n     am not under investigation, I will of course cooperate \n     fully.''\n       In recent testimony before the House Commerce oversight \n     subcommittee, Sasser depicted Haney as someone eager to show \n     his\n\n[[Page S1736]]\n\n     credentials around Washington by hiring people like Sasser \n     and long-time Democratic fund-raiser Peter Knight. \n     Wednesday's indictment also describes someone who was willing \n     to violate the law in order to make good on his pledge to \n     raise $50,000 for the Clinton-Gore committee.\n       The indictment charges that Haney and his administrative \n     assistant, who was not named in the indictment, instructed \n     company employees to make contributions of $1,000 apiece, \n     filled out the donor cards themselves and then wrote Haney \n     Co. checks to reimburse the employees.\n       Justice Department officials indicate they discovered the \n     illegal contribution scheme when Haney came on their radar \n     screen because of reports concerning his hiring of Knight and \n     Sasser. They represented him in efforts to obtain a \n     government lease and private financing for the Portals office \n     complex here.\n       House Republicans have charged that the fees paid by Haney, \n     $1 million to Knight and $1.8 million to Sasser, may have \n     been illegal contingency fees. Government contractors may not \n     pay lobbyists based on whether a contract is awarded. The \n     Justice Department continues to investigate the Portals \n     lease.\n       Campaign finance experts say illegal corporate \n     contributions are seldom discovered unless a company employee \n     blows the whistle or the company comes under scrutiny for \n     another matter.\n       ``It's a scheme which is extremely difficult to uncover,'' \n     said Ellen Miller, executive director of Public Campaign, a \n     group which supports public financing of campaigns.\n       Gary Burhop, the lobbyist for Memphis-based Harrah's Inc., \n     said he doubts it's a frequent practice.\n       ``If it happens, it happens more out of ignorance than a \n     willful desire to violate the law,'' said Burhop, based on \n     his observation of cases before the Federal Election \n     Commission.\n       Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist \n     who has studied campaign finance laws for 25 years, said he \n     doesn't believe the practice ``is widespread, but I don't \n     think they catch everybody who does it, either. It's very \n     difficult to catch unless somebody snitches. You have a know \n     who to target.''\n       Haney's indictment was the second brought by the campaign \n     finance task force. On September 30, Mark Jimenez 52, of \n     Miami, the chief executive officer of Miami-based Future Tech \n     International, was charged with funneling $23,000 into the \n     Clinton-Gore campaign, and $16,500 into four other Democratic \n     campaigns, from his company and another controlled by a \n     relative.\n       Two companies have been prosecuted by local U.S. attorneys \n     for using straw donors to make illegal contributions to the \n     1996 presidential campaign of former Kansas Republican Bob \n     Dole.\n       Simon Fireman, a national vice chairman of Dole's campaign, \n     funneled $100,000 into Dole's campaign using employees of his \n     company, Aqua Leisure Industries of Avon, Mass. He paid a $6 \n     million fine.\n       Empire Sanitary Landfill of Scranton, Pa., pleaded guilty \n     to contributing $110,000 to the Dole and other Republican \n     campaigns through employees and paid an $8 million fine.\n       Independent counsel Donald Smaltz was appointed to \n     investigate football game tickets and other gifts to former \n     Agriculture secretary Mike Espy, but his four-year probe has \n     produced six convictions for illegal corporate campaign \n     contributions.\n       In one case, lobbyist Jim Lake arranged for $5,000 in \n     contributions to the 1994 Mississippi congressional campaign \n     of Espy's brother, Henry Espy, and then padded his expense \n     account to get the money back. He was fined $150,000 and \n     ordered to write and send descriptions of the campaign \n     finance law to 2,000 lobbyists.\n       In another, New Orleans attorney Alvarez Ferrouilet was \n     sentenced to one year in prison for disguising $20,000 in \n     illegal contributions to Espy.\n       The other cases have resulted in fines of $1.5 million \n     against Sun-Diamond Growers, $480,000 against Sun-Land \n     Products $80,000 against American Family Life Assurance Co., \n     and $2 million against Crop Growers Corp.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this is the pertinent part.\n  Simon Fireman, a national vice chairman of Dole's campaign, funneled \n$100,000 into Dole's campaign using employees of his company, Aqua \nLeisure Industries of Avon, MA. He paid a $6 million fine.\n  Empire Sanitary Landfill of Scranton, PA, pleaded guilty to \ncontributing $110,000 to Dole and other Republican campaigns through \nemployees and paid an $8 million fine.\n  Independent counsel Donald Smaltz was appointed to investigate Mike \nEspy, which we all know about.\n  I don't know what happened to Haney, or whether or not he was found \ninnocent. But let's assume so. I am not trying to disparage. I am just \ntrying to say here is the corruption that actually goes on.\n  In one case, lobbyist Jim Lake arranged for a $5,000 contribution to \nthe 1994 Mississippi congressional campaign of Espy's brother and then \npadded his expense account to get the money back. He was fined $150,000 \nand ordered to write and send descriptions of the campaign finance law \nto 2,000 lobbyists.\n  Another New Orleans attorney, Alvarez Ferrouilet, was sentenced to 1 \nyear in prison for disguising $20,000 in illegal contributions to Espy.\n  The other cases have resulted in fines of $1.5 million against Sun-\nDiamond Growers, $480,000 against Sun-Land Products, $80,000 against \nAmerican Family Life Assurance Company, and $2 million against the Crop \nGrowers Corporation.\n  This corruption is rampant, and you can't stop it unless you get this \nconstitutional amendment. Everyone understands what Justice Kennedy \nsaid--that you are not going to have this covert speech. You are not \ngoing around, and you are not going to employees, because the name of \nthe game is--I know because I ran for President. I know one State that \nI believe I could have taken, but the one who succeeded in taking it \nspent x thousands of dollars above the limit. It was 2 years later they \nfound out that he spent over the limit. That was the end of that.\n  What I am saying is, you can't control this. It is a Federal election \ncampaign practices commission because it is all ex post facto. It is \nlost in the dust.\n  This has been going on, particularly with you and I serving in the \nSenate. We can't talk sense, we can't debate, we can't get measures up, \nand we can't deliberate because we have been corrupted by the money \nchase.\n  Mondays and Fridays, gone; Tuesday morning, gone; windows here and \nthere and yonder for lunches, dinners, fund raisers, breaks now every \nmonth of the year. Why: They go raise some more money, and we are not \ngetting the work of the people done.\n  I was here when it worked, when we met at 9 o'clock on Monday \nmorning. Nobody was here at 9 o'clock this Monday morning. Nobody is \nhere now because they are all out raising money. I can tell you, we \nworked until Friday afternoon at 5 o'clock. Ask Senator Byrd. He \nremembers. He knows how hard we worked in those days when he was \nleader.\n  But the system and the Buckley v. Valeo cancer are overtaking all of \nus. We are all part of it. I have asked for windows, and I have had to \nchase at holidays. I continue to do so. I am saying to myself and to \nall of us that it is time we sort of fess up and understand that this \nhas to stop. We have to start working on behalf of the people and not \nourselves. Let's do away with the corruption. Let's get back to the \noriginal intent of Buckley v. Valeo, which was totally bipartisan and \noverwhelmingly passed. That was to limit spending or stop the buying of \nthe office.\n  We had that enough in 1978, which I explained because I know what was \ncalled upon in cash moneys in my particular State. It was listed all \nover the country. Connolly asked the President, and he went down to \ncollect. They put up with Dick Tuck in the Brinks truck as it turned \ninto the ranch in order to have the barbecue so the President could \nthank his contributors whom he had not even met.\n  We all were so embarrassed. It is bad when there is not even any \nembarrassment in this body. The corruption is exacerbated. I learned \nthat word having come to Washington--``exacerbate.'' It continues to \nexacerbate, and it gets worse and worse.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time, and I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, it is the \nleader's hope and intention to have a final vote on the pending \nconcurrent resolution before the Senate adjourns on Tuesday, March 28. \nHowever, if a consent agreement cannot be reached, a cloture vote will \noccur on Wednesday morning. With that in mind, I send a cloture motion \nto the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n\n[[Page S1737]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there has been a great deal of \nanticipation today on what OPEC might do. For those of you who do not \nrecall the sequence, several weeks ago, our Secretary of Energy went \nover to OPEC, encouraging them to increase production. The concern was \nthat we were approximately 56-percent dependent on imported oil. A good \nportion of that came from OPEC. As we saw with the Northeast Corridor \ncrisis on heating oils, there was concern over the availability of \nadequate supplies of crude oil. It appears that we are using somewhere \nin the area of 2 million barrels a day more in the world than are being \nproduced currently. That sent a shock through the oil marketeers and \nresulted in our Secretary going over to OPEC and meeting with the \nSaudis and urging them to increase production.\n  They indicated they were going to have a meeting on March 27, which \nis today, and would respond to us at that time. The Secretary indicated \nthat this was a dire emergency, that oil prices were increasing and the \nEast Corridor was looking at oil prices in the area of nearly one and a \nhalf dollars and he needed relief now. The OPEC nations--particularly \nthe Saudis--indicated they would address it at the March 27 meeting. \nSo, in other words, the Secretary was somewhat stiff-armed.\n  Well, the Secretary, as you know, went to Mexico and encouraged the \nMexicans to increase production. The Mexicans listened patiently, but \nthey reminded the Secretary that last year when oil was $10, $11, $12, \n$13 a barrel, and the Mexican economy was in the bucket, where was the \nUnited States? The Secretary indicated we would help Mexico out with \nthe tesobonos, ensuring that they would be bailed out. But to make a \nlong story short, we didn't get any relief from Mexico.\n  Well, today, we didn't get any relief from OPEC. OPEC said they would \naddress it tomorrow. So the question of whether or not we are going to \nget relief, I think, points to one thing: We have become addicted to \nimported oil. We are like somebody on the street who has to have a fix. \nThe fix is more imported oil. And when the supply is disrupted, we look \nat what it takes to get more.\n  Well, it takes maybe a higher payment, a shortage of supply. It makes \nthe price go up. That is the position we are in. I encourage my \ncolleagues to look very closely at what OPEC does tomorrow--indeed, if \nthey do anything--because what they have been doing so far is cheating. \nWho have they been cheating on? They have been cheating, in effect, on \nthemselves at our expense because last year they agreed to cut \nproduction. They developed a discipline within OPEC to cut production \nback to 23 million barrels per day. But they did not keep that \ncommitment. They are currently producing 24.2 million barrels a day. \nThat is about 1.2 million over the agreement.\n  So if they come up tomorrow and announce they are going to come out \nwith a million and a half barrels a day increase, that isn't a million \nand a half barrels net; the net is 300,000 barrels a day. So we better \ndarn well look at that arithmetic. If they come up with 2 million \nbarrels a day, that is relief, in a sense, but in the last year our \ndemand increase has been a million and a half barrels a day in \naddition, and I did not take into account my arithmetic. Remember, we \nare not the only ones in the world who consume oil from OPEC. Those \nother countries are going to have to share in whatever increased \nproduction comes out.\n\n  So it is indeed a rather interesting dilemma that we find ourselves \nin as we now are dependent 56 percent on imported oil. The Department \nof Energy tells us that in the years from 2015 and 2020, we will be 65-\npercent dependent on imported oil. Well, some people say you learn by \nhistory. Others say you do not learn very much. Obviously, we have not \nlearned very much.\n  There is one other factor I think the American people ought to \nunderstand. Where has our current increase been coming from? It has \nbeen coming from Iraq. Last year, we imported 300,000 barrels a day \nfrom Iraq. Today, we are importing 700,000 barrels a day from Iraq. \nToday, the Department of Commerce lifted some sanctions off of Iraq to \nallow the Iraqis to import from the United States certain parts so they \ncould increase--these are refinery parts--refining capacity by 600,000 \nbarrels a day in addition.\n  So here we are, importing 700,000 barrels a day currently from Iraq. \nSome people forgot we fought a war over there not so many years ago--in \n1991. What happened in that war? We lost 147 American lives; 423 were \nwounded in action, and we had 26 taken prisoner. In addition, the \nAmerican taxpayer took it. Where did he take it? He took it in the \nshorts because since the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, just to \ncontain Saddam Hussein and keep him within his boundaries, the cost of \nenforcing the no-fly zone and other things is costing the American \ntaxpayer $10 billion.\n  So here we are today looking at OPEC for relief, allowing them to get \nparts for their refineries so they can increase production. Here we are \ndepending and begging and passing the tin cup for OPEC production. The \nanswer lies in decreasing our imports on foreign oil and, as a \nconsequence, producing more oil and gas in the United States. We can do \nit safely. We have the American technology. We have the overthrust \nbelt, the Rocky Mountains, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Louisiana, \nTexas, those States that want OCS activity.\n  My State of Alaska is perfectly capable of producing more oil. We \nproduce nearly 20 percent of the total crude oil; it used to be 25. We \nhave the technology. We know how to open up the Arctic areas and make \nsure the animals and the character of the land are protected because we \nonly operate in the wintertime. Our roads are ice roads. They melt in \nthe spring. There is no footprint. If there is no oil there, there is \nno footprint of any kind. We can do that in these areas. But as a \nconsequence, we have to look for a solution.\n  I hope my colleagues really pick up on this. If OPEC does increase \nproduction, there are going to be those who claim victory, that we got \nrelief. But it is going to be a hollow victory because that victory \nsimply says our Nation becomes more dependent on imported oil. I think \nmost Americans are waking up to the reality that that is a very \ndangerous policy. To suggest we got caught by surprise--I will conclude \nwith two little notes. In 1994, Secretary of Commerce Brown requested \nthat the independent petroleum producers do an evaluation on the \nnational energy security of this country and came to the conclusion \nthat we were too dependent on imported oil.\n  Last March, Members of the Senate wrote a bipartisan letter to the \nSecretary of Commerce, Secretary Daley, asking for an evaluation on the \nnational security interests of our country relative to our increased \ndependence on imported oil. He released that report in November. It sat \non the President's desk until Friday. They finally released it in a \nbrief overview.

Mr. President, over the past several years, our \nnation's military has become increasingly overcommitted and \nunderfunded--facing problems from recruiting and retention, to cuts in \nactive fleet numbers and a dwindling active duty force. Yet in spite of \nthese problems, the United States' naval power, with it's fleet of \nnuclear-powered attack submarines, life-saving Coast Guard and Merchant \nMarine forces, and highly skilled sailors and mariners, is the best in \nthe world. These components are a part of one of the most \ntechnologically sophisticated defense systems in the world. In Kings \nBay, Georgia, we are fortunate to be home to the greatest submarine \nbase in the nation, Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base. During my visits \nthere, however, I have heard time and again how detrimental the growing \ngap between commitments and funding has become.\n  I believe that by appropriating additional funds to our nation's \ndefense system and by supporting efforts to create a larger force \nstructure, we will resolve or at least begin to remedy some of these \nproblems that are facing today's military forces. Since I came to the \nSenate in 1997, I have supported funding for procurement, research and \ndevelopment, and readiness. In order for the United States to retain \nit's role as a military super power, we must pay attention to the gaps \nthat exist today and prevent further deterioration in our armed forces. \nIf we do not reverse this trend now, a very high price will be paid \ntomorrow for our collective lethargy on defense issues and for the \nmassive under-funding of our armed forces.\n  Mr. President, I now respectfully request that an article from the \nJanuary, 2000 edition of Seapower magazine be inserted into the Record, \nas I believe it accurately and appropriately outlines the existing gap \nbetween our commitments and resources, and effectively argues the case \nfor remedying this situation.\n  Thank you.\n\n                 [From Almanac of Seapower, Jan. 2000]\n\n                        A Tale of Two Centuries\n\n                            (By John Fisher)\n\n       The old century had come to an end and the United States, \n     its armed services triumphant from victory in a splendid \n     little war over a technologically inferior adversary, as \n     ready to take its rightful place among the major military and \n     economic powers of the world. A former assistant secretary of \n     the Navy, who became a national hero in that war, was soon to \n     become president and use his bully pulpit for, among other \n     things, the building of a Great White Fleet that was the \n     first step in making the United States a naval power ``second \n     to none.''\n       That former assistant secretary, later president, Theodore \n     Roosevelt, was a shrewd judge of human nature and a life-long \n     student of American history. He knew that most of his fellow \n     Americans had little if any interest in foreign affairs, or \n     in national-security issues in general. Roosevelt himself was \n     a staunch advocate of the seapower principles postulated by \n     Alfred Thayer Mahan, whom he greatly admired. So to remedy \n     the situation he helped found the Navy League of the United \n     States in 1902, contributing significant financial as well as \n     moral support.\n       There were many, of course, in the Congress and in the \n     media--indeed, in Roosevelt's own cabinet--who were not sure \n     that the Great White Fleet was needed. It cost too much and, \n     despite its fine appearance, would have little if any \n     practical value for a nation unchallenged in its own \n     hemisphere and unlikely ever to send its sons to fight in \n     Europe's wars, much less Asia's. Besides, there might be an \n     occasional colonial war here and there, but the possibility \n     of a direct war between the major powers of Europe was \n     becoming more and more remote with each passing year.\n       Within less than five years the vision of a lasting peace \n     throughout the world was demolished when the Japanese Navy \n     shocked the world by defeating the Russian Navy in the Battle \n     of Tsushima (27-28 May 1905), sinking eight Russian \n     battleships and seven Russian cruisers. The Japanese fleet, \n     which started the war a year earlier with a surprise attack \n     on Russian ships anchored in Port Arthur, lost three torpedo \n     boats at Tsushima.\n       Less than a decade later The Great War--``the war to end \n     all wars,'' it was called--started in Europe. The United \n     States remained a nonparticipant until April 1917, but then \n     entered the war in force. U.S. seapower contributed \n     significantly to the eventual Allied success. The joyous \n     Armistice of 11 November 1918, however, was followed by the \n     debacle at Versailles that sowed the seeds of World War II.\n       Again, America and its allies were not prepared. The United \n     States once again stayed on the sidelines until jolted out of \n     its lethargy by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor: That \n     put 15 million American men and women in uniform, led to \n     total mobilization of the U.S. economy--and of the mighty \n     U.S. industrial base--and resulted in millions of deaths \n     later on the unconditional surrender of both Nazi Germany \n     and Imperial Japan. The century was less than half over, \n     but it was already the most violent in all human history.\n       This time around, some lessons were learned--but not very \n     well, and they were not remembered very long. When North \n     Korea invaded South Korea the United States again was \n     unprepared--as it was a generation later in Vietnam. The Cold \n     War cast a nuclear shadow over the entire world for more than \n     four decades, though, and forced the much-needed rebuilding, \n     modernization, and upgrading of America's armed forces.\n       As the world enters a new century, and new millennium, \n     those forces are the most powerful, most mobile, and most \n     versatile in the world. Moreover, the young Americans in \n     service today are the best-led, best-trained, and best-\n     equipped in this nation's history. But that does not mean \n     that they are capable of carrying out all of the numerous \n     difficult and exceedingly complex missions they have been \n     assigned. The victories of the past are no guarantee of \n     success in future conflicts. And it is not foreordained that \n     the so-called ``American century'' that has now ended will be \n     extended by another uninterrupted period of U.S. economic and \n     military dominance.\n       Operation Allied Force, the U.S./NATO air war over Kosovo, \n     is a helpful case in point. The precision strikes against \n     Serbian forces, and against the civilian infrastructure of \n     the former Yugoslavia, eventually led to the withdrawal of \n     Serbian troops from Kosovo and the occupation of that \n     battered province by U.S./NATO and Russian peacekeepers. The \n     one-sided ``war'' lasted much longer than originally \n     estimated, though. It did not ``stop the killings'' (of \n     ethnic Albanians), the original purpose of the war. And it \n     left Slobodan Milosevic still in power in Belgrade.\n       It is perhaps inevitable that political leaders will focus \n     almost exclusively on the ``victories''--however fleeting and \n     however gossamer--that can be claimed. The prudent military \n     commander, though, will focus on the problem areas, the near-\n     defeats and potential disasters, the ``What-ifs'' and the \n     close calls. There were an abundance of all of these in \n     Kosovo last year--just as there were in the war with Iraq in \n     1990-91.\n       Logistics is the first and perhaps most important of those \n     problem areas--and the biggest ``What if'' as well. In both \n     conflicts. In the war with Iraq the question was ``What if \n     Saddam Hussein had not stopped with Kuwait but continued into \n     Saudi Arabia and all the way to Riyadh?'' The answer--on \n     this, virtually all military analysts agree--is that the war \n     would have lasted much longer and would have cost much more \n     in both lives and money. As it was, it took the greatest \n     sealift in history before the vastly superior U.S./\n     coalition forces could defeat the previously overrated \n     Iraqi army. That massive sealift--more than 10 million \n     tons of supplies carried halfway around the world--would \n     have been impossible, though, were it not for the fact \n     that, on the receiving end, Saudi Arabia had built a \n     large, modern, and well-protected port infrastructure.\n       Logistics was not a problem in Kosovo, either--but only \n     because the U.S./NATO air\n\n[[Page S1739]]\n\n     forces accomplished their mission (belatedly), and ground \n     forces did not have to be brought in. It was a close call, \n     though--more so than is generally realized--and the end \n     result was due more to good fortune than to careful planning. \n     The ports in the area that might have been available to U.S./\n     NATO shipping are few in number, inefficient, extremely \n     limited in their throughput capacity, and vulnerable both to \n     sabotage and to attack by ground forces. Which is exactly why \n     U.S. sealift planners say that a ground war in Kosovo would \n     have been ``a logistics nightmare.''\n       Nightmares aside, there are other problems, of much greater \n     magnitude, affecting all of the nation's armed forces. All \n     are underfunded. All are overcommitted--usually, in recent \n     years, to humanitarian and peacekeeping missions that, \n     however worthwhile in themselves, detract from operational \n     readiness and from the training required for actual combat \n     missions.\n       There is more: The U.S. defense structure is the leanest it \n     has been in the post-WWII era. Funding for the acquisition \n     and procurement of ships, aircraft, weapons, and avionics/\n     electronics systems has been cut precipitously in recent \n     years and the result has been a steady decline in the size--\n     and, therefore, responsiveness--of the vital U.S. defense \n     industrial base.\n       Except for the Marine Corps, all of the services also are \n     suffering from prolonged recruiting and retention problems \n     that, if not resolved, will lead to a ``hollow force'' of the \n     early 21st century similar to that of the late 1970s. There \n     is increasing evidence, anecdotal but mounting, that combat \n     readiness has declined.\n       Following are some particulars about how the various \n     problem areas enumerated above have affected the nation's sea \n     services--balanced by a report on the current strengths and \n     capabilities, as well as needs, of each service.\n       Since the end of the Cold War the Navy's active fleet has \n     been cut almost in half, and is now just over 300 ships, the \n     lowest level since the early 1930s. What makes the situation \n     worse is that the administration's future-years defense plan \n     (FYDP) calls for construction of only 6-7 ships per year for \n     the foreseeable future, whereas a building rate of 9-10 ships \n     is needed to meet the minimum requirement of 305 ships \n     postulated by the Quadrennial Defense Review. Independent \n     defense analysts say that a more realistic estimate of Navy \n     fleet requirements would be anywhere from 350 to 400 ships, \n     depending on the scenarios postulated. To maintain a fleet of \n     that size would require a building rate of 10-12 ships per \n     year.\n       Exacerbating the ship-numbers problem is the fact that, \n     because hundreds of Cold War U.S. air and ground bases \n     overseas have now been closed, and hundreds of thousands of \n     troops have returned to CONUS (the Continental United \n     States), a much heavier share of the collective defense \n     burden is now borne by the Navy's forward-deployed carrier \n     battle groups (CVBGs) and Navy/Marine Corps amphibious \n     ready groups (ARGs). In many areas of the world the CVBGs \n     and ARGs are now the only combat-ready forces immediately \n     available to the national command authorities.\n       The difficulties imposed on Navy carriers are particularly \n     heavy. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have told Congress that a \n     minimum of 15 active-fleet carriers are needed to maintain a \n     continuous presence in the most likely areas of international \n     crisis--i.e., the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean, and the \n     Western Pacific (particularly the waters off the Korean \n     Peninsula and, more recently, in the Taiwan Strait between \n     the People's Republic of China on the mainland and the \n     Republic of China on Taiwan). With only 12 carriers now \n     available--11 in the active fleet and one reserve carrier \n     used primarily for training purposes--the Navy has had to \n     adopt a ``gapping'' strategy that leaves one or more of these \n     ``hot spots'' without a carrier for several weeks, or \n     sometimes months, at a time. In today's fast-paced era of \n     naval warfare, the Navy League said last year, the gapping \n     strategy is ``not a prudent risk, as it is sometimes \n     described, but an invitation to conflict.''\n       The Navy's fleet of nuclear-powered attack submarines \n     (SSNs) is the best in the world, but also undersized to meet \n     all current as well as projected commitments. According to \n     force requirements provided to the Joint Chiefs of Staff by \n     the regional commanders in chief, more than 70 SSNs are \n     needed to meet all of the Navy's worldwide commitments--but \n     there will be only 50 available unless the QDR levels are \n     revised upward. This could pose major risks in areas where \n     land-based enemy aircraft and missiles make it difficult for \n     carriers and other surface ships to operate close to the \n     littorals.\n       The Navy's SSBN (nuclear-powered ballistic missile \n     submarine) force continues to be the dominant and most \n     survivable leg of the U.S. strategic-deterrent ``triad'' of \n     SSBNs, manned bombers, and intercontinental ballistic \n     missiles. There are now 18 Trident SSBNs in the active fleet, \n     but only 14 are likely to be needed in the future. The \n     proposed conversion into an SSGN (nuclear-powered guided-\n     missile submarine) configuration of the four SSBNs now slated \n     for deactivation would add significantly to the Navy's \n     overall power-projection capabilities and compensate to some \n     extent for current deficiencies in surface combatants.\n       Perhaps the brightest stars in the current fleet inventory \n     are the Aegis guided-missile cruisers and destroyers that \n     played such a key role in the Gulf War and in several lower-\n     scale combat actions since then. The combat-proven \n     effectiveness of the Aegis fleet has made it a strong \n     candidate to serve as the principal building block for the \n     national-missile-defense system favored by Congress and \n     likely to be built in the first decade of the new century.\n       Navy aircraft and weapon systems also are the best and most \n     technologically sophisticated in the world. Because of the \n     continued underfunding in procurement and acquisition, \n     however, all of these fleet assets have been considerably \n     overworked, a spare parts shortage has developed, and the \n     maintenance workload has increased significantly.\n       The U.S. Marine Corps has changed commandants, but \n     continues the march--and its proud tradition of always being \n     ``the most ready when the nation is least ready.''\n       That mandate from Congress is more daunting on the eve of \n     the 21st century than it has been at any previous time since \n     the dark days preceding World War II and the Korean War. In \n     both of those conflicts the Marines suffered a \n     disproportionate number of casualties, particularly in the \n     early months of fighting--primarily because forward-deployed \n     Marine units had to hold the line until the nation (and the \n     other armed forces) could catch up to the Marines in \n     readiness.\n       Today, all of the nation's armed services are in a \n     reasonable state of readiness. But the operating tempo is the \n     highest it has ever been in peacetime, and most deployments \n     in the past several years have been for humanitarian and \n     peacekeeping assignments rather than for combat missions. \n     Training has suffered, therefore, and there has been a slow \n     but steady degradation of combat readiness--well-documented \n     in hearings before the House Armed Services Committee.\n       Under former commandant Gen. Charles C. Krulak the USMC's \n     senior leaders developed a cogent and forward-looking plan to \n     field a 21st-century Marine Corps that will be fully combat-\n     ready to meet the assymetric challenges likely in the \n     foreseeable future. It will be up to Gen. James L. Jones Jr., \n     who succeeded Krulak on 1 July 1999, to implement that plan. \n     But significant additional funding will be needed for, among \n     other things:\n       Maintaining the Corps at its current authorized strength of \n     approximately 172,000 Marines on active duty and in the \n     Reserves;\n       Modernizing the Corps' Total Force with the aircraft, \n     weapons, rolling stock, electronics and avionics systems, and \n     other supplies and equipment needed to maintain combat \n     superiority on the littoral and inland battlefields of the \n     future;\n       Building, upgrading, and maintaining a self-sustaining \n     expeditionary tactical aviation force, including the \n     revolutionary V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft, which can \n     operate from aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships, \n     and/or expeditionary airfields ashore.\n       Expediting the early development and procurement of: (a) \n     the joint strike fighter, which USMC leaders have told \n     Congress is urgently needed both to maintain a modern \n     tactical aviation force and to replace the obsolescent \n     aircraft now in the Corps' inventory; and (b) advanced \n     amphibious assault vehicles capable of safely and swiftly \n     carrying Marines and their equipment to and over the beaches \n     to positions that in some combat scenarios will be far \n     inland; and\n       Implementing Corps-sponsored initiatives to develop and \n     field the advanced-capability shallow-water mine \n     countermeasures systems needed to allow future Marine assault \n     forces to maneuver safely through the littorals.\n       Alone of all the services, the Marine Corps has \n     consistently met its recruiting and retention goals in recent \n     years. Several studies suggest that this is because the \n     Marine Corps keeps a clear focus on its highest priorities--\n     ``Making Marines and Winning Battles''--and that young men \n     and women respond more readily to that inspiring challenge \n     than they do to the less lofty appeal of material \n     benefits.\n       Today's Coast Guard remains Semper Paratus--but just \n     barely, and at a very high price. The U.S. Coast Guard is \n     perhaps the most overworked and underfunded agency in \n     government today, but it carries out--efficiently and at \n     minimum cost to the taxpayer--a multitude of missions that \n     increase almost annually. Several studies suggest that the \n     Coast Guard returns a minimum of four dollars in services for \n     every tax dollar provided to the multimission service in \n     appropriations.\n       The Coast Guard is also the world's premier lifesaving \n     organization, and in recent years has saved an annual average \n     of more than 5,000 lives--and has assisted many more \n     thousands of people in distress on the seas, on the Great \n     Lakes, and in the nation's inland and coastal waterways.\n       But lifesaving is only one of the many ``services to \n     taxpayers'' in the USCG portfolio. In recent years the Coast \n     Guard has also, on average: conducted 44,000 law-enforcement \n     boardings, identifying 24,000 violations; seized 76,000 \n     pounds of marijuana and 62,000 pounds of cocaine; \n     investigated 6,200 marine accidents; inspected 23,000 \n     commercial vessels; responded to 12,400 spills of oil or \n     hazardous materials; serviced 55,000 aids to navigation; and \n     interdicted 10,000 illegal migrants.\n       To carry out all of those missions in the future, however--\n     and several others likely to be added--the Coast Guard needs \n     a major recapitalization of virtually its entire physical \n     plant: ships, aircraft, electronic and sensor systems, and \n     shore facilities. To its credit,\n\n[[Page S1740]]\n\n     the Coast Guard itself has taken the initiative by developing \n     a so-called IDS (Integrated Deepwater System) plan that, if \n     fully funded, would permit an orderly and cost-effective \n     replacement of cutters, aircraft, and other assets over a \n     period of years. Failure of the executive and legislative \n     branches of government to support and fully fund that plan \n     would cripple the Coast Guard's continued effectiveness--and \n     would cost the American people in numerous ways.\n       Even today, very few Americans realize how dependent the \n     United States is on the U.S.-flag Merchant Marine for \n     national defense and its continued economic well-being. In \n     times of war or international crises that might lead to war \n     95 percent or more of the weapons, supplies, and equipment \n     needed by U.S. forces overseas must be carried by ship--\n     usually over thousands of miles of ocean. It would be \n     military folly to rely on foreign-flag shipping to carry that \n     cargo.\n       Most innovations in the maritime industries in the post-\n     WWII era--e.g., containerization, LASH (lighter aboard ship) \n     vessels, and RO/ROs (roll-on/roll-off ships)--have been of \n     American origin, and the United States is by far the greatest \n     trading nation in the entire world. Literally millions of \n     U.S. jobs, and billions of tax dollars, are generated by the \n     import and export of raw materials and finished products into \n     and out of U.S. ports.\n       The port infrastructure itself is badly in need of \n     renovation and remodernization, however. Because of short-\n     sighted laissez-faire economic policies, U.S.-flag ships \n     today carry only a minor fraction of America's two-way \n     foreign trade. The result is the loss of thousands of \n     seafaring jobs, significantly reduced U.S. sealift \n     capacity, and a Merchant Marine that is now in extremis.\n       The creation of the Maritime Security Program was a helpful \n     first step toward recovery, but it will take many years, \n     perhaps decades, before the U.S.-flag fleet can regain its \n     traditional title as ``the vital Fourth Arm'' of national \n     defense.\n       Additional funding, and a larger force structure, will \n     resolve or at least ameliorate some of the most difficult \n     problems now facing the nation's armed services, not only in \n     procurement and RDT (research, development, test, and \n     evaluation) but also in readiness. More and better equipment, \n     combined with a lower operating tempo and higher pay, would \n     in turn have a salutary effect on both recruiting and \n     retention.\n       There are more intractable problems, though, that all the \n     money in the world will not resolve--and that should be of \n     major concern not only to the nation's armed services and \n     defense decision makers, but to all Americans. The most \n     difficult and most obvious of these problems is the \n     proliferation in recent years of weapons of mass destruction \n     (WMDs), and the means to deliver them. There already are a \n     dozen or more nations--several of them extremely hostile to \n     the United States--that already possess (or are close to \n     acquiring) more destructive power than was unleashed by all \n     the armies and navies in the world during World II.\n       It can be taken for granted that WMDs soon will be \n     available to terrorist groups as well. But what is even more \n     alarming is the near certainty that neither the United States \n     nor the so-called ``global community'' at large will take the \n     probably draconian steps that would be needed to counter this \n     unprecedented threat. Not, that is, until weapons of mass \n     destruction are actually used by terrorists. The only real \n     question here is not ``if,'' but ``when.''\n       There are other dangers, other problems, other defense \n     issues of transcendent importance that must be attended to at \n     the start of this new century and new millennium. The \n     succession in Russia, for example. In China as well. The \n     mentally unbalanced military adventurism of the leaders of \n     North Korea. The list could go on and on.\n       Quite possibly the greatest threats to world peace, though, \n     are American complacency and American lethargy. The history \n     of the 20th century shows that, once aroused to action, the \n     American people can and will unite to defeat any enemy, no \n     matter how long it takes or how much it costs. That history \n     also shows, though, that it takes more than education and \n     persuasion to unite the American people. It takes sudden and \n     painful shock.\n       The problem here is that, in the past, the nation always \n     had time to recuperate from its initial losses, and even from \n     a Pearl Harbor. That may no longer be the case. There is now \n     a bipartisan consensus that the United States should build \n     and deploy a national-mission-defense (NMD) system as soon as \n     ``practicable.'' If that consensus had existed several years \n     ago the need today might not be so urgent. As it \n     is, relatively few Americans realize that the United \n     States is still absolutely vulnerable to enemy missile \n     attacks. Another way of saying it is that not one U.S. \n     missile-defense system has yet been deployed that could \n     shoot down even one incoming enemy missile. That is a \n     sobering thought.\n       The old axiom says that leadership ``begins at the top.'' \n     But in a democracy that is not entirely true. If the American \n     people demand a certain course of action loud enough and long \n     enough,the elected ``leaders'' in the executive and \n     legislative branches of government almost always will follow. \n     In the field of national defense the American people have \n     demanded very little in recent years, and, with a few notable \n     exceptions, that is exactly what they have been provided.\n       In his prescient ``Prize Essay'' (The Foundation of Naval \n     Policy) in the April 1934 Naval Institute Proceedings Lt. \n     Wilfred J. Holmes argued persuasively that the size of the \n     fleet (and, by implication, the size and composition of all \n     naval/military forces) should always be consistent with \n     national policy. ``Failure to adjust the size of navies to \n     the needs of external [i.e., national] policy--or, \n     conversely, to adjust external national policy to the \n     strength of the military fleet--has, in the past, frequently \n     led to disaster,'' Holmes said. At the 1922 Limitation of \n     Armaments conference, he noted, the United States \n     ``relinquished naval primacy in the interests of worldwide \n     limitations of armaments.'' Unfortunately, though, ``the \n     retrenchment in [U.S.] naval strength was not followed by \n     retrenchment in the field of national policy.''\n       The circumstances are not exactly the same today--but they \n     are close enough. The current operating tempo, for all of the \n     nation's armed services, is the highest it has ever been in \n     peacetime. Commitments have been increasing annually, without \n     commensurate increases in funding. Ships, aircraft, and \n     weapon systems are wearing out--and so are our military \n     people. The ``gapping'' of aircraft carriers in areas of \n     potential crisis is an invitation to disaster--and, \n     therefore, represents culpable negligence on the part of \n     America's defense decision makers.\n       Eventually, a very high price will have to be paid for \n     these many long years of national lethargy, for the massive \n     underfunding of the nation's armed forces, and for the \n     continued mismatch between commitments and resources. When \n     that time comes--sooner is much more likely than later--it \n     may well be the darkest day in this nation's history.\n       Is there still time to reverse course? Perhaps. But not \n     much time. And the leadership may well have to come not from \n     those who hold high office in Washington, but from the \n     American people themselves.\n       If they do provide that leadership, there will indeed be \n     another American century. It will not be another century of \n     violence, but of peace.\n       Peace on earth, for all mankind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/27/senate-section/article/S1740-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     JOHN McCAIN, AN AMERICAN HERO\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nsalute my dear friend and colleague, the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, John McCain. Although he has suspended his campaign for \nPresident, he should nonetheless know that he has scored a great \nvictory in American electoral politics. More so than any other \ncandidate in recent memory, Senator McCain has beaten two of the \ngreatest enemies facing our political system in the twenty-first \ncentury--apathy and cynicism. We should all be grateful to him for \nreminding Americans that ``politics'' is not a dirty word, that \ncampaigns can be about more than 30 second sound bites, and that heroes \nstill exist. We in the Senate should all feel proud to call him one of \nour own.\n  I think I and the four other Vietnam veterans in the Senate feel a \nparticular kinship with Senator McCain, for obvious reasons. You do not \ngo through an experience like combat without being profoundly affected. \nYou recognize a change in yourself when you come home, and you \nrecognize it in others when you meet them for the first time. You are \nbrothers. We are brothers. But why did the rest of America respond to \nSenator McCain so strongly? Why did the ``Straight Talk Express'' \nappear every night on the evening news? Why did so many people want to \nsee Luke Skywalker emerge out of the Death Star?\n  I believe it is because John McCain reacts to challenges the way we \nwish we would ourselves, but fear we might not. He remained in the \nHanoi Hilton for seven years with his fellow P.O.W.'s even when he \ncould have left. He fights for campaign finance reform, for strong \naction to reduce youth smoking, and for curbs in pork barrel spending \neven when he knows it will make him unpopular with his party. He shoots \nfrom the hip. He tells reporters how he really feels. He loves his \nfamily.\n  He is not perfect, but none of us are. He and I disagree on many \nissues, but we agree on this: that the purpose of politics is to \ngenerate hope, that serving our country--as a soldier or a sailor or a \nSenator--is the greatest honor of a person's life, and that, in the \nwords of Babe Ruth, ``It's hard to beat a person who won't give up.''\n  Speaking for myself, I am a loyal Democrat who strongly supports the \ncandidacy of Al Gore. But as an American and as a fellow Vietnam \nveteran, I am proud of the work John has done, and will no doubt \ncontinue to do, in restoring the public's faith in their government and \nthe political process.\n  Mr. President, John McCain is an authentic American hero, and I am \nproud to serve along side him.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/27/senate-section/article/S1741-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1741]]\n                          HEROES OF THE STORM\n\n Mr. CLELAND.

In \nthe pre-dawn hours of Valentine's day, February 14th, the town of \nCamilla, Georgia was hit by a series of brutal tornadoes that took the \nlives of nearly twenty people. This storm caused not only terrible \ndamage--destroying homes, farms and businesses--but it tested the \nlimits of residents across the Southwest portion of the state. It has \nbeen said that ``Poor is the nation which has no heroes. Poorer still \nis the nation which has them, but forgets.'' When the storm calmed, \ntrue heroes emerged and they should be recognized.\n  I ask that I may be able to insert into the Congressional Record a \nlist of individuals, organizations, and area businesses that made all \nthe difference in preparing the people of Mitchell, Grady, Colquitt, \nand Tift counties for recovery from this tragic event. This list \nreflects only a portion of the many groups and individuals who reached \nout to our communities in their time of need. There are others who are \noften lost in the shuffle, whose movements and actions did not attract \nthe media's spotlight.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend an \norganization that has given consistently to our communities over the \npast 89 years. I am proud to honor the National Exchange Club--an \norganization that can be characterized by the word ``service''--as it \ncelebrates the anniversary of its founding.\n  The National Exchange Club is a volunteer group of men and women \ndedicated to serving their communities. Founded in 1911 by Charles A. \nBerkey, the organization has grown from a single group in Detroit, \nMichigan to nearly 1,000 clubs and 33,000 members throughout the United \nStates and Puerto Rico. in my home state of Minnesota, there are more \nthan 20 clubs committed to making our state and nation a better place \nto live.\n  In keeping with its rich history of helping others, the Exchange Club \nhas established Child Abuse Prevention as its national project. By \nutilizing a wide array of educational programs, local clubs work to \ncreate public awareness of child abuse and develop relationships with \nparents to counter abuse. This program has helped more than 140,000 \nchildren since 1979.\n  Exchange members participate in a variety of other services, such as \nYouth Programs and Americanism. The Exchange Club's variety of youth \nprograms encourage and recognize students who display good citizenship, \ncommunity involvement, and scholastic achievement, and serve as \nvolunteers. Clearly, its efforts are shaping the citizens of the \nfuture. Exchange's Americanism efforts spread pride in our nation and \nwork to foster an awareness of the wonderful freedoms with which our \ncountry is blessed.\n  The numerous other community service activities the National Exchange \nClub undertakes are focused on helping the largest number of citizens \nas possible in their respective communities. All individuals in a \ncommunity benefit from the club's crime and fire prevention efforts, \nits Book of Golden Deeds Award, and the Service to Seniors program.\n  For 89 years, the volunteers of the National Exchange Club have \ndedicated themselves to the betterment of our communities. I applaud \nthem on their achievements and wish them a prosperous future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/27/senate-section/article/S1741-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO MR.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Thomas D. \nBrasher, a native of my home state of Louisiana, who will be retiring \nat month's end after a thirty-five-year career in law enforcement, \nincluding thirty years as a postal inspector with the U.S. Postal \nInspection Service. At the time of his retirement, he will be sixth in \nseniority among the nation's 2,115 postal inspectors. Although a native \nof Alexandria, Louisiana, Mr. Brasher has worked with the U.S. Postal \nInspection Service in California.\n  Tom Brasher began his law enforcement career in Lafayette, Louisiana, \nin 1964, when he joined that city's auxiliary police force while \nattending the University of Southwestern Louisiana. He became a regular \nofficer in 1965 and worked in patrol. He joined the Louisiana State \nPolice in 1966, where he worked until 1970 when he was recruited by the \nPostal Inspection Service.\n  Mr. Brasher's Inspection Service career was in the San Francisco \nDivision, now the Northern California Division. Except for a four-year \nstint in San Francisco, he worked his entire career in San Jose. Mr. \nBrasher was primarily involved in investigating external crimes and was \nthe first External Crimes Prevention Specialist for the division. He \ncovered all of seven states and the Pacific Islands in that assignment. \nHe also had assignments in child pornography, embezzlements, and the \nmonitoring of the design and construction of post offices. He also \nserved as an ad-hoc EEO counselor for a four-division area. His last \nassignments have been on the San Jose External Crimes Team, the San \nFrancisco Bay Area Violent Crimes Team, the Northern California \nWorkplace Violence Team and a detail to the Postal Service's robbery \ntask force.\n  While Mr. Brasher will retire, his wife, Gay Ann, an award-winning \nschool teacher in San Jose, will continue her teaching career. Together \nthey will continue their travels, which so far have taken them to 94 \ncountries around the world.\n  I know I speak for my Senate colleagues when I wish Tom and Gay Ann \nBrasher all the best in this new phase of their lives and thank him for \nthirty years of distinguished service to the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/27/senate-section/article/S1742-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1742]]\n            LOUISIANA BUSINESS LEADER BILL RAINEY TO RETIRE\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to honor longtime Baton Rouge \nbusiness and community leader Bill Rainey, site manager of ExxonMobil's \nBaton Rouge Chemical Plant. Bill is retiring at the end of this month \nafter a 33-year Exxon career that began at the company's Baton Rouge \nRefinery in 1966.\n  Those of us in government who spent parts of our careers in Baton \nRouge recognize Bill Rainey as one of the most tireless community \nleaders and effective problem solvers in the Louisiana capital. Bill's \nleadership in the community and direction of ExxonMobil's philanthropic \nworks will be hard to replace and the company's more than 4,000 \nemployees in Baton Rouge will miss his steady hand on the ExxonMobil \nrudder.\n  A native of Auburn, Alabama, Bill earned a bachelor's degree in \nchemical engineering from Auburn University in 1966 before embarking on \nhis Exxon career. He left Baton Rouge in 1973 for a three-year stint in \nExxon USA's Houston headquarters but returned to the Refinery in 1976 \nto accept the first of many management positions in Baton Rouge. In \n1985, he became manager of the Exxon Research and Development \nLaboratories (ERDL) in Baton Rouge before returning to the Refinery as \nmechanical manager in 1988.\n  Like many of Exxon's top performers around the world, he was called \nto Valdez, Alaska in 1989 where he served as operations manager for \nExxon's oil spill recovery and cleanup operations. In 1992, he was \nnamed manager of the Baton Rouge Refinery, where he served with \ndistinction until moving up Scenic Highway to the adjacent Baton Rouge \nChemical Plant as site manager in 1996.\n  While moving up the ranks to ExxonMobil's two top positions in Baton \nRouge, Bill also moved up the ranks in almost every industry and \ncharitable organization in which he was involved. He is a member of the \nboard of directors and the executive committee of the Louisiana \nChemical Association and has served with distinction as chairman of the \nboard of directors of the Louisiana Chemical Industry Alliance since \n1996. While refinery manager he served on the board of directors of the \nLouisiana MidContinent Oil and Gas Association and provided outstanding \nleadership to that organization's initiatives and responses to various \nlegislative proposals over the years.\n  One of the organizations that will miss Bill the most is the Capital \nArea United Way, which he served as board chair in 1996-97. \nExxonMobil's annual combined corporate and employee and annuitant \ncontribution of more than $1 million makes it the largest United Way \nsupporter in the state and says volumes about his leadership of that \nessential and worthwhile effort.\n  Bill also serves currently as a member of the board of directors of \nthe Greater Baton Rouge Chamber of Commerce and the Partnership for \nExcellence Board of LSU's E.J. Ourso College of Business Administration \nand as co-chair of Community Action for Children.\n  Among Bill's many awards are the 1998 Alumni Recognition Award for \nCommunity Services from the LSU School of Social Work and the 1998 \nVolunteer CEO of the Year Award from the Volunteer Baton Rouge \nCorporate Volunteer Council.\n  Probably Bill's most notable accomplishment since arriving in Baton \nRouge 33 years ago, though, was discovering his lovely wife, the former \nEmilie Steffek of Baton Rouge, and with her raising their three sons--\nWill, 29; Chase, 27; and Kyle, 25--all of whom make their homes in \nBaton Rouge.\n  I know that Bill and Emilie will continue to be active in their \nefforts to help others and I hope to be able to call on Bill from time \nto time as oil and gas or petrochemical industry issues critical to our \nstate arise.\n  Bill is a frequent visitor to Washington and I know the entire \nLouisiana delegation joins me in wishing both him and Emilie a long and \nhappy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/27/senate-section/article/S1742-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CAPTAIN JERRY BURKE, EVERETT POLICE DEPARTMENT\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, throughout Washington state there \nare thousands of people who volunteer their free time to tutor, mentor, \nsupport our teachers and make a difference in their communities and in \nlives of our children. I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize an outstanding volunteer, Captain Jerry Burke of the Everett \nPolice Department who has passed his love of the theater onto a group \nof elementary students at Madison Elementary in Everett. For his \nefforts, I am proud to award him with my ``Innovation in Education'' \nAwards.\n  Captain Burke participates in a program in which members of the \nPolice Command Staff adopt an elementary school in the Everett School \nDistrict. While it is no surprise to see a police officer donating his \nor her time to a local school, Captain Burke is teaching something a \nlittle out of the ordinary for a cop who used to go undercover to bust \ndrug dealers--he teaches a drama class.\n  When Captain Burke first approached principal Joyce Stewart, she was \nintrigued by his Fine Arts Degree in Designing for the Theater and his \nexperience teaching theater arts prior to entering law enforcement. \nFurthermore, she was already interested in creating a drama program to \nexpose interested students to the fine arts. Though he had no prior \nexperience in creating such a program, or in teaching drama to \nelementary school students, Captain Burke agreed to take on the \nchallenge.\n  This program has been a tremendous success. Captain Burke and the \nschool created a drama club open to fourth and fifth graders that meets \nafter school one day a week. The program continues to grow and \napproximately 35 students are now participating. The program combines \nlectures with creative drama games that emphasize communication, \nvisualization, creativity, and improvisation. More importantly, the \nstudents enjoy the club and Captain Burke. Fourth grader Shawn Cook \nsaid, ``Police officers are always supposed to be tough. Mr. Burke is \nfunny and tough.''\n  This spring's club is limited to 10 weeks since Captain Burke is \nattending the FBI academy in April, but he and Ms. Stewart are already \nconsidering options for spring of 2001 that would create a second \ncreative drama class of third and fourth graders. The more experienced \nfifth grade students from this year's club are planning to put on the \nschool's first ever dramatic production. Clearly, Captain Burke has \nmade a significant contribution to the lives of these students and \ngiven them an interest that will last throughout their life.\n  One remarkable aspect of this program is that it demonstrates the \nimportance of community involvement in our local schools. From this \nprogram, students will not only have an appreciation for the fine arts, \nbut the will also have an appreciation for police officers and have a \ngreater sense of community. I applaud the work of Captain Burke and \nwish his students the best of luck in producing their first play. Thank \nyou to Captain Burke, and to all the members of the Everett Police \nCommand staff for your contributions to local elementary \nschools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/27/senate-section/article/S1742-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1742-S1743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       PALADIN DATA SYSTEMS SUPPORT OF THE WEST SOUND CONSORTIUM\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, when I travel across Washington \nstate, one of the first topics I hear about from local businesses and \nhigh-tech companies is their need for people with high-tech skills. A \nPoulsbo company, Paladin Data, has taken their efforts to find skilled \nemployees to a new level by donating its time and resources to train \nteachers in some of Washington state's public schools. For its \ncommitment to working with teachers, improving student learning and \nexpanding their skills, I am pleased to present Paladin Data with one \nof my ``Innovation in Education'' Awards.\n  Several years ago, seven school districts in Kitsap, Mason, and \nPierce Counties developed the West Sound School-to-Career Consortium \nwhich provides approximately 14,000 students with high-tech classes. \nThis year Paladin Data will begin its first year of a three-year \nproject that provides high-tech training to teachers involved with the \nWest Sound School-to-Career program. Paladin Data is also contributing \n$50,000 in matching funds to a state grant of $100,000 to provide \nneeded curriculum materials and onsite\n\n[[Page S1743]]\n\nteacher training in either a Paladin facility in Poulsbo or at a \ndesignated school district site. Moreover, each school district will \ndetermine what training their teachers will received based on the needs \nof their district and their students.\n  Paladin is giving our teachers more information and skills that they \ncan take back to their classrooms and shows teachers what skills \nemployers are looking for in perspective employees, giving their \nstudents a leg up on the competition. Paladin's involvement is not only \nimproving the education of our students, but also giving them an \naccurate picture of what skills they need well-before they enter the \njob market.\n  The Washington Software Alliance reports that over 64,000 computer-\nrelated jobs are currently unfilled in the State of Washington--all for \nlack of properly trained workers. I find it encouraging to see \ncompanies like Paladin Data, that are contributing to our booming \neconomy, are taking an active role in ensuring the quality education of \nour children. I am proud to acknowledge Paladin Data Systems \nCorporation's commitment to education and I look forward to hearing \nabout more companies making a contribution to our children's \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/27/senate-section/article/S1743-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING DR.

Subsequently, he has also held the positions of Professor and \nChair of the Department of English (1966-1971), Dean and Professor of \nFine Arts (1972-1980), Vice-President for Academic Affairs and \nProfessor of Fine Arts (1980-1982), and Professor of English and \nTheatre (1982-1986). In 1987, Dr. Knutson was appointed by the South \nDakota Board of Regents as the first University Distinguished \nProfessor.\n  As a member of the arts community, he has also served on the \nLiterature Panel of the National Endowment for the Arts (1975-1977) and \nas chairperson of both the South Dakota Arts Council (1971-1978) and \nthe South Dakota Humanities Council (1989-1991).\n  Dr. Knutson's honors include a Distinguished Service Award from the \nSpeech Communication Association of South Dakota, the Governor's Award \nfor Distinction in the Arts, the Burlington-Northern Faculty \nAchievement Award, a South Dakota Arts Council Senior Fellowship for \nPlay Direction, and an award for Outstanding Achievement in the \nHumanities from the South Dakota Humanities Council.\n  In addition to his instrumental work as a professor and an actively \ninvolved member of the arts community, Dr. Knutson is also an \naccomplished author, director, and playwright. He wrote ``The Dakota \nDescendants of Ola Rue'' and ``Dream Valley'', as well as a number of \narticles on theatre for Dramatics magazine and a short history of the \nUniversity of South Dakota. He has directed over sixty-five plays and \nmusicals for USD, the Black Hills Playhouse, Pierre Players, Lewis and \nClark Theatre, and the Group Theatre of Rapid City. He has also written \nten plays and opera librettos, one of which was aired on Voice of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Knutson has a immensely enriched life in South \nDakota and the honor of having Theatre I at USD renamed the ``Wayne S. \nKnutson'' is one he highly deserves. He has been an extraordinary \npioneer and supporter of the arts. He is a man of great scholarship and \nknowledge, and will continue to shape the arts community for years to \ncome. It is an honor for me to share the accomplishments of Dr. Wayne \nS. Knutson with my colleagues and to publicly commend him on his talent \nand commitment to the arts and education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/27/senate-section/article/S1743-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING BRIANNE COX AND GIRL SCOUT TROOP 290\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly commend Girl \nScout Troop 290 of Yankton, South Dakota.\n The girls of Troop 290 have worked especially hard this last \nyear, donating their time and energy to the community. Their wonderful \nefforts to enhance the lives of many unfortunate South Dakotans at \nChristmas and Thanksgiving, to assist the community's elderly, to aid \nimpoverished people in Haiti, and to undertake many other key projects \nhas had a very important positive impact in the world around them.\n  Sadly, on November 24, 1999, Brianne Cox, a member of Troop 290, was \nkilled in a tragic accident. She was active not only in Scouts, but \nenjoyed soccer, softball, dance, violin, trumpet, cross country, \nbasketball, and many other activities. This young lady had a wonderful \nspirit that touched everyone who knew her.\n  In her name, the Troop 290 scouts have undertaken a very special \nproject. These wonderful girls want to keep Brianne's memory alive and \nstay close to her family. To this end, they hold a fundraiser every \nsummer to raise money for the `Brianne Cox Memorial Fund'. This effort, \nin the name of a special girl, will designate funds to other middle \nschool students who wish to participate in the many activities Brianne \nenjoyed, and who otherwise could not afford it.\n  Mr. President, these girls are true examples of charity and goodness. \nTheir work to elevate the spirit of their hometown is inspiration in \nitself, but added to their work to keep Brianne Cox's memory alive, is \ntruly extraordinary. I am pleased to be able to share their story with \nmy colleagues and to be able to publicly commend their work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/27/senate-section/article/S1743-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1743-S1744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE SAGINAW COUNTY COMMISSION ON AGING HONORS MS.

Mr. President, on March 31, 2000, the Saginaw \nCounty Commission on Aging will hold a luncheon honoring four women who \nhave selflessly dedicated a significant amount of their time and their \nenergy to improving the community of Saginaw, Michigan. Their \ntremendous efforts over the years have not only touched a great many \nlives, they have truly changed lives, whether by providing those in \nneed with food and clothing, saving seniors hundreds of dollars in \nmedical insurance payments, mentoring elementary school students, or \nhelping people to understand and accept a culture different from their \nown. Thus, I rise today on behalf not only of myself, but also of the \nentire Saginaw County, Michigan, community, to sincerely thank Ms. \nHazel Wilson, Ms. Mary Flannery, Ms. Sue Kaltenbach, and Ms. Yoko \nMossner for their incredible efforts.\n  Ms. Hazel Wilson has been a Saginaw community leader for more than \nthirty years. Her charitable endeavors include working for the Family \nIndepence Agency in the 1960s, counseling laid-off auto workers for the \nUAW-GM Human Resource Center in the late eighties, serving on the Board \nof Trustees for the Saginaw Public Schools, and also serving on the \nBoard of Directors for the Saginaw Voluntary Action Center. For the \nlast ten years, she has been employed by the Saginaw County Community \nMental Health Authority as a Prevention Coordinator.\n  Ms. Wilson demonstrated her outstanding leadership capabilities, and \nindelibly left her mark on the Saginaw community, when in the early \n1970s she established the Good Neighbors Mission. Ms. Wilson's original \ngoal in establishing this organization was to provide needy families \nwith food and clothing. But because of her dedication the Good \nNeighbors Mission has continually grown, to the point where today it \nstands as a community resource center, a hub of activity, and, I am \ntold, a virtual clearinghouse, where people can find help fulfilling \nmuch more than just their food and clothing needs.\n  Aside from working as a Prevention Coordinator, Ms. Wilson is also \ncurrently a member of the Zion Baptist Church, Zeta Phi Beta sorority, \nthe Michigan T.A.G. Workgroup, and the\n\n[[Page S1744]]\n\nMichigan Prevention Association. I take great pride in recognizing \ncommunity-oriented constituents like Ms. Wilson, and I applaud the \nSaginaw County Commission on Aging for ensuring that her efforts are \nnot overlooked. On behalf of the United States Senate, I extend \ngratitude to Ms. Wilson for her dedication and work for her \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/27/senate-section/article/S1744-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE SAGINAW COUNTY COMMISSION ON AGING HONORS MS.

For many years, she was an employee of the Family Independence \nAgency. Fortunately for the citizens of Saginaw, no one has reminded \nMs. Flannery that she has in fact retired from her position there. She \nremains a regular fixture at local hospitals and nursing homes, and \nalso continues to volunteer her time at the Commission on Aging.\n  At the Commission on Aging, she shares the knowledge and skills she \ncollected while working at the Family Independence Agency, assisting \nseniors who have questions related to Medicare, Medicaid, and general \nhealth insurance. I am told that Ms. Flannery's expertise, and her \nwillingness to venture beyond the call of duty, have saved Saginaw's \nseniors thousands of dollars they may have spent on duplicated medical \nbills or services. I guess when one has lived their life aiding \nindividuals in need, even retirement cannot prevent them from \ncontinuing to do so.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the entire United States Senate, I take \npride in extending gratitude to Ms. Mary Flannery for her dedication to \nmaking the lives of others better. She is truly a role model for us \nall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/27/senate-section/article/S1744-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE SAGINAW COUNTY COMMISSION ON AGING HONORS MS.

During this time, she has served the Saginaw Township \nCommunity School Board in many ways: as president, vice president, \nsecretary and treasurer. She was also once president of the Saginaw \nCounty School Board Association, a vice president of the Assistance \nLeague of Saginaw, president of the Saginaw County Lawyer's Auxiliary. \nIn addition, Ms. Kaltenbach served the Junior League of Saginaw Valley \nas a corresponding secretary and the Street Smarts Investment Club as \nrecorder.\n  Ms. Kaltenbach has been a mentor at Coulter Elementary School since \n1996, as part of the H.O.S.T.S. program. She participates on the \nElection Scheduling Committee for Saginaw County, and is involved with \nnumerous educational programs dealing with art, literature, drug abuse \nprevention and law related education. She is also chairperson of Family \nin Action, a former member of the Christian Service Commission and the \nParis Council and a member at St. Stephen's Church.\n  Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Ms. Kaltenbach is that she \nhas managed to do all of this while placing her primary focus upon \nraising her own three children.

She \nserved as president and treasurer of People to People Chapter Seven, \nwas a member of the Board of Trustees of People to People \nInternational, and has also held various leadership roles in the \nSaginaw's Culture Club, the Women's National Farm and Garden \nAssociation, the Saginaw County Lawyers' Auxiliary, and the Valparaiso \nUniversity Guild. She is a former member of the Saginaw Zonta Club, and \nis currently a member of the Good Shepherd Lutheran Church.\n  More importantly, Ms. Mossner has played a leading role in finding \nJapanese culture a place in Saginaw County. For the last six years, she \nhas served as volunteer director for the Japanese Cultural Center and \nTea House, a project that was made possible by her efforts as a member \nof the Board of Trustrees of the Saginaw County Building Fund \nCommittee. She also serves as Special Envoy and Liaison Officer from \nSaginaw to its Sister City, Tokushima, Japan.

Mr. President, I am proud to introduce this bill \ntoday to establish the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front \nNational Historic Park. This park will be constructed on the former \nsite of Richmond Kaiser Shipyard #2 which produced WWII ships at the \nsite of the present-day Marina Park in Richmond California.\n  The Home Front industrial buildup in Richmond, California and across \nAmerica to strengthen U.S. military capability and eventually win World \nWar II started in early 1941 with the Lend Lease Program. Employment at \nthe Richmond Shipyards peaked at 90,000 and forced an unprecedented \nintegration of workers into the nation's work force.\n  ``Rosie the Riveter'' was a term coined to help recruit female \ncivilian workers and came to symbolize a workforce mobilized to fill \nthe gap created by working men who left their jobs for active military \nduty. Nationwide, six million women entered the WWII Home Front \nworkforce, which also provided unprecedented opportunities for \nminorities.\n  I am proud to offer this legislation to commemorate these invaluable \ncontributions to the U.S. victory in World War II, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO:\n  S. 2296. A bill to provide grants for special environmental \nassistance for the regulation of communities and habitat (SEARCH) to \nsmall communities; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                             PROJECT SEARCH\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nauthorize a national environmental grants program for small communities \ncalled Project SEARCH.\n  The national Project SEARCH (Special Environmental Assistance for the \nRegulation of Communities and Habitat) concept is based on a \ndemonstration program that has been operating with great success in \nIdaho in 1999 and 2000. In short, the bill establishes a simplified \napplication process for communities of under 2,500 individuals to \nreceive assistance in meeting a broad array of federal, state, or local \nenvironmental regulations. Grants would be available for initial \nfeasibility studies, to address unanticipated costs arising during the \ncourse of a project, or when a community has been turned down or \nunderfunded by traditional sources. The grant program would require no \nmatch from the recipients.\n  Some of the major highlights of the program are:\n  A simplified application process--no special grants coordinators \nrequired;\n  No unsolicited bureaucratic intrusions into the decision-making \nprocess;\n  Communities must first have attempted to receive funds from \ntraditional sources;\n  It is open to studies or projects involving any environmental \nregulation;\n  Applications are reviewed and approved by citizens panel of \nvolunteers;\n  The panel chooses number of recipients and size of grants;\n  The panel consists of volunteers representing all regions of the \nstate; and\n  No local match is required to receive the SEARCH funds.\n  Over the past several years, it has become increasing apparent that \nsmall communities are having problems complying with environmental \nrules and regulations due primarily to lack of funding, not a \nwillingness to do so. They, like all of us, want clean water and air \nand a healthy natural environment. Sometimes, they simply cannot \nshoulder the financial burden with their limited resources.\n  In addition, small communities wishing to pursue unique collaborative \nefforts might be discouraged by grant administrators who prefer \nconformity. Some run into unexpected costs during a project and have \nborrowed and bonded to the maximum. Others are in critical habitat \nlocations and any project may have additional costs, which may not be \nrecognized by traditional financial sources. Still others just need \nhelp\n\n[[Page S1748]]\n\nfor the initial environmental feasibility study so they can identify \nthe most effective path forward.\n  With these needs in mind, in 1998, I was able to secure $1.3 million \nthrough the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for a demonstration \ngrant program for Idaho's small communities. Idaho's program does not \nreplace other funding sources, but serves as a final resort when all \nother means have been exhausted.\n  The application process was simplified so that any small town mayor, \ncounty commissioner, sewer district chairman, or community leader could \nmanage it without hiring a professional grant writer. An independent \ncitizens committee with statewide representation was established to \nmake the selections and get the funds on the ground as quickly as \npossible. No bureaucratic or political intrusions were permitted.\n  Although the EPA subsequently insisted that grants be limited to \nwater and wastewater projects, forty-four communities in Idaho \nultimately applied, not including two that failed to meet the \neligibility requirements. Ultimately, twenty-one communities were \nawarded grants in several categories, and ranged in size from $9,000 to \n$319,000. A Native American community, a migrant community, and several \ninnovative collaborative efforts were included in the successful \napplicants. The communities that were not selected are being given \nassistance in exploring other funding sources and other advice.\n  The response and feedback from all participants has been overwhelming \npositive. Environmental officials from the state and EPA who witnessed \nthe process have stated that the process worked well and was able to \naccomplish much on a volunteer basis. There was even extraordinary \nappreciation from other funding agencies because some communities they \nwere not able to reach were provided funds for feasibility studies. The \nonly negative comments were from those who wished that the EPA had not \nlimited the program to water and wastewater projects.\n  The conclusion of all participants was that Project SEARCH is a \nprogram worthy of being expanded nationally. So many small communities \nin so many states can benefit from a program that assists underserved \nand often overlooked communities. This legislation provides us the \nopportunity to help small communities throughout the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2298. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nclarify the definition of homebound with respect to home health \nservices under the Medicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    THE HOMEBOUND CLARIFICATION ACT\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am here today to introduce the \nHomebound Clarification Act of 2000. This important bill has been \ncrafted to protect Medicare beneficiaries from a growing problem that \nis impeding access to vital home care services. I want to recognize my \ncosponsors, Senator Reed of Rhode Island and Senator Leahy, for their \ncontinued effort and dedication to protecting access to home health \ncare.\n  Federally funded home health care is an often quiet but invaluable \npart of life for America's seniors. Medical treatment can often mean \nbeing subjected to a strange and unfamiliar environment. For our \nnation's elderly, who may have special needs, this inconvenience can be \nmore severe and detrimental to successful recovery. Home health care \nmeans that people recovering from surgery can go home sooner--it means \nthat someone recovering from an accident can get physical therapy in \ntheir home, it means our seniors can stay at home, and out of nursing \nhomes.\n  The sooner you can return patients to their homes, the sooner they \ncan recover. The familiar environment of the home, family, and friends \nis more nurturing to recovering patients than the often stressful and \nunfamiliar surroundings of a hospital. Home health is also a great \navenue for education. It empowers families to assist in the care of \ntheir loved ones. It is smart policy from human and financial \nstandpoints.\n  But there are some seniors who are being denied access to this smart \npolicy. An individual must be considered ``homebound'' to qualify for \nMedicare reimbursement for home health. Though an individual is not \nrequired to be bed-ridden, the condition of the individual should \ninclude ``a normal inability to leave the home.'' Under the current \ndefinition, an individual is ``homebound'' if ``leaving the home \nrequires a considerable and taxing effort by the individual, and that \nabsences of the individual from home are infrequent and of short \nduration, or are attributable to the need to receive medical \ntreatment.'' The definition allows for ``infrequent'' or ``short \nduration,'' recognizing that short excursions may be a part of a \nsuccessful recovery process, but leaves it up to fiscal intermediaries \nto interpret exactly what number is frequent and how short an absence \nmust be. Interpretation of this definition has varied widely.\n  Sadly, there is a ready supply of disturbing examples of the \noverzealous and arbitrary interpretation of the definition. Many \nseniors have found themselves virtual prisoners in their homes, \nthreatened with loss of coverage if they attend adult day care, weekly \nreligious services, or even visit family members in the hospital. This \nmakes no sense because all of these activities are steps on the road to \nsuccessful and healthy recovery. Often, health professionals want \npatients to get outside for fresh air or exercise, as part of their \ncare plan. This helps fight off depression.\n  Seniors deserve a more consistent standard to depend upon, rather \nthan a completely arbitrary number of absences from the home. In April \n1999, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala sent a \nreport to Congress on the homebound definition. The report identifies \nthe wide variety in interpretation of the definition and the absurdity \nof some coverage determinations that follow. While the Administration \nunfortunately stopped short of taking action themselves, Shalala did \npropose that a clarification of the definition is needed to improve \nuniformity of determination.\n  The Homebound Clarification Act states that eligibility of an \nindividual depends on the condition of the patient, how ``taxing'' it \nis for the patient to leave home. It strikes the clause that states: \n``that absences of the individual from home are infrequent or of \nrelatively short duration, or are attributable to the need to receive \nmedical treatment.'' This is consistent with the intent of Congress and \nthe Administration. This will not open the door to wider coverage of \nhome health, but rather protect coverage for those who need it.\n  We ask that seniors put their trust in the Medicare program. We are \nresponsible for making sure that the Medicare program lives up to its \npromise and that home health will be available to those who need it. \nOnce again, I would like to thank my cosponsors, Senators Reed and \nLeahy for their work. We look forward to working with the rest of \nCongress to turn this legislation into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. L. CHAFEE (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2299. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \ncontinue State Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) \nallotments for fiscal year 2001 at the levels for fiscal year 2000; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               The Medicaid DSH Preservation Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenator Snowe in introducing the Medicaid DSH Preservation Act of 2000. \nThis legislation will freeze Medicaid disproportionate share hospital \n(DSH) reductions at Fiscal Year 2000 levels, thereby mitigating the \nforthcoming reductions in Fiscal Years 2001 and 2002. This bill will \nalso provide a growth rate adjustment to help compensate for the \nincreases in the cost of providing care to the most needy and indigent \npatients.\n  In addition to the Medicare payment reductions in the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997 (BBA), federal payments to the Medicaid DSH program were \nalso reduced by $10.4 billion over 5 years, with these reductions being \nabsorbed by States and our Nation's vulnerable safety net hospitals. \nMedicaid DSH payments help reimburse hospitals' costs of treating \nMedicaid patients, particularly those with complex medical needs. These \npayments also make it possible for communities to care for the \nuninsured--a population that is projected to increase considerably \nduring the next few years.\n\n[[Page S1749]]\n\n  The impact of these financial pressures was not fully anticipated at \nthe time the BBA was enacted. Other Financial pressures such as \ndeclining Medicaid enrollment have had a significant impact on these \nsafety net hospitals, thereby adding to the rapidly rising number of \nAmericans without health insurance. At a time when our Nation's \nuninsured rate continues to climb above 44 million, it makes little \nsense to be reducing much-needed Medicaid DSH payments to our nation's \nsafety net hospitals.\n  Hospitals in Rhode Island will absorb $400 million in reductions as a \nresult of changes made to the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the \nBBA. Ten out of fourteen hospitals in my State had operating losses in \n1999. After the BBA was enacted, it was predicted that cuts in federal \nMedicare and Medicaid payments would cost hospitals in Rhode Island \n$220 million over 5 years; however, this estimate has proven to be \nabout $180 million off the mark. Every other State is experiencing \nsimilar problems. Since the BBA was signed into law, the American \nHospital Association commissioned a study by the Lewin Group, which \nestimated that there would be $71 billion less paid to hospitals \nnationwide over 5 years. The original estimate of the impact of the BBA \nwas $18 billion. While the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 \nprovided some relief to our Nation's financially strapped hospitals, \nthat relief was targeted to the Medicare program. Clearly, more needs \nto be done to keep our vulnerable safety net hospitals from continuing \non this downward spiral.\n  This legislation we are introducing today represents a commonsense \ncompromise that will help prevent the further erosion of our Nation's \nsafety net hospitals and the long-term viability of our country's \nhealth care system.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation and I ask unanimous consent that the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2299\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Flag Protection and Free \n     Speech Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the flag of the United States is a unique symbol of \n     national unity and represents the values of liberty, justice, \n     and equality that make this Nation an example of freedom \n     unmatched throughout the world;\n       (2) the Bill of Rights is a guarantee of those freedoms and \n     should not be amended in a manner that could be interpreted \n     to restrict freedom, a course that is regularly resorted to \n     by authoritarian governments which fear freedom and not by \n     free and democratic nations;\n       (3) abuse of the flag of the United States causes more than \n     pain and distress to the overwhelming majority of the \n     American people and may amount to fighting words or a direct \n     threat to the physical and emotional well-being of \n     individuals at whom the threat is targeted; and\n       (4) destruction of the flag of the United States can be \n     intended to incite a violent response rather than make a \n     political statement and such conduct is outside the \n     protections afforded by the first amendment of the \n     Constitution.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide the \n     maximum protection against the use of the flag of the United \n     States to promote violence while respecting the liberties \n     that it symbolizes.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES AGAINST \n                   USE FOR PROMOTING VIOLENCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 700 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n[[Page S1751]]\n\n     ``Sec. 700.

Res. 263\n\n       Whereas the United States currently imports roughly 55 \n     percent of its crude oil;\n       Whereas ensuring access to and stable prices for imported \n     crude oil for the United States and major allies and trading \n     partners of the United States is a continuing critical \n     objective of United States foreign and economic policy for \n     the foreseeable future;\n       Whereas the 11 countries that make up the Organization of \n     Petroleum Exporting Countries (``OPEC'') produce 40 percent \n     of the world's crude oil and control 77 percent of proven \n     reserves, including much of the spare production capacity;\n       Whereas beginning in March 1998, OPEC instituted 3 tiers of \n     production cuts, which reduced production by 4,300,000 \n     barrels per day and have resulted in dramatic increases in \n     crude oil prices;\n       Whereas in August 1999, crude oil prices had reached $21 \n     per barrel and continued rising, exceeding $25 per barrel by \n     the end of 1999 and $27 per barrel during the first week of \n     February 2000;\n       Whereas crude oil prices in the United States rose $14 per \n     barrel during 1999, the equivalent of 33 cents per gallon;\n       Whereas the increase has translated into higher prices for \n     gasoline and other refined petroleum products; in the case of \n     gasoline, the increases in crude oil prices have resulted in \n     a penny-for-penny passthrough of increases at the pump;\n       Whereas increases in the price of crude oil result in \n     increases in prices paid by United States consumers for \n     refined petroleum products, including home heating oil, \n     gasoline, and diesel fuel; and\n       Whereas increases in the costs of refined petroleum \n     products have a negative effect on many Americans, including \n     the elderly and individuals of low income (whose home heating \n     oil costs have doubled in the last year), families who must \n     pay higher prices at the gas station, farmers (already hurt \n     by low commodity prices, trying to factor increased costs \n     into their budgets in preparation for the growing season), \n     truckers (who face an almost 10-year high in diesel fuel \n     prices), and manufacturers and retailers (who must factor in \n     increased production and transportation costs into the final \n     price of their goods): Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President and Congress should take both a short-\n     term and a long-term approach to reducing and stabilizing \n     crude oil prices as well as reducing dependence on foreign \n     sources of energy;\n       (2) to address the problem in the short-term, the President \n     should communicate to the members of the Organization of \n     Petroleum Exporting Countries (``OPEC'') cartel and non-OPEC \n     countries that participate in the cartel of crude oil \n     producing countries, prior to their scheduled meeting on \n     March 27, 2000, that--\n       (A) the United States seeks to maintain strong relations \n     with crude oil producers around the world while promoting \n     international efforts to\n\n[[Page S1753]]\n\n     remove barriers to energy trade and investment and increased \n     access for United States energy firms around the world;\n       (B) the United States believes that restricting supply in a \n     market that is in demand of additional crude oil does serious \n     damage to the efforts that OPEC members have made to \n     demonstrate that they represent a reliable source of crude \n     oil supply;\n       (C) the United States believes that stable crude oil prices \n     and supplies are essential for strong economic growth \n     throughout the world; and\n       (D) the United States seeks an immediate increase in the \n     OPEC crude oil production quotas and not simply an agreement \n     at the March 27, 2000, meeting to lift production quotas at a \n     later date;\n       (3) the President should be commended for sending Secretary \n     of Energy Richardson to personally communicate with leaders \n     of several members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \n     Countries on the need to increase the supply of crude oil;\n       (4) to ameliorate the long-term problem of the United \n     States dependence on foreign oil sources, the President \n     should--\n       (A) review all administrative policies, programs, and \n     regulations that put an undue burden on domestic energy \n     producers; and\n       (B) consider lifting unnecessary regulations that interfere \n     with the ability of United States' domestic oil, gas, coal, \n     hydro-electric, biomass, and other alternative energy \n     industries to supply a greater percentage of the energy needs \n     of the United States; and\n       (5) to ameliorate the long-term problem of United States \n     dependence on foreign oil sources, the Senate should \n     appropriate sufficient funds for the development of domestic \n     energy sources, including measures to increase the use of \n     biofuels and other renewable resources.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that Chairman \nHyde, Senator Leahy and I reached an agreement with the Department of \nJustice and Senators Sessions and Schumer yesterday on civil forfeiture \nreform legislation. This is an important issue, and I am proud to \nsupport this legislation. While civil forfeiture is a valuable law \nenforcement tool, it has become increasingly clear that some reform of \ncivil forfeiture law is necessary given the numerous controversial \nseizures of property in the last decade.\n  Federal civil forfeiture procedures, which are based largely on 19th \ncentury admiralty law, provide inadequate protections for private \nproperty. For example, under current Federal law, once the government \nseizes property, the burden of proof is on the property owner to prove \nthat the property is not subject to forfeiture. After property is \nseized, the property owner must post a cost bond in order to contest \nthe forfeiture. This bond requirement does not entitle the property \nowner to the return of the property, but merely allows the claimant to \ncontest the forfeiture. If the property owner files a claim to the \nproperty, the government has up to five years to file a complaint for \nforfeiture.\n  The legislation agreed to today increases protections for property \nowners, while respecting the interests of law enforcement. Among other \nprovisions, the bill places the burden of proof in civil forfeiture \ncases on the government throughout the proceeding; places reasonable \ntime limits on the government in civil forfeiture actions; awards \nattorney fees and costs to property owners who prevail against the \ngovernment in civil forfeiture cases; authorizes the court to release \nproperty pending trial in appropriate circumstances; eliminates the \ncost bond; and provides a uniform innocent owner defense to all federal \ncivil forfeitures affected by the bill.\n  All of us here are committed to depriving criminals of the proceeds \nof crime. To further this goal, the bill increases the ability of the \nJustice Department to target criminal proceeds. The bill also extends \ncriminal forfeiture authority to any Federal statute in which civil \nforfeiture authority exists in order to encourage the use of criminal \nforfeiture. In addition, the bill contains several mechanisms to deter \nand punish frivolous claims to seized property. Senator Sessions will \ndescribe these provisions in detail.\n  A broad coalition of organizations support this bill, including the \nChamber of Commerce, the American Bankers Association, the National \nAssociation of Homebuilders, the National Association of Relators, the \nInstitute for Justice, Americans for Tax Reform, the National Rifle \nAssociation, the American Bar Association, and the Fraternal Order of \nPolice. In addition, six former Attorneys General--William Barr, \nRichard Thornburg, Edwin Meese, Benjamin Civiletti, Griffin Bell, and \nNicholas Katzenbach--have endorsed the bill.\n  In closing, I would like to thank Senators Sessions and Schumer for \ntheir patience and cooperation. This agreement would not be possible \nwithout their hard work and dedication. Senator Sessions is to be \nespecially commended. As a former United States Attorney and state \nAttorney General, he has more experience in civil forfeiture actions \nthat any member of Congress. Senator Sessions has been an outstanding \nrepresentative of the law enforcement community, and I am proud to have \nhis support.\n  Finally, I would like to thank House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde. \nNo one has done more to advance the cause of civil forfeiture reform \nthan Chairman Hyde. His 1995 book on civil forfeiture helped draw \nnational attention to the need for reform. Last June, the House \noverwhelmingly passed the Hyde-Conyers civil forfeiture reform bill. \nThis victory for forfeiture reform was due in large measure to Henry \nHyde's stature and commitment.\n  Thank you for your attention to this important reform legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at long last, after years of effort and \nseveral weeks of intensive, tedious and seemingly endless negotiations, \nwe have reached agreement on civil asset forfeiture reform legislation. \nThis is a significant improvement over the current system and should go \na long way toward stemming the abuses that have so offended Americans \nacross the country and the political spectrum. It is not often that we \nsee the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, ACLU, NRA, National Association of \nCriminal Defense Lawyers, American Bankers Association, the Institute \nof Justice, Americans for Tax Reform, and the American Bar Association \njoining together on the same side of a legislative effort. Working with \nChairman Hatch, Chairman Hyde, Mr. Conyers, Senator Sessions and \nSenator Schumer, we have crafted a good\n\n[[Page S1760]]\n\nbill, a balanced bill and a reform package that should move forward as \nconsensus legislation and be enacted without further delay this year. I \nwant to thank all who have worked with us in this process. In \nparticular, I want to thank Janet Reno, our Attorney General, for \nworking with us, meeting with us and lending her support to this effort \nand joining our coalition by agreeing to the consensus civil asset \nforfeiture reform legislation that the Senate is passing today.\n  Asset forfeiture is a powerful crime-fighting tool. It has been a \nparticularly potent weapon in the war on drugs, allowing the government \nto take the cars and boats and stash houses amassed by drug dealers and \nput them to honest use. Last year alone, the government was able to \nseize nearly half a billion dollars worth of assets, cutting a big \nchunk out of criminals' profit stream and returning it to the law-\nabiding community.\n  Unfortunately, our nation's asset forfeiture is not fail-safe; it can \nbe and has been abused. In hearings on this issue, the Judiciary \nCommittee has heard examples of what happens when prosecutorial zeal \nskirts the boundaries of due process, leading to the taking of private \nproperty regardless of whether the owner is innocent of, or even \ncognizant of, the property's use in an illegal act, or whether the \nseizure is entirely out of proportion to the criminal conduct alleged.\n  I am well aware from incidents in Vermont about how aggressive use by \nFederal and State law enforcement official of civil asset forfeiture \nlaws can appear unfair and excessive, and thereby fuel public distrust \nof the government in general and law enforcement in particular. For \nexample, in 1989, federal prosecutors seized a Vermont homestead that a \nfamily had built and lived in for over a decade. The husband had \npleaded guilty in State court to growing six marijuana plants, without \nhis wife's knowledge, and was sentenced to 50 hours of community \nservice, which he fulfilled by building bookshelves for the local \npublic library.\n  Yet, one year after his arrest, Vermont State police brought his \narrest to the attention of the federal authorities and Federal marshals \nseized the family's home and 49 surrounding acres. Hundreds of \nVermonters rallied to the family's defense, including former \nprosecutors, until the case was settled with no seizure of the \nproperty.\n  In another civil asset forfeiture case, federal prosecutors again \nseized the home and 10 acres of a Vermont woman in Richmond, Vermont, \nafter two hidden patches of marijuana plants were discovered on her \nproperty. Criminal charges against the woman were dismissed when she \nestablished she was unaware that her daughter and daughter's boyfriend \nwere cultivating the plants. Three years after the seizure, in 1990, a \nfederal judge ordered the government to return the property to the \nwoman, but by that time it had been destroyed by fire.\n\n  By contrast to the obligation under Vermont law that law enforcement \nagencies must ``ensure that the property is properly maintained,'' 18 \nV.S.A. Sec.  4246, the federal authorities who made the seizure of this \nproperty had no such obligation and did not take good care of the \nproperty.\n  In yet another civil asset forfeiture case, federal prosecutors in \n1990, seized the home and 10.7 acres of a family in Craftsbury Common, \nVermont, after the homeowners were convicted in State court of \ncultivating marijuana and given suspended sentences three years earlier \nin 1987.\n  Given the fact that in each of these cases, the underlying criminal \ncharges were prosecuted by the State but the forfeiture action was \ntaken federally, one might ask why these related proceedings were \ndivided between the State and Federal authorities? The answer is \nsimple: Vermont law does not allow the forfeiture of real property \n``which is occupied as the primary residence of a person involved in \nthe violation and a member or members of that person's family.'' 18 \nV.S.A. Sec.  4241(a)(5).\n  Moreover, under Vermont law, state law enforcement authorities carry \na heavier burden ``of proving all material facts by clear and \nconvincing evidence.'' 18 V.S.A. Sec.  4244(c). By contrast, federal \nforfeiture procedures provide more latitude on the property subject to \nseizure and more lenient requirements for federal law enforcement \nauthorities to meet.\n  While federal authorities in Vermont have in recent years avoided \nsuch egregious asset forfeiture abuses, that is not the situation in \nother jurisdictions, prompting increasing and exceedingly sharp \ncriticism from scholars and commentators of the federal asset \nforfeiture system, which in general requires far less from the \ngovernment than any State forfeiture law.\n  Federal judges have also added their voices to the growing chorus of \nconcern. In 1992, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals stated: ``We \ncontinue to be enormously troubled by the government's increasing and \nvirtually unchecked use of the civil forfeiture statutes and the \ndisregard for due process that is buried in those statutes.'' Four \nyears later, the Eighth Circuit rebuked the government for capitalizing \non the claimants' confusion to forfeit over $70,000 of their currency, \nand expressed alarm that:\n\n       [T]he war on drugs has brought us to the point where the \n     government may seize . . . a citizen's property without any \n     initial showing of cause, and put the onus on the citizen to \n     perfectly navigate the bureaucratic labyrinth in order to \n     liberate what is presumptively his or hers in the first \n     place. . . . Should the citizen prove inept, the government \n     may keep the property, without ever having to justify or \n     explain its actions.\n\n  Similarly, the Seventh Circuit recently expressed its belief that \n``the government's conduct in forfeiture cases leaves much to be \ndesired,'' and ordered the return of over $500,000 in currency that had \nbeen improperly seized from a Chicago pizzeria.\n  Under current law, the property owner--not the government--bears the \nburden of proof. All the government must do is make an initial showing \nof probable cause that the property is ``guilty'' and subject to \nforfeiture. The property owner must then prove a negative--that the \nproperty was not involved in any wrongdoing. It is time to bring this \nlaw in line with our modern principles of due process and fair play, \nand reform forfeiture procedures to ensure that innocent property \nowners are adequately protected.\n\n  The Hyde-Conyers civil asset forfeiture reform bill, H.R. 1658, \npassed the House by an overwhelming bipartisan majority (375-48) last \nJune. After lengthy negotiations with the Department of Justice, \nChairman Hatch and I introduced a Senate civil asset forfeiture reform \nbill, S.1931. Our bill addressed every major concern that the \nDepartment had raised in our hearings and in the Statement of \nAdministration Policy regarding the Hyde-Conyers bill, and struck a \nfair compromise on those issues.\n  For example, the Hyde-Conyers bill put the burden of proof on the \nGovernment by clear and convincing evidence. We put the burden of proof \non the Government by a preponderance of the evidence. The preponderance \nstandard is used in virtually all other civil cases, and we believe it \nis sufficient to protect the interests of property owners.\n  The Hyde-Conyers bill authorized courts to appoint counsel for any \nindigent person who asserted an interest in seized property. Although I \nam sympathetic to that proposal--justice should not be only for the \nwealthy--the Administration strongly opposed it. We provided for \nappointment of counsel only in the rare case where the property subject \nto forfeiture was the claimant's primary residence. In other cases, a \nclaimant could recoup attorney fees only if she substantially prevailed \nin challenging the forfeiture.\n  We are grateful for the support of so many members of the Committee \nand others over the last year. The Hatch-Leahy bill was endorsed by the \nlast six Attorneys General of the United States from both parties, \nWilliam Barr, Richard Thornburgh, Edwin Meese, Benjamin Civiletti, \nGriffin Bell, and Nicholas Katzenbach, and a wide range of \norganizations.\n  Although I knew that we had met the Department more than half way in \nour bill, we did not stop there. We have met with and worked with \nSenators Sessions and Schumer, who had introduced a different type of \nbill, to see whether we might find common ground. After weeks of \nintensive efforts, we succeeded in coming together. For our part, \nChairman Hatch and I accepted more than 30 substantive changes to the \nprovisions in the Hatch-Leahy bill, plus about a dozen new sections to \nthe bill that give law enforcement new, but measured, authority. In\n\n[[Page S1761]]\n\nessence we combined the Hatch-Leahy Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act, \nS. 1931, with suggestions from the Sessions-Schumer bill to form a \ncivil asset forfeiture legislative package that we can all agree to \nsupport.\n  Among the important reforms made by the Hatch-Leahy-Sessions-Schumer \nsubstitute amendment to H.R. 1658, which the Senate passes today, are \nthe following:\n  Burden of proof. The substitute amendment puts the burden of proof on \nthe government by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  Cost bond. Another core reform of the substitute amendment is the \nelimination of the so-called ``cost bond.'' Under current law, a \nproperty owner who seeks to recover his property after it has been \nseized by the government must pay for the privilege by posting a bond \nwith the court. No other federal statute requires a cost bond, and no \nState requires a cost bond in civil forfeiture cases.\n  The government has defended the cost bond, not as a device for \nensuring that its court costs are covered, but as a way of deterring \nfrivolous claims. Of course, we are all in favor of deterring frivolous \nclaims, but there are ways to deter frivolous claims without offending \nthe fundamental principle of equal and open access to the courts, a \nbedrock of our American system of justice.\n  The substitute amendment provides that a person who challenges a \nforfeiture must file his claim on oath, under penalty of perjury. It \nalso provides for imposition of a civil fine, in cases where the \nclaimant's assertion of an interest in the property was frivolous. In \naddition, claimants will continue to bear the substantial costs of \nlitigating their claims in court, and they and their attorneys will \nremain subject to the general sanctions for bad faith in instituting or \nconducting litigation. Frivolous prisoner claimants will be barred from \nrepeated filings on proper court findings. The added burden of the \n``cost bond'' serves no legitimate purpose.\n  Legal assistance and attorney fees. The substitute amendment permits \ncourts to authorize counsel to represent an indigent claimant only if \nthe claimant is already represented by a court-appointed attorney in \nconnection with a related federal criminal case. This is both fair and \nefficient, and eliminates any appearance that the government chose to \npursue the forfeiture in a civil proceeding rather than as part of the \ncriminal case in order to deprive the claimant of his right to counsel.\n  Beyond this, the substitute amendment ensures that when the \ngovernment seeks to forfeit an indigent person's primary residence, \nthat person will be afforded representation by the Legal Services \nCorporation. When a forfeiture action can result in a claimant's \neviction and homelessness, there is more at stake than just a property \ninterest, and it is fair and just that the claimant be provided with an \nattorney if he cannot otherwise afford one. The Legal Services \nCorporation will be paid by the government for providing representation \nin these cases.\n  For claimants who are not provided with counsel, the substitute \nallows for the recovery of reasonable attorney fees and costs if they \nsubstantially prevail on their claim. The bill also makes the \ngovernment liable for post-judgment interest on any money judgment, and \nimputed interest in certain cases involving currency or negotiable \ninstruments.\n  Filing deadlines. Under current law, a property owner has only 20 \ndays from the date of first publication of the notice of seizure to \nfile a claim challenging an administrative forfeiture, and only 10 days \nto file a claim challenging a judicial forfeiture. It is therefore \nunlikely that anyone who misses the first of three published notices \nwill be able to file a timely claim. The substitute extends the \nproperty owner's time to file a claim following the commencement of an \nadministrative or judicial forfeiture action to 30 days. The bill also \ncodifies current Department of Justice policy with respect to the time \nperiod for sending notice of seizure, and establishes a 90-day period \nfor filing a complaint.\n\n  Release of property for hardship. The substitute will allow a \nproperty owner to hold on to his property pending the final disposition \nof the case, if he can show that continued possession by the government \nwill cause the owner substantial hardship, such as preventing him from \nworking, and that this hardship outweighs the risk that the property \nwill be destroyed or concealed if returned to the owner during the \npendency of the case. Unlike H.R. 1658, the substitute adopts the \nprimary safeguards that the Justice Department wanted added to the \nprovision--that property owners must have sufficient ties to the \ncommunity to provide assurance that the property will not disappear, \nand that certain property, such as currency and property particularly \noutfitted for use in illegal activities, shall not be returned. \nGovernment cannot obtain a grand jury subpoena to obtain such \ndocuments.\n  Criminal proceeds. The substitute also brings clarity and fairness to \nthe confused body of case law concerning the definition of criminal \nproceeds. Specifically, in cases involving lawful goods or lawful \nservices that are sold or provided in an illegal manner, the term \n``proceeds'' is defined to mean the amount of money acquired through \nthe illegal transactions resulting in the forfeiture, less the direct \ncosts incurred in providing the goods or services. An exception is made \nfor cases involving certain health care fraud schemes, since it would \nmake no sense to allow those who provide unnecessary services to deduct \nthe cost of those unnecessary services. Having resolved this important \nmatter, the substitute amendment broadly extends the government's \nauthority to forfeit criminal proceeds under the civil asset forfeiture \nlaws.\n  Fugitive disentitlement. The Supreme Court in 1996 disallowed the \njudge-made doctrine that a fugitive avoiding the jurisdiction of the \nU.S. courts in a criminal case may not contest a civil forfeiture; \nhowever, the Court left open the possibility that Congress could \nestablish such doctrine by statute. The Court was responding, in part, \nto the government's record of seeking forfeiture of property even \nthough the property is not subject to forfeiture (e.g., because the \nstatute of limitations has expired), when the government believes that \nthe fugitive owner will not be permitted to contest the forfeiture. \nOpponents of the fugitive disentitlement doctrine say that the \nprosecutors have gone so far as to indict people whom they know will \nnever return to this country, so that they can invoke the doctrine in \ncivil forfeiture proceedings against such persons' U.S. assets. The \nsubstitute provides a statutory basis for a judge to disallow a civil \nasset forfeiture claim by a fugitive, while leaving judges discretion \nto allow such a claim in the interests of justice.\n  Senator Hatch and I share a longstanding and deeply-held appreciation \nfor law enforcement and the officers who work on the front lines to \nprotect our families and communities, and we have worked together on a \nnumber of crime-related issues in the past. Recently, for example, we \nhave led the Senate in passing a number of legislative initiatives of \nimportance to State and local law enforcement, including the \nBulletproof Vests Partnership Act of 1998, Crime Identification \nTechnology Act of 1998, Care for Police Survivors Act of 1998, the \nRailroad Police Officers Training Act of 1999, and the Methamphetamine \nAnti-Proliferation Act of 1999. I want to commend him for his \ncommitment, not just to law enforcement, but to the rights of all \nAmericans. It has been my pleasure to work with him on this issue, to \nbring balance back in the relationship between our police forces and \nthe citizens of this country.\n  It has been a privilege to work with Representatives Hyde and Conyers \non this important legislation. And we greatly appreciate the \ncontributions made by Senators Sessions and Schumer, both knowledgeable \nand experienced legislators in this area.\n  I would also like to thank the Senate and House staff who worked so \nhard to bring this matter to closure: On my staff, Julie Katzman and \nBeryl Howell; in addition, George Fishman, who has been dedicated to \nthis project for so many years, Manus Cooney, Rhett DeHart, Ed Haden, \nBen Lawsky, Tom Mooney, John Dudas, Julian Epstein, Perry Apelbaum, and \nCori Flam--their efforts made this day possible. Thanks are also due to \nBill Jensen and the other hardworking members of the Senate's Office of \nLegislative Counsel.\n\n[[Page S1762]]\n\n  Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to David Smith, a \nleading expert on civil asset forfeiture, who gave tirelessly of his \ntime over the past few months. His expertise and good counsel were \ninvaluable in producing the legislation that the Senate passes today.\n  It is time for Congress to catch up with the American people and the \ncourts and do the right thing on this important issue of fairness. I am \nglad that the Senate is acting without delay to pass this long overdue \nreform legislation.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee substitute be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 1658), as amended, was read a third time and passed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the bill we have just considered is a \nvery important piece of legislation that has been the subject of \nconsiderable effort for over a year now in the Judiciary Committee in \nthe House.\n  Great efforts have been expended by all parties interested in this \nlegislation to achieve a piece of legislation that would provide \nenhanced protections to private property owners and at the same time \nwould not undermine, in a real and significant and unnecessary way, the \nability of law enforcement agencies to seize and forfeit to the \ninterest of the Government assets from illegal drug dealers and other \ncriminal assets that are forfeited.\n  In the early 1980s, this Congress passed one of its most historic \npieces of legislation that attacked crime in America. It was the asset \nforfeiture law. At that time, I was a U.S. attorney in Mobile, AL. This \nFederal law became a daily part of the work of my office.\n  We instructed our assistant U.S. attorneys that whenever they were \nprosecuting a drug case, it was not just enough to sentence and punish \nthe criminal, they ought to be sure the ill-gotten gains, the profits \nthey made from selling illegal substances in this country, would be \nseized and forfeited to the United States.\n  On a regular basis that was done all over this country. It was a \nmajor, important, historic step against crime, particularly against \ndrug crime in America. Hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of \ndollars, have been forfeited from illegal enterprises since that day. \nThe forfeitures are conducted under this Federal law, although States \nhave the ability to forfeit assets, too.\n  In Federal court, the Government had to prove its case, seize the \nasset; a cost bond would be posted by the defendant if he wished to \ncontest the seizure, and a court would hear the case and make a ruling \nin that fashion.\n  A number of people believed strongly that requiring a person to post \na cost bond was not a healthy thing under our legal system. They wanted \nto change that. Chairman Henry Hyde in the House Judiciary Committee \nfelt that way; so did Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. We began to analyze and study what we could do to \ndeal with this problem of asset forfeiture.\n  At the time, Senators Schumer, Thurmond, Biden, and myself introduced \nasset forfeiture reform legislation in the Senate. Senators Hatch and \nLeahy introduced another piece of legislation that was closer to the \nHyde bill.\n  For some months now, we have worked together to see what we could do \nto protect legitimate constitutional rights of American citizens, while \nat the same time protecting this tremendous asset to law enforcement of \nthe seizing and forfeiting of assets.\n  It is wrong, in my opinion, for a person who has made his money and \nhis livelihood for years selling dope in America to go to jail and \nleave a mansion out there that he can come back to and the Federal \ntaxpayers having to pay for his time in jail, or to have bank accounts \nwith hundreds of thousands of dollars in them and not have that seized \nby the Government but, in fact, serving his time in jail and getting \nout and living high off the ill-gotten gains he achieved as a drug \ntrafficker.\n  I would say, 98 percent of forfeitures in America today in Federal \ncourt are as a result of drug cases.\n  In my relatively small office in Alabama, when I was a U.S. attorney, \nwe seized probably $8 million to $10 million that we actually turned \ninto the Federal Treasury, after expenses and other items were paid.\n  In one case, we seized a Corvette automobile that was rumored to be \nworth hundreds of thousands of dollars because it was a unique \nCorvette. In fact, the drug dealer's car eventually was sold for \n$170,000, as I remember. We seized mansions in Florida on the Gulf \nCoast. We seized bank accounts in foreign countries--big freighters, \nsmall boats, expensive sail boats, automobiles of all kinds, and bank \naccounts into the millions of dollars.\n  These are effective tools against the drug trafficking industry. In \nfact, many countries now recognize that, and they are at this time \nattempting to pass similar laws in their countries. It certainly is \nimportant to America.\n\n  I believed very strongly that when we set about amending this law, we \ndo not need to place any unnecessary burdens on law enforcement and the \nprosecutors who will have to handle these cases. In fact, a large \npercentage, perhaps 90 percent or more, of these cases are confessed by \nthe defendant because he has to establish where he got this money. Not \nmany people can explain why they have $50,000 in cash in the trunk of \ntheir car along with maybe a few kilograms of cocaine. Normally, there \nis evidence in addition that they have been a drug dealer and that they \nhaven't had employment; that their house note is being paid in cash. \nOftentimes they paid for their Mercedes automobile in cash, those kinds \nof things. So the proof turns out to be pretty good, as a normal rule.\n  I believe the negotiation over this legislation was a fine example of \nthe Senate at work; the Senate and House, as a matter of fact. We \nbelieve the agreement that has been reached today will both satisfy the \nHouse Judiciary Committee leadership and the Senate Judiciary Committee \nleadership. Now it has already passed the Senate. If the identical bill \npasses in the House, it will become law. We will have done what we set \nout to do, to pass legislation that will strengthen protections and \ncivil liberties in America without undermining the rule of law in this \ncountry.\n  I was proud to be a part of that. We worked very hard on it. I \nexpress particular appreciation to my staff on the Judiciary Committee: \nKristi Lee, who is now U.S. Magistrate in Mobile, AL, and Ed Haden, who \nis with me today, who both worked with extraordinary skill to make this \nlegislation become a reality.\n  In recent weeks, I am particularly proud of the work Ed Haden has \ndone to be firm and strong for good, solid legislation that could have \nthe support of law enforcement in America.\n  I also express my appreciation for the leadership of Senator Hatch \nwho chairs the Judiciary Committee. His skill and knowledge on these \nissues is unsurpassed, and his dedication to American law is \nunsurpassed.\n  I also was extraordinarily impressed with the commitment and \nknowledge and ability of Chairman Henry Hyde of the House Judiciary \nCommittee. His insight and commitment to making this law better was \nremarkable, and I think the result has been something of which we can \nall be proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/27/senate-section/article/S1762-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ORDER FOR STAR PRINT--S. 2285\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.
