Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Iowa be recognized to make a brief statement, and then I will \ncontinue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \npending amendment with my colleague from Virginia, Senator Robb. \nSenator Robb has been a great advocate for improving education for many \nyears.\n  The facts about the need for this amendment to help modernize and \nupgrade our nation's public school facilities are well known.\n  The average school building is 42 years old. Nearly three-quarters of \nall public schools were built before 1970.\n  Fourteen million American children attend classes in schools that are \nunsafe or inadequate and the General Accounting Office estimates it \nwill cost $112 billion to upgrade existing public schools to overall \ngood condition.\n  Forty-six percent of schools lack adequate electrical wiring to \nsupport the full-scale use of technology.\n  Enrollment in elementary and secondary schools is at an all time high \nand will continue to grow over the next 10 years, making it necessary \nfor the United States to build an additional 6,000 schools.\n  It is a national disgrace that the nicest places that our children \nsee are shopping malls, sports arenas and movie theaters and the most \nrun down place they see are their public schools. What signal are we \nsending them about the value we place on them, their education and \nfuture?\n  How can we prepare our kids for the 21st century in schools that did \nnot make the grade in the 20th century?\n\n[[Page S984]]\n\n  Last year I visited Hiatt Middle School in Des Moines. This school \nopened its doors in 1925 and students spend all but a few hours a week \nin classrooms built during a time when Americans could not imagine the \ntechnological advances that would occur by the end of the century.\n  In 1925, Americans were flocking to movie theaters to see--and hear--\nthe first talking motion picture--Al Jolson's ``The Jazz Singer.'' The \nstudents who walked through the doors of the brand new Hiatt school \nthat year could not imagine IMAX theaters with surround sound where a \nmovie goer actually becomes a part of the film.\n  In 1925, consumers were lining up in department stores to buy \nnovelties like electric phonographs, dial telephones, and self-winding \nwatches. CD's, DVD players, cellular telephones, or palm pilots were \nunthinkable.\n  And, the introduction of state-of-the-art technologies like rural \nelectrification and crop dusting were revolutionizing the lives of \nfamilies and farmers alike.\n  There have been incredible technological and scientific advances in \nthe past seven decades. Yet, our schools have not kept pace with the \ntimes. We continue to educate our children in schools built and \nequipped in bygone eras.\n  We must make sure that every child and every school can facilitate \nthe technology of the 21st century. However, Iowa State University \nreports that we need at least $4 billion over the next ten years to \nrepair and upgrade school buildings in Iowa and make sure they can \neffectively utilize educational technology.\n  The amendment we are offering is a comprehensive, two-prong response \nto this critical national problem.\n  First, we would authorize $1.3 billion to make grants and loans for \nemergency repairs to public schools.\n  Mr. President, the Iowa Fire Marshall reported a five-fold increase \nin the number of fires in schools over the past decade. During the \n1990's there were 100 fires in Iowa schools. During the previous decade \nthere were 20.\n  It is clear that public schools have an urgent need to make repairs \nnow and these grants and no-interest loans will finance up to 8,300 \nrepair projects. We will fix the roofs, upgrade the electrical systems, \nand repair the fire code violations.\n  The second part of our comprehensive strategy is to provide $25 \nbillion in tax credits to modernize our nation's schools. These tax \ncredits will subsidize the interest on new construction projects that \nwill enable school districts to build new schools to replace outdated \nbuildings or add more class rooms so they can reduce class size.\n  A few weeks ago I visited a school in Des Moines where students \nattend class in closets because there is no room. This is simply \nunacceptable.\n  In closing, I would like to share a few words from Tunisia, \nWashington, D.C. fifth grader in Jonathan Kozol's book, ``Savage \nInequalities.''\n\n       It's like this. The school is dirty. There isn't any \n     playground. There's a hole in the wall behind the principal's \n     desk. What we need to do is first rebuild the school. Build a \n     playground. Plant a lot of flowers. Paint the classrooms. Fix \n     the hole in the principal's office. Buy doors for the toilet \n     stalls in the girl's bathroom. Make it a beautiful clean \n     building. Make it pretty. Way it is, I feel ashamed.\n\n  Our amendment will make it possible to rebuild her schools. It will \nmake it possible to fix the hole in the wall, put doors on the bathroom \nstalls and paint the classrooms. By modernizing and repairing Tunisia's \nschools we will make her feel a little less ashamed of herself and her \nschool.\n  This is a serious national problem. And it demands a comprehensive \nnational response. Our amendment is that response and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important amendment.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the pending amendment \nwith my colleague from Virginia, Senator Robb. Senator Robb has truly \nbeen one of the educational leaders over his tenure in the Senate. He \nhas shown great leadership especially in this area that is so important \nas we are reducing class sizes around the country. I have visited \nschools in Iowa and other States recently where, because of the \nreduction of class sizes, they are out of room; they need more space. \nAnd we know the average school building in this country is 42 years \nold; 74 percent of our schools were built before 1970.\n  The Robb amendment addresses this very critical need in our country. \nI am proud to be a cosponsor. I congratulate him for his very strong \nleadership in the whole area of education but especially in the area of \nmodernizing and rebuilding our schools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague from Iowa for his statement this \nmorning and for his continued leadership in education.\n  Mr. President, we are now considering amendment No. 2861. It is an \namendment I sent to the desk yesterday afternoon but agreed to debate \nthis morning.\n  I always welcome any opportunity to talk about education, about its \nimportance to our society, about ways we can improve our system of \neducation, and about how we at the Federal level can be better partners \nwith our States, our localities, and our families.\n  We met yesterday morning with the Governors of our 50 States. During \nmy own term as Governor of Virginia in the early 1980s, we took a great \ndeal of pride in being able to pump over $1 billion of new money--over \nand above the baseline projections--into public education. That was \nback when $1 billion was still serious money.\n  Education is not the only engine of innovation fueling opportunity \nfor economic prosperity; it is one of the most critical tools in \nmaintaining a democracy. Thomas Jefferson said that ``an enlightened \ncitizenry is indispensable to the proper functioning of a Republic.'' \nSo when we have an opportunity to talk in this Chamber about education, \nwe are really talking about our future as well as our past.\n  To my dismay, the opportunity we have today to engage in really \nproductive and constructive debate about education is really a mirage. \nWe have traveled this road before. We have debated this same bill and \nothers similar to it, and the President has exercised his veto power \nand has promised to veto this bill again if it arrives in its current \ncondition.\n\n  The Affordable Education Act, while it contains many admirable \nprovisions that would primarily enhance the affordability of higher \neducation, also contains a poison pill, one that many of us are simply \nunable to swallow. This bill, in essence, would allow the diversion of \npublic moneys to private elementary and secondary schools. As stewards \nof public taxpayer dollars, any policy that diverts public money away \nfrom public schools, it seems to me, is both unwise and inequitable.\n  We have heard many times the figures about education savings \naccounts. The average tax benefit to parents whose children attend \nprivate schools would be $37 a year while the benefit to families whose \nchildren attend public schools would be just $7 a year. Yet we know \nthat 90 percent of our schoolchildren attend public schools. We also \nknow our classrooms are overcrowded and many are dilapidated to the \npoint of being unsafe. We know we face a very real and imminent teacher \nshortage over the next 10 years. We know we need to continue our \nefforts to help States finish the business we started with Goals 2000. \nWe need to help States align their new standards and assessments with \ntheir curricula. We know we need to encourage more professional \ndevelopment for teachers and administrators. I believe we need to give \neven greater flexibility to States and localities in the use of Federal \ndollars in exchange for improved academic performance. We need to do \nall of these things and more.\n  I wish to talk about one specific area that demands our immediate \nattention. As a member of the Finance Committee, I have frequently \nmentioned the need to build and modernize our Nation's schools. In \nfact, I introduced school modernization legislation last July. It has \n21 cosponsors and has been endorsed by over 50 organizations, from \neducation groups to professional organizations to the National \nConference of Mayors.\n  Without good, safe, and modern facilities, the rest of the education \ndebate becomes practically moot. When a roof collapses, teachers and \nadministrators really care most about fixing the roof and reopening the \nschool. When fuses blow because of poor electrical wiring, \nadministrators know\n\n[[Page S985]]\n\nthey can't buy more computers before first rewiring the schools. \nTrailers may be a cheaper temporary fix to the problem of overcrowded \nclassrooms, but even the most modern trailers are not adequate to \naccommodate 21st century learning.\n  One of the largest investments Congress ever made in our national \ninfrastructure occurred under the leadership of a Republican President, \nDwight Eisenhower. In the 1950s, we spent roughly $1 billion to build \nand renovate our Nation's schools. That was a time when $1 billion \nreally meant something. My friends in Fairfax County tell me it now \ncosts them over $25 million to build just one high school. My friends \nin Loudoun County need 22 more new schools in the next 5 to 6 years \nbecause of skyrocketing enrollments.\n  There are a lot of problems we face in the education arena, but we \nsimply can't ignore the massive infrastructure problem we have anymore. \nEveryone, from civil engineers to architects to construction firms to \nthe education community, recognizes that we have to help and we have to \nhelp now. All of our talk about reducing class size and improving \ntechnology education and investing in school safety really puts the \ncart before the horse when there are no new classrooms for the newly \nhired teachers, no electrical upgrades to handle the new computers, no \nnew roofs to ensure the safety of our children.\n  Instead of talking about legislation which clearly is destined for \ndefeat or veto, we could be talking about reauthorizing the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act. Instead of talking about giving greater \ntax benefits to 10 percent of American families, we could be talking \nabout how to better serve the 90 percent of American families who want \nthe best education system that all levels of government can provide. \nInstead of talking about pouring money into private schools, I would \nrather be talking about pouring foundations for public schools.\n  So I offer an amendment with Senator Harkin, Senator Conrad, Senator \nLautenberg, and Senator Bingaman that would authorize $25 billion in \ntax credit bonds for school modernization and renovation. The amendment \nwould also authorize up to $1.3 billion a year for the next 5 years in \ngrants and zero-interest loans to needy school districts so they could \nmake urgent repairs such as those required to remedy fire code \nviolations and other urgently needed safety repairs.\n  This amendment still helps families save money for college. It still \nincreases the annual limit for education savings accounts to $2,000. It \nalso helps our States and localities meet a massive infrastructure \nneed.\n  In 1995, the GAO estimated we had $112 billion in repair needs and \n$73 billion in new construction needs. In a study just released by the \nNational Education Association, the total unmet school infrastructure \nneeds across the country now total $307 billion. These numbers were \ngathered from the individual State departments of education across the \ncountry. These are the dollars our States admit they can't come up with \ndespite their surpluses. Even if every State used all of their \navailable surpluses, that amount would still only meet 7.1 percent of \nthe school construction needs that exist now nationwide.\n\n  I don't think this Congress has taken seriously the enormity of this \nparticular problem. We can't just sit by and do nothing. Without the \npending amendment, the school construction assistance provided in this \nbill is negligible. Our amendment would help build 6,000 schools and \nhelp make urgent repairs to some 25,000 schools. The underlying bill we \nare considering today will only build or renovate 200 schools. That is \na stark contrast.\n  With over 12 million children attending schools with leaky roofs, our \nstudents deserve better. With over 3,000 trailers being used in my \nState of Virginia alone, our students deserve better. In Alabama, it is \nreported that the roof of an elementary school collapsed just after the \nchildren had left for the day. In Chicago, teachers place cheesecloth \nover air vents to keep lead-based paint flecks from getting into their \nclassrooms. In Maine, some teachers are forced to turn out the lights \nwhen it rains because their wiring is exposed under leaking roofs. The \nlist goes on and on.\n  Helping States and localities build schools doesn't interfere with \nlocal school control. We know the overwhelming majority of school \ndistricts face this particular infrastructure crisis. I simply do not \naccept the argument that the Federal Government cannot and should not \nplay a role in this crisis. The needs are simply too great. If we can \nhelp States and localities build roads, we can certainly help them \nbuild schools. Both are critical to our sustained economic success.\n  We should expect great things from our Nation's schools and our \nNation's students. They should expect real debate and results from \nCongress. But by choosing to rehash the same old debate about helping \nwealthy families pay for private school, we send a message to America \nthat this Congress is more interested in sound bites than in solutions.\n  The American people, and many Members here, are thirsty for solution-\noriented dialog. If this bill is passed without addressing some of the \nmost urgent needs, we are not meeting our obligations and we are \nmissing a very real opportunity to make a difference.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I'd like to focus on the issue of school \nconstruction. All of us, Democrats and Republicans, recognize the need \nfor well constructed and well-maintained school facilities. Nobody \nwants an inadequate learning environment for our children.\n  Senator Robb has offered an amendment on school construction. His \namendment, as I understand it, basically contains the administration's \nschool construction package. I opposed this package last year, and I \ncontinue to do so today.\n  Before I even talk about Senator Robb's amendment, I want to make a \npoint that is often lost in this discussion. The Federal Government \nalready provides a significant subsidy for school construction. Under \ncurrent law, states and localities can issue debt that is exempt from \nfederal taxation. This benefit allows them to finance school \nconstruction by issuing long-term bonds at a much lower cost than they \notherwise could. The interest subsidy saves school districts money and \nallows them to stretch their resources to meet their needs.\n  Now let me comment on the substance of Senator Robb's amendment. \nAmong other things, it creates a new type of bond--called a ``qualified \nschool modernization bond'' and authorizes the issuance of up to $23.6 \nbillion of these bonds. Unlike regular tax-exempt bonds, for which the \nholder receives tax-exempt interest payments, holders of these new \nqualified school modernization bonds would receive a federal tax \ncredit, in an amount to be set by the Treasury Department.\n  This program involves a dramatic increase in federal bureaucracy, \nwhile at the same time striking at the heart of local control of \neducation--which is the hallmark of our nationwide educational system.\n  In order to qualify for these bonds, a state or local school district \nwould need to secure the approval of the Department of Education. In \ngiving its OK, the Department of Education is supposed to consider \nwhether a comprehensive survey of the district's renovation and \nconstruction needs had been completed, and how the state or locality \nwould respond to the construction needs. In other words, federal \nofficials in Washington would be micromanaging a local school \ndistrict's renovation plans--in effect, second guessing the decision of \nstate and local officials.\n  It just does not make sense for the Department of Education to get \ninvolved at this level. President Clinton himself stated in 1994 that \n``the construction and renovation of school facilities has \ntraditionally been the responsibility of state and local governments \nfinanced primarily by local taxpayers.'' In that respect at least, I \nagree with the President.\n  While I am on the subject of local control, I want to point out that \nstate and local governments have, in fact, responded to the need for \nschool construction and renovation. On March 3, 1999, the Finance \nCommittee had a\n\n[[Page S986]]\n\nhearing where we evaluated the appropriate federal role in school \nconstruction. At that time, Dr. Dennis Zimmerman of the Congressional \nResearch Service explained that since the early 1990's, the approval \nrates for school bond issues and for total school construction dollars \nhas increased substantially. From 1991 until 1998, the approval rate \nfor new issues went from less than 50 percent to almost 67 percent. \nDuring those same years, the approval rates for new construction \ndollars went from about 48 percent to over 82 percent.\n\n  Additionally, the inflation adjusted annual growth rate of school \nbond volume--measured in dollars--during the last 20 years is 7.7 \npercent. This compares to an annual school age population growth rate \nof only 0.2 percent and an annual increase of 4.1 percent in state/\nlocal receipts. With respect to bond volume, in the first 6 months of \n1996, voters approved $13.3 billion in school bonds, an increase of \nmore than $4 billion over the first 6 months of 1995.\n  The bottom line is that many states and localities are doing their \nhomework, passing bonds, building and renovating schools, and enjoying \nfavorable treatment under the existing Tax Code. They are stepping up \nand meeting the challenge--and they are doing so without a massive \nintrusion by the Federal Government. One of the witnesses at our \nhearing, Bill Manning, the president of a large school district in my \nlittle State of Delaware, told us that if we really wanted to improve \neducation at the local level, we should diminish the federal role, \nrather than increase it.\n  The package of school construction measures in the Finance Committee \nbill would retain state and local control, and would also work within \nthe existing tax-exempt bond framework. The latter point is important \nbecause our purpose here is to provide state and local governments with \nincentives that they can use, and not concepts that are untested and \nuncertain.\n  For instance, 2 years ago, Congress enacted a tax credit bond program \nfor school construction. Called qualified zone academy bonds \n(``QZABs''), the law provided for an authorization of $400 million in \n1998 and $400 million in 1999. According to the Bond Market \nAssociation, however, few QZAB transactions have taken place.\n  Mr. President, in the extenders tax legislation last fall, we did \nextend the QZAB program through 2001. One of the reasons for this \nextension was to evaluate how this pilot program is performing. My \npoint here is simply that setting up a big program with a high \nauthorization does not always translate into a successful policy \nresult. We need to look at how the program will play out in the real \nworld--whether the rhetoric will translate into results. We need to \nlook at how the program will play out in the real world.\n  The proposals in the Finance Committee bill provide local school \ndistricts with the flexibility they need to address the needs of their \nconstituents. On this point, does anyone really believe Washington, DC, \nbureaucrats really understand local school construction needs better \nthan the local school board?\n  How do we accomplish the objective of enhancing the financing of \nschool construction activities, while maintaining local control, in \nthis bill?\n\n  The answer is several important school construction measures.\n  The first proposal is directed at innovative financing for school \ndistricts. It expands the tax exempt bond rules for public/private \npartnerships set up for the construction, renovation, or restoration of \npublic school facilities in these districts. In general, it allows \nstates to issue tax-exempt bonds equal to $10 per state resident. Each \nstate would receive a minimum allocation of at least $5 million of \nthese tax-exempt bonds. In total, up to 600 million per year in new tax \nexempt bonds would be issued for these innovative school construction \nprojects.\n  This proposal is important because it retains state and local \nflexibility. It does not impose a new bureaucracy on the states and it \ndoes not force the Federal Government to micromanage school \nconstruction.\n  The proposal also is important because it promotes the use of public/\nprivate partnerships. Many high-growth school districts may be too poor \nor too overwhelmed to take on a school construction project themselves. \nWith these bonds, those districts can partner with a private entity--\nand still enjoy the benefits of tax-exempt financing.\n  Mr. President, there is a second bond provision in this bill. That \nprovision is designated to simplify the issuance of bonds for school \nconstruction. Under current law, arbitrage profits earned on investment \nunrelated to the purpose of the borrowing must be rebated to the \nFederal Government. However, there is an exception--generally referred \nto as the small issuer exception--which allows governments to issue to \n$5 million of bonds without being subject to the arbitrage rebate \nrequirement. We recently increased this limit to $10 million for \ngovernment that issue at least $5 million of public school bonds during \nthe year.\n  The provision in the Finance Committee bill increase the smaller \nissuer exemption to $15 million, provided that at least $10 million of \nthe bonds are issued to finance public schools. This measure will \nassist localities in meeting school construction needs by simplifying \ntheir use of tax-exempt financing. At the same time, it will not create \nincentives to issue such debt earlier or in larger amounts than is \nnecessary. It is a type of targeted provision that makes sense.\n  Mr. President, I also want to make sure that my colleagues realize \nthat the Robb Amendment strikes the language in the bill relating to K-\n12 withdrawals from education savings accounts. This flexibility--the \nability to use a family's savings for any of the family's education \nexpenses--is a central component of this bill. Removing it sends the \nwrong message to American families and does nothing to help them meet \nthe increasing need of education.\n\n  For these reasons, I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to \ndo so as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the statement of Dr. \nDennis Zimmerman of the Congressional Research Service and Mr. William \nManning of the Red Clay Consolidated School District Board of Education \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Prepared Statement of Dr. Dennis Zimmerman\n\n       State and local governments historically have assumed most \n     of the financial responsibility for public elementary and \n     secondary schools. They raised about 92 percent of total \n     school revenue for school year 1995-96; the federal \n     government contributed about eight percent of revenue.\n       Federal financial support can be divided into two major \n     components. Direct federal support provided by on-budget \n     spending programs in school year 1995-96 amounted to $19.1 \n     billion (as measured by the states), 6.6 percent of total \n     school revenue. The federal policy objectives of this direct \n     federal spending are fairly clear: 55 percent of this \n     assistance in fiscal year 1995 targeted disadvantaged \n     children; another 22 percent targeted disabled children; 12 \n     percent targeted school system support for such things as \n     professional development and drug abuse education; and six \n     percent targeted children whose parents live and/or work on \n     federal property.(1)\n       Indirect federal support for capital facilities is provided \n     through the tax system. The interest income individuals and \n     businesses earn on state and local debt is excluded from \n     their taxable income. This exclusion lowers the interest rate \n     on state-local debt, a reduction in effect paid for by the \n     federal tax revenue not collected on the excluded interest \n     earnings. The estimated revenue loss on school facilities \n     bonds amounted to $3.7 billion in 1996, about 1.2 percent of \n     total education revenue.(2) The federal government imposes no \n     limit on the amount of tax-exempt bonds state-local \n     governments may issue for governmentally owned school \n     facilities.\n       Unlike federal direct spending for public elementary and \n     secondary schools, this tax subsidy is not motivated by a \n     federal education policy objective. Its existence is a \n     byproduct of the income tax structure established in 1913 \n     which incorporated the concept that the various levels of \n     government should refrain from taxing each other. As a \n     result, the tax subsidy is identical for all state-local \n     capital facilities--schools, roads, hospitals, parks, etc.--\n     and does not affect state-local taxpayer choices among \n     different types of facilities.\n       In summary, three facts stand out about federal financial \n     support for public elementary and secondary schools:\n       It is minor compared to state-local support.\n       On-budget spending is targeted to four major policy \n     objectives (the disadvantaged, the disabled, system support, \n     and the federally impacted).\n       The major tax subsidy was not adopted to pursue a federal \n     education policy objective,\n\n[[Page S987]]\n\n     and has been structured not to influence state-local taxpayer \n     choice among capital facilities for different public \n     services.\n\n\n     The State-Local Sector and America's Public School Facilities\n\n       Attention recently has focused on the deficiencies of \n     public elementary and secondary school capital facilities. \n     Studies have suggested that as much as $112 billion of \n     investment may be necessary to restore school facilities to \n     good overall condition, and that the resources of many local \n     school districts are inadequate to rectify the situation.(3)\n       It is useful to evaluate this information in an economic \n     context. The gap between ``good overall condition'' of school \n     facilities and their current condition is a serious problem \n     not to be minimized that undoubtedly has an adverse impact on \n     human capital formation. But budget constraints are a fact of \n     life: our desire for both private and public spending \n     (consumption) exceeds our ability to pay for it. It is likely \n     that a similar study assessing the condition of state-local \n     capital facilities for any function--roads, sewage treatment \n     plants, prisons--would reach a similar conclusion.(4) A gap \n     exists between the ``good overall condition'' of the capital \n     stock we desire and the less-than-good overall condition we \n     choose to live with.\n       When making budget allocation decisions, state-local \n     decision makers decide where to spend additional tax revenue \n     based in part upon their assessment of which activity will \n     provide the highest return or value. It is a given that \n     positive returns will result from additional investment in \n     almost any activity funded by state-local budgets. But a \n     ten percent return in education facilities will not be \n     funded if decision makers judge a twelve percent return is \n     available in sewage treatment facilities. In other words, \n     one must consider the possibility that state-local \n     decision makers made their spending decisions with \n     complete information; that they chose the existing less-\n     than-good condition of education facilities because they \n     place a higher value on spending the available tax revenue \n     for private consumption or other state-local services.\n       For the Nation as a whole, state-local taxpayers have not \n     been neglecting education facilities. Table 1 presents \n     referendum data on public elementary and secondary school \n     bond issues for the years 1988 through 1998. The percentage \n     of bond issues approved and the percentage of dollars \n     approved appear in columns 2 and 3. Both series tell \n     approximately the same story. Approval rates declined \n     substantially in the early 1990s, reaching a low of 49.9 \n     percent for Issues in 1991 and 48.4 percent for Dollars in \n     1993. Since those lows, the approval percentage for both \n     Issues and Dollars has risen substantially. The 1998 approval \n     rates of 66.8 percent for Issues and 82.4 percent for Dollars \n     are now higher than the levels that prevailed in 1988.\n\n TABLE 1.

We are now in the longest \n     uninterrupted economic expansion in the Nation's history, \n     during which the state-local surplus rose from $80.1 billion \n     in 1990 to $148.7 billion in 1998. As real income rises, \n     state-local taxpayers can be expected to spend more on a wide \n     range of public services, including investment in schools. \n     But these bond data do not provide evidence about how much of \n     the growing bond volume was necessary to keep pace with \n     growing student enrollment and whether schools were faring \n     better or worse than other state-local services.\n       Table 2 compares the 7.7 percent real annual growth rate of \n     school bond volume over the last two decades to the rates for \n     school-age population (ages 5 to 19) and state-local receipts \n     net of federal grants.\n       The school-age population grew at a 0.2% annual rate, so \n     most of this 7.7 percent real annual increase in bond volume \n     was devoted to maintaining or improving the facilities of a \n     relatively stable school population. State-local receipts net \n     of federal grants grew at a 4.1 percent real annual rate. \n     These data suggest state-local taxpayers have been devoting \n     an increasing share of own-financed revenue to schools, and \n     school construction spending has fared better than all other \n     functions combined.\n\n  TABLE 2.

Several circumstances arise which may cause school \n     districts to provide grossly inadequate school facilities, \n     and alleviation of some of these circumstances may be \n     consistent with historical federal policy objectives for \n     financing public elementary and secondary education.\n       A district might suffer from inadequate fiscal capacity; \n     residents may be poor and the district may lack significant \n     commercial and industrial property tax base. If its state \n     does not have a vigorous fiscal equalization program for \n     education finance, resources may not be available to provide \n     minimal capital facilities.\n       Some school districts might experience a substantial influx \n     of retirees, or be at the height of a long-term aging of \n     their population. Retirees may feel they have done their duty \n     by supporting school finance in their child-raising years. \n     Seeing few direct benefits to themselves, they may be \n     reluctant to support additional spending to maintain minimal \n     services, particularly if they have relocated.\n       Some school districts have experienced rapid population \n     growth (often resulting from immigration to the United \n     States). A ``normal'' financing effort might prove to be \n     inadequate to maintain minimal services when student \n     enrollment expands rapidly.\n       Some states and local governments impose very tight \n     borrowing restrictions and/or super-majority approval \n     requirements for bond referenda that may frustrate the \n     majority's spending preferences.\n\n\n                               in summary\n\n       The condition of America's school facilities may or may not \n     be worse than the capital facilities for other state-local \n     public services.\n       The proportion of school bond votes approved rose from a \n     low of 50 percent in 1991 to 67 percent in 1998. The \n     percentage of dollars approved in 1998 was 82 percent versus \n     49 percent in 1991.\n       State-local taxpayers have devoted an increasing share of \n     their own-source revenue to school bond finance; over the \n     last twenty years, the volume of new-issue school bonds has \n     grown at a 7.7 percent real annual rate, while state-local \n     own-source revenue has grown at a 4.1 percent real annual \n     rate. Since the school-age population has grown at a mere 0.2 \n     percent rate, most of this spending has been devoted to \n     maintaining or improving facilities.\n       These data present a favorable picture for the Nation's \n     school facilities, but may hide a subset of communities that \n     find it difficult to maintain adequate school facilities due \n     to: a high concentration of the poor; a concentration of \n     retirees who are reluctant to support school spending; high \n     population growth rates, sometimes resulting from an influx \n     of immigrants; and very tight borrowing restrictions and/or \n     super-majority requirements for approval of bond referenda.\n\n\n                       tax-exempt bond proposals\n\n       Several proposals have been introduced that would adjust \n     the current tax treatment of state-local debt to increase \n     federal financial support for school construction.(5) The \n     Administration has proposed Tax Credits for Holders of \n     Qualified School Modernization Bonds and Qualified Zone \n     Academy Bonds; Representative Archer has proposed a \n     lengthening of the period during which arbitrage can be \n     earned and not rebated to the Treasury; Senator Graham has \n     proposed allowing school facilities to be financed with \n     private-activity bonds; and it has been proposed that the \n     annual issuance ceiling to qualify for the small-issuer \n     arbitrage rebate exemption be raised. The last two proposals \n     were adopted by the Senate Finance Committee but not accepted \n     by the Conference.\n       Each of these proposals is described. Each proposal's \n     effect on the share of the debt service costs borne by state-\n     local taxpayers is estimated, and the targeting of the \n     proposal is compared to the targeting of federal on-budget \n     spending for elementary and secondary education.\n     School Modernization Bonds\n       Description. This Administration proposal would authorize \n     issuance of $11 billion of tax credit bonds in 2000 and $11 \n     billion in 2001. School bond volume in 1998 was about $23 \n     billion, so this proposal could be available to approximately \n     50 percent of the school bond market in 2000 and 2001.\n       Cost Reduction. Tax credit bonds pay 100 percent of state-\n     local interest cost on bonds, as opposed to 25 to 30 percent \n     of interest costs for traditional tax-exempt bonds. Thus, \n     unlike tax-exempt bonds, tax credit bonds lower the cost of \n     investing in school facilities relative to investing in \n     capital facilities for any other public purpose. This lower \n     relative cost would be a powerful incentive for state-\n     local taxpayers to adjust their public budgets and provide \n     more education services and less of all other services.\n       Targeting. Half of the annual borrowing authority would be \n     reserved for the Nation's communities with the highest \n     incidence of children living in poverty. The remaining half \n     would be allocated to the states and qualifying school \n     districts based upon the federal assistance they received \n     under the Basic Grant Formula for Title I of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (based primarily upon \n     incidence of low-income children). But states would not be \n     constrained by the Title I formula and could use any \n     appropriate mechanism for distributing the funds. Thus, half \n     of the subsidy\n\n[[Page S988]]\n\n     would conform to the federal government's existing criteria \n     for federal spending programs in education, and half could \n     potentially be spent on other school districts.\n     Relaxation of Arbitrage Restrictions\n       Description. State-local arbitrage bonds are tax-exempt \n     bonds issued where all or a major portion of the proceeds are \n     used to acquire securities with a higher yield. Because \n     state-local governments pay no federal income tax on their \n     interest earnings, Congress has restricted their ability to \n     earn arbitrage profits. Bonds for construction are allowed to \n     earn arbitrage profits if they conform to a schedule for \n     spending the bond proceeds: 10% within six months of \n     issuance; 45% within 12 months of issuance; 75% within 18 \n     months of issuance; 95% within 24 months of issuance; and the \n     permissible 5% retainage (amounts by which the earlier \n     targets are missed) within 36 months. Failure to comply \n     triggers a requirement to rebate the arbitrage earnings to \n     the U.S. Treasury.\n       This proposal would slow and lengthen the spend-down \n     schedule that must be met for bonds issued to finance public \n     school education facilities in order to qualify for exemption \n     from arbitrage rebate. No rebate would be required if: 10 \n     percent of bond proceeds is spent within 1 year of issuance; \n     30 percent is spent within 2 years; 50 percent is spent \n     within 3 years; and 95 percent is spent within 4 years. The 5 \n     percent retainage would have to be spent within 5 years. The \n     proposal applies to all school bonds.\n       Cost reduction. Issuers must be cautious when attempting to \n     earn arbitrage profits. Suppose the interest rate on the tax-\n     exempt bond issue is 6 percent and the interest rate on a \n     comparable long-term taxable bond is 8 percent. In theory, \n     the issuer could earn 2 percent arbitrage profit by investing \n     the tax-exempt bond proceeds in 8 percent long-term taxable \n     securities. This is a risky investment strategy. The issuer's \n     investment horizon is short because the spend-down rules \n     require sale of all the securities within 36 months (60 \n     months if this proposal is passed). Should interest rates \n     have risen when the issuer must sell the taxable bond to pay \n     for construction costs, the bond must be sold at a discount \n     and the issuer will suffer a capital loss that could easily \n     exceed the arbitrage earnings. Thus, the calculations in this \n     testimony assume the issuer earns arbitrage profits of 0.75 \n     percent, not the 2 percent yield differential. The important \n     point here is not so much the share of the principal that \n     could be paid off by the arbitrage profits, but the \n     differential between current law and the proposed changes.\n       Assuming the issuer takes maximum advantage of arbitrage \n     opportunities with a 0.75 percent profit, current law could \n     provide arbitrage profits for tax-exempt bonds sufficient to \n     pay for 1.05 percent of the amount borrowed. For tax credit \n     bonds, this percentage would rise to 9.5.(6) Allowing a five-\n     year spend-down period for tax-exempt bonds would increase \n     the percentage borrowed that could be financed with arbitrage \n     profits from 1.05 to 2.4 percent. If combined with tax credit \n     bonds, the percentage would rise from 9.5 to 21.2 percent.\n       Targeting. The arbitrage proposal would apply to all school \n     bonds. No attempt is made to target its availability to \n     school districts that meet the federal government's targeting \n     criteria for its on-budget spending programs.\n     Public School Construction Partnership Act\n       Description. This proposal introduced by Senator Graham in \n     the 105th Congress would include public elementary and \n     secondary education facilities in the list of exempt \n     facilities eligible for the use of tax-exempt private-\n     activity bonds. A state could issue bonds equal to the \n     greater of $10 per resident or $5 million on behalf of \n     corporations that would use the bond proceeds to build school \n     facilities and lease the buildings to school districts. A \n     corporation must charge a lease payment such that the \n     building could be transferred to the school district at the \n     end of the contract without further compensation to the \n     corporation. The bonds would not be subject to the private-\n     activity bond volume cap, so they would not compete with \n     other private-activity bonds for scarce borrowing authority.\n       Cost reduction. This proposal might reduce the federal \n     subsidy. Private-activity education facility bonds would be \n     issued as revenue bonds whose debt service is secured by the \n     corporation building and operating the facility rather than \n     as general obligation bonds whose debt service is secured by \n     the full faith and credit of the issuing school district. As \n     a result, the interest rate on the private-activity school \n     bonds is likely to be higher and the spread between the \n     taxable interest rate and the interest rate on the school \n     bonds is likely to be lower. The federal government would pay \n     a smaller share of interest costs than it would pay on \n     governmental tax-exempt school bonds.\n       A school district that chose this option could conceivably \n     receive compensation sufficient to offset its higher interest \n     cost in two ways. First, it might face very restrictive bond \n     referenda requirements that preclude getting approval from \n     the voters. Although private-activity bonds require the \n     issuing jurisdiction to hold a public meeting, they do not \n     require a vote. Second, the corporation might be a more \n     efficient builder and operator of the facility, or it may be \n     able to avoid compliance with a host of regulatory rules \n     pertaining to government construction projects (such as the \n     Davis-Bacon Act). These savings might enable the corporation \n     to provide lease terms whose present discounted value is \n     lower than would be the case for principal and interest \n     payments on the debt.(7)\n       Targeting. All but $5 million must be allocated to high-\n     growth school districts, defined as having: (1) a 5,000 or \n     greater student enrollment in the second academic year \n     preceding the date of the bond issuance; and (2) an increase \n     in student enrollment of at least 20 percent in the 5-year \n     period ending with that second academic year. It is not clear \n     how many of the eligible districts would have characteristics \n     that are targeted by federal on-budget education spending.\n     Small Issuer Arbitrage Exemption\n       Description. When the requirement for rebate of arbitrage \n     earnings was enacted in 1986, governmental units that issued \n     no more than $5 million of bonds per year were exempt. In \n     1997, the exemption limit was increased to $10 million, \n     provided at least $5 million is used to finance public school \n     construction. This proposal would increase the exemption \n     limit to $15 million, provided at least $10 million is used \n     to finance public school construction.\n       Cost reduction. The value of the small-issuer exemption is \n     that the spend-down rules do not apply; the issuer can earn \n     arbitrage profits on the amount borrowed for the entire \n     three-year spend-down period. When considering a $5 million \n     marginal investment on a variety of public functions, state-\n     local taxpayers will likely notice that (under current law) \n     school bonds could earn arbitrage profits sufficient to pay \n     2.3 percent of the amount borrowed, while bonds for other \n     functions could earn arbitrage profits sufficient to pay only \n     1.05 percent of the amount borrowed. If tax credit bonds \n     could be combined with the small-issuer exception (while \n     retaining the three-year spend-down requirement), arbitrage \n     profits would be sufficient to pay 20.3 percent of the amount \n     borrowed.\n       Targeting. This provision would apply only to relatively \n     small governmental units. It is not clear how many of these \n     units would have the characteristics that are targeted by \n     federal on-budget education spending.\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n       (1) U.S. Library of Congress, Congressional Research \n     Service, Public School Expenditure Disparities: Size, \n     Sources, and Debates over Their Significance, No. 96-51 EPW \n     by Wayne Riddle and Liane White, December 19, 1995, 31p.\n       (2) Indirect financial support is also provided by the \n     deductibility of state-local income and property taxes from \n     federal taxable income. This provision is not discussed here. \n     The tax-exempt bond revenue estimate is based on a 1996 \n     federal revenue loss from all outstanding bonds of $25 \n     billion (Budget of the U.S. Government, Analytical \n     Perspectives, Fiscal Year 1998), and assumes the school share \n     of the outstanding stock of all state-local bonds is equal to \n     the school share (14.7 percent) of new-issue state-local \n     bonds issued in 1996. A small amount of tax credit bonds are \n     also available for school districts with high concentrations \n     of students receiving free lunch.\n       (3) U.S. General Accounting Office, School Facilities: \n     America's Schools Not Designed or Equipped for 21st Century, \n     GAO/HEHS-95-95, April 4, 1995; and GAO, School Facilities: \n     Condition of America's Schools, GAO/HEHS-95-61, February 1, \n     1995.\n       (4) For an example, see Commission to Promote Investment in \n     America's Infrastructure, Financing the Future: Report of the \n     Commission to Promote Investment in America's Infrastructure, \n     February 1993.\n       (5) The question of whether these proposed increased \n     federal subsidies represent an improvement in economic \n     efficiency is complex. The answer depends in part upon the \n     extent to which returns from elementary and secondary \n     education accrue to society rather than the individual and \n     how widely these ``external'' benefits spill beyond state \n     borders.\n       (6) Since the federal government pays 100 percent of the \n     interest cost on tax credit bonds, arbitrage earnings would \n     be 6.75 percent, not the 0.75 percent for tax-exempt bonds.\n       (7) Some have suggested the efficiencies in such public/\n     private partnerships may be sufficiently great that school \n     districts could reduce costs even if they used taxable debt. \n     Ronald D.

Manning\n\n       Bill Manning has been President of the Red Clay \n     Consolidated School District Board of Education (Delaware's \n     second largest school district) for nine years. An attorney \n     by trade, Mr. Manning has been among Delaware's leaders in \n     proposing and implementing a variety of educational reforms: \n     public school choice, charter school legislation and rigorous \n     academic standards statewide. Red Clay is currently the only \n     district in Delaware to have reached an agreement with its \n     teachers association pursuant to which Red Clay teachers will \n     be evaluated based on student performance. Among other \n     recognitions, Mr. Manning was honored, in October, 1998, as \n     one of the nation's ``unsung heroes'' in education reform by \n     the Center for Education Reform in Washington, DC.\n       Demographically, Red Clay is a composite of all cross \n     sections of Delaware and America. It has both affluent areas \n     and poverty\n\n[[Page S989]]\n\n     stricken areas; suburban and city. Red Clay students speak a \n     variety of native languages, including a large component of \n     Spanish-speaking children.\n       Red Clay's capital assets are probably typical of those \n     found throughout America. No new schools have been built for \n     more than 30 years and existing schools require repair and \n     renovation. After one unsuccessful attempt, Red Clay received \n     referendum approval both to make the most needed repairs to \n     its buildings and invest in technology. That capital program, \n     however, is much smaller than Red Clay would prefer, and new \n     schools and renovations remain critical.\n\n\n      Statement Regarding the Federal Role in School Construction\n\n       I don't want to begin my testimony by assuming that the \n     federal government should have any role at all in public \n     education. Indeed, many of those in the education reform \n     community believe that the federal government should \n     diminish, rather than increase, its role in public education. \n     Let me give you one good reason why that is so. With all of \n     the talk regarding education reform these days, one \n     particular notion is being identified as having preeminent \n     importance: ``accountability.'' Indeed, it is acquiring \n     buzzword status. Presidents, members of Congress, governors \n     and school board members all over the country are talking \n     about the importance of accountability and they are all \n     correct. However, to the extent that you shift the locus of \n     decision making from the school to the district to the state \n     to the federal level, the more you have diminished the \n     chances that those responsible for delivering educational \n     services can be held accountable for their successes or \n     failures. Put another way, if I am a school administrator and \n     I can point to burdensome and inappropriate federal \n     regulations as the reason for my failure to provide adequate \n     facilities, I will.\n       All of that leads me to bring two messages today: (1) Don't \n     do anything at all and, if you have loose change rattling \n     around in the federal coffers, send it back to those who gave \n     it to you in the first place. (2) If you must do something, \n     make good on all the promises of local autonomy and \n     flexibility that inevitably accompany all such programs. \n     Don't let the public educational establishment claim that: \n     ``But for this federal regulation or that federal guideline, \n     we could have done the job.''\n       If you detect a note of cynicism about federal promises for \n     local autonomy and flexibility, you are correct. That \n     cynicism, however, is justified as we out in the states hear \n     more and more about some of the proposals before you. For \n     example, I understand that the President's proposal wants to \n     encourage capital spending by school districts that would not \n     have been possible without such financial assistance. \n     Therefore, as a criterion for eligibility, one would not be \n     surprised to see the Department of Education require an \n     applicant to make some sort of showing that its proposed \n     capital expenditure would not otherwise happen.\n       One imagines several responses to such a rule. First, the \n     ``green eyeshade guys'' that exist within each school \n     district will now slow down some projects, testing the \n     political waters each day to see whether increased federal \n     funding is soon to be available. After all, to move forward \n     with capital projects at this time may be to render them \n     ineligible at a later time. Thus, the games begin. Second, \n     what is so wrong with providing assistance to a district that \n     has already decided to ``bite the bullet'' and ignore other \n     priorities in order to make capital repairs? It seems to me \n     that this particular element of the President's proposal \n     removes, rather than creates, incentive for local \n     responsibility.\n       To take another example, one who is reading about the \n     President's current proposal comes away with the sense that \n     there will be significant means-testing within the \n     eligibility criteria. I certainly hope, on behalf of my \n     school district, that I will be able to use whatever capital \n     assistance the federal government decides to give me anywhere \n     in my district--whether it be in downtown Wilmington or out \n     in the suburbs.\n       Please understand that any federal rules and regulations \n     accompanying any new federal financial assistance will apply \n     on top of a host of other regulations already imposed at the \n     state level. Indeed, as I indicated, this hotchpot of \n     regulations imposed upon local school districts at the state \n     level already gives the establishment enough places to hide \n     from true accountability as it is. It is almost inconceivable \n     that a new regime of federal requirements would not be, in \n     some ways, inconsistent with a body of regulations that, in \n     my view, is already too large. Thus, the prospect of time \n     wasted and projects left undone because of conflicts between \n     federal and state regulation grows with every new federal \n     program. Please make any program that results from the \n     proposals before you serve as a testament that the federal \n     government can, if it wants to, render meaningful assistance \n     without creating matching unnecessary burdens.\n       Let me close with a few specific suggestions. First, I \n     believe, as do many of you, that charter schools are already \n     improving the educational landscape by offering variety, \n     quality and single-school focus to those who previously had \n     to pay to get those things. That's the good news. The bad \n     news is that charter schools are still regarded by the \n     educational establishment in some quarters as the enemy. \n     Thus, the organization that owns our school buildings is \n     sometimes stingy with them when it comes to housing charter \n     schools. Nor do the funding formulae in many state charter \n     school bills provide adequate capital--as opposed to \n     operating--assistance to charter schools. In that \n     environment, it would be particularly fitting if the federal \n     government took special care to ensure that our new charter \n     schools were well housed. Please don't overlook them.\n       As you review the variety of proposals before you, I \n     suggest that you carefully review those that would render \n     assistance to local school districts needing capital \n     assistance and simultaneously reduce federal ``red tape.'' In \n     Delaware, for example, we have several lending institutions \n     that are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank--one of the \n     Nation's few triple A rated institutions. If these lenders \n     could offer the Federal Home Loan Bank's credit to support \n     bond-financed school construction projects, then the cost of \n     debt--even tax exempt debt--would go down. However, for \n     reasons that appear only to have historical significance, \n     Federal Home Loan Banks are not permitted, under Section 149 \n     of the Internal Revenue Code, to provide such credit \n     enhancement. Nor does it appear that those federal (and \n     former federal) instrumentalities that are so authorized by \n     Section 149 (Federal Housing Administration, Veteran's \n     Administration, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and \n     Sallie Mae) are actually in the business of assisting school \n     financing. Thus, Section 149 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     should be amended to permit Federal Home Loan Banks to sell \n     credit enhancement products--at least in the area of school \n     construction finance if not all projects eligible for tax \n     exempt financing.\n       I appreciate the opportunity to share my thoughts with the \n     Committee. I realize that my plea to send those tax revenues \n     that might otherwise have been spent by the federal \n     government back to the taxpayers requires that Congress \n     ignore the political head of steam building over this issue. \n     So, if the federal government decides it wants or needs to \n     play a role in building schools, please do it in a way that \n     leaves school board members like me, as well as the \n     administrators and teachers who we employ, exposed to the \n     consequences of our failure, if that be the case, to do our \n     job and deliver a quality education to each of our students.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Robb. During consideration of S. 1134, the \nAffordable Education Act last year in the Finance committee, I joined \nmy colleague in offering a similar amendment during the markup. \nRegrettably, that amendment was not adopted.\n  Under the Robb amendment, an allocation of $24.8 billion in bonds \nwould be authorized to permit states and local school districts, over \nthe next 5 years, to issue bonds to modernize and renovate \napproximately 6,000 schools. Sixty-five percent of the bond authority \nwould be allocated to states based on their title I allocation, and 35 \npercent to the 100 school districts with the largest number of low-\nincome students. Additionally, $1.3 billion would be authorized for a \nnew grant and zero-interest loan program to fund the most urgent school \nrepair needs in local schools. There is also $400 million set aside for \nBureau of Indian Affairs schools.\n  Today we are considering our first major education measure of the \n21st century. It is critical that we weigh carefully the direction of \nthat education policy. What should our priorities be as we enter the \n21st century? How should we allocate our limited Federal resources in \neducation? How do we respond to growing concerns about the digital \ndivide, and what is the role of education in that debate?\n  Under S. 1134, the major provision of the bill would expand tax-free \nexpenditures from the current higher education individual retirement \naccount to permit student expenses for elementary and secondary \neducation including private, parochial, or public education. S. 1134 \nwould increase the limit on the annual contribution for an education \nIRA for a four-year period (2000-2003) to $2,000.\n  Expenses authorized for IRA expenditures would include traditional \nexpenses including tuition, books, supplies, computer equipment, \ntutoring services, as well as student expenses for room, board, \ntransportation and supplementary items. Additionally, S. 1134 makes a \nnumber of important changes, which I support, in prepaid tuition plans, \nemployer-provided educational assistance, and student loan interest \ndeduction.\n  There is no question, of the merits of encouraging families to save \nto meet the educational needs of their children. Education IRA's are \none way to encourage this savings, and we know it\n\n[[Page S990]]\n\nhas been very helpful to families planning for higher education \nexpenses. As we debate this legislation, however, it is critical that \nwe define our national education priorities, and allocate our limited \nFederal resources to meet those objectives. Does an expansion of \neducation IRA's respond to our national education priorities? Does the \nallocation of limited Federal resources for education IRA's respond to \nthe education needs of our children into the 21st century?\n  In the past 5 years, a number of very respected organizations have \nalerted us to the critical elementary and secondary school \ninfrastructure needs. In 1995, the GAO reported that $112 billion was \nneeded to bring the nation's schools into good overall condition. The \nreport cited that one-third of schools--about 25,000--were in need of \nextensive repairs. More recently, the National Center for Education \nStatistics released a report stating that the average public school in \nAmerica is 42 years old. Many of these schools are also lagging in \ntechnology infrastructure and their effort to connect to the Internet.\n\n  I know the need for repairs in our schools is great from my visits to \nNorth Dakota schools and conversations with educators, and state \nofficials. North Dakota State Superintendent of Schools, Wayne \nSanstead, informed me last year during consideration of the markup of \nS. 1134, that costs associated with school modernization in the North \nDakota would exceed $420 million. 88 percent of schools reported need \nto upgrade or repair facilities, and 62 percent reported unsatisfactory \nenvironmental conditions.\n  I ask unanimous consent Mr. President, that a letter from the N.D. \nDepartment of Public Instruction which outlines the critical school \ninfrastructure needs in North Dakota be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is critical that we ask whether an expansion of \neducation IRA's for elementary and secondary education expenses is the \nbest use of our limited Federal education dollars and responds to our \nnational education priorities. We need to examine who will benefit from \nthis IRA expansion as opposed to who will benefit from meeting school \ninfrastructure needs.\n  According to the Department of Treasury, 70 percent of the proposed \neducation IRA benefit would go to 20 percent of all taxpayers. Higher \nincome families would derive the most benefit. Many families with \nincomes less than $55,000 would receive little benefit. Additionally, \naccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the average annual \nbenefit for children attending private and parochial schools would be \nlimited to approximately $37.\n  On the other hand, 90 percent of our children attend public schools, \nand public school enrollments are increasing. According to the National \nCouncil on Education Statistics, a record 52.7 million children are \nenrolled in public schools, and that number is expected to increase to \n54.3 million by 2008. It is estimated that at least 2,400 new school \nfacilities will be needed to meet this student enrollment increase. \nStudies also show that building conditions and overcrowding in school \nfacilities are linked to student achievement.\n  There is no question where our education resources should be \ndirected. Although it is important to encourage families to save for \ntheir children's education, we have a more urgent need to ensure that a \nmajority of our children have the best educational environment for \nlearning. Regrettably, that is not the case in too many of our local \nschool districts. Local school districts face many challenges in school \nmodernization efforts. Interest payments on bonds are already a major \nexpense for local taxpayers. Additionally, taxpayers are burdened with \nmany unfunded Federal mandates and it becomes difficult to finance new \nconstruction or repairs through an expansion of bond authority. Also, \nmany of our rural communities across the nation, including North \nDakota, are experiencing declining enrollments in local school \ndistricts leaving many of these smaller, rural schools with more \nlimited education resources, and very limited ability to undertake bond \ninitiatives.\n  It is clear where Federal support for education should be directed. \nThe importance of school modernization is underscored by the emphasis \non technology in our economy in the 21st century. Information \ntechnology will play a key role in our continued economic growth. The \ncondition of our public school facilities, including technology \ninfrastructure and the ability to connect to the Internet, is critical \nin sustaining our current economic growth. It is also important in \nensuring that our children are equipped to enter the job markets in the \n21st century, and able to benefit from the extraordinary growth that we \nhave experienced in recent years.\n  School modernization is critical for our children's success, and \nshould be one of our key national education priorities as we enter the \n21st century. Local communities cannot face the task of funding the \nnecessary school building and technology infrastructure improvements on \ntheir own. They urgently need our help. I strongly urge my colleagues \nto vote in support of the amendment offered by Senator Robb.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                             Department of Public Instruction,\n\n                                      Bismarck, ND, March 2, 1999.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: I am writing this as a follow-up to \n     our recent conversation concerning the Senate Finance \n     Committee's plans to conduct hearings regarding funding for \n     school modernization.\n       I am attaching the executive summary of a school facilities \n     inventory completed by the Department of Public Instruction \n     with assistance from the Barton Malow Company. The study was \n     done in the fall of 1994 and the report was issued in January \n     of 1995.\n       While some school construction has taken place since that \n     time there is no reason to believe that the basic assumptions \n     outlined in the executive summary about North Dakota's needs \n     for school building renovation and upgrading have changed \n     significantly. As the executive summary indicates the total \n     projected costs to bring North Dakota's 453 public school \n     facilities up to state-of-the-art facilities would be \n     approximately $420 million or nearly one million dollars per \n     building.\n       Our small rural North Dakota school districts in particular \n     have extensive and potentially expensive school renovation \n     needs which have been consistently deferred because of budget \n     constraints due to fluctuations of our agricultural economy \n     and the impacts of significant declining enrollment which \n     further erodes school districts funding base.\n       Even in those few circumstances where some of these rural \n     districts consider consolidation school renovation would \n     still be needed. In fact, consolidation that appears to be \n     required in some rural areas to sustain school programs will \n     in turn require construction of updated larger facilities to \n     accommodate consolidation enrollments. Clearly, North Dakota, \n     and in this case, especially rural North Dakota would benefit \n     from federal financial assistance for school renovation and \n     construction.\n       In addition, North Dakota's Native American reservation \n     schools are in some cases in desperate need of renovation and \n     upgrading. While they have access to some funding through \n     other federal programs, our experience is that the money \n     available through those programs is not adequate and not \n     available in a timely fashion. These districts would also \n     benefit from a general federal infusion in the area of school \n     construction and renovation.\n       In sum, I am encouraged and strongly support your efforts \n     to pursue this source of funding to help our hard-pressed \n     agricultural areas. If I can provide further information or \n     be of advocacy assistance in this congressional effort please \n     do not hesitate to contact me at any time.\n       I look forward to visiting with you and your staff when I \n     once again preside over Council of Chief State School \n     Officers Legislative Committee deliberations on March 15 and \n     16.\n           With best wishes,\n                                            Dr. Wayne G. Sanstead,\n                                             State Superintendent.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I wish to address a couple of the issues \nraised by my distinguished colleague from Delaware. One of the issues \nthe Senator from Delaware suggested was that this creates a whole new \nbureaucracy. But with all due respect, it does not create a whole new \nbureaucracy. States only have to keep a tally on how much bonding \nauthority they have used. That is it. That is not a whole new \nbureaucracy.\n  Talking about the concern about assessments and making additional \nassessments, the truth is that most of the States have already made \nthose assessments. So we are not talking about any additional burden.\n\n[[Page S991]]\n\n  When we talk about the QZAB as not having been used, 94 school \ndistricts in 15 States have utilized the QZAB, and that, indeed, is the \nmodel upon which these school modernization bonds are featured. We are \nnot talking about an untested bill.\n  With respect to the number of students that we are trying to help \nunder the circumstances, currently we have 52.7 million students in \nAmerica's schools. In 8 years, that total will climb to 54.3 million \nstudents in our schools. We are talking about a significant increase in \nthe number of students at the same time we are trying to decrease the \nnumber of students in individual classes. We know the schools are \ngetting older and older, with the average age of the schools in this \ncountry today being 42 years old. We have a pressing, urgent problem.\n  With all due respect to my distinguished colleague from Delaware, I \nwould recommend a visit to a number of the schools because the schools \nin many cases are in desperate need of infrastructure repair. And this \nis designed to provide Federal assistance in ways that do not get \ninvolved in local school control. I recognize and respect that \nparticular feature.\n  This is simply designed to assess the financing of those greatly \nneeded improvements, which I believe the Senator from Delaware and any \nother Senator in this Chamber will find if they visit the schools in \ntheir districts. They are old and getting older, and we can't meet the \nreduction in class size. The school population is increasing. Most of \nthe children we are talking about for the years 2007 and 2008 are \nalready born. We know the numbers. We have to be able to respond to the \nneed. This is a way to do it without interfering with local control.\n  The basic difference between the two of us is whether or not we ought \nto put public moneys into private education or whether as stewards of \nthe public purse we have a responsibility to make sure we fund public \neducation first.\n  I respectfully request that my colleagues support this particular \nmeasure and stand up for the students and the future of education in \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues that we have \nalready considered and rejected the President's school construction \nproposal in the past. In 1998, in connection with an education tax \nbill, Senator Moseley-Braun offered the President's package, and it was \ndefeated by a vote of 56-42. Last year, my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Robb, offered this school construction plan, and it was \ndefeated 55-45.\n  We all agree on the need for well-built and well-maintained schools. \nThere is no one in this body who wants our children to learn in a \nsubstandard learning environment. But the evidence shows the States are \nstepping up and meeting the challenge of providing schools for their \nstudents. We should not create a new Federal program that injects the \nFederal bureaucracy into additional State and local controls. For these \nreasons, I oppose the amendment, and I move to table it.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to support of Senator \nRobb's amendment to provide funding for rebuilding and modernizing the \nnation's schools. The Coverdell bill does nothing for crumbling \nschools.\n  Schools, communities, and governments at every level have to do more \nto improve student achievement. Schools need smaller classes, \nparticularly in the early grades. They need stronger parent \ninvolvement. They need well-trained teachers in the classroom who keep \nup with current developments in their field and the best teaching \npractices. They need after-school instruction for students who need \nextra help, and after-school programs to engage students in \nconstructive activities. They need safe, modern facilities with up-to-\ndate technology.\n  But, all of these reforms will be undermined if facilities are \ninadequate. Sending children to dilapidated, overcrowded facilities \nsends a message to these children. It tells them they don't matter. No \nCEO would tolerate a leaky ceiling in the board room, and no teacher \nshould have to tolerate it in the classroom. We need to do all we can \nto ensure that children are learning in safe, modern buildings.\n  Nearly one third of all public schools are more than 50 years old. 14 \nmillion children in a third of the nation's schools are learning in \nsubstandard buildings. Half of all schools have at least one \nunsatisfactory environmental condition. The problems with ailing school \nbuildings aren't the problems of the inner city alone. They exist in \nalmost every community, urban, rural, or suburban.\n  In addition to modernizing and renovating dilapidated schools, large \nnumbers of communities across the country need to build new schools, in \norder to keep pace with rising enrollments and to reduce class sizes. \nElementary and secondary school enrollments have reached an all-time \nhigh again this year of 53.2 million students, and will continue to \nrise over the next ten years. The number will increase by 324,000 in \n2000, by another 282,000 in 2001, by still another 250,000 in 2002, and \ncontinue on an upward trend in the following years.\n  Last year, the Senate heard testimony from a student in Clifton, \nVirginia whose high school is so overcrowded that fights often break \nout in the overflowing halls. The problem is called ``Hall Rage,'' and \nit's analogous to ``Road Rage'' on crowded highways. The violence in \nthe hallways is bad enough. But it's even worse, because it's difficult \nfor teachers to teach when students are distracted by the chaos in the \nhallways and outside the classrooms.\n  The Department of Education estimates that 2,400 new public schools \nwill be needed by 2003 to accommodate rising enrollments. The General \nAccounting Office estimates that it will cost communities $112 billion \nto repair and modernize the nation's schools. Congress should lend a \nhelping hand and do all we can to help schools and communities across \nthe country meet this challenge.\n  In Massachusetts, 41 percent of schools report that at least one \nbuilding needs extensive repairs or should be replaced. 80 percent of \nschools report at lest one unsatisfactory environmental factor. 48 \npercent have inadequate heating, ventilation, or air conditioning. And \n36 percent report inadequate plumbing systems.\n  In Detroit, over half--150 of the 263--school buildings were built \nbefore 1930. Their average age is 61 years old, and some date to the \n1800's. Detroit estimates that the city has $5 billion in unmet repair \nand new construction needs. Detroit voters recently approved a $1.5 \nbillion, 15-year school construction program, but it's not enough.\n  In an elementary school in Montgomery, Alabama, a ceiling which had \nbeen damaged by leaking water collapsed only 40 minutes after the \nchildren had left for the day.\n  At Cresthaven Elementary School in Silver Spring, Maryland, a second-\ngrade reading class has to squeeze through a narrow corridor with a \nsink on one side into a space about 14 ft. wide by 15 ft. long. The \narea used to be a janitor's office, and the teacher has no place to \nsit.\n  Schools across the country are struggling to meet needs such as \nthese, but they can't do it alone. The federal government should join \nwith state and local governments and community organizations to \nguarantee that all children have the opportunity for a good education \nin safe and up-to-date school buildings. The Robb amendment is an \nexcellent start on this high priorities, and I urge the Senate to \napprove it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment offered by Senator \nRobb today to the Affordable Education Act which would remove the \nprovision of the bill to expand the use of educational individual \nretirement accounts for elementary and secondary education expenses, \nand instead expand incentives for the construction and renovation of \nour nation's public schools.\n  While I understand the overwhelming need for additional resources to \nhelp repair and rebuild crumbling schools across the United States, \nthis amendment would strip the legislation of its very admirable intent \nto assist parents in saving scarce resources for a child's elementary \nand secondary schooling\n\n[[Page S992]]\n\nyears. Parents should have the ability to make decisions about their \nown child's education, particularly in the early, formative years, as \nthey do with higher education. I believe that the education savings \naccounts for elementary and secondary education are a step in the right \ndirection in helping families to make these often difficult decisions \nabout the education of their child.\n  This vote on the Robb amendment is a particularly difficult one for \nme to cast because I, too, am extremely concerned about the dilapidated \nstate of our nation's schools. My home state of West Virginia has a \nschool renovation and construction need in excess of $1.2 billion, and \nthe nation a need totaling more than $250 billion. Mr. President, this \nis alarming! Our nation's schools are in disrepair and provide a less-\nthan-appealing workplace for our students and faculties. They lack the \nbasic infrastructure to allow our students to become ``ready'' for the \nage of technology, and many ill-equipped schools deny students the \nopportunity to engage in meaningful laboratory experiences in the \nsciences. Some schools are overcrowded, and many have become small \ncommunities of portable classrooms.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that the Senate will revisit this \nimportant issue of funding for school construction in a context that \nwould not pit one good initiative against another.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the motion to table amendment No. 2861. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, before the Senator from Michigan begins the \ndebate, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Daschle, Reid, Schumer, \nInouye, Wyden, Durbin, John Kerry, Dorgan, Boxer, and Torricelli. We \nappreciate the work of the Senator from Michigan but also the work \nproduct of the Democrats who have been involved in this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I comment to my colleague from Nevada, I \nappreciate the interest and support and efforts of all the Members he \nmentioned and those who previously were supporters of this legislation \nwhen it was introduced as a freestanding bill. I hope very much to \nultimately succeed in bringing this legislation to final successful \ncompletion.\n  First, prior to a discussion on the amendment, I express my strong \nsupport for the Affordable Education Act and compliment Senator \nCoverdell for his hard work on this effort. At a time when the new \nhigh-tech economy demands greater skills from our workers, our \neducational system is failing in its duty to provide enough of these \nskills.\n  At a time when the Department of Labor figures project our economy \nwill produce more than 1.3 million information technology jobs over the \nnext 10 years, our universities will produce, at least at the current \npace, less than one-quarter of that number of graduates in related \nfields.\n  At a time when we enjoy a critical competitive edge in high tech, we \nare not giving our own children the skills they need to succeed in the \nhigh-tech economy, at least not, in my judgment, at an adequate level. \nWe need to address that, and this amendment, in a small way, attempts \nto do so.\n  One crucial problem concerns the skyrocketing cost of education. \nAccording to the College Board, the average annual cost for tuition, \nroom, and board at a public university is now $7,472. At a private \ncollege, it is a whopping $19,213 per year.\n  If costs continue rising as they have been, a 4-year college \neducation will cost $75,000 at a public university and $250,000 at a \nprivate college by the time the average newborn begins attending in the \nyear 2016.\n  The Affordable Education Act addresses this problem through \npractical, pragmatic reforms. I will not detail all of those at this \ntime. Obviously, the proponents of the legislation have been doing an \nexcellent job of outlining what this bill accomplishes.\n  I firmly believe the continuing growth and prosperity in America \ndepends on continuing affordability of higher education. It is my firm \nbelief we must do more, particularly in the area of closing what is \nregularly referenced as the digital divide between the digital haves \nand the digital have-nots.\n  The amendment I have offered is the full text of my New Millennium \nClassrooms Act, legislation I have been pursuing for some time in this \nbody. In addition to the cosponsors who were just added, our bill, S. \n542, includes the support of Senators Wyden, Coverdell, Daschle, Hatch, \nHarkin, McConnell, Hollings, Burns, Boxer, Helms, Bingaman, Kerrey, \nBennett, Lieberman, and Ashcroft, just to name a few of its Senate \nsponsors. I ask unanimous consent the entire list of cosponsors be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows\n\n                            Cosponsors (30)\n\n       Senators: Allard, Ashcroft, Bennett, Bingaman, Bond, Boxer, \n     Burns, Campbell, Cochran, Collins, Coverdell, Crapo, Daschle, \n     Gorton, Grams, Hagel, Harkin, Hatch, Helms, Hollings, \n     Hutchison, Jeffords, Johnson, Kerrey, Lieberman, McConnell, \n     Santorum, Smith of Oregon, Warner, Wyden.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on July 29 of last year, the Senate \nunanimously adopted this amendment to the tax reduction bill. I urge \nthe Senate to do so again today.\n  This amendment aims to address our shortage of skilled high-tech \nworkers by addressing the shortage of computers and computer training \nin our schools.\n  Advanced technology has fueled unprecedented economic growth and \ntransformed the way Americans do business and communicate with each \nother.\n  Despite these gains, however, this same technology is just beginning \nto have an impact on our classrooms and how we educate our children. \nThirty-two percent of our public schools have only one classroom with \naccess to the Internet.\n  It is imperative that we act now to provide our Nation's students \nwith the training they need to succeed in tomorrow's high-tech \nworkplace.\n  The Department of Education recommends there be at least one computer \nfor every five students. According to the Education Testing Service, in \n1997 there was only one computer for every 24 students on average. Not \nonly are our classrooms sadly underequipped, but the equipment they \nhave is often obsolete, often incapable, for example, of accessing the \nInternet.\n  One of the more common computers in our schools today is the Apple \nIIc, a computer so archaic that it is now on display at the \nSmithsonian.\n  While this technological deficiency affects all of our schools, the \nstudents who are in the most need are receiving the least amount of \ncomputer instruction and exposure. According to the Secretary of \nEducation, 75.9 percent of households with an annual income over \n$75,000 have computers, compared to only 11 percent of households with \nincomes under $10,000.\n  This disparity exists when comparing households with the Internet \naccess as well. While 42 percent of families with annual incomes over \n$75,000 have online capability, only 10 percent of families with \nincomes of $25,000 or less have the same capability.\n  Rural areas and inner cities fall below the national average for \nhouseholds that have computers. Nationwide, 40.8 percent of white \nhouseholds have computers, while only 19 percent of African American \nand Hispanic households do. This disparity, unfortunately, is \nincreasing, not decreasing. This unfortunate trend is not confined \nsimply to individual households; it is present in our schools as well.\n  The Educational Testing Service statistics show schools with 81 \npercent or more economically disadvantaged students have only one \nmultimedia computer for every 32 students, while a school with 20 \npercent or fewer economically disadvantaged students will have a \nmultimedia computer for every 22 students.\n  That is a difference of 10 students per computer. Furthermore, \nschools with 90 percent or more minority students have only one \nmultimedia computer for every 30 students. This is simply unacceptable.\n  It points up the importance of securing additional computers for use \nin our schools. Our schools should be great educational equalizers, \nproviding resources and training to everyone, regardless of their race, \nclass, or rural or urban location so all of our kids can succeed.\n  To achieve this end, our amendment expands the parameters of the \nexisting tax deduction for computer deductions. It will also add a tax \ncredit.\n  Specifically, it will do the following: First, it will allow a tax \ncredit equal to 30 percent of the fair market value of the donated \ncomputer equipment. An increased tax credit provides a greater \nincentive for companies to donate computer technology and equipment to \nschools. This includes computers, peripheral equipment, software, and \nfiber optic cable related to computer use.\n  Second, it will expand the current age limit on donated computers to \ninclude equipment 3 years old or less. Many companies do not update \ntheir equipment within the existing 2-year period that currently is \nrequired for qualification for the existing tax deductions.\n  Yet 3-year-old computers equipped with Pentium-based or equivalent \nchips have the processing power, memory, and graphics capabilities to \nprovide sufficient Internet and multimedia access and run any necessary \nsoftware.\n  Third, the current limitation on original use will be expanded to \ninclude original equipment manufacturers or any corporation that \nreacquires the equipment. By expanding the number of donors eligible \nfor the tax credit, the number of computers available will increase as \nwell.\n\n[[Page S994]]\n\n  Lastly, it would implement enhanced tax credits equal to 50 percent \nof the fair market value of equipment donated to schools located within \ndesignated empowerment zones, enterprise communities, and Indian \nreservations.\n  Doubling the amount of the tax credits for donations made to schools \nin economically distressed areas will increase the availability of \ncomputers to the children who need it most.\n  Bringing our classrooms into the 21st century will require a major \nnational investment.\n  According to a Rand Institute study, it will cost $15 billion, or \n$300 per student, to provide American schools with the technology \nneeded to educate our young people; the primary cost being the purchase \nand installation of computer equipment.\n  At a time when the Government is planning to spend $2.25 billion to \nwire schools and libraries to the Internet, the demand for this \nsophisticated hardware will be even greater.\n  Meanwhile, the Detwiler Foundation estimates that if just 10 percent \nof the computers that are taken out of service each year were donated \nto schools, the national ratio of students-to-computers would be \nbrought to 5 to 1 or less. This would meet, or even exceed, the ratio \nrecommended by the Department of Education.\n  This amendment will provide powerful tax incentives for American \nbusinesses to donate top quality high-tech equipment to our Nation's \nclassrooms. And it will do so without unduly increasing Federal \nGovernment expenditures or creating yet another Federal program or \ndepartment.\n  Encouraging private investment and involvement, this act will keep \ncontrol where it belongs--with the teachers, the parents, and the \nstudents.\n  At the same time, all our children will have an equal chance at \nsucceeding in the new technological millennium.\n  In my mind, these are laudable goals, goals we must attain if we are \ngoing to provide the kind of future our children deserve.\n  In closing, I am hopeful our colleagues will uniformly join in \nsupport of this legislation. It seems to me, as I travel around my \nState and go into classrooms, there are a lot of places in Michigan--\nand I suspect in all the other States--where just a little bit more \nequipment would allow for more students to get the kind of high-tech \ntraining they need.\n  How do we match up a situation where, literally across this country, \nwe have schools that do not have enough computer equipment, and we have \ncountless businesses and enterprises that have used equipment they \ndon't know what to do with? Can't we find a way? In my judgment, this \nlegislation is the way.\n  If we pass this legislation, I think we will provide a major \nincentive to merge the used surplus computers that exist in the private \nsector with the needs of our schools. In doing so, we will provide more \nstudents with access to the technology they need to have in order to be \nable to pursue the jobs of the new century.\n  I offer this amendment for my colleagues' consideration. I appreciate \nthe attention of the Chamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am pleased to join today with my colleague from \nMichigan, Senator Abraham, to offer the New Millennium Classrooms Act \nas an amendment to the Education Savings Account legislation. This is \nan issue on which he and I have worked for several years now.\n  The New Millennium Classrooms Act is about digital recycling. It \ngives companies an incentive to recycle technology. It says the \ncomputer Bill Gates may see as a dinosaur, is really a dynamic new \nopportunity for a student who has none.\n  The E-Rate program, authored by Senators Rockefeller and Snowe, has \nbeen an enormous success, helping to wire almost all of the nation's \nschools and a good portion of the nation's classrooms. What schools \nneed now is good equipment. That's the purpose of this amendment.\n  We know that very early in this new Century 60% of all jobs will \nrequire high-tech computer skills. To prepare our children for the jobs \nof the future, they not only must have access to technology, but they \nmust be trained to use it as well.\n  The purpose of our amendment is to build more bridges between the \ntechnology ``haves'' and the ``have nots;'' to build more on-ramps to \nthe information superhighway. You can't get 21st Century classrooms, \nusing Flintstones technology.\n  Technology is not cheap and school budgets are limited, making it \ntough for schools to upgrade their systems by themselves. The point of \nour amendment is to enhance existing incentives to businesses to donate \ncomputer equipment to schools.\n  There is a federal program in place, the 21st Century Classroom Act \nof 1997, but its use has been limited. It allows businesses to take a \ntax deduction for certain computer equipment donations to K-12 schools. \nBut most businesses take longer to upgrade their computers than allowed \nfor under the law.\n  The New Millennium Classrooms Act would make this law work the way it \nwas intended. First, our legislation would increase the age limit from \ntwo to three years for donated equipment eligible for a tax credit. \nThis more realistically tracks the time line businesses follow for \ntheir computer upgrades. It will cover hardware that possesses the \nnecessary memory capacity and graphics capability to support Internet \nand multimedia applications.\n  Second, our bill expands the current limitation of ``original use'' \nto include both original equipment manufacturers and any corporation \nthat reacquires their equipment. We believe that by expanding the \nnumber of donors eligible for the credit, we will expand the number of \ncomputers donated to schools.\n  Third, our bill provides for a 30% tax credit of the fair market \nvalue for school computer donations, and a 50% credit for donations to \nschools located in empowerment zones, enterprise communities and Indian \nreservations. The Department of Commerce report highlights the need to \nencourage computer donation in these notoriously under-served \ncommunities and we want to target donations toward these communities.\n  Finally, our bill requires an operating system to be included on a \ndonated computer's hard drive in order to qualify for the tax credit. \nThis will ensure students don't get empty computer shells, but the \nbrains that drive the computers.\n  Our legislation is supported by a wide range of business and \neducation groups. Leaders of technology associations, like the \nInformation Technology Industry Council and TechNet, and the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers have joined education associations, such \nas the National Association of Secondary School Principals and the \nNational Association of State University and Land Grant Colleges, in \nsupport of the amendment.\n  The Digital Millennium Classrooms Act promotes digital recycling. It \nwill encourage companies to put their used computers into classrooms \ninstead of into landfills. It will help build a safety net under \nstudents trying to cross the digital divide. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment, and again wish to commend Senator Abraham for \nhis leadership on this legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Hagel as a \ncosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Michigan for \nhis amendment and his work on the New Millennium Classrooms Act. I \njoined him several months ago at a press conference where he announced \nhis intentions. I think it is among the\n\n[[Page S995]]\n\nmore well-intended, helpful measures to deal with the reform and change \nwe are all seeking in education across America.\n  There is a real need to bring more computers into our classrooms \nwhich is, of course, what the amendment is designed to do.\n  Sixty percent of all jobs will require high-tech computer skills. Yet \n32 percent of our public schools have only one classroom with access to \nthe Internet. It is almost an incongruity, when you read every day \nabout what is happening on the Internet and where we have gotten in \nterms of access. It really does point to the digital divide we all \nspeak of these days.\n  The change is occurring so quickly, and the large public educational \nsystem is not accustomed to it. In fact, many of us are not accustomed \nto it. But legislation such as that offered by the Senator from \nMichigan accelerates the ability of public education to stay up with \nhigh tech.\n  The Department of Education recommends that there be at least one \ncomputer for every five students. Yet according to the Educational \nTesting Service, on average, there is only one multimedia computer for \nevery 24 students.\n  Since the passage of the 21st Century Classrooms Act of 1997, there \nhas not been a significant increase in computer donations due to \nrestrictions on the age of the donated equipment and the limitations on \ndonor qualifications.\n  According to the Detwiler Foundation, a California-based nonprofit \norganization dedicated to providing schools nationwide with quality \ncomputers donated by individuals and industry, there are very few \nPentium computers donated to schools through their organization. This \nnumber has not increased since the passage of the 21st Century \nClassrooms Act of 1997. Of those computers donated, even fewer \nqualified for the deduction because of the restrictions.\n  According to the Detwiler Foundation, if even just 10 percent of \nretired computers each year were donated to schools, we would easily \nachieve the Department of Education's recommendation of only five \nstudents for every one computer. The current deduction is not enough to \noffset the costs of the donation.\n  Without the addition of the tax credit, the high costs associated \nwith the transport and installation of the computer equipment cancel \nout the current tax benefit.\n  The new millennium classrooms amendment addresses these restrictions \nwithout unduly increasing Federal Government expenditures or creating \nyet another Federal program or department. It encourages private \ninvestment and involvement and keeps control with the teachers, the \nparents, and the students. At a time when the Government is planning to \nspend $1.2 billion to wire schools and libraries to the Internet, the \ndemand for this sophisticated equipment and technology will be greater \nthan ever.\n  This amendment increases the age limit for eligible computers from 2 \nto 3 years; will allow computer manufacturers to donate equipment \nreturned to them through trade-in and leasing programs; allows a 30-\npercent tax credit for qualified computer donations; allows a 50-\npercent tax credit for qualified computer donations to schools located \nwithin empowerment zones, enterprise communities and Indian \nreservations; requires that the donated computer must include an \noperating system.\n  Increasing the amount of the tax credits for donations made to \nschools in economically distressed areas will increase the availability \nof computers to the children who need it most. Educational Testing \nService statistics show that schools with 81 percent or more \neconomically disadvantaged students have only one multimedia computer \nfor every 32 students, while a school with 20 percent or fewer \neconomically disadvantaged students will have a multimedia computer for \nevery 22 students. Again, the divide is a most dangerous thing for us \nto contemplate in education in America.\n  Public schools with a high minority enrollment had a smaller \npercentage of instructional rooms with Internet access than public \nschools with a low minority enrollment.\n  This bill is not another targeted tax break. Broad-based tax relief \nand reform efforts should work to lower tax rates across the board \nwhile continuing to retain and improve upon the core tax incentives for \neducation, home ownership, and charitable contributions. The new \nmillennium classrooms amendment expands the parameters and, thus, the \neffectiveness of an already existing education and charity tax \nincentive, one which will effectively bring top-of-the-line technology \ninto all of our schools.\n  The 21st Century Classrooms Act tax deduction expires this year. It \nis imperative we act now to ensure that all our children have access to \nquality computer technology.\n  Again, I commend the Senator from Michigan and his cosponsors. This \nis, indeed, a most appropriate piece of legislation that will do great \ngood in our education system.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold that for a \nsecond, we have two Senators who are on their way to speak. The \nminority leader is on his way to speak on this issue, and Senator \nWyden, who is a cosponsor of the amendment, is in the House and is also \non his way back. They should both be here momentarily.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, my estimate is that maybe in the next \n15 minutes or so----\n  Mr. REID. I think it would probably be closer to 11:30 because both \nhave prepared remarks.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I know Senators are trying to plan their day. It is \nuseful to clarify, even though we are not absolutely certain. The \nSenator thinks their statements are such that the next vote might occur \nat or about 11:30?\n  Mr. REID. I think that is probably when it will be.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment and \napplaud the authors. I am very hopeful that we can get good bipartisan \nsupport for this legislation, in large measure because it is exactly \nwhat we need to be doing right now, if, indeed, we are serious when we \nsay we want more technology in schools.\n  I can't think of a better way to encourage more technology in schools \nthan to ensure that companies are able to use the incentives that are \nthere to maximize the opportunities for schools to acquire the kinds of \nhardware and software they need to fully equip every school across the \ncountry.\n  As I travel throughout South Dakota, it is with great pride that \nsuperintendents and principals will show me their computer room. They \nwill show me how computer literate their students are. They show me how \nintegrated technology is now becoming in schools. But the one \nconsistent lament they have is that they just don't have the resources \nto ensure that they can acquire the equipment or, in a timely way, \nreplace that equipment, knowing it is going to be outdated in 3 years, \nknowing they are going to be faced with the same budgetary decisions \nonce again in a very short period of time. There is a longer life for \nacquiring sports equipment, books, desks, or almost anything else \nrelated to schools. The timeframe within which the technology becomes \noutdated, as we all know, is extremely short.\n  So this amendment is simply designed to acknowledge that fact--to \nacknowledge the fact that schools desperately need this technology and \nall of the equipment associated with it. They need to have the \nassurance that once they have acquired this technology, they are going \nto continue to get it in the future. This relatively minor tax \nincentive, from the perspective of a budgetary impact, will have \nprofound consequences with respect to its effect on companies and the \nincentive it will create, and with its effect on what can happen in \nschools if we pass it.\n  Mr. President, I applaud Senators Wyden, Baucus, Abraham, and others \nfor their effort to make this issue the prominent one it is with this \ndebate on\n\n[[Page S996]]\n\nhow we might improve our educational opportunities. As I say, I think \nthat as we look at the next 10 or 20 years, one of the biggest \nchallenges schools are going to face--whether they are rural or urban, \nprivate or public--will be the insurmountable task of technology \nacquisition. I do hope they can overcome the fiscal challenges they all \nface. Whether or not they do, in part, will be dependent upon whether \nor not something as simple as this can be passed, creating an incentive \nthat will ultimately provide companies with more reasons to support \nschools in their effort to acquire technology.\n  That is what this amendment is all about. It deserves our support. I \nam sure it will have our support, and I am sure it may not be the last \nword on what it is we need to do with regard to technology acquisition. \nBut it is a good beginning. I applaud my colleagues--especially \nSenators Wyden and Baucus--for all their efforts in bringing it to this \npoint. I urge its passage.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \nin relation to the Abraham amendment and with respect to the Bingaman \naccountability amendment be postponed to occur at 1 p.m. today. I \nfurther ask that no second-degree amendments be in order to either \namendment prior to the votes and the time between now and 1 p.m. be \nequally divided for debate of both amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Many Senators thought we would be voting at about 11, \nso they need to pay particular attention to this change.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). There is an order for the \nSenator's amendment and the amendment of the Senator from Michigan to \nbe debated concurrently, with a vote to occur at 1 o'clock.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2863\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure accountability in programs for disadvantaged \n       children and provide funds to turn around failing schools)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2863.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 101 and insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 101 FUNDS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT.\n\n       ``(a) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of \n     carrying out this section, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated $275,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 and such sums \n     as may be necessary for each of the succeeding fiscal years.\n       ``(b) National Activities.--From the amount appropriated \n     for any fiscal year under subsection (a), the Secretary of \n     Education (`the Secretary') may reserve not more than 3 \n     percent to conduct evaluations and studies, collect data, and \n     carry out other activities relevant to sections 1116 and 1117 \n     of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     (hereafter in this section referred to as ``the ESEA'').\n       ``(c) Allocations to States.--The Secretary shall allocate \n     the amount appropriated for any fiscal year under subsection \n     (a) and not reserved under subsection (b) among the States in \n     the same proportion in which funds are allocated among the \n     States under part A of title I of the ESEA.\n       ``(d) State Use of Funds.--(1) In General.--Each State \n     educational agency shall use funds received under subsection \n     (c) to--\n       ``(A) make allotments under paragraph (2); and\n       ``(B) carry out its responsibilities under sections 1116 \n     and 1117 of the ESEA, including establishing and supporting \n     the State educational agency's statewide system of technical \n     assistance and support for local educational agencies.\n       ``(2) Allotments to Local Educational Agencies.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Each State educational agency shall \n     allot at least 70 percent of the amount received under this \n     section to local educational agencies in the State.\n       ``(B) Priorities.--In making allotments under this \n     paragraph, the State educational agency shall--\n       ``(i) give first priority to schools and local educational \n     agencies with schools identified for corrective action under \n     section 1116(c)(5) of the ESEA; and\n       ``(ii) give second priority to schools and local \n     educational agencies with other schools identified for school \n     improvement under section 1116(c)(1) of the ESEA.\n       ``(e) Local Use of Funds.--.\n       ``(1) Corrective action.--Each local educational agency \n     receiving an allotment under subsection (d)(2)(B)(i) shall \n     use the allotment to carry out effective corrective action in \n     the schools identified for corrective action.\n       ``(2) School improvement.--Each local educational agency \n     receiving an allotment under subsection (d)(2)(B)(ii) shall \n     use the allotment to achieve substantial improvement in the \n     performance of the schools identified for school \n     improvement.''\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am introducing this amendment to \nstrike the part of the bill that provides the tax savings because I \nthink there is a better use for that amount of funding. I am proposing \nan alternative use for that funding that I urge my colleagues to \nseriously consider.\n  My amendment strikes the part of the bill that provides the average \nfamily with a very small tax savings, and there are various estimates \nas to what that savings would be. Essentially, as I understand it, the \nJoint Tax Committee says the average benefit per child in public school \nwould be something like $3 in 2001 and $4.50 in 2002.\n  I think it is clear, regardless of the precise number, that these are \nnot tax savings that are going to help any child in this country get a \nbetter education. So my thought is that rather than do that with the \nfunds we are expending through this bill--or proposing to expend--we \nuse the money to provide crucial funds to turn around the failing \npublic schools.\n  Public schools are where over 90 percent of our children are \neducated. I grew up in Silver City, NM where, if you want to go to \nschool, you go to public school. That is the way it has always been, to \nmy knowledge. It is going to be that way for some time. We need to be \nsure the schools that are not adequately training young people and \neducating young people get the assistance, the resources, the \noversight, and the accountability they need in order to move ahead and \nsolve that problem.\n  Let me talk a little bit more about the bill that is presently \npending and then talk about my own amendment. The Joint Tax Committee \ndid this analysis of the Coverdell proposal and indicated that it \nwould, in their view, disproportionately help families with children \nalready in private schools. Eighty-three percent of families with \nchildren in private schools would use this account, but only 28 percent \nof families in public schools would make use of it.\n  Essentially, the proposal is a way of diverting funds that are \notherwise public funds into the private schools, at a time when we all \nrecognize that the public schools have inadequate funds to do the job \nwe are calling upon them to do.\n  Also, the pending Coverdell bill we are trying to amend has no \nmechanisms in it to ensure accountability of the use of the funds we \nare talking about. The bill does nothing to improve teacher quality. It \ndoes nothing to provide safe and modern environments for learning. It \ndoes nothing to raise academic standards or to impose upon the public \nschools or bring them to more accountability in the expenditure of the \nfunds.\n  I believe we need to use Federal funds on initiatives that make a \ndifference in our public schools. That is what my amendment intended to \ndo.\n  The relevant section of the Coverdell bill costs the public an \naverage of $275 million a year for the next 5 years. That is the cost \nto the taxpayers. I believe we can use that $275 million each year to \nensure that higher standards and accountability are implemented \nthroughout our public schools. We have made some progress in \nimplementing higher standards.\n  Most States have adopted or are in the process of adopting statewide \nstandards. This is due in part to the fact that Federal law applicable \nto the program for disadvantaged students --that is title I--requires \nthat standards be adopted. Although States have\n\n[[Page S997]]\n\nadopted standards, many States and districts have not had sufficient \nfunds to ensure the accountability for meeting those standards they \nhave set or to provide adequate resources to the schools that are \nfailing to meet the standards. I think dedicating specific funds to \nthis purpose is necessary in order to create the rewards and the \npenalties that will allow schools to be held accountable for the \nimprovement in student performance.\n  The Federal Government directs over $8 billion in Federal funds to \nprovide support programs through title I. But the accountability \nprovisions in title I have not been adequately implemented because they \nhaven't had the resources to do it at the State level, primarily.\n  Title I authorizes State school support teams to provide support for \nschoolwide programs to provide assistance to schools that are in need \nof improvement through activities such as professional developments for \nthe teachers in those schools, and identifying resources for changing \nthe way the instruction is provided.\n\n  In 1998, only eight States requiring these school support teams have \nbeen able to serve the majority of the schools that they have been \nidentified as needing improvement. Less than half the schools \nidentified as being in the need of improvement in the school year of \n1997-1998 reported that having been designated as a school needing \nimprovement actually got some professional development to accomplish \nthat improvement.\n  Schools and school districts need additional support and resources in \norder to address the weaknesses that we identify. They need that \nsupport and those resources quickly after those weaknesses are \nidentified. They need to be able to promote an intensive range of \ninterventions, continuously assess the results of those interventions, \nand to implement some incentives for improvement.\n  The National Governors' Association asked us to provide funds for the \npurpose this amendment tries to address.\n  I have a letter that came to me last October when this same issue \ncame before us in the Senate. I offered an amendment at that time which \nwas not successful but which I believe had merit then, and I believe it \nhas merit now.\n  Let me make it very clear so there is no misunderstanding. At that \ntime, I was not proposing to strike the tax proposal that Senator \nCoverdell brought forward and substitute this in its stead. The \nGovernors were not responding to that specific striking aspect of my \namendment of today, but they were talking about the need to have \nadditional funds to ensure accountability and to ensure the \nimplementation of these higher standards by the schools that are \nfailing.\n  The amendment I am offering would provide $275 million to help \nimprove failing schools. The money would be used to ensure the States \nand school districts have the necessary resources to implement the \ncorrective action provisions of title I by providing immediate, \nintensive interventions to turn around low-performing schools.\n  Let me read part of this letter so that folks know what the Governors \nare saying. It is a letter to me by Mr. Raymond Scheppach, who is the \nexecutive director of the National Governors' Association.\n  It says:\n\n       On behalf of the Nation's Governors, I write to express our \n     strong support for your amendment to provide States with \n     additional funds to help turn around schools that are failing \n     to provide quality education for title I students.\n\n  That is what we are trying to do today.\n  He says further:\n\n       As you know, under current law, States are permitted to \n     reserve one-half of one percent of their title I monies to \n     administer the title I program and provide schools with \n     additional assistance. However, this small set aside--this is \n     one-half of one percent--does not provide the States with \n     sufficient funds to improve the quality of title I schools. A \n     recent study by the U.S. Department of Education noted the \n     ``capacity of State school support teams to assist schools in \n     need of improvement of title I is a major concern.'' The \n     programs authorized to fund such improvement efforts have not \n     been funded. As a result, States have been unable to provide \n     such services.\n\n  Then he goes on to various other points but essentially says:\n\n       Your amendment would provide such funding. Therefore, NGA \n     supports your amendment and will urge other Senators to \n     support the adoption of it.\n\n  Let me make it very clear to people again. This was a letter related \nto an amendment to direct funds at accountability in the expenditure of \npublic funds and help these failing schools. It does not include the \nproposal I am making today as well to strike the Coverdell amendment \nand substitute this instead as a better use of that money.\n  But the types of interventions the States and school districts could \nprovide under these funds are things which I think we would all \nrecognize are needed.\n  First, purchasing necessary materials, up-to-date textbooks, \ncurriculum, technology.\n  I think we all encounter circumstances where teachers, school \nadministrators, and students tell us about how they have outdated \ntextbooks and inadequate lab materials or whatever in order to really \npursue their studies as they would like to.\n  These funds could be used for that. They could be used for providing \nintensive, ongoing teacher training.\n  That clearly is a need, and I think it is a recognized need in the \nteaching profession.\n  The people who talk to me about the importance of more teacher \ntraining are the teachers. So this is not an attack on our public \nschool teachers. This is a recognition that we need to do more to help \nthem constantly stay abreast of the new developments in teaching and do \na better job.\n  Third, this would provide access to distance learning.\n  We have the amendment that was talked about just prior to the \namendment I am discussing about technology in our schools. All of us \nrecognize there is a great opportunity, particularly in rural \ncommunities, to make better use of teacher learning.\n  This past weekend, I was in some communities in my State where there \nare very small high schools. I was in Eunice, NM; I was in Jal, NM. \nThose are communities with very small high schools. Frankly, they are \nnot able to offer all of the courses they would like to offer for their \nstudents. They have the opportunity through distance learning, through \nthe Internet, through interactive television, and through a variety of \ntechnologies to provide courses to some of their students even though \nthey may not have a teacher in that school who is qualified to teach \nthat course. We need to be sure the funds are there to do that. This \namendment would help provide those funds.\n  These funds must be used to extend learning time for students--\nafterschool programs, Saturday programs, and summer school--to help \nthem catch up and perform at least at grade level and, hopefully, \nbetter than grade level.\n  These funds could be used to provide rewards to low-performing \nschools that show significant progress, including cash awards or other \nincentives such as, in particular, release time for teachers to prepare \nfor the next school year or whatever.\n  Also, these funds could be used for intensive technical assistance \nfrom teams of experts outside the schools to help develop and implement \nschool improvement plans in failing schools.\n  These teams would determine the causes of low performance--for \nexample, low expectations, outdated curriculum, poorly trained \nteachers, and unsafe conditions. They would assist in implementing \nresearch-based models for improvement.\n  I am persuaded there are today research-based whole school reform \nprograms that have been developed that can dramatically improve the \nperformance of our elementary schools. I have become most familiar with \none which is called Success for All. There are others that are also \nshowing very good results.\n  This Success for All program was developed at Johns Hopkins \nUniversity. Bob Slavin was the key researcher who worked on it. This is \na proven early grade reading program. It also covers other subjects. \nThe core subject which most schools have adopted and are focused on is \nthe reading. This is a program which, if implemented properly, can \nensure substantial results. We have 50 elementary schools in New Mexico \nthat are presently using this Success for All program and the results \nare impressive. At the end of the first grade, Success for All schools \nhave averaged\n\n[[Page S998]]\n\nreading scores almost 3 months ahead of those in other control schools \nwhere that program has not been implemented.\n  This amendment will not address all the issues of our schools. I \nbelieve sincerely that it is a positive step forward. It will be a more \nmeaningful step forward in improving the educational quality in America \nthan this alternative of providing a $5 a year, or whatever the right \nnumber is, tax benefit to the average American.\n  Clearly, we all want to see our schools improved.\n  Senator Reed is on the floor and wishes to speak for a moment on this \nand then I understand Senator Roth has an amendment he wishes to offer.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first, I will speak with respect to Senator \nBingaman's amendment. Let me commend the Senator for his efforts not \nonly today but throughout his career in the Senate to ensure that \naccountability is a central part of Federal educational legislation.\n  Senator Bingaman, in 1994, was one of the leaders in this body with \nrespect to the issue of accountability. At that time, I was serving in \nthe other body. Together we worked at the conference on accountability \nprovisions in the 1994 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. As a result of the efforts of Senator Bingaman and \nothers, we were able, for the first time, to begin to focus significant \nattention on the issue of accountability. In fact, the 1994 \nreauthorization, together with Goals 2000 legislation, accelerated and \nencouraged a movement throughout the States to develop standards. \nPractically every State in the country today has standards.\n  We now have the opportunity to begin measuring how well schools are \ndoing. That is at the heart, I believe, of Senator Bingaman's approach \ntoday. We need not only to measure how well they are doing but then \nhold States and localities accountable for those results.\n  What has happened in the last several years is that the States have \nnot had the resources to fully exploit the opportunities to measure \nschools against standards and then improve those schools. Half of the \nschools in the country that are problematic, according to State \nstandards, have not been able to have access to teams of improvement; \nthey have not had access to the support they need to make themselves \nbetter. In addition, they have not had access to the \nprofessional development which they need to enhance the capabilities of \ntheir teachers. All of these efforts together suggest the American \npeople's money would be best spent by devoting time and attention to \naccountability.\n\n  Again, I think the approach that the Senator from New Mexico is \ntaking is exactly on target. As we spend $8 billion a year on title I, \nwe should insist that the States live up to their responsibility to use \nthese funds wisely as measured by the performance of their students. \nThe best way we can do that is to give them the resources and, again, \nthe impetus to take stock of their schools and then to apply corrective \nmeasures, remedial measures.\n  They have not been able to do that. I don't believe it is because \nthey don't want to do it; I believe it is because they have not been \nable to find the resources to carry out this mission. Senator \nBingaman's amendment would give them access to these resources. It will \ngive them access not in a restrictive way but in a very open-ended way \nso they can pick and choose the best device to use in their particular \nschool to ensure that school performance improves. That, again, is why \nI believe we are all here.\n  We have a special obligation at the national level to assist, \nparticularly, low-income schools. Regrettably and unfortunately, many \nof the low-performing schools are low-income schools. Therefore, this \neffort to help support States to identify low-performing schools and to \nbring them up to the standards of the State is entirely consistent with \nthe purpose of Federal legislation, which is to assist low-income \nstudents to have access to the opportunities that more affluent \nstudents and their families take for granted.\n  I believe what the Senator is proposing is entirely consistent with \nwhat we should be about, but also it will go to the heart of leveraging \nall of our programs and all the State programs to ensure we accomplish \nthe ultimate goal that lies before the Senate of ensuring that every \nchild in this country has access to excellent public education.\n  Coincidentally, both Senator Bingaman and I and others today are \nbeginning the markup in committee of the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. We will be pursuing these \nissues within the context of that legislation. Today, when we have a \nbill in this Chamber that purports to be a way to assist education, \nelementary and secondary education, in the United States, we have to \nseize this opportunity to point out that the heart of our efforts has \nto be the reinforcement of what we have already begun years ago, which \nis to develop within the States the capacity to evaluate their schools \nbased upon their standards and then to intervene successfully to fix \nthese schools.\n  Before we go on to more attenuated means to help education in the \nUnited States--such as tax credits and other proposals--we have a \nprimary responsibility and, today, an opportunity to do what we started \nto do in 1994 to give the States the resources, further incentives to \nevaluate their schools, identify the schools that are failing, to step \nin with their choice of intervention strategies, and to fix the schools \nin America.\n  There are over 8,000 schools in this country that are not meeting \nState standards. Those figures come from our Department of Education. \nWhat is preventing the States and the localities from stepping in right \nnow? There might be a host of issues, but one thing we can do to \naccelerate that intervention is to support the Bingaman amendment, to \ngive them resources and give them the clarion call to step in and fix \nthe schools so we can declare--as I hope we can at the end of this \ndebate and certainly I hope at the end of the debate on the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act--that we are not only committed but we are \non a path to ensure that every school in this country is providing \nevery American child with the opportunity to succeed. Every public \nschool in this country is doing that.\n  I commend the Senator and I thank him for yielding time to me. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \noff of the Abraham amendment debate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I intend to offer a substitute amendment to \nS. 1134 later today. The underlying bill was reported out of the \nFinance Committee almost 1 year ago, in May 1999. My substitute \namendment makes some important and necessary policy changes that were \nnot done before--because of budget constraints 1 year ago. My amendment \nalso updates the bill to account for the passage of time.\n  When the committee originally considered this education bill, we were \noperating under last year's budget scenario. Since that time, the \nsurplus numbers have increased dramatically. In today's economic \nenvironment, I believe that it is appropriate to use the surplus to \nprovide education tax incentives for American families. Through their \nhard work, the American people created these favorable economic \nconditions and the resulting budget surplus. They should be entitled to \ntake some of that surplus back.\n  We should not have to raise taxes to offset these much needed \neducation tax incentives. My amendment makes this legislation a true \ntax cut relief bill for education. With a growing Federal surplus \ncreated by their tax dollars, Americans should not be taxed again to \npay for a national priority.\n  Accordingly, my substitute amendment strikes all of the revenue \nraisers in S. 1134. The cost of my amendment is but a small percentage \nof the projected budget surplus over the next 10 years.\n  Now let me explain some of the substantive changes that I make in the\n\n[[Page S999]]\n\nsubstitute amendment. First, the underlying bill increases the maximum \ncontribution amount for an Education IRA from $500 per year to $2,000 \nper year. The underlying bill also allows contributions to an Education \nIRA to be used for kindergarten through high school education expenses. \nThese are both important and needed changes. But the underlying bill \nsunsets both of those benefits after the year 2003. That is not good \npolicy. Accordingly, my bill removes the sunset--it makes permanent \nboth the increase in the contribution limit and the flexibility in the \nuse of the accounts.\n  Planning and saving for college should take place as early as \npossible. To help families make those important decisions, they need to \nknow how much money they can put away and for what it can be used. \nHaving provisions that sunset--and thus need to be renewed by \nCongress--takes away from that certainty. We need to make saving for \ncollege easier and more certain--not complex and uncertain.\n  I can easily see why a family would not want to take their hard \nearned savings and put them in a program where the terms could change \nin a few years. My amendment helps to solve that problem. We should not \nsunset our future--the education of our children.\n  Education IRAs are extremely important for a few reasons. First, they \nhelp families afford the escalating costs of higher education. The \nincrease to $2,000 will make these accounts more attractive to families \nwho want to use them and to institutions who want to offer them. \nSecond, the existence of an education IRA gives an additional push to a \nstudent to attend college. Last month, the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee held a hearing on the rising cost of college tuition. One of \nthe witnesses was Dr. Caroline M. Hoxby, an associate professor of \neconomics at Harvard University.\n  Commenting on the behavioral incentives of an Education IRA, Dr. \nHoxby noted that for an eighth grader, there is something different \nabout knowing that there is money being put away for your college \neducation and that you will lose it and the opportunity to go to \ncollege if you do not continue to do well. It makes sense that a child \nwho is aware that there is a fund being built up for his or her future \neducation would think longer and harder about going to college.\n\n  My amendment also fixes a trap for the unwary. Under current law, a \nstudent who takes a distribution from an Education IRA is not able to \nuse the HOPE or Lifetime Learning Credit--even if different education \nexpenses are allocated for the different tax benefits. Again, this is \nnot right. We are providing these education tax incentives to families \nbecause they need them. We should not hold them out there--making \npeople believe that they are available--and then take them away. \nBecause of revenue constraints, the original Finance Committee bill \nfixed this coordination only for a few years. My amendment makes the \ncoordination permanent, and makes sure that families continue to \nreceive the full benefits from all these tax benefits.\n  My amendment also makes the tax-free treatment of employer-provided \neducational assistance permanent. In last year's Extenders bill, \nCongress extended the current tax-free treatment for a few years. That \nwas the right move, but it did not go far enough. First, something as \nimportant and necessary as continuing education should not be wrapped \nup in the uncertainty of extenders legislation. Workers and companies \nneed to plan ahead, and they need to know how these educational \nexpenses will be treated under the Tax Code. Second, we should \nreinstitute the exclusion for graduate education expenses. Especially \nin today's dynamic economy--which is marked by high technology and \ninnovation--it is important that workers have access to graduate \neducation. My amendment recognizes that fact, and so it makes permanent \ntax-free treatment of employer-provided educational assistance for both \nundergraduate and graduate level courses.\n  Finally, my amendment updates the Finance Committee bill by changing \nthe effective dates of the provisions. They would all be effective \nbeginning in the year 2001. I should also note that my amendment takes \ninto account the Senate's adoption of the Collins amendment yesterday--\nand so will include that amendment as well as any others that have been \nadopted.\n  Why are the permanent provisions in my amendment so important? Some \nSenators have tried to rationalize their opposition to this bill by \nclaiming that it would not do enough to advance education. My amendment \nguarantees that this is simply not true.\n  My amendment would allow parents to contribute up to $2,000 annually \ntoward their child's education--from the day of birth to the first day \nof college.\n  That is just $5.48 a day or $38.46 a week. That may not seem like a \nlot but, like a train, it may start slowly but it is very powerful. It \nwill gain speed. It is a savings express to college.\n  By putting their child on the savings express, after 18 years when \nthat child is ready to go to college, the parents will have $65,200, \nand that just assumes a 6 percent rate of interest--the rate on a \nGovernment security. Of course, other investments could yield even \nmore, but a U.S. Government security is the safest in the world.\n  So parents would have at least $65,200 toward their child's \neducation. $29,000 of that would be solely due to the power of \ncompounding interest. And every cent of that $29,000 would be tax-\nfree--it would go straight into education.\n  Maybe that still does not seem like a lot to some folks, but it sure \nseems like a lot to parents who are struggling today to insure college \nfor their children tomorrow.\n  The average annual cost of college--tuition, room, and fees--in 1997-\n1998, was $9,536. At the University of Delaware, it is $9,984 for this \nschool year. So the national average total cost is roughly $10,000 per \nyear or $40,000 for the cost of a college education.\n  My amendment before us today will cover this. It will give parents \nand students peace of mind.\n  My amendment is a powerful incentive to save. It is an engine. It is \nthe engine that can pull a long train of savings--and dreams.\n  Like the Little Engine that Could, my amendment makes this \nlegislation the Education Savings Plan that Will. Parents and children \ngetting on this savings train, will get off at college to a better \nfuture.\n  I am amazed that some people are trying to overlook the train and \njust see the caboose. I promise you the American people are not. \nAmerica has waited for this college savings plan for 3 years. This \nlegislation brings it home today. It is time the President got on \nboard.\n\n  The measures in this bill are an important step forward. My amendment \nwill not only take us another step forward but keep us on a permanent \ntrack to prosperity.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in a bipartisan effort to make education \naffordable for American families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Who yields time? The Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 46 minutes; the minority has \n33 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly to the Bingaman \namendment.\n  First, I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from \nDelaware. The Senator talked about the train that could and the train \nthat will, but it will not if we adopt the Bingaman amendment because \nthe Bingaman amendment neuters, makes moot, the education IRA, the \neducation savings account. He takes the funding that is in the bill \nthat is before us and shifts it to the Department of Education. It may \nbe a rational goal or not; that can be debated. The bottom line is that \neverything Senator Roth of Delaware has just spoken to would be moot. \nAll the advantages, the accumulation of funds that will allow families \nto more effectively deal with college costs or educational costs in \ngeneral will disappear, end, be over, no train.\n  This is about the third attempt from the other side to bring ``an \napple pie goal'' and use it as a tactic to defund educational savings \naccounts.\n  With regard to the Bingaman amendment and its issues of \naccountability, of course those are rightfully being discussed in the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act which is in committee. It is \nbeing jump-started in a\n\n[[Page S1000]]\n\nvery confrontational way in that the very essence of everything we have \nbeen talking about for the better part of 2 weeks would be moot if we \nallowed the funding that allows the creation of family education \nsavings accounts to be shifted over to the Department of Education and \nall that bureaucratic morass in the name of a good goal.\n  Certainly, accountability is something for which we all strive. I do \nthink we ought to remember that accountability in schools is primarily \nthe responsibility of the State governments. Currently, of all the \neducation funds available in America, some 13 percent are now provided \nby the Federal Government.\n\n  What is interesting is about 50 to 60 percent of the administrative \noverhead and regulations and those things that bog down principals and \nsuperintendents and teachers is a Federal mandate. We send off a check \nfor 13 percent, but we demand about a 50-percent overhead on what all \nthose local schools have to do.\n  We will be voting a little bit later on the Robb amendment which, of \ncourse, does the same thing. It creates a national school construction \nprogram, and if my colleagues read through the amendment, they will see \nit is going to take a building of lawyers to understand all the \nrequirements and mandates.\n  I wanted to make the point that on the Bingaman amendment and, for \nthat matter, the Robb amendment, both have the effect of defunding and \nmaking impossible the creation of the education savings account.\n  I will take a few more minutes to remind everybody that by Government \npredictions and estimates, the education savings account we are \nproposing will affect 14 million American families who are educating 20 \nmillion children. Because they are setting up this education savings \naccount, they will invest--these are the American families--$12 billion \nover the next 10 years to be used to help their children for \neducational purposes.\n  So every time we confront one of these amendments that removes the \nfunding to establish the education savings account, we are not only \nthrowing the idea away, but we are throwing away $12 billion of \nvolunteered money that would come from these 14 million families for \ntheir children. It will be one of the largest infusions of resources we \nhave seen in public-private education in many years, and the Federal \nGovernment is not having to raise taxes to do it. They are not having \nto appropriate money to do it. We are simply saying we will allow the \ninterest that will build up in these education savings accounts not to \nbe taxed.\n  Over a 10-year period, it is a reasonably small number of tax revenue \nthat is forfeited, and it makes the American public do massive things. \nImagine saving $12 billion for the aid of kids who are trying to get \nthrough school and college.\n  I wanted to make it clear that these amendments, under these ``apple \npie'' titles have the effect of closing down the idea that we will be \nopening an education savings account.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the period \nof time that is consumed in the quorum call be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending consent agreement be amended to include a vote in relation to \nthe Graham amendment and, therefore, those three votes be postponed to \noccur at 2 p.m. today. I further ask unanimous consent that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order to either of the three amendments prior \nto the votes and the time between now and 2 p.m. be equally divided for \ndebate of all three amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is my \nunderstanding the next 2 hours, then, are evenly divided between the \nminority and majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Therefore, Mr. President, the next votes will occur at \n2. The Senate was advised that it would be at 1 and there would be two \nvotes. So the change is that we are able to work another amendment in, \nand we will have 3 votes at 2.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2864\n\n (Purpose: To provide funds to assist high-poverty school districts in \n                     meeting their teaching needs)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will be offering an amendment which is \nentitled Transition to Teaching. This amendment came to my attention as \na result of a series of personal experiences.\n  One set of those experiences related to the military and specifically \nthe U.S. Navy in Pensacola. Several years ago, facing the downsizing of \nthe military and aware that there were going to be a lot of people with \ntalents, particularly in areas such as science and mathematics, who \nwould be looking for a second career, the U.S. Navy in Pensacola, the \nState university in Pensacola, and the University of West Florida \nformed a partnership. That partnership was to provide training for \nnaval personnel who were within a few months or years of their \nretirement date so that when they did reach retirement, they would be \nprepared to go into the classrooms of America with full certification \nand commence a second career educating the next generation of young \nAmericans.\n  This has been a very successful program. It has assisted scores of \nschools in my State and many more across the country. This program has \nbeen generally referred to as the Troops to Teachers Program.\n  Last August, I did one of my monthly workdays at North Marion High \nSchool north of Ocala, FL. There I met a man by the name of Bill \nAradine. Bill teaches automobile mechanics at North Marion. North \nMarion, as do many schools in America, every year faces a major \nchallenge in how to recruit enough young new teachers to fill the \nranks.\n  We are facing, in the next decade, something on the order of 2 \nmillion American teachers who are going to retire. These are teachers \nwho largely came to the classroom in the 1950s and 1960s, are now \nreaching their retirement period, and are going to create tremendous \ndemands for new teachers to fill those ranks. Bill Aradine filled one \nof those positions at North Marion High School.\n  What is peculiar about Bill is not just the fact that he is \nconsidered to be an outstanding teacher who motivates his students and \nhas prepared students for very good paying jobs upon their graduation \nfrom his automobile mechanics program, but what is most peculiar about \nBill is the fact that he is a man who already had a career. The career \nwas that, at first, he was an automobile mechanic and then the lead \nmechanic of one of the large automobile dealerships in Marion County, \nFL. So when he came to the classroom, he was a fully mature adult with \na lot of experience in the area he was going to teach, credibility with \nthe students, and the ability to be beyond a teacher, a mentor, a \ncounselor, and the bridge from the classroom to employment for his \nstudents.\n\n  Now, Bill made that transition to the classroom out of his own grit, \nhis interest in being able to share with young Floridians what he had \nlearned in a lifetime of automobile mechanics. But Bill, unfortunately, \nis a rarer commodity than he should be. We ought to be encouraging more \npeople at midcareer to consider the classroom as their second career. \nWe ought to be facilitating their ability, as the Navy and the \nUniversity of West Florida did, to get certified so they can move\n\n[[Page S1001]]\n\nseemlessly into the classroom. We ought to recognize the fact that a \nstudent at 40 is different than a student at 18, in terms of their \nclass schedule and their other responsibilities, both family and \neconomic; and we ought to try to make it easier for those Americans to \nbe able to pursue their desire at a second career in the classroom.\n  That is what the transition to teaching legislation intends to do. It \nfocuses on two of the principal inhibitors to persons pursuing a second \ncareer in education. The first of those occurs at the universities. The \nuniversities are very well prepared to train people who are right out \nof high school, who don't have many family or economic \nresponsibilities, and who, at the age of 22 or 23, will go into the \nclassroom. They are not so well prepared to deal with the student who \nis in their forties, who has all these responsibilities and has to have \na greater degree of flexibility in their schedule. As the University of \nWest Florida found, they had to redo their curriculum in order to be \nable to respond to the needs of the Navy personnel. I suggest the same \nthing is going to be required if we are going to move the Bill Aradines \nfrom a rare exception to a significant stream of persons coming into \nthe classroom as a second career. So the first part of our transition \nto teaching is focused on the universities to provide them some \nstimulation and resources to commence the process of restructuring \ntheir curriculum so they can be responsive to the needs of the middle-\nage second career student. Second is to provide stipends to these \nstudents while they are undergoing this process of change, recognizing \nthat they have other responsibilities, typically, in terms of \nsupporting their families and the other obligations that an adult would \ntypically have.\n  So those are the two targets of this legislation in order to \nfacilitate more Americans being able to consider a second career in \neducation and to be able to contribute to that 2 million new teachers \nthat America is going to need in the next 10 years in order to meet the \ntremendous demands that will be caused by the impending retirements of \nmany hundreds of thousands of current teachers.\n  I will offer, for purposes of consideration as an amendment to the \nlegislation that is pending before us, an amendment on which I have \nbeen joined by Senators Bingaman and Robb, entitled ``Transition to \nTeaching.'' I will urge its consideration and vote at the scheduled \ntime of 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I now send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for himself, Mr. \n     Robb and Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 2864.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n                   TITLE ____--TRANSITION TO TEACHING\n\n     SEC. ____1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Transition to Teaching \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. ____2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) School districts will need to hire more than 2,000,000 \n     teachers in the next decade. The need for teachers in the \n     areas of mathematics, science, foreign languages, special \n     education, and bilingual education, and for those able to \n     teach in high-poverty school districts will be particularly \n     high. To meet this need, talented Americans of all ages \n     should be recruited to become successful, qualified teachers.\n       (2) Nearly 28 percent of teachers of academic subjects have \n     neither an undergraduate major nor minor in their main \n     assignment fields. This problem is more acute in high-poverty \n     schools, where the out-of-field percentage is 39 percent.\n       (3) The Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) \n     ranked United States high school seniors last among 16 \n     countries in physics and next to last in mathematics. It is \n     also evident, mainly from the TIMSS data, that based on \n     academic scores, a stronger emphasis needs to be placed on \n     the academic preparation of our children in mathematics and \n     science.\n       (4) One-fourth of high-poverty schools find it very \n     difficult to fill bilingual teaching positions, and nearly \n     half of public school teachers have students in their \n     classrooms for whom English is a second language.\n       (5) Many career-changing professionals with strong content-\n     area skills are interested in a teaching career, but need \n     assistance in getting the appropriate pedagogical training \n     and classroom experience.\n       (6) The Troops to Teachers model has been highly successful \n     in linking high-quality teachers to teach in high-poverty \n     districts.\n\n     SEC. ____3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to address the need of high-\n     poverty school districts for highly qualified teachers in \n     particular subject areas, such as mathematics, science, \n     foreign languages, bilingual education, and special \n     education, needed by those school districts, by recruiting, \n     preparing, placing, and supporting career-changing \n     professionals who have knowledge and experience that will \n     help them become such teachers.\n\n     SEC. ____4. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\n\n       (a) Authority.--The Secretary is authorized to use funds \n     appropriated under subsection (b) for each fiscal year to \n     award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to \n     institutions of higher education and public and private \n     nonprofit agencies or organizations to carry out programs \n     authorized by this title.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of \n     carrying out this title, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated $25,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2001 \n     through 2006.\n\n     SEC. ____5. APPLICATION.\n\n       Each applicant that desires an award under section ____4(a) \n     shall submit an application to the Secretary containing such \n     information as the Secretary requires, including--\n       (1) a description of the target group of career-changing \n     professionals upon which the applicant will focus in carrying \n     out its program under this title, including a description of \n     the characteristics of that target group that shows how the \n     knowledge and experience of its members are relevant to \n     meeting the purpose of this title;\n       (2) a description of how the applicant will identify and \n     recruit program participants;\n       (3) a description of the training that program participants \n     will receive and how that training will relate to their \n     certification as teachers;\n       (4) a description of how the applicant will ensure that \n     program participants are placed and teach in high-poverty \n     local educational agencies;\n       (5) a description of the teacher induction services (which \n     may be provided through existing induction programs) the \n     program participants will receive throughout at least their \n     first year of teaching;\n       (6) a description of how the applicant will collaborate, as \n     needed, with other institutions, agencies, or organizations \n     to recruit, train, place, and support program participants \n     under this title, including evidence of the commitment of \n     those institutions, agencies, or organizations to the \n     applicant's program;\n       (7) a description of how the applicant will evaluate the \n     progress and effectiveness of its program, including--\n       (A) the program's goals and objectives;\n       (B) the performance indicators the applicant will use to \n     measure the program's progress; and\n       (C) the outcome measures that will be used to determine the \n     program's effectiveness; and\n       (8) an assurance that the applicant will provide to the \n     Secretary such information as the Secretary determines \n     necessary to determine the overall effectiveness of programs \n     under this title.\n\n     SEC. ____6.

EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION.\n\n       To the extent practicable, the Secretary shall make awards \n     under this title that support programs in different \n     geographic regions of the Nation.\n\n     SEC. ____8. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n\n[[Page S1002]]\n\n       (1) High-poverty local educational agency.--The term \n     ``high-poverty local educational agency'' means a local \n     educational agency in which the percentage of children, ages \n     5 through 17, from families below the poverty level is 20 \n     percent or greater, or the number of such children exceeds \n     10,000.\n       (2) Program participants.--The term ``program \n     participants'' means career-changing professionals who--\n       (A) hold at least a baccalaureate degree;\n       (B) demonstrate interest in, and commitment to, becoming a \n     teacher; and\n       (C) have knowledge and experience that are relevant to \n     teaching a high-need subject area in a high-need local \n     educational agency.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, when I introduced Transition to Teaching \nin October last year, I talked about my workday with Bill Aradine.\n  He teaches 150 students, from 9th to 12th grade at North Marion High \nSchool near Ocala, FL.\n  He teaches auto mechanics, and has sparked an interest in students \nthat may lead to rewarding, lucrative, and challenging careers for \nthem.\n  But Mr. Aradine brings something else to his first year in North \nMarion High School--eleven years of on-the-job experience.\n  He has years of experience in a local Chevrolet car dealership, and \nhe is starting a second career in teaching.\n  The students look at him with a different perspective: When he says \nthat ``you will need to know this to succeed'' they know that he knows.\n  Having just come from the automotive industry, he teaches at the \ncutting edge.\n  The information that he brings to his students is what he was \nactually doing in the workplace not that long ago.\n  Mr. Aradine is also a bridge between North Marion High students and \nthe world of employment.\n  He offers them advice, counsel, and real-life connections to future \njobs.\n  As Bill Aradine made the mid-career transition into the teaching \nprofession, students gained a valuable instructor and mentor, and North \nMarion High School was able to fill a vacancy and ease its teacher \nshortage.\n  Every August and September--another school year begins for thousands \nof young Americans.\n  Almost every year at this time, I hear from school districts in \nFlorida about teacher shortages:\n  Miami-Dade hired 1,700 new teachers for the 1999 school year, and \nstill had 300 vacancies to fill on the first day of classes.\n  Hillsborough County hired 1,493 teachers for the start of the school \nyear and were still 238 teachers short when the first class bell rang.\n  Orange County needed 1,300 teachers for the new year, and still had \n50 vacancies several months after school started.\n  These concerns will only get worse: 40 percent of current \nschoolteachers are over age 50, on the verge of retirement.\n  Who will be the future role models to the next generation of \nAmericans?\n  The importance of having high-quality teachers, and in sufficient \nnumbers is crucial when we look at the challenges facing education in \nthe future.\n  The American family structure will change in two key ways: Half of \nall children will spend some of their childhood in single-parent homes, \nand are more likely to live in poverty. And, of the children who grow \nup in a nuclear family, very often both parents will work, thus are \nless able to be involved in a child's school and schoolwork.\n  Second, societal expectations for students upon graduation will be \ngreater.\n  In the middle of this century, 20 percent of the jobs needed skilled \nworkers.\n  At the end of this century, 80 percent of jobs will need skilled \nworkers.\n  Thus, the American student will need to graduate from school better \nprepared for the hi-tech world than ever before, but single parent \nfamilies and dual-income families, in general, will face more \nchallenges in being actively involved in their child's education.\n  These challenges, and others, will face the American educational \nsystem.\n  I rise today to take one step forward in easing the nationwide \nteacher shortage, and offering challenging new opportunities for \nAmerica's professionals by introducing the Transition to Teaching Act \nof 1999.\n  Representatives Jim Davis of Florida and Tim Roemer of Indiana have \ntaken the lead in the House of Representatives on this issue.\n  We have a very successful model on which to build the Transition to \nTeaching program.\n  Since 1994, the ``Troops to Teachers'' program has brought more than \n3,000 retired military personnel to our classrooms as math, science, \nand technology teachers.\n  Florida schools have the benefit of more than 270 individuals who \nhave successfully completed the Troops to Teachers program, and are \nbringing their life-experience to the classroom today.\n  Troops to Teachers, and now Transition to Teaching, overcome two of \nthe main obstacles that mid-career professionals face when becoming a \nteacher.\n  It streamlines the teaching certification process.\n  It provides money to mid-career professionals to become certified.\n  It's not impossible to do this now, as Mr. Aradine has shown, but \nthis legislation will assist with and simplify the process.\n  The first issue that is addressed involves teaching colleges within \nuniversities.\n  They are often set up for traditional students, in their early-20's, \njust starting out in their professional lives.\n  These programs are generally taken over a multi-year period as a \nfull-time college student.\n  This legislation encourages teaching colleges to develop curriculum \nsuitable for an individual who has many years of work experience.\n  These programs are more streamlined, more flexible in school hours, \nand recognize that the professional brings more life and work \nexperience than a traditional college student.\n  By developing such programs, colleges can maintain high standards, \nbut allow a mid-career professional, making the change into teaching to \nbecome certified in a more efficient, streamlined manner.\n  Teaching colleges are also asked to develop programs to maintain \ncontact with and support for these new teachers during at least their \nfirst year in the classroom.\n  Second, Transition to Teaching will assist teachers who come to the \nprofession in mid-career in a very tangible way.\n  Grants will be awarded, up to $5,000 per participant, to offset the \ncosts of becoming a certified teacher.\n  In return, the teacher agrees to teach in low-income schools for \nthree years, as determined by the percentage of Title One students in \nthe school population.\n  Thus, two of the biggest obstacles to becoming a teacher in mid-\ncareer are alleviated by this legislation:\n  First, the certification process is streamlined, and second, stipends \nare provided to offset the cost of this additional education.\n  By expanding the ``Troops to Teachers'' program into ``Transition to \nTeaching,'' law enforcement, attorneys, business leaders, scientists, \nentrepreneurs, and others in the private sector, should be encouraged \nto share their wisdom with students.\n  This amendment is timely. We are on the cusp of the retirement of \nmillions of baby boomers.\n  By encouraging recent retirees, or mid-career professionals, to \nbecome certified through Transition to Teaching and spend a few years \nin the classroom, we will bring the life skills of experienced \nprofessionals to our youngest citizens.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Our nation's children deserve our best efforts to provide them with a \nworld class education.\n  Let me just add an economic component to this amendment. This \namendment would be in the nature of an authorization. The President has \nin his budget an item of $25 million, which would be the basis of \nsupporting this program, as well as the current Troops to Teachers \nProgram.\n  It is estimated that approximately half of the persons who would be \ntrained with that $25 million appropriation that has been recommended \nby the President would be military personnel and the other half would \nbe civilian. As we begin to stabilize the reduction of the military, \nthe proportion of those persons who would be trained for a second \ncareer in the classroom would probably begin to shift with a larger \nnumber being from the civilian sector. It is estimated that the cost \nper student for this program will be approximately $3,500 to $4,000 a \nyear for their training, with the average person\n\n[[Page S1003]]\n\ntaking between 1 and 2 years to be trained to the point they are \ncertified to go into the classroom.\n  I believe this is a very reasonable and prudent investment for \nAmerica to make in Americans who have demonstrated their \naccomplishments in a first career and are now ready to share their \nexperiences with American youth in a second career in the classroom. \nThis will help to facilitate that transition to teaching for the 21st \ncentury.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask whether the floor is in any kind \nof a parliamentary situation at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is controlled and evenly divided \nuntil 2 o'clock on the pending amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business for a maximum of 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I \nmention to the Senator that in the context of these amendments that his \nside has invited Senator Wellstone to come to begin his amendment. If \nthat were to come about, we would need to try to accommodate it. If the \nSenator would help us with that, I see no problem.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would be pleased to do that.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/01/senate-section/article/S1003-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1003-S1004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN CONTROL\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, none of us can possibly ignore what \ntook place yesterday in Michigan. Another child killed by gunfire. \nEverywhere across the country we see children killing children. And \nthen we see members of the immediate family their faces contorted by \nsadness. Anyone who has a child or grandchild has to be dismayed and \nupset by these tragedies.\n  I am fortunate enough to have seven grandchildren, the oldest of whom \nis 6. Nothing is more joyful than to see their smiling faces--to see \nthem learning about life, reading, playing, and singing.\n  And when I think of my grandchildren, and the other children across \nthis country, I ask myself what it will take to stop the gun violence. \nWhen will this Congress say we have enough killing? What does it take \nto change some minds, to say that guns do kill?\n  I am so tired of that foolish saying: ``guns don't kill people, \npeople kill people.'' Of course, people kill people, but we would see \nmuch less deadly violence if we passed common sense gun safety \nmeasures. It is getting close to the 1-year anniversary of the tragedy \nat Columbine. I will never forget the picture of the child hanging out \nof the window at that school, looking for help, trying to get away from \nthe terror. I thought that terrible violence--12 children killed and \nmany more seriously injured--would force this Congress to act.\n  And yet there has been much more gun violence since Columbine. \nShootings in Georgia; in Ft. Worth, Texas, at a prayer meeting. Those \nyoung people were gathered to worship and along comes someone with a \ngun and kills them. And then a gunman in California attacks children at \na day care. After that terrible assault, the gunman goes on to kill a \npostal worker because he is Filipino and not white.\n  When will the National Rifle Association and its friends step up to \nthe issue, not always appealing to the extremists, and say there is a \nsensible way to approach this problem and reduce the proliferation of \nguns? They should join with us and help close the gun show loophole \nthat allows guns to be sold without a criminal background check.\n  A person could be one the 10 most wanted criminals in this country \nand say to one of the dealers: I have $500; give me a couple of guns. \nThe dealer could sell them, and he would not be breaking the law. It is \nan outrage.\n  Of course, some who oppose gun safety legislation talk about the \nSecond Amendment. But there is nothing in the Constitution that says \ncitizens can buy a gun without identifying themselves. There is nothing \nin the Constitution that says, buy a gun, carry it anyplace you want. \nNo, no; there are overriding considerations that say we have to protect \nour citizens. We put people in uniform to protect our citizens. \nSometimes it is a military uniform, sometimes it is a police uniform. \nWe do it to protect our citizens. Why don't we reduce the possibility \nthat a gun might be introduced into a situation?\n  In 1996, Congress did pass my domestic violence gun ban. There was a \nhuge fight on the floor of this Senate and the House. In cooperation \nwith President Clinton, on the budget bill, we said anybody who has \ncommitted a misdemeanor of spousal abuse or abusing a child, that \nperson should not have a gun. We fought like the devil. People said we \nhave no right to take guns away from people who haven't done something \nserious.\n  But domestic violence is serious. And guns make domestic violence \nincidents even more dangerous. The trigger does not have to be pulled \nto traumatize a spouse or a child. Let a man put a gun to a woman's \nhead and say: I will blow your brains out in front of your children. \nThat is a wound that does not go away in a hurry. Doctors cannot see \nthat wound on the skin, but it does not go away.\n  Mr. President, since that law went into effect, 33,000 purchases have \nbeen prevented. 33,000 of those wife abusers, spousal abusers, could \nnot get a gun. I feel good about it. And I still cannot understand \nthose people who opposed it and who continue to oppose gun safety \nmeasures. They seem to want guns for everyone, wherever they want, at \nany age, it doesn't matter, hide them, conceal them, do what you want.\n  That is irresponsible. And we should not have people hiding behind \nempty slogans like ``guns don't kill people''. Or trying to distort the \nmeaning of the Second Amendment. No one has a right to hurt another. \nThat is not in the Constitution.\n  Just a few minutes ago we learned that there was another shooting \nnear Pittsburgh. We don't have all the details, but someone shot four \npeople in a McDonald's and then went to a Burger King and shot someone \nelse.\n  So the gun violence continues, week by week, day by day, hour by \nhour. Yesterday it was a six-year-old in Michigan killing another \nchild. And we ask ourselves what can be done. Do you put a 6-year-old \nin jail? Do you lock him up in a cell? Or do you say to a parent or a \nfriend: It is your responsibility?\n  If you own a car, you have no right to give it to somebody who \ndoesn't know how to drive and tell them to have a good time. That can \nbe criminally prosecuted if a person has an accident. Why is a gun \ndifferent? Why shouldn't all guns be protected from access by \nunacceptable users, children, deranged people, et cetera?\n  We ought to do it. We keep avoiding it with silly excuses in this \nplace. I hope people across America understand we ought to stop this \nnow. We can require gun manufacturers to manufacture guns that don't \nwork except in the hands of an authorized user. Thirteen children a day \ndie from gunshots; over 4,500 kids a year. We can pass a bill that \nSenator Durbin from Illinois has authored, the Child Access Prevention \nAct. It imposes criminal penalties on gun owners who allow children \naccess to their guns.\n  And we ought to take stronger measures to prevent easy access to \nguns. Closing the gun show loophole which allows criminals to purchase \nfirearms without a background check will help. Let me give a graphic \nexample why we cannot afford to wait any longer to do this.\n  Every year, several gun shows are held in Portland, OR at the Expo \nCenter. The Expo Center is managed by a commission established by the \nlocal government, the Metropolitan Exposition-Recreation Commission, \ncalled Metro for short. Metro officials were concerned about possible \ncriminal activity at gun shows, so they looked at police records and \nput together a report. Here is what they found:\n\n       Investigative reports from the Portland Police Bureau \n     demonstrate a continuing pattern of frequent significant \n     criminal activity\n\n[[Page S1004]]\n\n     associated with the Rose City gun shows at the Expo Center.\n\n  And the report gives examples of that criminal activity. Here is an \nexample:\n\n       Three subjects were observed in the gun show wearing gang \n     attire. The three subjects were looking for dealers who do \n     not do background checks. One of the subjects attempted to \n     purchase a Glock pistol without any paperwork. The subjects \n     bought 4 high capacity magazines and exited the show. \n     Officers contacted the subjects and found one subject all in \n     red to be 12 years old. The second subject all in blue had a \n     warrant for his arrest. The last subject was found to be an \n     ex-felon. The two adults were arrested and transported to NE \n     precinct. At the NE precinct officers found marijuana \n     packaged for sale and $1,150 in the last subject's shoe. He \n     was charged with delivery of a controlled substance.\n\n  So we have gang members--drug dealers--using a gun show as a \nconvenience store for guns. These gang members were looking for gun \nsellers who were not required to do criminal background checks.\n  And this testimony is similar to what we heard from Robyn Anderson \nwhen she testified before the Colorado legislature. She is the young \nwoman who went with Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold to the Tanner Gun \nShow in Adams County, Colorado.\n  She testified that Harris and Klebold went from table to table at the \ngun show, looking for gun sellers who were not required to complete a \nbackground check.\n  With her help, Harris and Klebold bought two shotguns and a rifle \nwithout a criminal background check. And everybody knows what happened \nafter that. They used those guns to murder fellow students and a \nteacher at Columbine High School. How much more do we need to know \nbefore we do the sensible thing and close this loophole?\n  Gang members and teenagers bent on committing murder know they can go \nto a gun show and get a firearm if they want, without a background \ncheck. Is there anyone around here who actually thinks that is all \nright? Good friends on the other side, good friends on both sides will \nsometimes defend gun ownership blindly. But we should all agree that \nyou should not be able to buy a gun without identifying yourself and \nhaving a criminal background check.\n  The gun lobby says we do not need a new law, all we need to do is \nenforce the current law. But that completely misses the point. There is \na loophole in the law, so when you try to enforce it, criminals simply \nslip through the loophole. This hole in our gun laws is leaking human \nlives and we ought to plug it before someone else is killed with a \npistol or shotgun purchased at a gun show without a background check. \nPeople ought to identify themselves when they buy a gun. Why not?\n  Some of our colleagues who argue against closing this loophole are \nthe same people who go on and on about the need to get tough on crime. \nBut when it comes to this gaping loophole in our gun laws, they are \nstrangely quiet. All of us know why. Those tough-on-crime Members do \nnot hear the huge majority of the people. Ninety percent of the people \nin this country, according to a recent poll, are calling for us to \nclose this loophole. They do not hear the cries, see the tears of those \nwho have lost a child, a friend, a relative. But what do they hear? \nThey hear the NRA making deposits to their campaign accounts. They hear \nthe NRA saying: Do nothing and we will keep these campaign \ncontributions coming.\n  I have been fighting this battle for a long time, almost a year now \non this specific issue. Back on May 20, 9 months ago, the Senate passed \nmy amendment to close the gun show loophole. It passed 51-50, with a \nhuge struggle. But the Congress has yet to finish the job because the \nNRA has been putting its money to work making sure my amendment stays \nbottled up in a conference committee.\n  Let's do the right thing and set this legislation free. Let's not \nallow extremists in the gun lobby to prevail over the families across \nthis country who want to stop the gun violence.\n  April 20 will mark 1 year since the terrible tragedy at Columbine \nHigh School. On that day, people across this country will ask, What has \nCongress done? What have you done to stop gun violence in this country? \nWhat have you done to protect my child, my grandchild, my brother, my \nsister, my parents from this mad gun violence? It is not too late to \ngive the public the answer they want, the answer they deserve. It is \nnot too late to show them that common sense can prevail in this \ndistinguished place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/01/senate-section/article/S1004-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1004-S1005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    AWARDING JOHN CARDINAL O'CONNOR THE CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise today \nto thank my distinguished Senate colleagues for their support, help, \nconsideration, and, hopefully, passage of S. 2076, legislation which \nwill bestow upon John Cardinal O'Connor the Congressional Medal of \nHonor.\n  I, along with Senators Moynihan, Specter, and Santorum, introduced \nthis bill last week. We believe now is the perfect time for Congress to \npublicly thank His Eminence for his 50 years of service to America, the \nCatholic Church, and for his numerous contributions as an ambassador of \npeace, freedom, and humanitarianism around the world.\n  Since being ordained 54 years ago, John Cardinal O'Connor has humbly \ncaptured the hearts of millions with a message of caring and compassion \nfor all people. He has dutifully served the Church in Philadelphia, the \nDiocese of Scranton, and now from the steps of the treasured St. \nPatrick's Cathedral serves as the spiritual guiding force for the 10-\ncounty New York Archdiocese and its more than 2.3 million Catholic \nmembers.\n  He is loved in New York and by Catholics across the country. He has \ntouched the hearts of millions whose spiritual life is richer from the \nwords and deeds of our cardinal.\n  Since being named by the Pope as successor to the late Cardinal \nTerence Cook in 1984, Cardinal O'Connor has sought to reinforce the \ntraditional teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church while \nputting a human face on the problems faced not only by Catholics but \nall New Yorkers.\n  He has advocated for an increase in the minimum wage. He has \nadvocated for farm workers. He has advocated for working people \nthroughout New York and throughout the world.\n  He has worked hard to improve relationships between Catholics and \nJews, knowing that is so important to the future of the area he \nrepresents and to all Americans.\n  He has advocated relentlessly for fairness and justice. And even \nwhile reaffirming the Church's teachings on homosexuality, he set up \nAIDS clinics and volunteered anonymously in them.\n  I have not always agreed with Cardinal O'Connor. For example, he is a \nstrong, vocal, and impassioned voice in opposition to abortion. I have \nrespectfully disagreed with his position. But in some instances you \nearn an even greater respect for someone by the way they disagree with \nyou, how they fight for their beliefs: With vigor, passion, and \nconviction, but also with humility and grace.\n  He is a man of immense conviction. He has been unyielding in his \ncommitment to reaffirm the priorities of the Church and his faith.\n  I am left with nothing but respect and admiration for the way in \nwhich Cardinal O'Connor has advocated on behalf of his beliefs.\n  John Cardinal O'Connor's life of spiritual service began decades ago. \nHe had 20-plus years of distinguished service in the Armed Forces. He \nheeded our Nation's call in 1952, joining the ranks of the military \nchaplaincy during the Korean war, and provided spiritual leadership for \nmembers of the Navy and Marine Corps during Vietnam. His career \ncontinued on as chaplain to the United States Naval Academy.\n  Eventually he rose with distinction to become Navy chief chaplain. He \nserved in that capacity until 1979, upon which he retired from military \nservice with the distinguished rank of rear admiral. An international \nambassador for humanity, Cardinal O'Connor has traveled the world \nover--Israel, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia, and Russia--and he also \naccompanied Pope John Paul II on his visit to Cuba.\n  He has called on governments to work for social development, provide \ninternational peace, and implored governments to provide their citizens \nwith the freedom and ability to exercise their religious beliefs.\n  His work in volatile 1980s Central America helped clear the way for \nclergy members to be allowed to visit political prisoners and also \nhelped end\n\n[[Page S1005]]\n\nthe expulsion of foreign missionaries. He has, with great resolve, \nworked to strengthen the human spirit whenever war, oppression, and \npoverty have threatened to weaken it, as a servant of the Roman \nCatholic Church and a compassionate American citizen.\n  Now the cardinal is ailing. We all pray and wish for his recovery. \nBut there is no time more appropriate than now for the Congressional \nGold Medal to be bestowed upon Cardinal O'Connor. It is not often that \nthis gold medal is issued. But given the cardinal's service, given the \ncardinal's ability to reach out to so many different kinds of people, \nno one is more deserving of the Congressional Gold Medal. The medal is \nan expression of public gratitude reserved exclusively for those who \nhave distinguished themselves through their achievements and \ncontributions to our great Nation. From his spiritual guidance to the \nmembers of the Armed Forces 50 years ago to his commitment to justice \nand holiness as head of the archdiocese in New York today, John \nCardinal O'Connor has earned this rare and distinguished congressional \nhonor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nremaining votes in this series be limited to 10 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support Senator Bingaman's amendment\n\n[[Page S1006]]\n\nto ensure greater accountability by Title I schools that are low-\nperforming. The Coverdell bill does nothing to help improve public \nschools that need assistance. Instead it diverts scarce resources to \nwealthy families in private schools, when 90 percent of the nation's \nstudents attend public schools.\n  Stronger accountability in the nation's education system is \nessential. Effective accountability measures--what business leaders \ncall quality control--can make sure that investments in schools are \nused wisely and produce better results for children. Accountability is \nespecially important in schools with high concentrations of \ndisadvantaged students, so that all students will have the opportunity \nto meet high standards of achievement.\n  Despite concerted efforts by states, school districts, and schools, \naccountability provisions in title I have not been adequately \nimplemented due to insufficient resources. In 1998, only 8 states \nreported that school support teams have been able to serve the majority \nof schools that need improvement. Less than half of the schools \nidentified as in need of improvement in 1997-98 reported that they \nreceived additional professional development assistance or technical \nassistance.\n  We cannot afford to let low-performing public schools slip through \nthe cracks. Schools and school districts need additional support and \nresources to remedy weaknesses as soon as they are identified. We \nshould act now to make our schools more accountable for the benefit of \nthe nation's disadvantaged students. These students have already spent \ntoo much time in low-performing schools, and they deserve better, much \nbetter. The time is now to take action to fix these schools. The \nnation's children deserve no less. I urge the Senate to support the \nBingaman amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2863\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment that is to be voted on \nnext is one I offered which takes the $275 million per year that is the \nestimated cost of this underlying bill with the tax provisions and it \ndevotes that $275 million to assisting States to hold local school \ndistricts accountable to upgrade standards.\n  It is an accountability amendment. Presently, most of the States in \nthe country have established performance standards for their schools \nand their students but we have no accountability provisions that are \nadequate for them to meet those standards. This amendment tries to \nsolve that. It gives the resources to the States so they can solve \nthat. I believe it is a very good amendment and it is something we all \nought to support.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, at the heart of my opposition to the \namendment is that it strikes the education savings account, the core of \nthe legislation that came from the Finance Committee. It is a killer \namendment.\n  The amendment allocates only 70 cents of every dollar to local school \ndistricts. We have been striving to get to 95 cents of every Federal \ndollar. The amendment not only neuters education savings accounts but \nit also goes to core issues about how title I funds should be \ndistributed to help local school districts under ESEA.\n  This is an issue being debated at the committee's markup today. \nSenator Jeffords, chairman of the committee, opposes this amendment \nbecause he believes it violates the jurisdiction of the committee.\n  I move to table the amendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n2863.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Banking \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 3557 and the \nSenate now proceed to its immediate consideration under the following \nlimitations: There be 10 minutes of debate equally divided between \nSenators Santorum and Schumer, and no amendments or motions be in order \nto the bill. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following the use or \nyielding back of debate time, the bill be read a third time and passed \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3557) to authorize the President to award a \n     gold medal on behalf of the Congress to John Cardinal \n     O'Connor, Archbishop of New York, in recognition of his \n     accomplishments as a priest, a chaplain, and a humanitarian.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, it is with an enormous amount of pride \nand respect that I rise in support of this bill. Senator Schumer from \nNew York spoke on this matter earlier today. I strongly endorse and \nsupport his words of support for this resolution.\n  I stand with a tremendous amount of pride to speak in favor of my \nfavorite son. John Cardinal O'Connor is a Philadelphian, someone who \nhas left his mark not only on the country but on Pennsylvania, where he \nserved as Bishop of Scranton--I see Senator Biden who is a \nScrantonian--where he served a brief time--less than a year--but with \ndistinction and, prior to that gave tremendous service to this country \nas a chaplain in the U.S. Navy, serving during the Korean conflict and \nduring Vietnam.\n  He was appointed Chief of Chaplains of the Navy with the grade of \nrear admiral and served for over 25 years in the capacity of a chaplain \nin the military.\n\n[[Page S1007]]\n\n  From that, he came into civilian life to Scranton, PA, and served \nthere for less than a year until he was picked by Pope John Paul II to \nbe the Archbishop of the Catholic Diocese of New York, and then shortly \nthereafter was elevated to the rank of cardinal in May of 1985.\n  He has served as Cardinal O'Connor in the Diocese of New York and, as \nthe leader of the Diocese of New York, also as the titular head of the \nCatholic Church in this country. He has provided tremendous leadership \non a variety of humanitarian and moral causes, always standing up for \nthe weakest among us and shepherding his flock in an extraordinary way \nwith great principle, dignity, and character.\n  It is sad that as we speak today, Cardinal O'Connor is suffering from \ncancer and is gravely ill. Senator Schumer and I worked very hard to \nmake sure this Congressional Gold Medal would be awarded to Cardinal \nO'Connor so he could be aware of it during this very difficult time in \nhis life and know that the Senate, the Congress, and certainly all of \nus in Washington extend our best wishes to him and want him to know how \nmuch we appreciate the tremendous outstanding service he has given to \nthe Catholic Church and to the people in the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will continue the remarks I made \nearlier about Cardinal O'Connor.\n  First, I thank Senator Santorum of Pennsylvania, as well as my \ncolleague, Senator Moynihan, and his colleague, Senator Specter. The \nfour of us have worked hard on this bill.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Cardinal O'Connor, of course, has had a \ndistinguished career. He has had a distinguished career as a Catholic, \nrising to one of the great positions of the Catholic Church in America.\n  He also has had a distinguished career as an American, having served \nfor many years in the Armed Forces. He served 20 years in the Armed \nForces. In 1952, he joined the ranks of the military chaplaincy. During \nthe Korean war, he provided spiritual leadership for the Navy and \nMarine Corps. He was Chaplain of the Naval Academy, became Navy Chief \nChaplain, and left the Armed Forces with the rank of rear admiral.\n  I want to say, as someone of the Jewish faith, that the cardinal has \nbeen particularly effective in moving out to the people of the Jewish \ncommunity and doing a great deal to bridge the gaps--which fortunately \nnow are relatively small and minor--between the Catholic community and \nthe Jewish community. He went out of his way to do this, which I \ngreatly respect.\n  He has always been seen doing things for the poor. He has worked hard \non making working conditions better for people. He cares about the \nplight of the farm workers. He is dedicated to protecting the rights of \nimmigrants and, in fact, announced at his Labor Day mass as recently as \nSeptember, his first public appearance after his surgery, a new \narchdiocesan program of aid to immigrants. He reached out to the poor.\n  His views on homosexuality are known, but he has spent time \nanonymously working with people with AIDS. I do not agree with his \nviews, but I sure respect the fact that, without any fanfare, he has \nbeen able to do those things.\n  Of course, now he is ill, and that is one of the reasons I thank \nevery one of my colleagues for moving this bill with alacrity because \nmy State of New York and this entire Nation owe a debt of gratitude to \nCardinal O'Connor. There is no more fitting way than presenting him \nwith the gold medal.\n  For his compassion, for his strength of argument--which I agreed with \nmany times; disagreed with sometimes--for his intelligence, and for his \ncommitment to New York and to faith, very few would be more deserving \nof this medal than Cardinal O'Connor.\n  I again thank my colleagues. I thank this body for taking the time, \nin the middle of this bill, to honor the cardinal in a very fitting \nway. Our hopes and prayers are for his health, and our thanks are for \nthe great job he has done for New York's Catholics, for all New \nYorkers, and for all Americans.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for \nhis heartfelt comments.\n  I want to relate a small personal story. I had an opportunity, with \nmy wife Karen, to meet and talk with the cardinal a few years ago when \nwe were in New York. I had never had a chance to meet him, and he was \nsomeone whom I respected very much and followed his leadership. I had \nwanted the opportunity to meet with him.\n  We went by his residence and were hoping for about 5 minutes. An hour \nlater, after a wonderful discussion of issues that I was working on and \nthat he was interested in, and things he was working on that I was \ninterested in, he gave me a tremendous amount of encouragement for work \nin public service.\n  He understood the importance of public service in his work as a \nchaplain and, obviously, in his work as the Cardinal of New York. That \nwas, indeed, public service, also.\n  Senator Schumer mentioned many things he did outside the archdiocese \nand work that reached out into the community. He gave me great \nencouragement to continue to work, to fulfill what Catholic social \nteaching is, to care particularly for the poor and the most vulnerable \nin our society.\n  He gave me a lot of inspiration. He gave my wife a lot of \ninspiration. For that I will always remember and always thank him, and \nfor the blessing and the prayers that he gave me that night.\n  Senator Schumer said--and I said earlier--he is gravely ill right \nnow. But I know, as he spends these last few days on Earth, that many \nof us who know him and admire him will long remember him. Certainly, \nthe comment, ``Well done, my good and faithful servant,'' will apply to \nJohn Cardinal O'Connor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nproceed for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as the Senator from Pennsylvania, I have \nknown Cardinal O'Connor for a long time. I am a cosponsor of this bill. \nThat is not the reason I stand.\n  I stand today to say I hope there is a lesson drawn from what is \nbeing done here. The primary cosponsor of this amendment is a man from \nNew York of a different faith, who disagrees vehemently with the \ncardinal on some very important items that mean a lot to him in terms \nof the rights of homosexuals and the issue of choice. Yet he has come \nforward to acknowledge, along with his friend from Pennsylvania, that \nthis man should be recognized for the special features he has possessed \nand the courage and the commitment he has shown.\n  I hope we all take a lesson from this. I hope we all understand that \nin every one of us in this country there is a lot of good--those who \nhave strong political positions that are diametrically opposed to us--\nand yet we are able to see the good as well as the disagreement. I hope \nthis is an object lesson for everyone.\n  I thank the Senator from New York for having the good grace to \nunderstand how we should run all of our affairs in this country. You \ncan disagree without being disagreeable. You can have strong views and \nstill recognize, in this instance, the saintly side of a great man.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the bill (H.R. 3557) \nis read the third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider is laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/01/senate-section/article/S1007-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1007-S1018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AFFORDABLE EDUCATION ACT OF 1999--Continued\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the manager of this bill, the Senator from \nGeorgia, has agreed that we would go out of the order we have had and \nallow Senator Biden to go forward for 10 minutes with his amendment. \nFollowing that, under the regular order that has already been agreed \nto, Senator Wellstone will be up next as part of the unanimous consent \nagreement. According to the unanimous consent\n\n[[Page S1008]]\n\nagreement, on his amendment there are 2 hours set aside equally \ndivided. Following that on our side, after the Republicans offer their \namendment, Senator Murray would then offer her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. What is the request, again?\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Biden be allowed to \nprecede for 10 minutes to offer his amendment, and following that, the \nSenator from Minnesota be recognized to offer his amendment, and then \nfollowing the Republicans offering an amendment, Senator Murray be \nrecognized to offer her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I may not take the 10 minutes.\n  I can assure my colleagues that in order to accommodate the number of \nSenators who asked about my amendment, I am not going to, at this \nmoment, force a vote on that amendment.\n  What I rise today for is to speak about an amendment I have submitted \nto this bill. What we have before us today is fundamentally a tax bill \nto help middle-class parents give their children the best education \npossible at elementary and secondary levels, as well as higher \neducation.\n  I, with a few on my side of the aisle, happen to support the Senator \nfrom Georgia in his effort. The proposals in this bill are not new. In \nfact, I have supported many of them in their various incarnations in \nthe past.\n  Several of these proposals were included as part of a so-called GET \nAHEAD Act--Growing the Economy for Tomorrow: Assuring Higher Education \nis Affordable and Dependable--an act which I introduced in 1997. \nAlthough this bill never came before the Congress for a vote, many of \nits provisions were included in the 1997 tax bill.\n  In 1998, I was one of only a handful of Democrats who supported the \nlegislation to expand the existing education savings accounts, more \ncommonly referred to as educational IRAs. Currently, $500 a year may be \ncontributed to these education IRAs, and the money in these accounts \nmay only be used for higher education. However, under the 1998 \nproposal, as well as the bill we have before us today, these accounts \nwould be expanded so the parents could contribute up to $2,000 per \nyear, and the savings in the accounts could be used to pay for \nelementary and secondary education costs, as well as the costs \nassociated with higher education.\n  I find no principal rationale why I should be able to use a $2,000 \nIRA to have sent my child to Georgetown University and not use it to \nsend my child to Archmere Academy, which is a Catholic institution as \nwell but a high school.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have consistently supported \nreasonable, appropriate, and constitutional measures to help middle-\nclass and low-income families choose an alternative to public schools. \nI believe the bill achieves part of this goal.\n  There is no tax deduction for the money put into these education \nIRAs. There is no tax deduction for the entire cost of a private or \nparochial education. This is not a voucher proposal.\n  The thing I would most want to speak to today is the idea that we \nhave to do more than we are now to accommodate parents sending their \nkids to college. As helpful as this initiative is, it does not go very \nfar. We all know firsthand how difficult it is for American families to \nafford college.\n  In 1997, we took some important steps towards making college \neducation more affordable with the enactment of several tax credits for \nstudents and their families. So-called HOPE scholarships allow families \na tax credit of up to $1,500 for tuition and fees for the first 2 years \nof college. The Lifetime Learning credit currently allows families a \n20-percent tax credit on up to $5,000 for educational expenses through \nthe year 2002, and up to $10,000 for educational expenses thereafter.\n  Additionally, the 1997 tax bill allows students to deduct a portion \nof the interest paid on student loans during the first 60 months of \nrepayment. The bill before us today proposes to eliminate that 60-month \nlimit on student loan interest deductions and allow students to deduct \nthe interest paid on their student loans for the duration of their \nrepayment.\n  While this is another step in the right direction, I believe there is \nstill more we can do to help our Nation's college students. That is why \nI am offering an amendment today to allow an additional tax relief for \nmillions of families who are struggling to put their kids through \ncollege. My amendment builds upon the proposal contained in the \nlegislation introduced in 1997.\n  My amendment would offer families the option of either a tax \ndeduction of a 28-percent tax credit on up to $5,000 of educational \nexpenses during 2001 and 2002 and up to $10,000 of educational expenses \nduring 2003 and thereafter. Further, there is no limit on the number of \nyears the family could claim this tax credit. So a student could claim \na deduction or credit for every year he or she is enrolled in an \ninstitution of higher learning as either an undergraduate or a graduate \nstudent.\n  Additionally, this educational tax deduction contains higher income \nthresholds. I would allow this to be taken for up to $120,000 for joint \nfilers, thus allowing more families and more students to take advantage \nof the tax benefits in this proposal.\n  Things have changed a great deal since I arrived in the Senate in \n1973. In 1973, there was still the myth that all a student needed was a \ngood high school education to have a clear shot at being able to make \nit. The statistics and the numbers and the story has been told over the \nlast 28 years that a college education is essentially becoming a \nprerequisite for having a clear shot at the middle-class dream of being \nable to own a home, afford a good education for your children, and to \nlive with some degree of financial certitude.\n  I will not take more time today, although when I do introduce this \nformally to a piece of legislation, I will speak much longer and in \nmuch more detail.\n  To summarize, I think it is the most noble of social purposes to seek \nto encourage families to spend money on educating their children and, \nparticularly at this stage, on higher education. People say to me: Joe, \n$120,000 is an awful lot of money for you to allow someone to have a \ntax advantage. You can have them make up to $120,000 and they still get \na benefit here.\n  The answer is yes. My inclination is to go higher. Try sending a kid \nto a private institution today and college. Try sending a kid to a \nschool that is not a State public institution. There are phenomenal \nState public institutions. I am not suggesting there aren't.\n  Take my alma mater, the University of Delaware. As an in-State \nstudent, you can get it done for somewhere around $13,000 room, board, \nand tuition. Send that same kid to the school my son attended, the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania and it is $35,000. Send them to Gettysburg \nCollege and it is $30,000 room, board, and tuition. The cost of \neducation is astronomical.\n  What I don't like to see happen, when you think about the incredible \ncost of education today and what we are developing, is basically a two-\ntiered education system. One of the greatest bills that ever passed was \nthe GI bill. The GI bill meant that Irish Catholic kids and inner-city \nkids and farm boys could go to Harvard and Yale and Princeton and to \nthe great ``universities'' out there. But now to go to those schools \nand every other school, many of which we haven't heard the names of, \nthere is very little possibility. The only choice a student has in a \nmiddle-class family is to be able to go to the State institution.\n\n  I went to the State institution. I am proud of having gone to the \nState institution. My wife graduated from the State institution. My \nwhole family went to the University of Delaware. I take a back seat to \nno one at any other university in terms of the education I received, \nbut I don't want to be in a position where, in fact, the only choice \nmiddle-class people have of sending their kids to college is at a State \nuniversity. I don't want this two-tiered system to reemerge.\n  If you get into one of the great universities, the prestige \nuniversities, they are endowed enough that if you have no money, you \nare likely to be able to get help. You will be able to get some aid \npackages to go. The people who get crunched are the people in the \nmiddle.\n\n[[Page S1009]]\n\n  I am delighted and pleased and I applaud the Georgetowns and the \nDukes and the Princetons and the Stanfords and the great universities \nout there that are the named universities for providing for the \neducation of moderate- and low-income people who otherwise qualify to \nget in. Very few get turned away because of that. The problem comes \nwith the quintessential middle-class family who makes what appears to \nbe a good income, has three kids going to college, and they lose that \noption. I don't think they should.\n  Mr. President, rather than take the time of the Senate, I will \nwithhold sending my amendment to the desk because I am not going to ask \nfor a vote on it now. I will speak to this in more detail later.\n  I thank the manager of the bill for allowing me the opportunity. I \nparticularly thank Senator Wellstone, who was here before me, for \nallowing me to precede him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2865\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n    report to Congress on the extent and severity of child poverty)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2865.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. REPORT TO CONGRESS REGARDING EXTENT AND SEVERITY \n                   OF CHILD POVERTY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than June 1, 2001 and prior to \n     any reauthorization of the temporary assistance to needy \n     families program under part A of title IV of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) for any fiscal year \n     after fiscal year 2002, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services (in this section referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall report to Congress on the extent and severity of child \n     poverty in the United States. Such report shall, at a \n     minimum--\n       (1) determine for the period since the enactment of the \n     Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation \n     Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193; 110 Stat. 2105)--\n       (A) whether the rate of child poverty in the United States \n     has increased;\n       (B) whether the children who live in poverty in the United \n     States have gotten poorer; and\n       (C) how changes in the availability of cash and non-cash \n     benefits to poor families have affected child poverty in the \n     United States;\n       (2) identify alternative methods for defining child poverty \n     that are based on consideration of factors other than family \n     income and resources, including consideration of a family's \n     work-related expenses; and\n       (3) contain multiple measures of child poverty in the \n     United States that may include the child poverty gap and the \n     extreme poverty rate.\n       (b) Legislative Proposal.--If the Secretary determines that \n     during the period since the enactment of the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n     1996 (Public Law 104-193; 110 Stat. 2105) the extent or \n     severity of child poverty in the United States has increased \n     to any extent, the Secretary shall include with the report to \n     Congress required under subsection (a) a legislative proposal \n     addressing the factors that led to such increase.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment--and I \nhope there will be a very strong vote for the amendment--is to call on \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to the Congress on \nthe extent and severity of child poverty in our country. I will make \nthe connection to education in a moment.\n  We need to have some critical information about the welfare bill \nbefore reauthorization. That is what this amendment says. We ask the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to provide this Congress with \ncritical information. The Congress has consented so far to allow \nwelfare reform to continue without an honest accounting of how our \nactions impact our Nation's children. Before we reauthorize this bill, \nwe need to know what has happened.\n  There is one missing ingredient when we talk about welfare, and that \nmissing ingredient is information. Let me quote from some of the most \nknowledgeable people who are doing research in this area. The National \nAcademy of Sciences convened a panel of leading researchers to evaluate \nthe data and methods for measuring the effects of welfare reform. This \nis basically a quote from their report:\n\n       The gaps in the data infrastructure for determining the \n     effects of welfare reform are numerous.\n\n  ``Numerous gaps in the data''--what does that mean? It means we have \nno understanding of what the effects of this legislation on the lives \nof people in our country--poor people, mainly women and children. The \ninformation is simply not collected, and we don't know because we don't \nask.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to understand the effect of this \nlegislation on child poverty before we reauthorize it. We need to know \nwhether or not it is true, as has been reported in the data, that \nactually we are seeing an increase in the poverty of the poorest of the \npoor children--those children in households with less than half of the \nofficially defined poverty income. We need to know what the gap is \nbetween the welfare bill and families working, and whether or not they \nare above the poverty level income, because the whole goal was to move \npeople to economic self-sufficiency. We need to know what, in fact, is \ngoing on with programs such as the earned-income tax credit, or food \nstamp assistance, or Medicaid, and how that has affected the lives of \npoor children in America.\n  We need to do some policy evaluation. Too many people--Republicans \nand Democrats and the administration--brag about the fact that the \nrolls have been slashed by 50 percent since 1994. But how can anyone in \ngood conscience use that as a measure of success alone? Reducing the \nrolls is easy. You just push people off the rolls, you close their \ncases, and you wish them good luck.\n  Reducing the rolls by half doesn't indicate whether or not we have \nreduced the poverty. The goal is to reduce the poverty of women and \npoor children in America. The question is whether or not people who \nhave been pushed off the rolls are working and at what kinds of jobs. \nAre they living-wage jobs? And the question is, What kind of child care \ndo they have for their children? Do they still have medical assistance, \nor are they worse off because they have been cut off of medical \nassistance? The question is, What about the additional services for \nthose families where maybe the single parent struggles with addiction, \nor maybe she has been battered over and over again and there needs to \nbe additional support before this woman and her family can move to \nemployment and decent wages. Are the support services being provided?\n\n  I think we have created a whole new class of working poor people in \nthis country. We have created a whole new class--unless we call for a \npolicy evaluation--of the ``disappeared.'' We don't know what is \nhappening. We have been unwilling to do any serious policy evaluation. \nGunnar Myrdal, the Swedish sociologist, once wrote that ignorance is \nnever random. We don't know what we don't want to do. Before we \nreauthorize the welfare bill and as we move forward on an education \npiece of legislation, I would ask the Senate to go on record calling \nfor an evaluation as to the effect of this legislation on poor children \nin our country.\n  Some would say: What are you doing, Senator Wellstone, calling for an \nevaluation on a welfare bill? This doesn't belong on an education bill.\n  If a child is living in poverty--and I try to stay very close to this \nquestion, as I care a great deal about what happens to poor children in \nAmerica--the preliminary reports I have seen indicate we now have more \nchildren living in households below the poverty level of income. We see \na deepening of poverty in children in our country.\n\n  I argue that if a child is sick, if a family has been cut off medical \nassistance--and please remember that Families USA, 6 months ago or so, \nissued a report that there are 670,000 people in our country today who \nno longer have medical assistance because of the welfare bill--I argue \nthat children don't do well in school when they do not receive adequate \ncare, when they are sick, when they have an illness, or when they have \ntooth decay or an abscessed tooth. It is very hard for children to do \nwell in school under those circumstances. I think we are sleep-walking \nin the Senate if we don't see any connection between how well children \ndo in school and the economic circumstances of their lives.\n\n[[Page S1010]]\n\n  We had a wonderful coalition gathering yesterday. Senators Kennedy \nand Specter are introducing antihunger legislation, of which I am proud \nto be an original cosponsor. If we have 30 million citizens in our \ncountry today with a booming economy who are ``food insecure,'' and if \ntoo high a percentage of those citizens are children, and if, in fact, \nwe have seen a dramatic decline in food stamp participation--and I will \nmarshal the evidence for this in a moment--and the Food Stamp Program \nwas the major safety net for children in this country, you had better \nbelieve I have this amendment on this bill, because when children are \nhungry, they don't do well in school.\n  May I repeat that. When children are hungry, they don't do well in \nschool. May I repeat the fact that we have dramatically slashed the \nfood stamp rolls and that many children who should be receiving food \nstamp assistance today are not receiving food stamp assistance. That is \nan important fact. We ought to do the policy evaluation. We ought to \nhave the courage to evaluate the impact of this welfare bill on poor \nchildren in America today.\n\n  In my State there is no longer any affordable rental housing. It is \nabsolutely unbelievable. Children are the fastest-growing segment of \nthe homeless population in our country today, and they end up having to \nmove four or five times during the school year. In many of the schools \nI visit in our State of Minnesota, especially in our cities, and I \nvisit one every 2 weeks, the teachers tell me it is hard for a third-\ngrader to do well when she is moved four times during a year because \nthe family can't find affordable housing. Don't tell me that doesn't \nhave any impact on how well a child performs in school. This is an \neducation bill being debated, so I have an amendment that deals with \nthe poverty of children in our country.\n  I argue that today, with an economy booming and an affluent country, \nwe have one out of every five children growing up poor in our country. \nUnder the age of 3, I believe it is closer to one out of every four; \nand under the age of 3, it is about 50 percent of children of color \ngrowing up poor in our country today, which is a national disgrace. I \nargue that poverty has everything in the world to do with education and \nwhether or not each and every child in America has the same opportunity \nto reach her full potential and his full potential, which is the \ngoodness of our country.\n  Challenging Senators today to vote for a policy of evaluation on the \nwelfare bill, so we can assess what is happening to poor children, is \nthe right thing to do on an education bill.\n\n  If we blindly accept the argument that the welfare ``reform\" is a \ngreat success because we have eliminated the rolls by 50 percent, we \nare guilty of turning our backs on the most vulnerable citizens in our \ncountry--poor children. And if we will not address the underlying \nproblems that deal with race--yes, race--and gender, and poverty, and \ninequality, and social injustice in our country today, it is all too \npredictable which children will come to kindergarten way behind and \nwhich children will fall even further behind, and, yes, which children \nwill fail these standardized high-stakes tests we give to show how \ntough we are and how rigorous we are, and which children will be held \nback, and which children will drop out of school, and which children \nwill wind up incarcerated in America today.\n  Don't move to table this amendment arguing that it has nothing to do \nwith education. No Senator should say, ``Senator Wellstone, I am going \nto table your amendment because your amendment deals with race, gender, \nand poverty of children in this country and that has nothing to do with \neducation.'' Today, 13 million children are growing up poor in our \ncountry with a booming economy.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider my amendment before we reauthorize \nthis welfare bill which will impact on children and the poverty of \nchildren.\n  Let me now discuss some recent studies.\n  According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Bob \nGreenstein, director, received the McArthur Foundation grant--I think \none of the genius grants--for the impeccable research he directs. More \nthan two-thirds of our States impose full-family sanctions, stopping \naid to children as well as parents. Nearly half of these States impose \na full-family sanction at the first instance of noncompliance. More \nthan one-fourth of all case closures in a number of States have been \nthe result of sanctions.\n  In other words, half of the people are off the welfare rolls. In many \ncases, the families have been sanctioned. That doesn't mean they are \nworking. It doesn't mean they have good wages or are doing well. They \nhave just been sanctioned. Then the question becomes, If in a lot of \nStates you have these sanctions, are the sanctions justified?\n  A recent Utah study found that three-quarters of the sanctioned \nfamilies had three or more barriers to employment, including a health \nor medical problem, lack of transportation, or lack of skills.\n\n  A Minnesota study concluded that sanctioned families were four times \nas likely as the caseload as a whole to report chemical dependency, \nthree times as likely to report a family health problem, and twice as \nlikely to report a mental health problem or domestic violence.\n  We should be worried about this. We should want to know what is going \non.\n  Finally, quite often the families who are subject to the sanctions \nmay have the greatest difficulty understanding the program, rules, and \nexpectations. Recent studies from South Carolina and Delaware document \nthat sanction rates are highest for those people with the least amount \nof education. The Delaware study also found that sanctioned individuals \nwere more likely to have trouble comprehending TANF rules and did not \nunderstand the consequences of noncompliance.\n  As a result of the welfare bill, more than 2.5 million poor families \nhave lost their benefits. That is a decline in the rolls of 50 percent. \nBut the number of people living in poverty in our country has held \nclose to the study. Many of these families have gone from being poor to \ngetting poorer, and most of the welfare recipients are children.\n  This is why I challenge Senators today. I do not know how any of you \ncan vote against this, colleagues. I am saying, before we do any \nreauthorization of this welfare bill, we ought to evaluate the impact \nof poverty on children.\n  Don't table this amendment because you cannot separate whether \nchildren are hungry, homeless, or whether there has been decent child \ncare before they get to kindergarten.\n\n  One study I cite should trouble Senator Reid and every Senator. It \nwas released by researchers at UC-Berkeley and Yale. They found that \nabout a million additional toddlers and preschoolers are now in child \ncare because of the changes in the welfare law. Mothers work. They are \nsingle parents. But these children, unfortunately, are in low-quality \nchild care, and therefore they end up lagging behind other children \ntheir age in developmental measures.\n  There was a study of nearly 1,000 single mothers moving from welfare \nto work, and they found that many of these children had been placed in \nchild care settings where they watched hours of television or wandered \naimlessly and had little interaction with their caregivers.\n  The result: These toddlers showed developmental delays. When asked to \npoint to one of three different pictures in a book, fewer than two out \nof five of the toddlers in the study pointed to the right picture \ncompared to the national norm of four out of five children.\n  One of the study's authors is quoted as saying, ``We know that high-\nquality child care can help children and that poor children can benefit \nthe most. So we hope this will be a wake-up call to do something about \nthe quality of child care in this country. The quality of day-care \ncenters is not great for middle-class families, but it is surprising \nand distressing to see the extent to which welfare families' quality \nwas even lower.''\n  Colleagues, we ought to know what is going on with this bill. If we \nare telling these mothers they have to work, that we are not looking at \nthe child care picture, and their children are in dangerous and \ninadequate child care centers and falling further behind \ndevelopmentally, shouldn't we know that? Don't we want to know the \nimpact? Can any Senator tell me that is of no consequence as to how \nwell these children do in school? Of course it is.\n\n[[Page S1011]]\n\n  I also want to point out that many of these families have been \nstigmatized. We have an additional problem. Again, I would like to see \nan analysis of this. But all too often, too many families don't even \nenter TANF. They do not know they have the right to receive assistance \nat the beginning, and, therefore, in this affluent economy we see a \nrise in the use of food banks and shelters. It is amazing. Everybody is \nclaiming success.\n  The 50-percent reduction in the welfare rolls has hardly reduced \npoverty. In many cases, children are poorer now than they were before. \nIn all too many cases families don't even know they are eligible to \nreceive this assistance, and they don't.\n  I will save some of my time in case there is a response to the \ndebate. But I want to talk about a report released yesterday by the \nNational Campaign for Jobs and Income. It is a new coalition of \nantipoverty groups.\n  They found a couple of results that are very distressing. In too many \ncases families are eligible still for medical assistance and food stamp \nassistance when they move from welfare to work, but at the local county \nlevel they are not told they are eligible. That is incredible. That \nis absolutely incredible.\n\n  Let me talk about Medicaid and what is happening under welfare \nreform.\n  Despite the creation of the State Child Health Insurance Program, \nCHIPS, which provide resources to States, the total number of low-\nincome children enrolled in Medicaid in the State CHIP program combined \nhas actually decreased in the 12 States with the largest number of \nuninsured children between 1996 and 1998.\n  A study in the January issue of Health Fairs found that 41 percent of \nthe women surveyed lacked health insurance one year after leaving \nwelfare. Forty-one percent of these women no longer have any coverage. \nTheir families don't have coverage. Only 36 percent of the women had \nbeen able to retain their Medicaid coverage. The same study found that \n23 percent of the women with children were also uninsured. Some were \nabout to keep their insurance. But 23 percent were uninsured one year \nafter losing welfare benefits.\n  I ask you to vote for an amendment that says we ought to do an \nevaluation of the impact of their welfare bill on the poverty of \nchildren. If 23 percent of the children one year after their mothers \nleave welfare no longer are covered and no longer have any health \ninsurance coverage, that is a serious consequence. We ought to \nunderstand that.\n  According to Families USA, two-thirds of a million low-income \npeople--approximately 675,000--lost their Medicaid coverage and became \nuninsured as a result of the welfare bill.\n  Families are losing Medicaid coverage under welfare reform because: \nNo. 1, they are basically not being told they are entitled to it at the \nlocal level.\n  No. 2, you have these complex rules, and it is very difficult for \npeople to know their rights. Legal immigrants, in particular, are \nespecially confused.\n  No. 3, antiquated computer systems. Most States rely on computer \nsystems that were designed for welfare programs, not Medicaid. As a \nresult, these systems produce letters that are technical and difficult \nto understand. When families are pushed off welfare right away they \ndon't even know they are entitled to medical assistance.\n  Now for the second set of disturbing facts. Sometimes facts make \nMembers uncomfortable--or they should make Members uncomfortable. \nAccording to the USDA, 30 million people live in a ``food insecure'' \nhouse; 40 percent of them are children; 12.5 million children are \n``food insecure''--that is another way of saying going hungry or \nmalnourished.\n  I have talked about all of the people who have been pushed off \nwelfare. According to a study by the USDA, more than one-third of those \neligible for the Food Stamp Program are not receiving the benefits. A \nGeneral Accounting Office report released last year found food stamp \nparticipation dropped faster than related indicators would predict.\n  Furthermore, GAO points out there is a growing gap between the number \nof children living in poverty, an important indicator of children's \nneed for food assistance and the number of children receiving food \nassistance. That food stamp participation dropped faster than related \neconomic indicators would indicate simply means we have hardly made a \ndent in reducing poverty. We have many poor children in the country. \nThe Food Stamp Program was the major safety net program for poor \nchildren in America and we have seen a dramatic decline in \nparticipation. Probably as many as 33 percent of the children should be \nreceiving the help, and they are not. Therefore, they are hungry, they \nare malnourished, and therefore they can't do as well in school. And no \nSenator's child could do well in school if their child went to school \nmalnourished or if their child was hungry.\n\n  These are not my opinions but that of good researchers. The Urban \nInstitute report found two-thirds of the families who left the Food \nStamp Program were still eligible for food stamps.\n  What is going on? We need a policy evaluation. A July 1999 report, \nprepared for USDA by Mathematics Policy Research, identified ``lack of \nclient information'' as the barrier to participation and pointed out \nthat many of these people who were not participating were not aware \nthey were eligible.\n  At the local level they are not being told. We have created such a \nstigma, we have done so much stereotyping and bashing of these poor \nwomen and children and the poor in America today, that it has filtered \ndown to the local level. Basically, at the local level people don't \neven know they have the right to get this assistance.\n  Much of this is happening at the same time the States are now sitting \non a $7 billion surplus of TANF money. Colleagues who were for the \nwelfare bill should be as concerned about this as I am. There were a \nnumber of States--Minnesota was one last year; not this year, I am \nhappy to say--that through a little of bit of accounting and juggling, \nused the TANF money for a tax rebate.\n  This is what we have: Families who are not being told they are \neligible for medical assistance, and they are; we have families not \nbeing told they are eligible for food stamp assistance, and they are; \nwe have a rise in the use of food shelters; we have hungry children in \nAmerica; we have many families who no longer receive medical assistance \n1 year after the welfare bill; we have the vast majority of the women \nno longer on welfare and still don't make even poverty wages; and we \nhave a whole group of other recipients and women who have severely \ndisabled children or they had children when they were children, who do \nnot have the skills development or have struggled with addiction, or we \nhave, unfortunately, a central issue of violence in the home, women who \nhave been battered over and over again. They need to have the support \nservices so they can move from welfare to work and be able to support \ntheir children in this prosperous economy.\n\n  The Governors came here and said, several years ago: Trust us, trust \nus, trust us.\n  Some States are doing good work. The Chair was a Governor of New \nHampshire. Some States are doing good work.\n  I can't believe they are sitting on $7 billion in TANF money, some of \nwhich could go into training, some of which could go into education, \nsome of which could go into the support services. That is what this was \nall about.\n  There is reason to be concerned. Not later than June 1, 2001, and \nprior to the reauthorization of this bill, let's call upon the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to make a report on the poverty \nof children in America and in particular on the welfare bill and how it \nhas affected the economic status of the children in these families.\n  The reason I offered this amendment is manyfold, but let me make it \ntwofold. First, there is disturbing evidence based upon reports that we \nare now seeing an increase of children who are among the poorest of \npoor in America. Second, there is disturbing evidence that very few of \nthese families have actually moved from welfare to escape poverty. \nThere is clear evidence that many of the families have now lost their \nmedical assistance and are worse off. In addition, there is clear \nevidence that many of these children and many of these families are \neligible for food stamp assistance, which is particularly\n\n[[Page S1012]]\n\nimportant in making sure that children don't go hungry, and they are \nnot being told about it.\n\n  The second reason I bring this amendment to the floor is I think \nthere should be an up-or-down vote. Members can't argue that this is \nirrelevant to the discussion at hand. The Yale-Berkeley study sends \nchills down my spine. There has also been a national report. I know \nthere was a New York Times article about it. What has happened with \nmany of these families is the mothers work, but all too often they have \nto leave at 6 by bus. It takes them 2 hours. There is not adequate \ntransportation. They don't have a car or they may live in a rural area. \nThey don't get home until 8 o'clock at night. The child care situation \nis frightening. A lot of the child care for these children is dangerous \nand inadequate, at best. These children should be valued as much as our \nchildren.\n  Colleagues, I wait for a response.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 28\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask my colleague from Georgia whether there is any \nresponse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I did not hear the Senator's question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Georgia, I \nreserve the remainder of my time. I have tried to make the following \narguments. I have tried to say there is disturbing evidence, outside \nreports that all may not be right with what is happening. Before we \nreauthorize this bill, we ought to have a policy evaluation of the \nimpact on poor children. Then I went on and tried to give examples. I \ncan repeat them if my colleague wants me to. It is in my head and my \nheart.\n  My second point has been I certainly hope this amendment will not be \ntabled because I think it has everything to do with education. I think \nit is terribly important.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 59 minutes. The Senator from \nMinnesota has 28 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It might be helpful to the Senator from Minnesota to \nknow I do not believe there will be a rebuttal to his amendment. It is \nmy intention to yield back our time at the appropriate moment.\n  I am unaware of anybody who has expressed to me an interest in \ndebating his amendment. If the Senator wanted to use the remainder of \nhis time, this would be the time to do it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I gather from what my colleague said \nthat means if there is not a rebuttal, there is going to be a good \nstrong vote for this amendment? Is that what my colleague is saying? \nThat would please me.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Anybody who predicts the legislative process is \nprobably the same person who gets his own attorney.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Is my colleague going to move to table?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes, I am.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia. Here \nis what I am concerned about now. I want to say this to the Senator \nfrom Georgia.\n  The background of this is, I have for the last 2 years, off and on, \nbeen trying to get a policy evaluation of the bill. This time I focused \non the poverty of children because I thought it was so important, so \nrelevant to education. I believe that. I think my colleague from \nGeorgia does.\n  I say to the Senator, he does not have to respond. We will see what \nthe House does. It is a tax bill. It may go to the President, and it \ncould very well be vetoed. If that happens, then I have to come back \nwith this amendment on another vehicle, but I certainly hope if we go \nto conference committee this amendment will not be dropped.\n  I am going to call for a record vote because I want everybody on \nrecord. What has happened in the past is I will come out and then it \nwill get dropped. First, we lost on a vote, a slightly different \namendment. Then the next one was dropped.\n  I know I speak with emotion about this, but I really do think it \nmakes sense before we reauthorize by 2001--before we reauthorize in \n2002, we ought to know what the impact is. I have presented a lot of \nstudies that should trouble all of us. I think it is terribly relevant \nto how well our children do.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia because he could have come out and \ntried to give this the back of his hand and tabled it. I appreciate the \nfact he did not. I do not think Senators should vote against this \namendment. What I hope is it will stay in conference committee. I make \nthat request to my colleague.\n\n  I have been on votes that have been 99-1, where I am the 1. \nObviously, I have not persuaded too many people. And then I have been \ninvolved in votes that are closer. If this is almost a unanimous vote \nor a unanimous vote, I would like Senators to know: You are on record. \nWhen we vote we are on record. I want Senators to know when you vote \nyou are on record saying it is important we have a thorough policy \nevaluation done of the effect of the welfare bill on children. We want \nto know if there has been a rise in the poorest of the poor children. \nWe want to know what the gap is between those families who are working \nand poverty-level income. Are they moving to economic self-sufficiency? \nWe want to know what has happened with other programs such as food \nstamp programs and why there has been such a drop in food stamp \nparticipation, way below the drop in poverty. We want to know what is \ngoing on. We want to know what is going on with child care. I am \ntroubled by all these reports about the dangers due to inadequate child \ncare for these children.\n  The way I look at it, I say to Senator Coverdell, the evidence is \nirrefutable that probably the most important thing any of us could do \nis try to make sure prekindergarten kids get the developmental child \ncare from parents--or whoever, if the parents work--so they come to \nkindergarten ready to learn and not way behind.\n  I want all Senators to know you are on record supporting this policy \nevaluation. I have been trying to do this for several years. I \nappreciate the support. It is not a small question. Children who are \nhungry do not do well in school. Children who receive no health care \ncoverage or dental care where they have an abscessed tooth and \ninfection do not do well in school. Children who have been in inferior \nprekindergarten situations, inadequate child care, do not do well in \nschool. Children who are homeless do not do well in school. And \nchildren who are among the poorest of the poorest of the poor citizens \nof this country, living in households at less than half the poverty-\nlevel income, do not do well in school.\n  I think it is important we get a handle on what it means that in the \nmost affluent country in the world, with an economy booming and record \nsurpluses, we have 12.5 million children who are ``food insecure.''\n  We can do better, and we will do better when we are willing to do an \nhonest evaluation as to what is happening.\n  I thank my colleague from Georgia. I take his support not as a sort \nof effort to trivialize this but as sincere support. It means a lot to \nme.\n  Before I yield the floor, I ask my colleague, I would like to have \nthe vote. I would like to have everybody on record. When would we be \nscheduling this vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is not a precise science we are \ndealing with here, but it is contemplated that we will move from the \nSenator's amendment to an amendment by Senator Hutchison of Texas, to \nan amendment by Senator Murray of Washington, and perhaps one other \nwhich is being discussed from Senator Roth, which is a managers' \namendment. Then all those would be voted on back to back. My guess is, \nif that is the general plan and it occurs that way--as the Senator \nknows, these things are sometimes subject to some modification--I think \nthat is a pretty good description of what is likely to happen and that \nwould probably happen around 5:30 or 6 o'clock. It is contemplated the \nSenator wants a vote on his amendment. It will be in that stacked \nseries of votes.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n[[Page S1013]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Georgia, what would be best \nfor Senators' schedules would be stacked votes, either later today or \nearly tomorrow morning; is that correct?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes. The purpose for that is we are trying to \nfacilitate people offering amendments, trying to keep it as near on \ntime as we were doing with the presentation of the Senator so people \ncan keep their schedules.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague from Georgia. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back his time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Is the Senator from Minnesota prepared to yield back \nhis time? I am prepared to yield back our time on the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield back our time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2860\n\n       (Purpose: To establish the Careers to Classrooms Program)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2860.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2860.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this amendment adds flexibility to our \nschool systems. I am working with Senator Jeffords and his committee, \nand Senator Leahy as well, on the ESEA reauthorization.\n  I wish to lay down the marker with this amendment because I think it \nis the key to what we are talking about. We are trying to give parents \nmore options for their children to make the choices that are best for \neach child.\n  One of the problems we have in high-needs schools across our country \nis that we do not have qualified teachers to teach subjects that will \nbenefit young people all over our country. It may be computer courses. \nIt may be language courses. Yet we have people who have had careers--\npeople in the military, people in corporations and businesses--who may \nbe proficient in French and they may live in an area where the school \nis not able to teach French because they do not have a qualified \nteacher. This would be a big benefit to the young people in that school \nsystem if they had that as an option. It may be the Russian language or \nthe Chinese language. It may be computer skills. It may be chemistry or \nbiology classes. There are so many areas, but they just are not teacher \nqualified.\n  My bill, which is called Careers to Classrooms, is being offered as \nan amendment to give more flexibility to the States by allowing them to \ngo to a high-needs school and give priority in that high-needs school \nto recruiting teachers.\n  My amendment also encourages a certification process that will bring \nthe teacher up to speed quickly. It is an expedited certification \nprocess so the teacher will not have to wait a whole year to go into \nthe classroom but can go through an expedited certification process by \nthat State.\n  It is important we replicate the programs that have succeeded. My \nCareers to Classrooms amendment replicates the Troops to Teachers \nProgram that has been in place and has been very successful. It uses \nretired military people who have experience in the military which they \ncan transfer to the classroom and enrich educational opportunities for \nour young people. This allows people in the private sector to do the \nsame.\n  This is similar, but not the same, as the Graham amendment. The \nGraham amendment goes toward the universities being able to have \nprograms. Mine is for the States to put these programs in place.\n  I urge the adoption of my amendment. I think it adds an enriching \nexperience for the classrooms, particularly in high-needs schools, \nwhether it be in an urban community that does not have access to \nteachers or in our rural areas.\n  I happen to know of a case involving a woman who was a French major \nin college. She had taught French in private schools. She moved to a \nsmall town in Texas where they wanted to offer French in the high \nschool. She wanted to teach it, but she could not because she did not \nhave the teacher certification.\n  This is made to order for this situation. This is a French language \nmajor who taught French in private schools and who wants to give this \nopportunity to a small Texas high school. I want her to be able to do \nthat because we know those students will be enriched by having that \noption.\n  I urge the adoption of my amendment. I hope we can offer this kind of \nenrichment to schools all over our country by giving the States this \noption.\n  Mr. President, I ask the distinguished manager of the bill if I can \nask approval of my amendment. Does he want a voice vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, if the Senator from Texas has completed \nher presentation on the amendment, my suggestion is that we set it \naside and move to other matters. We are trying to determine the \nsequence of amendments. Perhaps we can deal with the amendment either \non a recorded vote or perhaps we can secure a voice vote in the back-\nto-back management of this current series of amendments.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy to accommodate whatever works. Is my \namendment the pending amendment?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It is at the moment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, does the Senator want me to set it \naside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we may be able to clear this. We do not \nknow. I have to check with the Finance Committee as to how they feel \nabout this. It may be better to put this in the normal course of \namendments. If we can do this by voice vote, that will be great.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. What we are saying is we have not decided that yet. \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set aside \nfor the moment. We will proceed with business and return to it at the \nappropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am going to propound a unanimous \nconsent in just a moment. I see my colleague is wishing to make a \nremark or two, so I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Georgia, there are a \nnumber of meetings taking place tonight, one at the White House. What \nwe are trying to do is get things arranged so we can have votes \ncompleted in time for Senators to go to the White House for a \nbipartisan meeting. What we are trying to do is have Senator Murray \ntake the floor for her amendment at about 20 until 5. The majority will \nrespond to that. We will then begin a series of two and possibly three \nvotes, two recorded votes, maybe one voice vote. If we can't do the one \nby voice, that will be put over until tomorrow, so Members have an idea \nof what we are trying to do.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from Nevada. \nThey very appropriately characterize what is being attempted at this \npoint.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S1014]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nin relation to the Murray amendment on class size be divided with \nSenator Murray in control of 20 minutes and Senator Coverdell control \nof 10 minutes. I further ask consent that at 5:05 p.m. today the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relation to the Wellstone amendment No. 2865, to \nbe followed by a vote in relation to the Murray amendment regarding \nclass size. I further ask consent that no amendment be in order to the \namendments prior to the votes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, my only \nmodification would be that the vote will be at approximately 5:05. It \nmay not be exactly at that time because the time doesn't add up.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I so modify the request to say approximately 5:05 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. For the information of all Members, this agreement \nwould provide for the disposition of two additional amendments. It is \nhoped that the Hutchison amendment will be agreed to by a voice vote; \ntherefore, Members can expect two or three votes beginning at \napproximately 5:05 p.m. today.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, while we are waiting for the Senator \nfrom Washington to present her amendment, I thought I would take a \ncouple of minutes to talk about a certain section of this longstanding \ndebate.\n  The day before yesterday, the discussion of the core policy of this \npiece of legislation was that we would leave and not tax the interest \nbuildup on education savings accounts so that they would compound \nthemselves more quickly as an incentive for people to open the \naccounts. We are told it will probably result in 14 million people \nopening an account of this nature, and it will bear the parents of 20 \nmillion children, which is a little over a third of the entire \npopulation of children attending kindergarten through high school.\n  So the reach of the legislation we are debating and amending is very \nlarge. But in the discussion, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts referred \nto the fact that when you leave, you don't collect a tax. In his mind, \nthat is an expenditure; we didn't appropriate it necessarily, but by \nnot collecting that revenue we, in a sense, are appropriating money.\n  I find that a flawed theory. Under that context, every dime we do not \ntake from a working family or an individual belongs to the Government, \nand only by the grace of the Government have we allowed it to stay in \nthe family's checking account.\n  I won't say that is a convoluted theory, but it is certainly foreign, \nI believe, to the genesis of American liberty which envisioned the \nproceeds of the wages that are earned by families and individuals in \nour country as belonging to them--the people who earned it. Thomas \nJefferson warned us of Government's propensity to take too much from \nthe laborer who produced the wealth or the income.\n  So I thought I would take a minute or two to say that this Senator is \namong those who believe the wealth, the income, the paycheck belongs to \nthe person who earned it, and Government should only, by the most \nurgent necessity, tax and remove that resource and thereby lessen the \nability of that family or that individual to pursue their dreams and \ncare for their family and its vision.\n  This theory, which essentially is the view that everything that \neverybody produces belongs to us up here in Washington unless we just \nhappen to gracefully leave it in the family's checking account, is not \na healthy idea. And it has come up two or three times in the debate \nover these education savings accounts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I think under the previous order we \nwould hear from Senator Murray on her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2821\n\n        (Purpose: To provide for class size reduction programs)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2821.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senate is currently considering the \nRepublican education agenda. I have listened carefully to the debate \nover the last several days.\n  It seems to me the difference between the Democratic and Republican \napproaches couldn't be more clear. Democrats want to invest in policies \nthat really make a difference for today's young people. On the other \nside, we are hearing the same old song and dance about tax cuts, \nvouchers, block grants, and savings accounts. I fear those policies \nwill really weaken our public schools instead of strengthening them.\n  The education savings account bill we are considering today would \nonly help a very few wealthy families at the expense of everyone else. \nI urge my colleagues to reject it.\n  We should be spending our limited time on the policies that parents \nand teachers know work--things such as smaller classes taught by fully \nqualified teachers. Those are the policies that time and time again \nhave produced real results for our students --not tax schemes, not \nfunding gimmicks, not policies that will drain money away from our \npublic schools.\n  That is why I am here this afternoon to introduce my class size \namendment which will provide real help for students across the country.\n  These education savings accounts will only help a few people with \nvery high incomes. Unfortunately, families who aren't well off need \nmore incentives to save for education. And this bill doesn't offer them \nany. For the 90 percent of Americans whose children attend public \nschools, this bill offers peanuts.\n  The Joint Tax Committee found that the average benefit per child in \npublic school would be between $3 and $7 per year over a 4-year period. \nThis program is a backdoor voucher which will drain money away from our \npublic schools and take scarce resources from students who need them \nmost. All the while, this bill will do nothing to improve the quality \nof public education.\n\n  I know I am not the only person in America who thinks we should be \ninvesting in the things that we know work in education. A recent poll \nwas conducted for the National Education Association by two bipartisan \nresearch firms--a Democratic research firm and a Republican research \nfirm. It found that Americans want specific policies--policies such as \nproviding additional support for students with special needs, policies \nsuch as helping school districts attract quality teachers, and policies \nsuch as hiring 100,000 new, fully qualified teachers to reduce class \nsizes in our country. Those are some of the specific, concrete policies \non which the American people want us to focus.\n  In the same poll, the American public chose education as its No. 1 \npriority over tax cuts by a margin of two to one.\n  The bill on the floor today ignores the priorities the American \npeople are asking us to address.\n  As a former school board member, let me give my colleagues a real-\nlife opportunity to test this poll's funding.\n  Monday night, for many districts, is ``School Board Meeting Night'' \nacross the country. If my colleagues want to know what the education \npriorities are at home, all they have to do is attend a local school \nboard meeting. Senators will have the ability to see locally-\n\n[[Page S1015]]\n\nelected officials, respected community activists, parents, and students \ngather to discuss priorities and real problems.\n  School boards all across the country face very tough issues. I know \nwhat service on a school board is. I know what school boards are \ndealing with. They are grappling with class size, hiring quality \nteachers, deteriorating facilities, textbooks, curricula, and other \nissues.\n  I know what school boards are not dealing with. School boards are not \ndebating tax cuts and vouchers. School boards are not considering \ndiverting revenues from public schools to private schools. But that is \nwhat this bill would do.\n  This is the wrong education debate for our country. The right \neducation debate gives our students the tools and the support they need \nto reach their full potential. Every child in America deserves a well-\ntrained teacher and a small class size. When a student's hand goes up \nin the classroom, she should get the help she needs and the attention \nshe needs. That is why this Senate should pass this class-size \namendment.\n  I am offering this amendment for one reason--to continue the progress \nwe have made in classrooms across America for the last 2 years. As a \nformer teacher, I can tell you, it makes a difference if you have 18 \nkids in your classroom instead of 35. Parents know it, teachers know \nit, and students know it. By working together over the past 2 years, we \nhave been able to bring real results to students.\n  This year, 1.7 million students across the country are learning in \nclassrooms that are less crowded than the year before; 1.7 million \nstudents are in classrooms where teachers can spend more time teaching \nand less time dealing with discipline problems; and 1.7 million \nstudents are in classrooms where they can get the individual attention \nthey need and where they will learn the basics.\n  That is progress. But it is not enough. There are still too many \nstudents in overcrowded classrooms. So far, we have hired 29,000 new \nfully qualified teachers. My class size amendment will continue our \nprogress.\n  I recently visited a classroom in Takoma, WA, where they have taken \nour class size money and put it into their first grade classrooms. Now \n67 classrooms in that district have 15 students in the first grade. The \nteachers will say they know this is the first year they will be able to \nsay at the end of the year that every child in their first grade \nclassroom will be able to read. There will be direct results from this \nprogram we have passed the last 2 years. They could not make those \npromises with 30 kids in the classroom. They now can as a result of the \nwork we have done.\n  I wish to take a moment to go through the specifics of my amendment. \nThis amendment uses $1.2 billion to reduce class size, particularly in \nthe early grades, first through third, using highly qualified teachers \nto improve educational achievement for regular and special needs \nchildren.\n  This amendment targets the money where it is needed within the \nStates. Within States, 100 percent of the funds go directly to local \nschool districts on a formula which is 80 percent need-based and 20 \npercent enrollment based. Small school districts that alone may not \ngenerate enough Federal funding to pay for a new teacher may join \ntogether to generate enough funds to pay for a new teacher or to \ninstitute a top-notch recruiting program.\n  This amendment ensures local decisionmaking. Each local school \ndistrict board makes the decisions about hiring and training their new \nteachers. The school district must use at least 75 percent of the funds \nto hire new certified teachers.\n  This amendment promotes teacher quality. Up to 25 percent of the \nfunds may be used to test new teachers or to provide professional \ndevelopment to new and current teachers or of regular and special needs \nchildren. The program ensures that all teachers are fully qualified. \nUnder the amendment, school districts hire State-certified teachers so \nevery student will learn from a highly trained professional.\n  This amendment is flexible. Any school district that has already \nreduced class sizes in early grades, to 18 or fewer children, may then \nuse the funds to further reduce class sizes in the early grades, to \nreduce class size in kindergarten or other grades, or carry out \nactivities to improve teacher quality, including professional \ndevelopment.\n  The class size program is simple and efficient. School districts fill \nout a one-page form which is available online. The Department of \nEducation sends them the money to hire the new teachers based on need \nand enrollment.\n  Let me add that teachers have told me they have never seen money move \nas quickly from Congress to the classrooms as they have under our class \nsize bill.\n  Finally, this amendment ensures accountability. The amendment \nclarifies that the funds are supplementary and cannot replace current \nspending on teachers or teacher salaries. School districts fill out no \nnew forms to get the funding, they just add a description of their \nclass size reduction plan to a current form. Accountability is assured \nby requiring school districts to send a report card in plain English to \ntheir local community, including information about how achievement has \nimproved as a result of reducing class size.\n  Those are the specifics of my amendment. I know this amendment will \nhelp my students. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator from Washington leaves the floor, I say \nto her and Members of the Senate how much I appreciate her leadership \non this issue. She has been the voice speaking out on this issue time \nand time again. I think we in the Senate should listen to someone with \nexperience. She served in the school boards we hear so much about. Why \ndo we not do what the school boards want? That is what we are trying to \ndo. We are doing that through the voice of someone who has served on a \nschool board, who taught in preschool, who has been a voice on \neducation.\n  On behalf of the people of the State of Nevada, I express my \nappreciation to Senator Murray for leading the Senate down this road of \ntalking about the important matters that affect public education. That \nis what the debate should be: What can we do to provide a better \neducation for the more than 90 percent of children in America today who \ngo to public schools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I rise in opposition to the amendment. I wish to make \nseveral points. The first point is the Senator from Washington \ncharacterizes the education savings account as something that would \nonly benefit a handful of people who are wealthy. I believe that is \npretty close to what she said.\n  According to the Joint Tax Committee, 70 percent of those who would \nutilize the education savings account make $75,000 or less. This is not \nsomething for anybody driving around in a black limousine. It is wrong \nto characterize it otherwise.\n  The second point: the criteria for these educational savings accounts \nare identical to the President's criteria for the higher education \nsavings account. The same folks who use these savings accounts are the \nones who were applauded by that side of the aisle when they created a \nhigher education savings account. There is no difference. Every ``t'' \nis crossed and every ``i'' is dotted exactly the way it was done on the \nother side of the aisle. We cannot have it both ways. If they are not \nrich over here, they are not rich over here. The point is, the vast \nmajority of accounts are utilized by middle-class folks and low-income \npeople.\n  No. 2, this is the fourth attempt from the other side of the aisle to \ngut the creation of the education savings account. Who do they leave \nbehind? The 14 million American families, 20 million American children \nwho would save on their own $12 billion that would go to help \neducation. By simply cutting out the funds as the amendment of the \nSenator does, $1.2 billion, she robs the Nation of $12 billion in \nresources that would come freely from families investing in these \naccounts utilizing their own money. It is bad economic policy to leave \n$12 billion sitting on the table.\n  The Senator in her amendment strikes the provision that allows 1 \nmillion students in college to receive prepaid tuition in the 43 States \nthat do that, including her State, from their prepaid tuition being \ntaxed when they get it. We are trying to leave the resource there so it \ncan be used for the\n\n[[Page S1016]]\n\ncollege education. The amendment guts it.\n  Last, the proponents of the amendment, as is so often the case, say \nwe will do something for you. But read the language under ``use of the \nfunds.'' They are mandatory uses. It is a long series. If you want to \nplay ball with the Federal Government, you have to hopscotch through \nevery hurdle, every loophole, every this, every that, page after page, \nreports, qualifications--mandatory.\n  It is reinforcement of the entire concept of oversight by the big \nprincipal in Washington. That is not what America wants. It wants its \nschools governed at home.\n  Time is limited; we have 5 minutes remaining in our time. I see \nSenator Gregg of New Hampshire, and I yield the remainder of our time \nto Senator Gregg of New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia. I \nappreciate his hard work on this bill. He has certainly outlined most \neloquently the importance of these savings accounts to education and \nhow the dollars that will be going into the savings accounts will have \na multilayer effect and grow radically, thus increasing the opportunity \nfor more and more kids and more and more families to experience the \nAmerican dream of going to college. They are using these dollars for \nother educational activities.\n  I wish to speak specifically to the amendment of the Senator from \nWashington State. This amendment is misdirected. It has come to the \nfloor on a number of other occasions and it has been misdirected every \ntime it came to the floor. It has been put forward by the \nadministration as basically a polling amendment. I mean they went out \nand polled the term and then they concluded that term polled well so \nthey came forward with a program based on that term.\n\n  It does not have anything to do with quality education. Study after \nstudy has shown the issue of quality education is not tied directly to \nclass size. It is tied to the quality of the teacher in the classroom. \nIn fact, there was a recent study done which studied all the other \nstudies; 300 studies were looked at by Eric Hanushek of the University \nof Rochester. His conclusion was this, looking at 300 different studies \non this specific issue: Class size reduction has not worked; the \nquality of the teacher is much more important than class size.\n  Equally important to that issue is the fact this is a straw dog \namendment; 43 of the States in this country already are below what the \nPresident wants in class size ratio, 18-1. So the amendment really is \nnot for the purpose of reducing class size; it is for the purpose of \nputting out a political statement.\n  Let's do something about education. That is what the Republican side \nof this aisle wants to do. So we have come forward with something \ncalled the Teacher Empowerment Act. Rather than having Washington put a \nstraitjacket on the communities where they have to use this money for \none thing and one thing only, which is to hire new teachers--many \nschool systems not needing new teachers; what they really need is keep \nthe good teachers they already have and they are having trouble doing \nthat--rather than having this straitjacket from Washington delivered by \nthe Clinton administration and the Members on the other side of the \naisle, we said: Let's give the local communities the opportunity to \ngive them what they need, the Teacher Empowerment Act.\n  It says we will take the funds suggested by the Senator from \nWashington and put them in the proper vehicle, which happens to be the \nElementary and Secondary School Act, which is being marked up today, \nand we will allow those funds to be used by local communities to assist \nin addressing their teacher needs. They can use it for teacher \neducation; they can use it for paying good teachers more money to keep \nthem there in the school system; they can use it to send teachers out \nto get better qualifications and more certification or, if they want, \nthey can use it to hire teachers to reduce class size.\n  We give the local school system a series of options, which is exactly \nwhat should happen. We in Washington should not be saying to every \nschool system in America that in order to get these funds it has to add \nanother teacher because that may not be what the local school system \nneeds. There are numerous school systems in this country that have \ngreat teachers that they are losing because the tremendous demand of \nthe marketplace is taking those teachers out of the school system and \nputting them in the private sector, especially in the math and science \nareas. So what that school system needs is the ability to pay them a \ndifferential, pay them a little more money. This gives them that \noption.\n  The Republican proposal is a logical proposal. It is a proposal that \naddresses the needs of the school systems, the needs of the principals \nin the school systems, the needs of the superintendents in the school \nsystems and, most important, the needs of the teachers in the school \nsystems and the needs of the parents whose children those teachers \nteach, rather than addressing some polling data that happens to make a \nnice political statement but ends up straitjacketing the local \ncommunities and the parents and teachers in those local communities.\n\n  That is the difference. To begin with, the Coverdell bill is the \nwrong place for this amendment. The amendment is bad to begin with, as \nI just noted, and I noted why it is bad, but it has no place in this \nbill. We are in the process of marking this specific issue up in \ncommittee. In fact, today we heard from the Senator from Washington; we \nheard from the Senator from Massachusetts as to how class size was \ngoing to be one of the two essential issues they intended to raise in \nthe committee as we marked up the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct. That is very appropriate. That is where the debate should occur.\n  In that bill already is the TEA bill, the Teacher Empowerment Act. \nThey don't like it because it gives freedom to local school districts \nand they want to keep control in Washington. I can understand that is \ntheir political philosophy, but that debate should occur in the \ncommittee of jurisdiction on the bill appropriate to the issue. It \nshould not occur on this bill, which is a bill to expand and empower \nparents and kids so they can go to college, so they can pursue other \ntypes of educational excellence activities.\n  The Coverdell idea is a superb idea and it certainly should not be \nmucked up, the water should not be discolored as a result of putting \nout what is basically a proposal that has no relevance to this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time is left on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will just take a few minutes to wrap up and then I can \nyield my time. A number of Senators want to vote. They have other \nbusiness to do.\n  Let me respond to the Senators from Georgia and New Hampshire. The \nSenator from New Hampshire is correct. We are in markup on the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act in committee. Unfortunately, we \njust gave political speeches this morning and were not able to offer \nour amendments and go through that process. I know the committee \nintends to do that, but the majority decided what was going to be on \nthe floor today--their education policy. This is what we are debating. \nThis is our opportunity as Democrats to say what we believe is \nimportant.\n  We believe clearly that we have a choice. We can take very important \nFederal resources and offer them to families who are wealthy enough to \nput $2,000 away and get $3 to $7 back in a tax cut, or we can use that \nmoney for programs that we know work.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire indicated he did not believe class \nsize reduction worked. Let me tell you two things, Mr. President. First \nof all, a very important study that was completed, a STAR study from \nTennessee, that followed kids in the early grades, first through third \ngrade, in small classes, and then watched their progress until they \ngraduated a year ago, clearly found students in small classes, as we \nare asking this money to go for, had fewer discipline problems, \ngraduated with higher scores in math\n\n[[Page S1017]]\n\nand English, and in much greater numbers went on to college.\n\n  What Member of this Senate has not been out here to say those are \ngoals every one of us has: Better discipline and higher scores in math \nand English and higher rates of students going on to college? That is \nclearly a goal for all of us in public education. It is the STAR study \nand other studies that have shown it works.\n  We are saying if we want to provide this money, we should do it for \nprograms that work for kids. The mandatory provision the Senator from \nGeorgia spoke to in the bill is, I believe, 13 lines long and merely \nsays what this money goes for is for class size reduction with a \nquality teacher in every classroom. It provides some of those funds for \ntraining those teachers because that is a critical issue. I absolutely \nagree.\n  Finally, let me say from a personal perspective, having been in a \nclassroom as a teacher with a large class and a small class, I can tell \nyou what the difference is. The difference between the large class and \nsmall class is the difference between crowd control and teaching; \nhaving the time to work individually with students, to understand what \ntheir needs are, to help them get through the difficult processes of \nlearning in the early grades: Reading, writing and math. Those are very \nbasic skills that a child needs to have.\n  It is very clear to me we have a choice between a few families in \nthis country who can afford to put away several thousand dollars a year \nand only get $3 to $7 back--a very few families--or we can use this \nmoney in a way that absolutely makes a difference in early grades for \nour children.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and ask them to \nseriously consider what education policies we believe are important for \nfamilies across this country. I believe reducing class size, providing \nquality teachers, making sure our schools are safe, are important \ncriteria and a responsibility for us at the Federal level, to work in \npartnerships with our State and local school boards to make sure every \nchild in this country--every child, not just a few--is able to learn to \nread and write and be a success.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support Senator Murray's amendment to \nprovide $1.2 billion dollars to help reduce class size in the early \ngrades by hiring 100,000 new teachers. The Coverdell bill does nothing \nto help improve public schools that need assistance. Instead it diverts \nscare resources to wealthy families in private schools, when 90% of the \nnation's students attend public schools.\n  Research has documented what parents and teachers have always known \nintuitively--smaller classes improve student achievement. In small \nclasses, students receive more individual attention and instruction. \nStudents with learning disabilities are identified earlier, and their \nneeds can be met without placing them in costly special education. In \nsmall classes, teachers are better able to maintain discipline. Parents \nand teachers can work together more effectively to support children's \neducation. We also know that overcrowded classrooms undermine \ndiscipline and decrease student morale.\n  Project STAR studied 7,000 students in 80 schools in Tennessee. \nStudents in small classes performed better than students in large \nclasses in each grade from kindergarten through third grade. Follow-up \nstudies show that the gains lasted through at least eighth grade, and \nthe gains were larger for minority students.\n  STAR students were less likely to drop out of high school, and more \nlikely to graduate in the top 25% of their classes. Research also shows \nthat STAR students in smaller classes in grades K-3 were between 6 and \n13 months ahead of their regular-class peers in math, reading, and \nscience in grades 4, 6, and 8. Michigan, California, Nevada, Florida, \nTexas, Utah, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Oklahoma, Iowa, Minnesota, \nMassachusetts, South Carolina, and Wisconsin have initiated or \nconsidered STAR-like class size reduction efforts.\n  In Wisconsin, the Student Achievement Guarantee in Education program \nis helping to reduce class size in grades K-3 in low-income \ncommunities. A study found that students in the smaller classes had \nsignificantly greater improvements in reading, math, and language tests \nthan students in bigger classes. The largest achievement gains were \namong African-American boys.\n  In Flint, Michigan, efforts over the last three years to reduce class \nsize in grades K-3 have produced a 44% increase in reading scores and \nan 18% increase in math scores.\n  Because of the Class Size Reduction Act, 1.7 million children are \nbenefitting from smaller classes this year. 29,000 were hired with \nfiscal year 1999 funds. 1,247 are teaching in the first grade, reducing \nclass sizes from 23 to 17. 6,670 are teaching in the second grade, \nreducing class size from 23 to 18. 6,960 are teaching in the third \ngrade, reducing class size from 24 to 18. 2,900 are in grades 4-12. 290 \nspecial education teachers have been hired. And, on average, 7% of the \nfunds are being used for professional development for these new \nteachers.\n  The Boston School District received $3.5 million this year to reduce \nclass size. As a result, Boston was able to hire 40 new teachers, \nreducing class size from 28 students to 25 in the first and second \ngrades.\n  In Mississippi, Jackson Public Schools used its $1.3 million federal \ngrant to hire 20 new teachers to reduce class size in 1st grade \nclassrooms from 21 to 15, and in 2nd and 3rd grade classrooms from 21 \nto 18.\n  In New Hampshire, the Manchester School District received $634,000 \nand was able to hire 19 new teachers in grades 1-3, particularly in its \nEnglish as a Second Language and special education programs, reducing \nthe average class size from 28 students to 18.\n  In Ohio, the Columbus Public School District has hired 58 fully \ncertified teachers with funds from the class size reduction program, \nand placed these teachers in 14 high-poverty, low-performing schools, \nreducing class size in grades 1 to 3 from 25 to 15. Along with proven-\neffective reading programs such as Success for All, class size \nreduction is a central part of efforts by the City of Columbus to \nimprove low-performing schools.\n  Senator Murray's amendment is an important amendment which deserves \nthe Senate's consideration, and I urge the Senate to approve it. The \nnation's children and the nation's future deserve no less.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2865\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. By a previous unanimous consent agreement, I believe \nthe order of business is to move to the Wellstone amendment for a vote. \nHave the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2860\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I believe the next order of business is \nthe Hutchison amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Hutchison \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2860) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the Mack-Hatch amendment No. 2827 and that following the \nreporting by the clerk, the Senate proceed to a period for morning \nbusiness with Members permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  I further ask consent that the Senate resume the pending bill at 9:30 \na.m. on Thursday and that there be 30 minutes equally divided in the \nusual form, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Mack-Hatch \namendment. I ask that no second-degree amendments be in order prior to \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. In light of this agreement, there will be no further \nvotes this evening and the first vote tomorrow will occur at 10 a.m.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for information purposes, it is my \nunderstanding in the morning we will do the Hatch amendment. It is my \nfurther understanding after that we will move to the Roth amendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes, I have the consent request I will read.\n  Mr. REID. That is fine.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I further ask consent that following the disposition \nof the Hatch amendment, Senator Roth or his designee be recognized in \norder to call up the Roth amendment. I also ask consent that \nimmediately upon reporting of the amendment, Senator Graham of Florida \nbe recognized in order to offer a second-degree amendment relating to \noffsets.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be a total of 30 minutes equally \ndivided in the usual form with respect to both amendments. Finally, I \nask that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed \nto a vote on or in relation to the Graham amendment, to be followed by \na vote on or in relation to the Roth amendment, as amended, if amended.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask that \nthere be a number assigned to the Roth amendment. Do we have a number \non that? Is this the one that is going to be offered for the purpose of \nsubstituting original text? We want to make sure if, in fact, the Roth \namendment is adopted the legislation remains amendable.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. There is no intent to alter that plan.\n  Mr. REID. My only other suggestion is that the time be 1 hour equally \ndivided. We believe we can do it more quickly, but at this time, there \nis a request for more time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It says 30 minutes for each amendment. Does the \nSenator want to make it an hour for each one?\n  Mr. REID. I believe 30 minutes for each amendment will be adequate, \nbut let's cover the phone call we just received.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I modify the unanimous consent request \nto read according to the request of the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Also, Mr. President, we will have no objection, but for the \ninformation of Senators, especially those on my side, following the \ndisposition of the Roth amendment, as amended by Graham, we are going \nto move to the Boxer amendment, the Feinstein-Sessions amendment, and \nthereafter, we will probably move to either the amendment of Senator \nDorgan or Senator Kennedy or Senator Schumer. We have their amendments \nlined up. The first two will be Boxer and Feinstein. We should be able \nto move through the next amendments in the next day or two.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. In conjunction with the Senator's question about the \nRoth amendment, I think this language will clarify it. And with respect \nto the Roth amendment, if agreed to, it will be considered as original \ntext for the purpose of further amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2827\n\n    (Purpose: To eliminate the marriage penalty in the reduction in \n  permitted contributions to education individual retirement accounts)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am saddened to come to the floor this \nafternoon to speak about a tragedy that occurred yesterday in my home \nState of Michigan.\n  Yesterday morning, in room No. 6 at Buell Elementary School in Mount \nMorris Township near Flint, a first-grade student allegedly shot and \nkilled his young classmate, Kayla Rolland.\n  We don't yet know all the facts about how the first-grader gained \naccess to the handgun or whether the shooting was accidental or \nintentional. We do know, however, that one girl lost her young life in \nthis tragedy and the children at Buell Elementary are scared\n\n[[Page S1019]]\n\nand confused and their parents deeply concerned.\n  Although grief counselors and social workers are at the elementary \nschool now and will work their hardest to help these children \nunderstand and cope with the trauma, there is really no amount of \ncounseling that can replace the innocence these children have lost.\n  The class of 22 students who witnessed the shooting is looking for \nanswers and so are most of the rest of us. How can we make sense of \nthis tragedy and the apparent relative ease with which a 6-year-old \nbrought a 32-caliber semiautomatic handgun to school?\n  It is impossible to come to terms with this or any of the other \nshooting tragedies in this country that claim the lives of 12 children \non the average each day. Yet always after a tragedy such as this one, \nwe ask ourselves if it could have been prevented. The answer is a \nresounding yes. Congress can and must work to keep guns out of the \nhands of children.\n  It has now been almost 1 year since the deadly shooting at Columbine \nand still Congress has done nothing to help prevent these school \nshootings.\n  Lori Mizzi-Spillane, a Michigan coordinator of the Million Mom March, \nan organization advocating for stricter Federal firearms laws, asks in \nher words, ``What is it going to take now for people to wake up?''\n  What will it take for us to ``wake up'' and pass legislation \nrequiring firearms to be sold or transferred with storage or safety \ndevices? What will it take for us to ``wake up'' and pass child access \nprevention legislation which would require that adults store firearms \nsafely and securely in places that are reasonably inaccessible to \nchildren? Together, both Houses must enact these and other commonsense \ngun safety reforms that will keep our young people alive.\n  We should also note that the semiautomatic handgun that was \nreportedly used by the 6-year-old is a Saturday-night special, or junk \ngun, manufactured by one of the same companies that recently filed for \nbankruptcy protection to evade claims for damages caused by their \nproduct.\n  Earlier this year, I offered an amendment to the Bankruptcy Reform \nAct to prevent gun manufacturers from tactically using bankruptcy laws \nto evade accountability. That amendment would have held those companies \nresponsible if they produced unsafe products and distributed those \nproducts negligently. The amendment did not pass, and the gun industry \ncontinues to be the only industry explicitly exempted from Federal \nhealth and safety regulations. As a result, many of the guns \nmanufactured today lack even the most basic kind of safety devices. We \nshould repeal this privileged position of gun manufacturers and also \nrequire that all firearms are personalized or child-proofed so they \ncannot be fired by unauthorized users.\n  I extend my thoughts and my prayers to Kayla's family, and I know I \ndo on behalf of every Member of the Senate. No family should have to \nsuffer what this family has suffered in the last 2 days and what they \nwill continue to suffer as long as they live. We will work ever harder \nto reduce the toll of gun violence for all the children of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/01/senate-section/article/S1019-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1019-S1020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONSERVATION AND REINVESTMENT ACT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, most certainly I hope the cameras can \nget a great shot of this beautiful poster. It says: Parks and \nrecreation: The benefits are endless. This is a picture of a Little \nLeague team. I do not exactly know from which State they hail, but it \nis from one of our great States. This is a team; and you can tell they \nare having a lot of fun.\n  To me and many of us who are working on a very important \nenvironmental bill, this poster represents something that is absolutely \nessential for our country today and is something that has been a joy to \nwork on in this Congress and something on which we are making such \nprogress.\n  Besides a great education for kids, we also have to give them a place \nto grow up and ball teams to belong to. It builds character and it \nteaches them how to work together and how to be productive.\n  Really, life is a lot about teamwork. We learn that in the Senate. We \nlearn it in classrooms. We also learn it on ball fields all over this \ngreat country and around the world.\n  I want to take a moment, if I can, to say a couple words about a bill \nintroduced last night by a group of us. I thank Senators Trent Lott, \nFrank Murkowski, John Breaux, and Dianne Feinstein for being \ncosponsors. Senator Evan Bayh indicated to me a few minutes ago he is \nanxious to join with us; and also Senator Campbell mentioned his \ninterest. I am sure there will be many who support us as the word gets \nout about this particular bill. It is S. 2123 that was filed. It is the \nexact version of a bill that was worked out in a great compromise in \nthe House about the ways we should reinvest our oil and gas revenues to \nprovide for the expansion and full funding of our land, water, and \nconservation funds, which would fund thousands of opportunities such as \nthis for the children I just mentioned.\n  It would fund significantly our wildlife conservation programs in \nthis country, not necessarily dictated from Washington but actually \ndecisions made at the State and local levels where, with regard to game \nand nongame species, special methods can be used; one size doesn't fit \nall.\n  Significant to my State of Louisiana as a producing State, this \nparticular bill would provide some significant resources to address the \ngreat coastal needs of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, but also \nof New Jersey, California, Washington, and all of our coastal States, \nincluding our Great Lakes States. Whether we drill or not--and there \nare no incentives for drilling--it will be a great resource to help \nrestore our coastlines, help stop the erosion, and help preserve \nwetlands in this Nation and our State of Louisiana, which represents \nover 60 percent of the coastal wetlands in the United States, and 40 \npercent of the commercial fisheries, the habitat of which rests in \nthese wetlands. So it is a tremendous treasure.\n  This bill was introduced along with others we have before our \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources. I thank the growing number \nof Senators who have stepped up to the plate to try to help us pass \nwhat is arguably the most important conservation and environmental bill \nin the last 100 years.\n  To my friends who are concerned about more acquisition of Federal \nland, I will share a few thoughts from Don Young, who has been the \nleader on the House committee, who has been a champion of private \nproperty rights, a champion of the outdoors. They joked earlier today \nthat he carries a knife. I guess it is OK in the House because he has \none. If worse comes to worst, he may use it to help get this bill \npassed. I think that is probably going too far. But trust me, he is an \noutdoorsman from Alaska; he knows about private property rights.\n\n  He says the bill we are debating, S. 25, and also this new bill, S. \n2123, which reflects the compromise he and Congressman Miller from \nCalifornia worked out, would actually improve the position of Western \nStates that are concerned that perhaps this bill gives even more money \nto purchase land because, in fact, any administration can do that, and \nright now some administrations have done it without much oversight from \nCongress.\n  This bill provides the proper partnership and balance between the \nadministration and Congress. This bill gives the appropriators and the \nauthorizing committee the authority and encourages them to actually \nmake the decisions about what lands will be purchased. In addition, \nwhat I think is so right about what Chairman Don Young says, is that \nour environmental efforts need to be about much more than just \nacquiring more land; we have to take care of the land we already own. I \nthink the Chair would agree with that. That is what the bill does.\n  I reach out to my colleagues from Western States, many of whom have \nsupported this effort, many of whom have other concerns and have \nhesitated so far with their endorsement, to ask them to really look at \nwestern values within the Conservation and Reinvestment Act piece that \nis being circulated and really look at what an improvement this bill \noffers over the current status quo.\n  My last point is actually a word to the White House and to the \nPresident,\n\n[[Page S1020]]\n\nfirst to thank the President for his leadership in lands legacy. He has \na tremendous idea about trying to leave a great legacy. Of course, he \nhas done many good things in his time as President for these 8 years. \nHe has been a leader in the environmental effort. I so appreciate that; \nmany of us do.\n  I thank him for laying down a mark on lands legacy but urge him to \nconsider that this piece of legislation is permanent in nature. It is \nbroader than the vision he has outlined. And it is an improvement. It \nbrings in the East and the West, the North and the South. It helps \nurban areas and rural areas because we have added urban parks and \nhistoric preservation. There have been some great improvements \ndemonstrated through the development of this piece of legislation.\n  I thank him for his great leadership, acknowledge the work of many \npeople in the White House, but urge them to embrace the concept that is \nnow supported by over 300 Members in the House. We have a growing \nnumber of Members in the Senate to pass this bill now.\n  Some people think we can't afford it. If we can't afford to take $2 \nbillion, which our bill is calling for, out of arguably a $3 trillion \nsurplus--if you want to take Social Security completely off the plate, \nwhich I want to do, and give very conservative estimates, it leaves us \nwith about $800 billion to allocate. We can do it through some tax \ncuts, which I support, reasonable and targeted. We can do strategic \ninvestments in education. But there is one investment I know, besides \neducation, the American people want us to make. That is preserving land \nthat is lost every hour and every minute, preserving parks for these \nchildren, preserving opportunities to hunt and fish, to take your \ngrandchildren to the pond outside of your farm or down the road or \nacross the State line to spend a weekend in the woods.\n\n  I am positive people in Louisiana and all over America want us to act \nnow. Ten years is too late. Next year is too late. My question is, if \nwe can't afford to take this money now, which in my opinion should not \nbe going into the Federal Treasury because it is taxes from a resource \nthat is depleting--we should not be using it in our operating expenses \nanyway because one day, probably in my lifetime, these oil and gas \nwells will be dried up--why do we not take this opportunity in the dawn \nof this new century to take some of this money and give it back to our \nkids and our grandkids in ways that are responsible and meaningful and \nfor something that is permanent.\n  In conclusion, I know many people will thank us for passing this \nbill, but the most important group will be our grandchildren. We will \nbe proud that we did it.\n  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues, Republican and \nDemocrat, to get this bill out of committee, passed on the floor, and \nbe there for the signing when the President will enthusiastically \nembrace what we have done to improve his lands legacy approach to \nprovide security for Western Senators, to provide urban help to our \nurban areas, and to do it in a way that is very fair to all parts of \nthe country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a document in the \nRecord entitled ``Western Values Within the Conservation and \nReinvestment Act of 1999.''\n  There being no objection, the document was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Western Values Within the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999 \n                                 (CARA)\n\n\n                               background\n\n       For decades, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has made \n     $900 million available for state and federal land \n     acquisition. State acquisitions are driven by a state \n     planning process and states and local governments are \n     responsible for their own plans and receive direct funding \n     (matched 50/50) based upon a formula. Since fiscal year 1995, \n     the states have not received funding from the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund.\n       For federal acquisitions, any amount (up to $900 million) \n     may be spent on Federal land acquisition as appropriated \n     through the annual Congressional appropriations process. \n     There are virtually no restrictions with this process and \n     almost $300 million has been historically appropriated to \n     purchase new federal lands. In a recent year, nearly $700 \n     million was used to buy private lands.\n\n\n      how does cara change this process to protect western values?\n\n       1. By making permanent and dividing (between the state and \n     federal portions) the $900 million within the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund, we require the federal government to share \n     half of the LWCF funds with the states to be spent on locally \n     selected projects.\n       2. Each year the Administration must transmit a list to \n     Congress requesting specific approval for each tract of land \n     to be acquired.\n       3. Congress must specifically approve each project.\n       4. The Administration must seek to consolidate federal land \n     holdings in states with checkerboard Federal land ownership \n     patterns.\n       5. The Administration must seek to use exchanges and \n     conservation easements as an alternative to acquisition.\n       6. The Administration must notify Congress (within the \n     annual request required by CARA) if tracts are identified for \n     acquisition from non-willing sellers.\n       7. Transactions will be carried out with willing sellers, \n     because CARA prohibits the government from using adverse \n     condemnation to acquire lands--unless specifically authorized \n     by Congress.\n       8. The Administration must demonstrate, to Congress, its \n     authority to carry out the federal acquisition.\n       9. 30 days after the submission of the LWCF acquisition \n     request (new CARA requirement), the Congressional \n     representatives, the Governor, and local government official \n     must be notified.\n       10. 30 days after the submission of the LWCF acquisition \n     request (new CARA requirement), the local public must be \n     notified in a newspaper that is widely distributed to the \n     area in which the proposed acquisition is to take place.\n       11. Prior to the federal purchase of lands, all actions \n     required under Federal law must be completed.\n       12. Prior to the federal purchase of lands, a copy of the \n     final NEPA documents must be given to Congress and the \n     Congressional representatives, the Governor, and local \n     government officials must be notified that the environment \n     work is complete and the documents are available.\n       13. CARA requires just compensation for the taking of \n     private property, as provided within the Constitution.\n       14. CARA protects State water rights.\n       15. CARA provides $200 million annually for maintenance.\n       16. CARA provides up to $200 million in additional funding \n     for PILT and Refuge Revenue Sharing.\n       17. CARA will provide the necessary funds to reduce the $10 \n     billion backlog of willing sellers stuck within an inholding.\n       18. Restricts the federal governments regulatory ability \n     over all private lands.\n       19. CARA prohibits funding for wildlife law enforcement.\n       20. If revenues for CARA fall, all titles and programs are \n     reduced proportionally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/01/senate-section/article/S1020-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1020-S1021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the extremely generous and thoughtful gift for the education \nof our nation's children that was announced today by the Bill and \nMelinda Gates Foundation. Although relatively young, the Foundation \nalready has a track record of making significant contributions for the \nsharing of new technologies and improving the educational opportunities \nof all our children. For example, in 1999, Bill and Melinda Gates \nprovided $1 billion to establish the Gates Millennium Scholars program, \nwhich will provide scholarships for academically talented minority \nstudents who would otherwise not have the financial resources to attend \ncollege.\n  Today, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will announce a new gift \nof approximately $350 million, and more than $200 million of this gift \nwill be directed to Washington state schools and districts. This gift \nis comprised of a series of grants that are designed to raise academic \nstandards and help all students meet those standards.\n  The grants are broken into two elements. The first is a series of \ngrants for the development state, district, school and classroom \nleadership. Our educators are doing an outstanding job teaching our \nchildren. This funding, however, will give our teachers even more \nsupport and enhance their education which will in turn improve the \neducation of our students. This series of grants consists of $100 \nmillion for state challenge grants for Leadership Development, $45 \nmillion for the Teacher Leadership Project, and $25 million for \nnational teacher training and teacher quality initiatives.\n  The second series of grants will encourage the development of model \nschools and districts. Throughout our state, educators and school \nadministrators have hundreds of innovative and creative ideas to \nimprove education. With this funding, educators can turn\n\n[[Page S1021]]\n\ntheir ideas into reality and implement new solutions and ways to teach. \nThis series of grants consist of the $30 million Washington State \nSchool Grant Program which will serve approximately 140 schools, and \nthe $150 million School District Grant Program which includes $50 \nmillion for 10-11 districts in Washington State.\n  Finally, the Foundation is providing the Seattle School District with \na $26 million grant that will assist the district in its use of \ntechnology to help students meet Washington state's challenging \nacademic standards.\n  I'm sure my colleagues join me in thanking Bill and Melinda Gates for \ntheir significant and considerate contribution to education. I know \nthat current and future generations of students will benefit greatly \nfrom this gift. The education of our children is the key to the success \nof our country and the Gateses have given all of our students an even \ngreater chance of succeeding.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to share with my colleagues some \ngreat education news for schools in Washington state and around the \ncountry. Today, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced a \nnationwide commitment to provide $350 million over three years to help \nstudents succeed in the classroom.\n  As a former educator in Washington state, I'm especially pleased that \nmore than $200 million dollars will go to Washington state classrooms. \nThis generous contribution will put money where we know it will make a \ndifference: helping all students achieve by developing strong \nleadership skills in our teachers and administrators.\n  As we work here in the Senate on our national education policy, \ntoday's announcement is a reminder that educating our children is a \nteam effort--and there are important roles for federal, state, and \nlocal officials, as well as businesses, nonprofit organizations, and \nindividuals.\n  For years, the people I represent have seen first-hand the generosity \nand sense of community that Bill and Melinda Gates possess. Their \nfoundation has worked to vaccinate poor children against diseases, to \nbring computers to libraries across the country, and to provide \nscholarships to talented minority students. We in Washington state have \nknown about it since the beginning, and I'm proud that today, the whole \nnation gets to see it--and benefit from it.\n  I couldn't be more proud of the Gates Foundation on this special \noccasion and can't wait to see the many ways this will improve \neducation for millions of students.\n  As we begin our work to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, I hope that this major announcement serves to remind us \nthat local school districts--on their own--don't have all the resources \nthey need. Individuals have a role to play as mentors, volunteers and \ncoaches. Charitable foundations have a role to play, and the federal \ngovernment also has a role to play.\n  I hope the Senate will follow the important and thoughtful example \nset by the Gates Foundation to do our best to give all students the \nresources and the tools they need to reach their potential.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/01/senate-section/article/S1021-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNITION OF THE ``FROM THE TOP'' PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to announce the winner of my \n33rd Innovation in Education Award. This award goes to a national group \nsponsored by Boston Public Radio titled ``From the Top.'' I learned \nabout this program when I attended a ``From the Top'' performance in \nSpokane on January 29th. Two students from Washington state, Stephen \nBeus of Othello and Justin Mackewich of Vancouver, participated in the \nconcert and I was amazed by their technique and their immense talent. I \nwas delighted to see such outstanding students excelling in the arts \nand am pleased to award Stephen and Justin and recognize this \nexceptional program.\n  Both Stephen and Justin are very gifted musicians. I was amazed by \nStephen's skill at the piano and the Four Seasons Quartet that Justin \nplayed in was astounding. I hope to attend more of their concerts in \nthe future.\n  ``From the Top'' consists of a series of public radio performances, \ntaped in front of live audiences. These performances have been given \nacross the country in places like Boston, New York City, Sarasota, \nFlorida, and St. Paul, Minnesota. The concept for ``From the Top'' is \nto highlight the performances of exceptional, pre-college age, \nclassical musicians. Indeed, their performances make a ``From the Top'' \nconcert a remarkable experience.\n  An additional positive impact of ``From the Top'' is that it provides \nan arena for people of all ages to enjoy classical music. In today's \nmodern world, we must take the time to enjoy the classics and encourage \nour youth to value the great symphonies and music from the past. ``From \nthe Top'' is an excellent source for all ages and walks of life to \nlearn more about classical music.\n  Each week, I give an ``Innovation in Education'' Award to individuals \nor groups within the education system who make outstanding \ncontributions to the education of our children. I believe that ``From \nthe Top'' gives our students exposure to the arts that provides an \ninvaluable enrichment to any child's upbringing. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in recognizing the great contributions of ``From the \nTop''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/01/senate-section/article/S1021-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in honor of Leap Day, which was yesterday, \nI am going to vary my regular format.\n  It is estimated that 200,000 people in the United States were born on \nFebruary 29th. While these individuals may not share their birthdays \nwith their families and loved ones every year, they do share--every \nyear--in the less than desirable Federal debt like the rest of us.\n  Since 1970, the Federal debt has leapt remarkably--reaching \n$5,735,333,348,132.58 (Five trillion, seven hundred thirty-five \nbillion, three hundred thirty-three million, three hundred forty-eight \nthousand, one hundred thirty-two dollars and fifty-eight cents) at the \nclose of business yesterday, February 29, 2000.\n  The previous Leap Day, February 29, 1996, the Federal debt stood at \n$5,016,041,000,000 (Five trillion, sixteen billion, forty-one million) \nwhich reflects a debt increase of more than $700 billion--\n$719,292,348,132.58 (Seven hundred nineteen billion, two hundred \nninety-two million, three hundred forty-eight thousand, one hundred \nthirty-two dollars and fifty-eight cents) during the past four years.\n  Today, Mr. President, each citizen's share of the Federal debt is \n$20,727.13. Translating this figure into the amount that Leap Day \ncitizens owe, the figure becomes $4,145,426,000.00 (Four billion, one \nhundred forty-five million, four hundred twenty-six thousand). This \namount may not seem like a lot, but it is when you consider it is only \nenough to pay down four days worth of the interest on the Federal debt.\n  Mr. President, I wish my Senate colleagues to note how tragic it is \nthat our country's debt leaps with more frequency than the years do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/01/senate-section/article/S1021-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1021-S1022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           TRIBUTE TO VETERANS OF THE U.S. NAVY ASIATIC FLEET\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nheroism and sacrifices of the sailors and marines who served in the \nU.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet.\n  The Asiatic Fleet established itself as one of the premier assets of \nthe United States Navy during its years of operation. Officially \ncommissioned by the Navy in 1910, The Asiatic Fleet's origins can be \ntraced back to 1845, when the United States first established a naval \npresence in the Far East. The United States established the Asiatic \nFleet to protect American interests in the western Pacific. The sailors \nand marines of the Asiatic Fleet ensured the safety of United States \ncitizens and foreign nationals and provided humanitarian assistance in \nthat region during the Chinese civil war, the Yangtze Flood of 1931, \nand the outbreak of Sino-Japanese hostilities. The increasing risks \nfaced by U.S. military personnel serving in this region were \nhighlighted by the accidental bombings and sinking of a U.S. Navy \ngunboat belonging to the Asiatic Fleet, the U.S.S. Panay, in \ninternational waters by Japanese aircraft in 1937--four years before \nthe U.S. entered World War II.\n\n[[Page S1022]]\n\n  Following the declaration of war against Japan, the warships, \nsubmarines, and aircraft of the Asiatic Fleet singly or in task forces \ncourageously fought many naval battles against a superior Japanese \narmada. General Douglas MacArthur evacuated most U.S. military \npersonnel and equipment from the region to prevent them from being \ndestroyed by Japan's military forces, leaving the Asiatic Fleet alone, \nwithout reinforcement, to do what it could to obstruct the Japanese \nadvance. During these battles, the men of the Fleet discovered that \nmuch of their equipment was defective. It has been estimated that one \nin three of the Asiatic Fleet's torpedoes, and one fifth of its anti-\naircraft ammunition, were duds. Forced to rely on World War I-era \nequipment, the Asiatic Fleet directly suffered the loss of 22 ships, \n1,826 men killed or missing in action, and 518 men captured and \nimprisoned under the worst of conditions. Many of those who survived \nlater died while being held as prisoners of war. The Asiatic Fleet \nceased to exist as a cohesive fighting force on March 1, 1942, when its \nflagship, the U.S.S. Houston, was sunk by the Japanese near Indonesia.\n  Unfortunately, the heroism of the sailors and marines of the Asiatic \nFleet are largely unknown to the American public. Today, March 1, 2000, \nthe 58th anniversary of the Houston's sinking, I want to commend the \nbravery, resourcefulness and sacrifices of all who served in the United \nStates Navy Asiatic Fleet from 1910 to 1942, especially those sailors \nand marines who put their lives in harm's way during the first few \nmonths of America's participation in World War II. No words can \nadequately express our nation's debt to its veterans, and it is \nessential that we provide them with the thanks and recognition they \nhave earned. The American people should always remember the courage and \ndetermination displayed by the personnel of the Asiatic Fleet, honoring \nthe sacrifices they made in defense of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/01/senate-section/article/S1022-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING THE U.S. COAST GUARD'S ROLE IN THE SUCCESS OF GREAT LAKES \n                                SHIPPING\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the men and \nwomen of our U.S. Coast Guard. In particular, I salute the crew of the \nUSCGC Mackinaw for their work, which ensures the full utilization of \nthe navigation season in my state, and the Great Lakes region as a \nwhole.\n  Mr. President, the ice that forms on the Great Lakes rivals that \nfound anywhere in the continental United States. Even in a normal \nwinter, ice six to eight feet thick will develop in the connecting \nchannels. Windrows, chunks of ice piled atop one another by the wind, \neasily can reach 15 feet in height. Navigation under such conditions \nhas been possible only because the Coast Guard's icebreaking forces are \nled by the Mackinaw. The icebreaker is capable of generating 10,000 \nshaft horsepower, and is wide enough--75 feet--to clear a track for \nGreat Lakes vessels. Furthermore, the Mackinaw is crewed sufficiently \nto stay on station for days on end.\n  Annually, more than 10 million tons of iron ore, 4 million tons of \ncoal, 1.5 million tons of stone, and 500,000 tons of cement are shipped \nacross the Great Lakes. The iron ore, coal, stone, and Seaway trades \ngenerated nearly 14 billion tons of cargo during the 20th century. That \ncommerce could not have been accomplished as safely and efficiently as \nit was without the assistance of the U.S. Coast Guard, and especially, \nthe Mackinaw.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/01/senate-section/article/S1022-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTERNATIONAL ABOLITION DAY\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I rise to mark \nInternational Abolition Day. This day marks the occasion in 1847 when \nthe state of Michigan became the first English-speaking territory in \nthe world to abolish capital punishment. As one of the first acts \nfollowing conferral of statehood on Michigan, the Michigan legislature \nabolished the death penalty for all crimes except treason. I note, with \ntongue and cheek and with all due respect to my distinguished \ncolleagues from Michigan, that the date marking International Abolition \nDay probably should be 1853, when my great state, the state of \nWisconsin, became the first state to abolish the death penalty for all \ncrimes. Wisconsin has been death penalty-free for nearly 150 years. It \nis clear that the people of the Midwestern states have shown great \ncourage and leadership on this issue since almost the birth of our \ngreat Nation.\n  Mr. President, International Abolition Day is a day to remember the \nvictims and survivors of violent crimes perpetrated by individual \ncriminals. But it is also a day to remember those killed by state-\nsponsored executions. And it is a day for education and discussion of \nalternatives to the death penalty.\n  Just as the people of Michigan over 150 years ago learned the painful \nreality of the fallibility of our criminal justice system and \nconfronted the death penalty's main use, as a tool of vengeance, people \nthroughout the United States today are beginning to question their \nlongstanding support for the death penalty. On January 31, Governor \nRyan effectively imposed a moratorium on executions in Illinois until a \nstate panel can examine the administration of the death penalty and why \nso many innocents have sat on Illinois' death row. In a recent Gallup \npoll, even though a majority of Americans still support the death \npenalty, support for the death penalty is at a 19-year low. And when \nasked whether Americans prefer the death penalty or life imprisonment \nwithout the possibility of parole, support for the death penalty drops \neven further.\n  These are just some of the many positive developments that have \nnurtured the reawakening of the American conscience to the great \nresponsibility and stain that state-sponsored executions place on our \nsociety. I look forward to the day when our federal government and the \n38 states with the death penalty will recognize the adequacy of \nsentencing alternatives and abolish this barbaric punishment for all \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/01/senate-section/article/S1022-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SPARKMAN HIGH SCHOOL PARTICIPATION IN THE ``WE THE PEOPLE . . .

Mr. President, on May 6-8, 2000 more than 1200 \nstudents from across the United States will be in Washington, D.C. to \ncompete in the national finals of the ``We the People . . . The Citizen \nand the Constitution'' program. I am proud to announce that a class \nfrom Sparkman High School from the city of Harvest will represent my \nhome state of Alabama in this national event. These young scholars have \nworked diligently to reach the national finals and through their \nexperience have gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the \nfundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy.\n  The ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution'' program \nis the most extensive educational program in the country developed \nspecifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights. The three-day national competition is modeled after \nhearings in the United States Congress. These hearings consist of oral \npresentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges. \nThe students testify as constitutional experts before a congressional \ncommittee, that is, the panel of judges representing various regions of \nthe country and a variety of appropriate professional fields. The \nstudent testimony is followed by a period of questioning during which \nthe judges probe students for their depth of understanding and ability \nto apply their constitutional knowledge. Columnist David Broder \ndescribed the national finals as ``the place to have your faith in the \nyounger generation restored.''\n  The student team from Sparkman High School is currently conducting \nresearch and preparing for the upcoming national competition in \nWashington, DC. I am extremely proud of the students and teacher and \nwish them the best of luck at ``We the People'' national finals. I look \nforward to greeting them when they visit Capitol Hill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/01/senate-section/article/S1022-4", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1022-S1023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT MICHAEL SULLIVAN\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and say \nfarewell to an outstanding Naval Officer and fellow Arizona citizen, \nLieutenant Michael Sullivan, who has served with distinction for the \npast eighteen months in the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs. It is \na privilege for me to\n\n[[Page S1023]]\n\nrecognize his many outstanding achievements and to commend him for the \nsuperb service he has provided to the U.S. Senate and to our great \nNation as a whole.\n  Lieutenant Sullivan is a graduate of my alma mater, the United States \nNaval Academy. I had the great honor of addressing his class at his \ngraduation in May 1993. Similar to myself, academic honors had eluded \nhim but the standards at the Naval Academy are such that simply \nsurviving the four years reflects great credit upon his ability and \ndedication. When it was his turn to walk across the stage, he shook my \nhand and exclaimed, ``Go Navy and Go Arizona!'' I shared in his \nenthusiasm and we embraced in a bear hug as I handed him his diploma.\n  Lieutenant Sullivan proceeded to Surface Warfare Officer School in \nNewport, Rhode Island, before reporting to the U.S.S. Fife (DD-991) \nwhich was forward deployed to the U.S. Seventh Fleet in Yokosuka, \nJapan. On Fife be served as the Auxiliaries Officer and Fire Control/\nStrike Missile Systems Officer. Following that arduous tour, he \nreported to the U.S.S. Antietam (CG-54) as the Combat Information \nSystems Officer. Among his notable accomplishments, he distinguished \nhimself in 1997 by being named a Commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. \nPacific Fleet Junior Officer Shiphandler of the Year. In July 1998, \nLieutenant Sullivan joined the Navy's Senate Liaison team and helped \nthe Senate ensure that our Navy remained the best trained, best \nequipped, and best prepared Naval force in the world.\n  Mr. President, Lieutenant Sullivan represents the very best of \nAmerica's most precious resource--her youth. With being a commissioned \nofficer come responsibilities so immense and so important that the \nlives of all Americans and the welfare of much of the world will be \ndirectly affected by how well they discharge them. I have every \nconfidence that Lieutenant Sullivan will continue to acquit himself \nwith distinction. As he now departs for the next of many more tours at \nsea, I call upon my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to wish him \nfair winds and following seas.\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and say \nfarewell to an outstanding Naval Officer and fellow Arizonian, \nLieutenant Michael Sullivan, who has served with distinction for the \npast year and a half years in the Navy's Senate Liaison Office on \nCapitol Hill. It is a privilege for me to recognize his many \noutstanding achievements and to commend him for the superb service he \nhas provided this legislative body, the Navy, and our great Nation.\n  Lieutenant Sullivan comes from a patriotic family. His grandfather \nwas a submariner during World War II and his father is a Navy veteran \nof the Riverine Force in Vietnam. The Sullivan Family lived in the \nBronx, New York before moving to the great state of Arizona. Lieutenant \nSullivan attended elementary and middle public schools in Scottsdale \nand ultimately graduated from Saguaro High School. He was attending the \nUniversity of Arizona, and I was still a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, when he applied for the most privileged of \nresponsibilities I have as a Member of Congress--making a nomination \nfor appointments to the U.S. Service Academies. It was with great pride \nthat I had submitted his name to attend the United States Naval Academy \nwhere he graduated and earned his commission in 1993.\n  Lieutenant Sullivan joined the Navy's Senate Liaison team in July \n1998, following successful sea tours on board the U.S.S. Fife (DD-991) \nand the U.S.S. Antietam (CG-54). During his service as a Navy Liaison \nOfficer he provided members of the Senate and our personal staffs with \ntimely support and accurate information on Navy plans, programs, and \nconstituent casework. He has helped us maintain the best trained, best \nequipped, and best prepared Navy in the world.\n  Mr. President, Lieutenant Sullivan has served proudly with a \ndedication and enthusiasm that only comes from our Nation's best and \nbrightest. Lieutenant Sullivan is a great credit to both our Navy and \nour country. As he now departs for Department Head School and his next \nsea tour, I call upon my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to \nwish him the best for a continued brilliant Navy career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/01/senate-section/article/S1023-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:44 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1749.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Congressional Budget Office currently estimates \n     that the Government will have a $23,000,000,000 nonsocial \n     security surplus (on-budget surplus) in fiscal year 2000;\n       (2) Government spending in fiscal year 2000 will increase \n     faster than the rate of inflation for a total of over \n     $1,750,000,000,000;\n       (3) Government publicly held debt in fiscal year 2000 will \n     be reduced by over $150,000,000,000, yet debt held by the \n     public will remain in excess of $3,450,000,000,000 and cost \n     over $200,000,000,000 in annual interest payments;\n       (4) Government revenues in fiscal year 2000 will be 20.3 \n     percent of the Gross Domestic Product, which is the highest \n     level since World War II; and\n       (5) nearly 40,000,000 citizens currently rely on social \n     security and medicare, yet as more Americans retire over the \n     next decade, these programs will begin running deficits and \n     jeopardize their retirement.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to ensure that \n     the fiscal year 2000 on-budget surplus is used to reduce \n     publicly held debt.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2127\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Protection Act of \n     2000''.\n\n      SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Television is seen and heard in nearly every United \n     States home and is a uniquely pervasive presence in the daily \n     lives of Americans. The average American home has 2.5 \n     televisions, and a television is turned on in the average \n     American home 7 hours every day.\n       (2) Television plays a particularly significant role in the \n     lives of children. Figures provided by Nielsen Research show \n     that children between the ages of 2 years and 11 years spend \n     an average of 21 hours in front of a television each week.\n       (3) Television has an enormous capability to influence \n     perceptions, especially those of children, of the values and \n     behaviors that are common and acceptable in society.\n       (4) The influence of television is so great that its images \n     and messages often can be harmful to the development of \n     children. Social science research amply documents a strong \n     correlation between the exposure of children to televised \n     violence and a number of behavioral and psychological \n     problems.\n       (5) Hundreds of studies have proven conclusively that \n     children who are consistently exposed to violence on \n     television have a higher tendency to exhibit violent and \n     aggressive behavior, both as children and later in life.\n       (6) Such studies also show that repeated exposure to \n     violent programming causes children to become desensitized to \n     and more accepting of real-life violence and to grow more \n     fearful and less trusting of their surroundings.\n       (7) A growing body of social science research indicates \n     that sexual content on television can also have a significant \n     influence on the attitudes and behaviors of young viewers. \n     This research suggests that heavy exposure to programming \n     with strong sexual content contributes to the early \n     commencement of sexual activity among teenagers.\n       (8) Members of the National Association of Broadcasters \n     (NAB) adhered for many years to a comprehensive code of \n     conduct that was based on an understanding of the influence \n     exerted by television and on a widely held sense of \n     responsibility for using that influence carefully.\n       (9) This code of conduct, the Television Code of the \n     National Association of Broadcasters, articulated this sense \n     of responsibility as follows:\n       (A) ``In selecting program subjects and themes, great care \n     must be exercised to be sure that the treatment and \n     presentation are made in good faith and not for the purpose \n     of sensationalism or to shock or exploit the audience or \n     appeal to prurient interests or morbid curiosity.''.\n       (B) ``Broadcasters have a special responsibility toward \n     children. Programs designed primarily for children should \n     take into account the range of interests and needs of \n     children, from instructional and cultural material to a wide \n     variety of entertainment material. In their totality, \n     programs should contribute to the sound, balanced development \n     of children to help them achieve a sense of the world at \n     large and informed adjustments to their society.''.\n       (C) ``Violence, physical, or psychological, may only be \n     projected in responsibly handled contexts, not used \n     exploitatively. Programs involving violence present the \n     consequences of it to its victims and perpetrators. \n     Presentation of the details of violence should avoid the \n     excessive, the gratuitous and the instructional.''.\n       (D) ``The presentation of marriage, family, and similarly \n     important human relationships, and material with sexual \n     connotations, shall not be treated exploitatively or \n     irresponsibly, but with sensitivity.''.\n       (E) ``Above and beyond the requirements of the law, \n     broadcasters must consider the family atmosphere in which \n     many of their programs are viewed. There shall be no graphic \n     portrayal of sexual acts by sight or sound. The portrayal of \n     implied sexual acts must be essential to the plot and \n     presented in a responsible and tasteful manner.''.\n\n[[Page S1026]]\n\n       (10) The National Association of Broadcasters abandoned the \n     code of conduct in 1983 after three provisions of the code \n     restricting the sale of advertising were challenged by the \n     Department of Justice on antitrust grounds and a Federal \n     district court issued a summary judgment against the National \n     Association of Broadcasters regarding one of the provisions \n     on those grounds. However, none of the programming standards \n     of the code were challenged.\n       (11) While the code of conduct was in effect, its \n     programming standards were never found to have violated any \n     antitrust law.\n       (12) Since the National Association of Broadcasters \n     abandoned the code of conduct, programming standards on \n     broadcast and cable television have deteriorated \n     dramatically.\n       (13) In the absence of effective programming standards, \n     public concern about the impact of television on children, \n     and on society as a whole, has risen substantially. Polls \n     routinely show that more than 80 percent of Americans are \n     worried by the increasingly graphic nature of sex, violence, \n     and vulgarity on television and by the amount of programming \n     that openly sanctions or glorifies criminal, antisocial, and \n     degrading behavior.\n       (14) At the urging of Congress, the television industry has \n     taken some steps to respond to public concerns about \n     programming standards and content. The broadcast television \n     industry agreed in 1992 to adopt a set of voluntary \n     guidelines designed to ``proscribe gratuitous or excessive \n     portrayals of violence''. Shortly thereafter, both the \n     broadcast and cable television industries agreed to conduct \n     independent studies of the violent content in their \n     programming and make those reports public.\n       (15) In 1996, the television industry as a whole made a \n     commitment to develop a comprehensive rating system to label \n     programming that may be harmful or inappropriate for \n     children. That system was implemented at the beginning of \n     1999.\n       (16) Despite these efforts to respond to public concern \n     about the impact of television on children, millions of \n     Americans, especially parents with young children, remain \n     angry and frustrated at the sinking standards of television \n     programming, the reluctance of the industry to police itself, \n     and the harmful influence of television on the well-being of \n     the children and the values of the United States.\n       (17) The Department of Justice issued a ruling in 1993 \n     indicating that additional efforts by the television industry \n     to develop and implement voluntary programming guidelines \n     would not violate the antitrust laws. The ruling states that \n     ``such activities may be likened to traditional standard \n     setting efforts that do not necessarily restrain competition \n     and may have significant procompetitive benefits. . . Such \n     guidelines could serve to disseminate valuable information on \n     program content to both advertisers and television viewers. \n     Accurate information can enhance the demand for, and increase \n     the output of, an industry's products or services.''.\n       (18) The Children's Television Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-\n     437) states that television broadcasters in the United States \n     have a clear obligation to meet the educational and \n     informational needs of children.\n       (19) Several independent analyses have demonstrated that \n     the television broadcasters in the United States have not \n     fulfilled their obligations under the Children's Television \n     Act of 1990 and have not noticeably expanded the amount of \n     educational and informational programming directed at young \n     viewers since the enactment of that Act.\n       (20) The popularity of video and personal computer (PC) \n     games is growing steadily among children. Although most \n     popular video and personal computer games are educational or \n     harmless in nature, many of the most popular are extremely \n     violent. One recent study by Strategic Record Research found \n     that 64 percent of teenagers played video or personal \n     computer games on a regular basis. Other surveys of children \n     as young as elementary school age found that almost half of \n     them list violent computer games among their favorites.\n       (21) Violent video games often present violence in a \n     glamorized light. Game players are often cast in the role of \n     shooter, with points scored for each ``kill''. Similarly, \n     advertising for such games often touts violent content as a \n     selling point--the more graphic and extreme, the better.\n       (22) As the popularity and graphic nature of such video \n     games grows, so do their potential to negatively influence \n     impressionable children.\n       (23) Music is another extremely pervasive and popular form \n     of entertainment. American children and teenagers listen to \n     music more than any other demographic group. The Journal of \n     American Medicine reported that between the 7th and 12th \n     grades the average teenager listens to 10,500 hours of rock \n     or rap music, just slightly less than the entire number of \n     hours spent in the classroom from kindergarten through high \n     school.\n       (24) Teens are among the heaviest purchasers of music, and \n     are most likely to favor music genres that depict, and often \n     appear to glamorize violence.\n       (25) Music has a powerful ability to influence perceptions, \n     attitudes, and emotional state.

A bill to create incentives for private sector research \nrelated to developing vaccines against widespread diseases and ensure \nthat such vaccines are affordable and widely distributed; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n              vaccines for the new millennium act of 2000\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nVaccines for the New Millennium Act of 2000. I have the honor of being \njoined by the distinguished chairman of the Africa Subcommittee, \nSenator Frist, and my friend, the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray. \nThis bill addresses a catastrophic problem that needs our immediate \nattention.\n\n[[Page S1027]]\n\n  The proportions of the AIDS calamity in Africa are stupefying. More \nthan 33 million people are infected with HIV--95 percent of them in \nsub-Saharan Africa. This disease will kill more than 2.5 million this \nyear. It has already orphaned 11 million children, and it will orphan \n40 million by 2010. These numbers are incomprehensible. To put in \nperspective, nearly 60 people will become infected with HIV in the time \nit takes me to testify today.\n  In addition, tuberculosis will kill close to 2 million this year, and \na person dies from malaria every thirty seconds. No nation--but \nparticularly ours--as rich as we are in talent, technology and money--\ncan fail to help turn this around.\n  We should remember: borders do not matter when you are dealing with \ncontagion.\n  These epidemics are out of control. And if we are to reverse this \ndeath spiral, we need to institute bold new measures. We must provide \nnew global health infrastructures which look at long-term solutions for \ndisease eradication. And, until they are established, we must provide \nmuch-needed short-term financing for disease prevention and treatment.\n  Mr. President, a number of my colleagues have shown great leadership \nin trying to find a solution to the health emergencies in the \ndeveloping countries.\n  I applaud the work of my friend, Senator Durbin with whom I have \njoined on a number of bills this year. I also recognize and support the \nefforts of Senator Boxer and Senator Smith for their work on the Global \nAIDS Plan. Senator Moynihan and Senator Feingold also have an important \nplan to prevent vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child. I \nhave supported all these plans.\n  Mr. President, I think we need to acknowledge the scope of this \nepidemic requires a bold response which looks beyond just preventing \nand treating this disease. The epidemiology of this disease dictates \nlifetime adherence to preventive measures. I am fully supportive of \nprevention programs--I have seen their very positive effect in the AIDS \nAction Committee in Boston and in AIDS Project Worcester. The Outer \nCape also has a tremendous program which I support every year in \nProvincetown and these are echoed in small towns across Massachusetts \nwhich have accessed CDC grants and instituted the absolute best of \ncommunity-based programs. I have also been an early and consistent \nsupporter of the Ryan White program which comes up for reauthorization \nthis year.\n  But, Mr. President, we need a vaccine--for the United States and for \nthe developing world.\n  Vaccines are the most cost-effective weapon in the arsenal of modern \nmedicine to stop the spread of contagious disease, and they offer a \nrelatively inexpensive means of lowering a society's overall cost of \nmedical care. Prime examples of the success are the three million \nchildren whose lives are saved each year as a result of early childhood \nimmunizations against diphtheria, polio, pertussis, tetanus, measles, \nand tuberculosis.\n  Mr. President, consider the alternatives we have now. Pharmaceutical \nproducts, like the highly touted antiviral ``cocktail'' for treating \nAIDS patients can cost, on average, as much as $15,000 a year. That is \na princely sum for even wealthy countries but clearly, for nations with \nper capita incomes of $700 or $800 like Malawi, such treatments and \ndrugs are nowhere in the real of affordability. They also require \nenormous infrastructure investments and medical compliance which is \ndifficult to adhere to in this country let alone developing societies.\n  For these nations, finding an affordable vaccine for AIDS is really \nthe only option that offers them an opportunity for gaining control \nover the AIDS epidemic.\n  Unfortunately, of the $2.4 billion or so spent on overall AIDS \nresearch last year, only a fraction was spent on AIDS vaccine research.\n  The World Bank estimates that perhaps between $280 million and $350 \nmillion was spend worldwide on finding a vaccine for AIDS in 1999, or \nsomewhere between 10 and 15 percent of the total amount spent on AIDS \nresearch.\n  Furthermore, of the $300 million or so spent on HIV vaccine research, \nless than $50 million came from private sector research and development \nbudgets. Simply put, our biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries do \nnot believe that investing in AIDS vaccine research is a good \ninvestment.\n  So, Mr. President, we have a responsibility, an obligation, to change \nthis perception. Investing in an AIDS vaccine is one of the best \ninvestments we as a nation can make. And for Africa, it is the only \nhope for survival.\n  And while continued and expanded investments in our research engines \nare vitally important--I am referring to AIDS research at the National \nInstitutes of Health--the time has come for us to explore additional \nstrategies for stimulating private sector AIDS vaccine research and \ndevelopment.\n  We must look for innovative financing mechanisms. We must instill the \nfinancial incentives for our pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors \nto engage in areas that have previously ignored.\n  Mr. President, I was amazed to learn that of the $56 billion a year \nspent globally on health research, well over 90 percent is spent on \nresearch into health problems that concern only 10 percent of the \nworld's population.\n  Amazingly, of the 1,200 new drugs commercialized between 1975 and \n1997, only 13 were for tropical diseases--diseases such as malaria and \ntuberculosis which combined kill close to 3 million people a year.\n  Why is it that pharmaceutical companies don't invest in these \ndiseases? Because there is no hope for finding a vaccine for malaria? \nNo hope for finding an affordable vaccine for tuberculosis or HIV? Is \nthe science just insurmountable?\n  Absolutely not.\n  Companies don't invest in these diseases because they don't foresee a \nprofit. A malaria vaccine, while offering the potential to save \nmillions of lives, does not offer the same return to shareholders as \nthe return from Viagra, Lipitor, Prozac, or other blockbusters here in \nthe United States. I don't blame the pharmaceutical industry for \nconcern about their shareholders, but I believe it is morally \nimperative to jumpstart research into vaccines as quickly as possible.\n  What then, is the answer? Should we turn our back on these diseases \nas a casualty of the way free markets function? Should we dump billions \ninto new government bureaucracies to tackle these problems? The answer \non both counts is no. We as a nation, and as a responsible member of \nthe international community, should create the market incentives to \nencourage our pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, the best and \nbrightest companies in the world, to invest in those diseases which are \na scourge to the world.\n  What we need to do is give pharmaceutical companies the financial \nincentives to achieve what we know is possible and let them work their \nmagic--these are the same engines of growth and technological progress \nwhich have helped extend life expectancy beyond what was imaginable at \nthe turn of the century. Now, let's help them turn their attention to \nthose diseases which kill millions upon millions in developing \ncountries.\n  I think this type of public-private partnership is the most efficient \nmeans of addressing the world's growing health care pandemics. How \nwould it world specifically?\n  The legislation I introduce today, the ``Vaccines for the New \nMillennium Act,'' provides a number of market incentives to encourage \nprivate sector investment in lifesaving vaccines. These incentives can \nbe classified in one of two ways. Some of them provide a ``push'' \nmechanism--lowering the cost of R at the front end. Others provide a \n``pull'' mechanism, demonstrating that a market will exist if the \npharmaceutical companies provide the product.\n  On the push side, first, the bill expands on the research and \ndevelopment tax credit by increasing the credit rate from 20 percent to \n50 percent for research related to developing vaccines for AIDS, \nmalaria, tuberculosis, or any infectious disease which kills over 1 \nmillion people a year. The tax credit is incremental such that the \ncredit applies to research spending which exceeds a base amount. In \neffect, the credit rewards incremental increases in lifesaving vaccine \nresearch--thus giving our drug companies an incentive for more focus on \nlifesaving vaccines.\n\n[[Page S1028]]\n\n  Second, the bill allows small biotechnology companies which do not \nhave tax liability to pass a smaller tax credit through to investors. \nFirms with assets under $50 million may choose to pass through a 25 \npercent tax credit to investors who provide financing for research and \ndevelopment on one of the priority vaccines. The credit would apply to \nstock issued after the date of enactment and used within 18 months to \npay for qualified vaccine research expenses.\n  Both of these proposals have been endorsed by a combination of public \nhealth advocacy groups and industry--including AIDS Action Council, the \nGlobal Health Council, the American Public Health Association and the \nAIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition.\n  Third, the bill authorizes voluntary contributions to the Global \nAlliance for Vaccines and Immunizations and the International AIDS \nVaccine Initiative. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations \nis an international partnership recently established to expand and \nimprove access to existing safe and cost-effective vaccines. It is \nbeing supported by a number of nations and international donors, \nincluding an incredibly generous founding gift by the Bill and Melinda \nGates Foundation. A similar provision was included in the President's \nbudget. By working to improve the delivery of existing vaccines, the \nGlobal Alliance not only offers the opportunity to save lives, it will \nimprove health delivery systems for the distribution of future \nvaccines.\n  Fourth, the bill authorizes voluntary contributions to the \nInternational AIDS Vaccine Initiative. In effect, the initiative \nprovides financing to industry in return for international access to \nthe vaccine. For example, under a typical IAVI/industry agreement, IAVI \nwill provide financing in exchange for an agreement with the \nmanufacturer to sell the vaccine to developing countries at very \nreasonable prices. Once again, the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation \nprovides a large portion of IAVI's funding.\n  To further accelerate the invention and production of lifesaving \nvaccines, the bill includes a tax credit proposed in the President's \nbudget. Under the proposal, every dollar paid by a qualifying \norganization to buy a lifesaving vaccine would be matched by a dollar \nof tax credits--thereby doubling the purchasing power of nonprofit \norganizations and others that purchase vaccines for developing \ncountries. The credit only applies to vaccines not yet developed, thus \ndemonstrating the existence of a market if drug companies fill the \nvoid. The credit would apply to vaccines for AIDS, malaria, \ntuberculosis, or any other disease which kills over 1 million people \nannually.\n  The bill also establishes a Lifesaving Vaccine Purchase Fund. This \napproach has been advocated most prominently by Harvard economist \nJeffrey Sachs, a witness on the third panel.\n  Under my proposal, Congress would authorize and advance appropriate \n$100 million a year, over ten years, to a fund for the purchase and \ndistribution of newly-developed vaccines for AIDS, malaria, and \ntuberculosis. The first appropriation would not occur until a vaccine \nhas been licensed and approved. In effect, by establishing a guaranteed \nmarket, the proposal would provide a real incentive for additional \nprivate sector research. However, the money would not be spent until \nthe vaccine was developed, thus postponing any cost to the government.\n  Finally, the bill directs the Administration to initiate negotiations \nwith officials of foreign governments for the establishment of an \ninternational vaccine purchase fund that would purchase and distribute \nin developing countries vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis, HIV, or any \ninfectious disease which kills over 1 million people. It is assumed \nthat if such an agreement is reached, the domestic fund described above \nwould be integrated into the multilateral agreement.\n  This is a comprehensive plan, Mr. President, which I have worked on \nfor two years. This past weekend, it was endorsed as a positive step by \nacademics, pharmaceutical executives and governmental leaders at a \nhigh-level conference convened by the University of California at San \nFrancisco, World Bank and the Global Forum for Health Research.\n  Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi will introduce identical companion \nlegislation in the House and it is my hope that our colleagues will \ngive it equally serious attention.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. DeWine, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Smith of \n        Oregon, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 2137. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Education to make \ngrants to educational organizations to carry out educational programs \nabout the Holocaust; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n                   holocaust education assistance act\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Senator DeWine and I are \nintroducing a bill to provide funds to educational organizations to \nteach the history of the Holocaust. It is entitled the Holocaust \nEducation Assistance Act. Cosponsoring the bill are Senators Smith of \nOregon, Moynihan, Lautenberg, Schumer, Boxer, Wellstone, and Durbin.\n  This bill authorizes $2 million each year for fiscal years 2001-2005 \nfor a competitive grant program under which schools, museums and other \nnon-profit organizations could compete for grants to train teachers, \nconduct seminars and develop educational materials on the Holocaust. It \nis the companion bill to H.R. 3105, introduced by Representatives \nMaloney, Horn, Waxman, and others.\n  The Holocaust is one of the most horrific events in human history. In \nthe 1930s and 1940s, the German Nazi regime systematically slaughtered \nmore than 6,000,000 Jews and other minorities under the guise of \nachieving a ``racially pure'' society. Hopefully, this bill can help \nensure that the next generation of Americans learns some of the crucial \nlessons of the Holocaust. The most fundamental of these lessons is that \nracial and ethnic-based hatred endangers each of us, and that the \nviolation of one person's rights threatens the freedom of all of us.\n\n  Five states mandate that the Holocaust be taught in schools. They are \nCalifornia, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey and New York. Eleven others \nrecommend or encourage teaching the Holocaust in school. They are \nConnecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Ohio, \nPennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington. The \nbill is needed because most teachers have little training and few \nresources to teach the history of the Holocaust. This bill does not \nmandate anything, but it does create a funding source for schools and \ncommunities that choose to teach youngsters about this horrible chapter \nof human history.\n  In my state, the following groups support the bill:\n\n       Holocaust Center of Northern California.\n       Los Angeles City Human Relations Commission.\n       Simon Wiesenthal Museum of Tolerance.\n       The Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern \n     California.\n\n  The following national organizations support the Holocaust Education \nAssistance Act:\n\n       Agudath Israel of America.\n       American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors.\n       American Jewish Committee.\n       American Society for Yad Vashem, Inc.\n       Anti-Defamation League.\n       Association of Holocaust Organizations.\n       Braun Holocaust Institute.\n       Facing History and Ourselves.\n       Hatikvah Holocaust Education Resource Center.\n       Institute for Public Affairs of the Orthodox Union.\n       Museum of Jewish Heritage.\n       National Catholic Center for Holocaust Education.\n       Rabbinical Council of America.\n       Religious Action Center for Reform Judaism.\n       Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum of Tolerance.\n       United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism.\n       World Jewish Congress.\n\n  The following regional organizations support the Holocaust Education \nAssistance Act:\n\n       Florida Holocaust Museum.\n       Hawaii Holocaust Center.\n       Holocaust Memorial Foundation of Illinois.\n       Holocaust Memorial Resource and Education Center of Central \n     Florida.\n       Holocaust Resource Center & Archives, Queensboro Community \n     College.\n       Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Philadelphia.\n       Jewish Community Relations Council of New York.\n       New Mexico Holocaust and Intolerance Museum and Study \n     Center.\n\n[[Page S1029]]\n\n       Tennessee Holocaust Commission.\n       Tennessee Jewish Federation.\n       West Virginia Holocaust Education Commission.\n\n  As we enter the new century, we must remain vigilant to ensure that \nwe do not forget the lessons of the last century. The admonition that \n``those who forget history are doomed to repeat it'' is as true today \nas ever. After the Holocaust, survivors and others vowed not to let \nanother such tragedy go unchallenged. Rallying behind the cry: ``Never \nagain!'', Holocaust survivors made a promise to the memories of their \nmothers, fathers, husbands, wives and children. This bill provides a \nway for us to join with Holocaust survivors in keeping that promise. It \nensures that future generations of Americans will remember that bigotry \nagainst any group poses a menace to society at large, and that the \nviolation of an individual's rights places every person's freedom in \nperil.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url":

Con. Res. 87\n\n       Whereas the Holy See is the governing authority of the \n     sovereign State of Vatican City;\n       Whereas the Holy See has an internationally recognized \n     legal personality, which allows it to enter into treaties as \n     the juridical equal of a state and to send and receive \n     diplomatic representatives;\n       Whereas the diplomatic history of the Holy See began over \n     1,600 years ago, during the 4th century A.D., and the Holy \n     See currently has formal diplomatic relations with 169 \n     nations, including the United States, and maintains 179 \n     permanent diplomatic missions abroad;\n       Whereas, although the Holy See was an active participant in \n     a wide range of United Nations activities since 1946, and was \n     eligible to become a member state of the United Nations, it \n     chose instead to become a nonmember state with Permanent \n     Observer status over 36 years ago, in 1964;\n       Whereas, unlike other geographically small countries such \n     as Monaco, Nauru, San Marino, and Liechtenstein, the Holy See \n     does not possess a vote in the General Assembly of the United \n     Nations;\n       Whereas, according to a July 1998 assessment by the United \n     States Department of State, ``(t)he United States values the \n     Holy See's significant contributions to international peace \n     and human rights'';\n       Whereas during the past year, certain organizations that \n     oppose the views of the Holy See regarding abortion and the \n     sanctity of human life have initiated an organized effort to \n     pressure the United Nations to remove the Permanent Observer \n     status of the Holy See; and\n       Whereas the removal of the Holy See's Permanent Observer \n     status would constitute an expulsion of the Holy See from the \n     United Nations as a state participant: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress\n       (1) commends the Holy See for its unique contributions to a \n     thoughtful and robust dialogue in issues of international \n     concern during its 36 years as a Permanent Observer at the \n     United Nations;\n       (2) strongly objects to any effort to expel the Holy See \n     from the United Nations as a state participant by removing \n     its status as a nonmember state Permanent Observer;\n       (3) believes that any degradation of the status accorded to \n     the Holy See at the United Nations would seriously damage the \n     credibility of the United Nations by demonstrating that its \n     rules of participation are manipulable for ideological \n     reasons rather than being rooted in neutral principles and \n     objective facts of sovereignty; and\n       (4) contends that any degradation of the status of the Holy \n     See will damage relations between the United States and the \n     United Nations.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of \nsubmitting a Senate concurrent resolution objecting to any efforts to \nexpel or degrade the Holy See's current status as a nonmember permanent \nobserver to the United Nations. It is hard to believe there are people \nin the world--indeed, in our own country--who wish to take away that \nstatus.\n  Throughout my tenure in the Senate and the House, I have worked to \nuphold the sovereignty of the United States, perhaps as much as anyone \nin the body. Recently, it has come to my attention that the sovereignty \nof the Holy See, the institution that represents the State of the \nVatican City internationally, is being attacked by up to 400 \nnongovernmental organizations in a movement called ``See Change.'' That \nis S-e-e.\n  See Change is comprised of extremist groups, pro-choice groups, some \nextreme environmental organizations, and antireligious, atheist groups \nwho want to take away this permanent status of the Holy See.\n  Specifically, the agenda of See Change is to pressure U.N. Secretary \nGeneral Annan into revoking the Holy See's nonmember Permanent Observer \nstatus by attacking its status as the legal and diplomatic body that \nrepresents the sovereign country of the State of the Vatican City.\n  What an outrage. See Change believes it can use the smokescreen of \nthe Holy See's unique sovereignty to silence its undisputed legal \nrights as a sovereign entity to voice its views on the sanctity of \nhuman life at the U.N. That is what this is about. It is about an \nattack on the sanctity of human life. It is an attack on the Pope for \nhis views on the sanctity of human life.\n  Since the U.N. rules by the consensus of all members, See Change is \nattempting to pressure and intimidate the Holy See, the Secretary \nGeneral, and other member countries of the U.N. to silence any \nopposition to what really is a pro-abortion agenda.\n  Currently, the Holy See is recognized by almost every nation in the \nworld. Furthermore, the Holy See has sent and received diplomats since \nthe 4th century and has possessed a permanent diplomatic mission since \nthe 15th century.\n  As I stated before, a central argument that these nongovernmental \norganizations use is the issue of the Holy See's legally recognized \nauthority to represent the citizens of Vatican City and the worldwide \nCatholic Church.\n  According to international law, sovereignty in its simplest form can \nbe defined by a people, territorial entity, and a government with \ninstitutions that are recognized by the international community of \nnations. Without any doubt--since the 4th century--the Holy See acts as \nthe legal and internationally recognized body that represents the \npeople of Vatican City and Catholics around the world. The Holy See \nmeets all those criteria. The Vatican State has a population of \napproximately 900 citizens, has a defined territory, and has \ninstitutions of government.\n  The sovereignty issue was irrefutably settled in 1929, when the Holy \nSee and Italy signed and ratified the Lateran Treaty, which brought the \nVatican City State into existence. Article 12 of this treaty states:\n\n       Diplomatic relations with the Holy See are governed by the \n     rules of International Law.\n\n  All states have equal standing under international law. I believe the \nSenate needs to send a strong, positive message to reaffirm the concept \nof state sovereignty. If we cannot do that in this body, then I do not \nknow what we can do. I would like to remind Secretary General Kofi \nAnnan about his duty to uphold the principle the United Nations \nconsiders most important in its charter--the legal equality of nations, \nwhich is Article 2(1).\n  Furthermore, this legal principle says all states are not similar in \ntheir\n\n[[Page S1032]]\n\ncharacteristics. For example, China contains about one-quarter of the \nhuman race while the State of the Vatican City contains a little fewer \nthan 1,000 citizens.\n  Moreover, this Nation, the United States, is exponentially larger in \nphysical size and political stature than, say, Bangladesh; however, \nboth nations have equal status under international law.\n  Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice, said the \nHoly See sitting at the U.N. was like ``Euro-Disney sitting on the \nSecurity Council.'' Can you imagine? Surely, any person, American or \nnot, would recoil at the irreverence of this statement and the \nignorance, frankly, of the invaluable work the Holy See has undertaken \nto foster peace between fellow nations.\n  Highly respected U.N. leaders, such as Dag Hammarskjold, have, in \nfact, recognized the unique sovereign status of the State of the \nVatican City and insisted on the presence of the Holy See at the U.N. \nIn addition, U.N. Secretary General U Thant attempted to establish an \nincreased stability of relations between the Holy See and the U.N.\n  Catholics for a Free Choice--I use that term loosely--a leading \norganization in the movement to remove the Holy See from the U.N., has \nset forth the following statement in their own web site:\n\n       What place does a religious body--claiming to possess the \n     universal ``objective truth'' and speak infallibly on moral \n     matters--have in an intergovernmental institution like the \n     United Nations?\n\n  I would like to point out that above the doors of the U.S. House \nChamber are the reliefs of great lawmakers who had a profound impact on \nthe moral and legal origins of this Nation. The most important lawmaker \nis Moses; his relief is placed higher, in the center of the Chamber, \nfacing the Chair.\n  Why didn't anyone question the sovereignty of the Soviet Union and \nits Politburo, with the Communist ideology that it espoused, and the \nmanner in which it imposed its will upon the satellite states of \nEastern Europe under its control?

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Transition to Teaching \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. ____2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) School districts will need to hire more than 2,000,000 \n     teachers in the next decade. The need for teachers in the \n     areas of mathematics, science, foreign languages, special \n     education, and bilingual education, and for those able to \n     teach in high-poverty school districts will be particularly \n     high. To meet this need, talented Americans of all ages \n     should be recruited to become successful, qualified teachers.\n       (2) Nearly 28 percent of teachers of academic subjects have \n     neither an undergraduate major nor minor in their main \n     assignment fields. This problem is more acute in high-poverty \n     schools, where the out-of-field percentage is 39 percent.\n       (3) The Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) \n     ranked United States high school seniors last among 16 \n     countries in physics and next to last in mathematics. It is \n     also evident, mainly from the TIMSS data, that based on \n     academic scores, a stronger emphasis needs to be placed on \n     the academic preparation of our children in mathematics and \n     science.\n       (4) One-fourth of high-poverty schools find it very \n     difficult to fill bilingual teaching positions, and nearly \n     half of public school teachers have students in their \n     classrooms for whom English is a second language.\n       (5) Many career-changing professionals with strong content-\n     area skills are interested in a teaching career, but need \n     assistance in getting the appropriate pedagogical training \n     and classroom experience.\n       (6) The Troops to Teachers model has been highly successful \n     in linking high-quality teachers to teach in high-poverty \n     districts.\n\n     SEC. ____3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to address the need of high-\n     poverty school districts for highly qualified teachers in \n     particular subject areas, such as mathematics, science, \n     foreign languages, bilingual education, and special \n     education, needed by those school districts, by recruiting, \n     preparing, placing, and supporting career-changing \n     professionals who have knowledge and experience that will \n     help them become such teachers.\n\n     SEC. ____4. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\n\n       (a) Authority.--The Secretary is authorized to use funds \n     appropriated under subsection (b) for each fiscal year to \n     award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to \n     institutions of higher education and public and private \n     nonprofit agencies or organizations to carry out programs \n     authorized by this title.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of \n     carrying out this title, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated $25,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2001 \n     through 2006.\n\n     SEC. ____5.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Biomass Research and \n     Development Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) conversion of biomass into biobased industrial products \n     offers outstanding potential for benefit to the national \n     interest through improved strategic security and balance of \n     payments, healthier rural economies, improved environmental \n     quality, near-zero net greenhouse gas emissions, technology \n     export, and sustainable resource supply;\n       (2) the key technical challenges to be overcome in order \n     for biobased industrial products to be cost competitive are \n     finding new technology and reducing the cost of technology \n     for converting biomass into desired biobased industrial \n     products;\n       (3) biobased fuels, such as ethanol, have the clear \n     potential to be sustainable, low cost, and high performance \n     fuels that are compatible with both current and future \n     transportation systems and provide near zero net greenhouse \n     gas emissions;\n       (4) biobased chemicals--\n       (A) can provide functional replacements for essentially all \n     organic chemicals that are currently derived from petroleum; \n     and\n       (B) have the clear potential for environmentally benign \n     product life cycles;\n       (5) biobased power can provide environmental benefits, \n     promote rural economic development, and diversify energy \n     resource options;\n       (6) many biomass feedstocks suitable for industrial \n     processing show the clear potential for sustainable \n     production, in some cases resulting in improved soil \n     fertility and carbon sequestration;\n       (7)(A) grain processing mills are biorefineries that \n     produce a diversity of useful food, chemical, feed, and fuel \n     products; and\n       (B) technologies that result in further diversification of \n     the range of value-added biobased industrial products can \n     meet a key need for the grain processing industry;\n       (8)(A) cellulosic feedstocks are attractive because of \n     their low cost and widespread availability; and\n       (B) research resulting in cost-effective technology to \n     overcome the recalcitrance of cellulosic biomass would allow \n     biorefineries to produce fuels and bulk chemicals on a very \n     large scale, with a commensurately\n\n[[Page S1040]]\n\n     large realization of the benefit described in paragraph (1);\n       (9) research into the fundamentals to understand important \n     mechanisms of biomass conversion can be expected to \n     accelerate the application and advancement of biomass \n     processing technology by--\n       (A) increasing the confidence and speed with which new \n     technologies can be scaled up; and\n       (B) giving rise to processing innovations based on new \n     knowledge;\n       (10) the added utility of biobased industrial products \n     developed through improvements in processing technology would \n     encourage the design of feedstocks that would meet future \n     needs more effectively;\n       (11) the creation of value-added biobased industrial \n     products would create new jobs in construction, \n     manufacturing, and distribution, as well as new higher-valued \n     exports of products and technology;\n       (12)(A) because of the relatively short-term time horizon \n     characteristic of private sector investments, and because \n     many benefits of biomass processing are in the national \n     interest, it is appropriate for the Federal Government to \n     provide precommercial investment in fundamental research and \n     research-driven innovation in the biomass processing area; \n     and\n       (B) such an investment would provide a valuable complement \n     to ongoing and past governmental support in the biomass \n     processing area; and\n       (13) several prominent studies, including studies by the \n     President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology and \n     the National Research Council--\n       (A) support the potential for large research-driven \n     advances in technologies for production of biobased \n     industrial products as well as associated benefits; and\n       (B) document the need for a focused, integrated, and \n     innovation-driven research effort to provide the appropriate \n     progress in a timely manner.\n\n     SEC. 103.

Mr. President, this morning the Democratic Policy \nCommittee had a very important hearing on the issue of prescription \ndrug coverage under Medicare for the Nation's older people. We heard \nfrom senior citizens, we heard from pharmacists, we heard from \ngerontologists, extraordinarily compelling testimony about why this \nprescription drug benefit is so important.\n  Frankly, I do not think there is a single Member of the Senate, \nwhether they are a Democrat or a Republican, who would not be moved by \nwhat we heard this morning. The senior citizens, as we hear again and \nagain in townhall meetings at home, are pointing out that they cannot \nafford their prescription medicines.\n  The pharmacists went into detail about how frustrated they are that \nso many of the older people lack bargaining power in the marketplace, \nbargaining power that can help them drive down the cost of their \nmedicine. I thought the gerontologists we heard from this morning were \nvery compelling in making the case of how so many of these drugs today \ncan promote wellness and help seniors stay healthy and keep from \nracking up these extraordinary medical bills that are so often incurred \nand require hospitalization under what is called Part A of the Medicare \nprogram.\n  It is so important that we come together as a body to address this \nissue. Senator Daschle, in particular, mentions to me on almost a daily \nbasis how he wants to reconcile the various bills. He wants to reach \nout to colleagues on the other side of the aisle. In particular, I \npraise my colleague, Senator Snowe. She and I have worked for over a \nyear on a bipartisan effort with respect to prescription drugs.\n  I know colleagues on the other side of the aisle are interested in \nthis issue as well. Frankly, I think any Member of the Senate who heard \nwhat the Democratic Policy Committee heard this morning had to have \nbeen moved by how great the need is for prescription drug coverage for \nseniors.\n  One of the issues that has come up in recent days is this question of \nwhether private insurance companies are going to be interested in this \nbenefit and whether they are going to be willing to update their \npolicies. We are hearing a lot of talk that maybe they are not and they \nare not going to come forward.\n  I guess we are starting to hear from the same crowd who said doctors \nand hospitals in the early sixties were not going to participate in the \nMedicare program. It is preposterous to say private insurers are not \ngoing to participate once we go forward and enact a responsible \nbipartisan prescription drug program for seniors under Medicare.\n  What the Snowe-Wyden legislation does is make it very clear the money \nthat would be earmarked under our bipartisan bill would be made \navailable to pick up the prescription drug portion of a senior \ncitizen's private health insurance bill.\n  The Presiding Officer, who has great expertise in this area as well, \nknows that the vast majority of seniors have these private policies--\nMedigap policies, HMO policies, a variety of private policies today.\n  I am absolutely convinced that when we go forward to enact this \nprogram on a bipartisan basis, as we heard in the Democratic policy \nsession this morning, private insurance companies all over this country \nwill tear up their existing contracts with older people and add the \nprescription drug program that we enact this year to their coverage. By \nthe way, they would not be required to do it. Under our legislation and \nother bills, this would be voluntary for both private insurance \ncompanies and for older people.\n  The reason why I believe private insurance companies are going to be \nvery eager to participate is that they will not be able to be \ncompetitive with the various other companies in an area unless they \noffer the benefit.\n  If you took a Salt Lake City, UT, or a Portland, OR, or a Denver, CO, \nwhere there are a variety of insurers, once we enact this program, \nseniors are going to go to private insurers and ask: Are you offering \nthis particular benefit? Because we see the Congress has passed a law \nmaking available funds to pick up the prescription drug portion of a \nsenior citizen's private health insurance bill.\n  I think all this talk about how private insurance companies are not \ngoing to be interested in offering this benefit is incredibly \nfarfetched. While our proposal and the other good proposals that\n\n[[Page S1043]]\n\nare offered are voluntary, we are already hearing from insurance \ncompanies that they are going to be very interested in offering this \nbenefit. In fact, many of them are going to believe they have to do it \nin order to be competitive in their community.\n  I hope--I did want to be brief tonight--we can go forward in the days \nahead and act on this matter as priority business before the Senate. I \nintend to keep coming to the floor to bring to the attention of this \nbody cases from home and from across this country of older people who, \nwhen they are done paying their prescription drug bills, literally have \nonly a few hundred dollars a month to pay for their food and their rent \nand their utilities. It is outrageous, in a country as good and strong \nas ours, that we have not updated our health care system to provide \nthis coverage.\n  Because I have come to the floor now 25 times in 3 months to talk \nabout this issue, and Senator Daschle's effort to bring the Senate \ntogether, to reach out to colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I \nam asked all the time: Can America afford to cover prescription drugs \nfor older people? My response is: We can't afford not to cover \nprescription drugs.\n  What the gerontologists told us today is that if you want, for the \nlong-term, to promote wellness and to keep seniors healthy, make these \ndrugs--the drugs that lower blood pressure and cholesterol--available \nto seniors because with them seniors will be able to stay healthy and \nnot rack up these much larger medical bills that are incurred when they \nare ill.\n  One of the most striking examples I have seen in this discussion \ninvolves the anticoagulant drugs, the drugs that prevent strokes. It \nmight cost $1,000 or $1,500 for a senior to get those drugs for a \nyear--certainly that is expensive--but if, through drugs such as that, \nyou can prevent stroke--which will cost upwards of $100,000--it seems \nto me it makes a very clear case that we ought to be offering this \nbenefit.\n\n  I recognize that colleagues have different views as to how to go \nabout doing it. Several of my Democratic colleagues have bills. I do \nnot expect to have the last word on this subject. I know colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle have legislation, as well. I am very \nhonored to have been able to team up with Senator Snowe for 15 months \nnow in an effort to pass this prescription drug benefit on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  But let us make sure this issue does get addressed, and addressed in \nthis Congress. Because to let this become fodder for another political \nseason, and to have the back and forth that would go on in a political \ncampaign, where one side blames the other side, is not productive. That \nis not what Senator Daschle wants to have, as he tries to bring \ntogether the various approaches that have been offered by Members of \nthe Senate. I know there are a number of Republicans who want to avoid \nthat kind of train-wreck scenario where you do not act on this issue; \ninstead, it just becomes the fodder for another political campaign.\n  What the Democratic Policy Committee heard this morning from seniors, \nfrom pharmacists, from gerontologists, ought to be compelling to every \nMember of this body--Democrats, Republicans, liberals, and \nconservatives.\n  Let us debate the specifics about how to go about offering this \nbenefit, but let us make sure this issue gets done because I do not \nthink it is right for the country to wait any longer to move forward on \nan issue that is so vital to health care reform.\n  I intend to keep coming back to the floor to address this issue. The \nsession held by the Democratic Policy Committee was so compelling this \nmorning that I wanted to take a couple minutes to bring it to the \nattention of the Senate.\n  I wish to make it clear that I look forward to working with all of my \ncolleagues on a bipartisan basis. The Presiding Officer--the Senator \nfrom Utah--and I have talked about health care on a number of occasions \nsince I have been in the Senate. He has great expertise. We are going \nto involve him in this cause and get it done in a bipartisan way.\n  I think this morning's program by the Democratic Policy Committee was \nanother step in the right direction.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/01/senate-section/article/S1043-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
