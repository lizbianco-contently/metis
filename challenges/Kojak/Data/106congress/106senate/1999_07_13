Mr. President, the chairman of the Finance Committee \nwill be coming out with his mark on tax cuts, and this is a critically \nimportant issue. It is an important one for the country. It is \nimportant, now that we are looking forward to having some surplus, that \nwe say to the American people: You have been overpaying your taxes, and \nwe want to give some of that back to you. This is over and above Social \nSecurity, the amount of the payroll tax that is going to Social \nSecurity. So we are setting aside the Social Security trust funds--a \nlockbox is what we call it, a lockbox for the Social Security surplus--\nand with the remainder talking about tax cuts, serious tax cuts.\n  One issue we want to discuss this morning is doing away with the \nmarriage penalty. It seems extraordinary to me that we would have a tax \npolicy in this country that actually penalizes people for getting \nmarried. With all the problems we have with families in our society, it \nseems, if anything, we would want to do just the opposite--we would \nwant to give people a benefit for being married rather than taxing them \nfor being married. And yet the way the code has evolved, today 21 \nmillion American married couples pay an average of $1,400 more in taxes \njust for the privilege of being married.\n  I think that is wrong. The Government should not use the coercive \npower of the Tax Code to erode one of the foundational units of our \nsociety, that of marriage. We should stop the taxation. We should put a \nstop to the marriage penalty tax. This year we can change that.\n  I am encouraged that the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nRoth, and his committee have put forward efforts to alleviate the \nmarriage penalty. We have a unique opportunity to put that issue behind \nus.\n  I want to draw Senators' attention to another issue under the \nmarriage penalty area which has not been talked about that much. That \nis the earned-income tax credit bias against married couples. A \nsignificant share of the marriage penalty occurs to low-income\n\n[[Page S8310]]\n\ncouples. It is caused by the loss of the earned-income tax credit when \nindividuals' incomes are combined.\n  What happens is, you have two-wage-earner families that, if they were \nnot married, if they were single and filing separately, would qualify \nfor the earned-income tax credit. But if they get married and they earn \nover this mark, they get penalized again for being married.\n  Estimates by the CBO indicate that what we can do is double, for two-\nwage-earner families, the amount of income that can be received and \nstill qualify for the earned-income tax credit. Virtually all the \nbenefits of this adjustment in the earned-income tax credit would go to \ncouples with incomes below $50,000. There are nearly 3.7 million \ncouples in America today that do not receive the earned-income tax \ncredit that would, if we double the amount that they can make, still \nqualify for the earned-income tax credit.\n  I point this out because people struggle mightily to raise families, \nand the notion that we would tax and then tax again low-income \nfamilies, keeping them from receiving a benefit because they are \nmarried, makes absolutely no policy sense at all.\n  I don't see how on Earth anybody can argue this is a good idea or \nthis is the right thing to do. I am hopeful the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee has focused on this. We can do this. I hope the President \nwill be willing to work with Members of Congress in both the House and \nthe Senate in crafting a tax package we can all agree with, so the \nAmerican people can stop overpaying their taxes--which they are \ncurrently doing.\n  The CBO is now projecting an onbudget surplus of $14 billion in \nfiscal year 2000, with the surplus growing to $996 billion over the 10-\nyear period beginning in fiscal year 2000. We have this opportunity to \neliminate the marriage penalty tax and to do away with paying the \nmarriage penalty tax on upper-income levels and for those not being \ngiven the earned-income tax credit on the lower-income level.\n  Of course, the surging surplus I was discussing is as a result of \npayroll tax receipts. I continue to emphasize that.\n  The majority side wants to put a lockbox around any Social Security \nsurplus and have that maintained only for Social Security. We can do \nthese things. We need to work across the aisle. We need to work with \nthe President. I hope he will be willing to work with Members as we \nmove forward in dealing with the marriage penalty tax, which is a \nterrible signal to send across society, to send to people across \nAmerica. We will be working with the chairman of the Finance Committee. \nI hope this is one tax that can find its death in this round of tax \ncuts. We will hopefully be going to reconciliation and discussing tax \ncuts this month. It is a very important topic we will discuss.\n  I encourage people paying a marriage penalty tax to contact Members \nregarding how the marriage penalty tax has directly impacted your \nlives. I have had any number of couples write saying: We wanted to get \nmarried but we found out we were going to pay this huge tax for getting \nmarried and we could not afford to do that; this is money we wanted to \nuse for a downpayment of a house or to get a car that would work.\n  They were not able to do it because of the pernicious fiscal effect \nof the marriage penalty tax. It is a terrible signal we are sending \nacross our society.\n  Senator Hutchison from Texas has been a leader on this issue of \ndealing with the marriage penalty tax. She has come to the floor, as \nwell, to discuss what we can do. Now is the time to eliminate this \nmarriage penalty tax.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/13/senate-section/article/S8310-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  VISIT TO THE SENATE BY THE HONORABLE JOHN HOWARD, PRIME MINISTER OF \n                               AUSTRALIA\n\n  Mr. HAGEL.

The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Brownback.\n  Senator Ashcroft from Missouri, Senator Brownback, I, and many others \nhave been talking about the marriage penalty tax for two sessions, and \neven a session before that.\n  We were stunned when we discovered 44 percent of married couples in \nthe middle-income brackets--in the $40,000 to $60,000 range--were \npaying a penalty just for the privilege of being married.\n  We have introduced legislation to cut the marriage tax penalty. In \nfact, both the House and Senate have tax cut plans that we will be \ndiscussing over the next few months to try to determine what we can \ngive back to the hard-working Americans who have been sending their \nmoney to Washington to fund our Government.\n  When we start talking about how we are going to give people their \nmoney back, I think we have to step back and talk about the basic \nargument, which is: What do we do with the surplus? And are tax cuts \nthe right way to spend the surplus?\n  I will quote from a Ft. Worth Star-Telegram opinion piece by one of \nthe editorial writers on that newspaper, Bill Thompson, from June 30, \n1999.\n  He says there is only one question to ask about the budget surplus, \nand that is:\n\n       How should we go about giving the money back to its \n     rightful owners?\n       And the rightful owners, surely even the biggest nitwit in \n     Washington can understand, are the taxpayers of the United \n     States of America.\n       The federal government is not a private business that can \n     do whatever it wants to with unexpected profits.\n\n  Because, in fact, we are more of a co-op. We are not a business that \nis trying to make a profit and then decide what to do with the profits.\n\n       . . . [T]here should be no discussion about the fate of the \n     money. . . .\n\n  If there is money left over, we give it back to the people who own \nthat money. We in Washington, DC. do not own that money. The people who \nearned it own it. It is time we start giving them back the money they \nhave earned.\n  We are doing what we should be doing. We are cutting back Government \nspending, so people can keep more of the money they earn. If we do not \ngive it back to them, we will be abusing the power we have to tax the \npeople. We are talking about giving the money back to the people who \nearn it, and the first place we ought to look is to people who are \nmarried who pay more taxes just because they are married. If they were \neach single they would be paying lower taxes, but because they got \nmarried the average is $1,400 in the marriage penalty tax. That is \nunconscionable.\n  Since 1969, we have seen the marriage tax penalty get worse and worse \nand worse. It was not meant to be that way. Congress did not intend to \ntax married people more. But because more women have gone into the \nworkforce to make ends meet and to do better for\n\n[[Page S8311]]\n\ntheir families, the Tax Code has gotten skewed and the deductions have \nbecome unfair. So today we are saying the first priority should be to \neliminate the tax that is more on married people than it would be if \nthey were single.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Ashcroft, who is working \nwith me on this very important issue. We will give the taxes that \npeople are paying to the Government back to them because it does not \nbelong to us. It belongs to the people who earn it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the article by Bill Thompson \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    The Budget Surplus: There's Only One Topic That Needs Discussing\n\n                           (By Bill Thompson)\n\n       Nothing will get the politicians' juices flowing like an \n     avalanche of money. Put large piles of cash in front of a \n     herd of politicians, and the ensuing stampede will crush \n     everything in its path.\n       Nowhere is this truer than in Washington, D.C., where the \n     latest predictions of burgeoning federal budget surpluses \n     have the president, Congress and everyone in between all but \n     trampling one another in their fervor to dive into those \n     irresistible mountains of money.\n       Not surprisingly, all the official and semiofficial public \n     pronouncements, all the expert analyses and all the wide-eyed \n     speculation about the fate of the extra money seem to arrive \n     at the same conclusion: The politicians will spend it.\n       In fact, the only question that anyone who's anyone seems \n     to be asking about this ``windfall'' revenue is: How should \n     we spend it?\n       Well, call me naive or simple-minded or just plain dumb--\n     many readers do so on a regular basis, after all--but in my \n     humble opinion the deep-thinkers are asking the wrong \n     question. The only legitimate question that anybody should be \n     asking about the federal budget surplus is: How should we go \n     about giving the money back to its rightful owners?\n       And the rightful owners, surely even the biggest nitwit in \n     Washington can understand, are the taxpayers of the United \n     States of America.\n       The federal government is not a private business that can \n     do whatever it wants to with unexpected profits. It's not \n     even one of those publicly traded corporations that can \n     choose among options such as reinvesting in the company \n     sharing the profits with employees or distributing the money \n     to stockholders by means of increased dividends.\n       Government collects money from citizens in the form of \n     taxes and fees for the purpose of providing designated \n     services to those very same citizens. If for some reason the \n     government should happen to collect more money than it needs \n     to provide the designated services, there should be no \n     discussion about the fate of the money: It goes back to the \n     taxpayers who worked it over in the first place.\n       For politicians and bureaucrats to suggest that they are so \n     much as considering any other use of a budget surplus should \n     be looked upon as the worst sort of fiscal malfeasance.\n       True enough, the idea of using some of the budget surplus \n     to bail out fiscally endangered programs such as Social \n     Security and Medicare sounds tempting. But there's a \n     problem--two problems, actually.\n       Problem No. 1 is that these breathtaking estimates of \n     budget surpluses totaling trillions of dollars over the next \n     15 years are just that--estimates. An unexpected downturn in \n     the nation's economy could blow the projections sky high and \n     leave the taxpayers with mind-boggling financial commitments \n     to those programs--and no money to meet them.\n       Problem No. 2: The commitment of future budget surpluses to \n     these expensive entitlements is a phony solution that \n     distracts attention from the desperate need for fundamental \n     reforms to programs whose escalating costs simply must be \n     brought under control sooner or later.\n       President Clinton's proposal to dedicate a portion of any \n     budget surplus to pay down the national debt seems reasonable \n     enough at firs glance. But consider this: How can Clinton \n     brag about cutting up Washington's credit card when his plan \n     to pay off the card's outstanding balance hinges on projected \n     income?\n       We should be paying off the debt with actual revenue that \n     would be available for debt reduction if the government would \n     cut expenses instead of constantly seeking new ways to spend \n     the taxpayers' money.\n       No, this raging debate about how to spend the surplus is \n     the wrong debate. The only question that politicians need to \n     debate is whether to give the money back to the taxpayers in \n     the form of a reduction in income tax rates, or through some \n     sort of tax credit that enables taxpayers to deduct their \n     share of the surplus from their tax bills.\n       The money belongs to the people. It should be returned to \n     the people.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her \nkind remarks and for allowing me to speak on this important issue.\n  Americans are now paying taxes at a higher rate than ever before. The \nburden and cost of the government are more, and the Federal Government \nis responsible for the overwhelming lion's share. As a matter of fact, \nwe are not just responsible for the Federal taxes, because we have \nmandated so many programs on State and local governments we are \nresponsible for a lot of what they are taxing people. So we are being \ntaxed at the highest rates in history--at the highest rates in history.\n  Now we announced, in spite of that, we are paying more in those taxes \nthan it costs to run Government. We are paying more in than it costs to \nfund the programs we are getting. If you go to a grocery store and you \nare buying $8 worth of groceries and you give them a $10 bill, you are \npaying more than it costs for the service and they give you a couple of \ndollars in change.\n  There is a stunning debate in Washington. We are debating over \nwhether or not to give people the change back. They are paying more \nthan is required for the programs they have requested, and we are \ndebating whether or not we are going to give them the change back. We \nought to give the money back. They own it. They have overpaid.\n  No. 1, we are paying the highest taxes in history. No. 2, those taxes \npay for more than what our programs cost; therefore, we are overpaying. \nNo. 3, we ought to refund that overpayment to the American people.\n  I submit among those who ought to be the first in line to get money \nback are those who have been particularly abused, those who have been \nthe subject of discrimination, those who have been the subject of \nwrongful taking of the money by Government. That is where you come to \nthis class of people who are not normally thought of as being a special \nclass. They are married people. Forty-two percent of all the married \npeople in the United States end up penalized for being married. That is \n21 million families. Mr. President, 21 million families pay an average \nof over $100 a month--that is $1,400 a year--because we have what is \ncalled the marriage penalty tax.\n  Before we decide on tax relief for the population generally, let's \ntake some of these gross inequities out of the system, especially \ninequities that target one of the most important, if not the most \nimportant, components of the community we call America--our families. \nOur families are the most important department of social services, the \nmost important department of education. The most important fundamental \ncomponent of the culture is the family. It is where we will either \nsucceed or fail in the next century. Our Tax Code has been focusing on \nthose families and has been saying we are going to take from you more \nthan we would take from anybody else.\n  This idea of penalizing people for being married is a bankrupt idea, \nand it is time to take the marriage penalty part of this law and \nadminister the death penalty to the marriage tax.\n  I say it is time for us to end the marriage penalty. This will mean a \nsubstantial improvement in income for people who have been suffering \ndiscrimination because they are married. It is time for us to end the \nmarriage penalty in the tax law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President, we are engaged in a historic debate about \nthe future of health care in the United States. I have tried very \ndiligently to ensure that children are a large part of this debate.\n  In conjunction with those activities, yesterday I had the opportunity \nto visit with pediatricians and pediatric\n\n[[Page S8312]]\n\nspecialists in my State of Rhode Island at Hasbro Children's Hospital, \nan extraordinary hospital in Rhode Island. I am very proud of it. While \nlistening to those professionals, I got a sense of the real needs we \nhave to address in this debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  First of all, there is tremendous frustration by these physicians and \nmedical professionals about their ability to care for children, their \nability to effectively provide the kind of care which parents assume \nthey paid for when they enrolled in the HMO. They are frustrated by the \nmindless rules. For example, one physician related to me there is the \nstandard practice of giving a child a complete examination at the age \nof 1. He had a situation where a child came in at 11 months 28 days. \nThey performed the examination, and the insurance company refused to \npay because, obviously, the child was not yet 1 year old. That is the \ntype of incredible, mindless bureaucracy these physicians are facing \nevery day.\n  I had another physician tell me--and this was startling to me--she \nwas treating a child for botulism. She was told the company was \nrefusing to pay after the second day. She called--again, here is a \nphysician who is spending valuable time calling to find out why there \nis no reimbursement--and she was told simply by the reviewer--not a \nphysician, the reviewer--that according to the guidelines of that HMO, \nno one can survive 2 days with a case of botulism; therefore, they were \nnot paying for more than 2 days. Mercifully, the child survived, and \neventually I hope they were paid for their efforts.\n\n  These are the kinds of frustrations they experience. This is \nthroughout the entire system of health care. There are some very \nspecific issues when it comes to children. One is the issue of \ndevelopmental progress. An adult is generally fully developed in \ncognition, in mobility, in all the things that children are still \nevolving. Yet managed care plans seldom take into consideration the \ndevelopmental consequences of a decision when it comes to children. \nUnless we require them to do that, they will continue to avoid that \nparticular aspect. So a child can be denied services.\n  For example, special formulas for infants can be denied because the \nHMO will say: Well, it is not life-threatening; there is no serious, \nimmediate health consequence. But the problem, of course, is, unless \nthe child gets this special nutrient, that child is not going to \ndevelop in a healthy fashion. Five, six, seven, eight years from now, \nthat child is going to have serious problems, but, in the view of an \nHMO, a dollar saved today is a dollar saved today. Oh, and by the way, \nthat child probably will not even be in their health care system 5 \nyears from now, the way parents and employers change coverage.\n  We have to focus on developmental issues. We also have to ensure \nchildren have access to pediatric specialists. There is the presumption \nthat a rose is a rose is a rose, a cardiologist is a cardiologist is a \ncardiologist, when, in fact, a pediatric cardiologist is a very \nspecific discipline requiring different insights and different skills.\n  We also have to recognize that many very talented pediatricians find \nthemselves overwhelmed today with the young children they are seeing. I \nhad one physician tell me he sees children who have problems with \ndeficit disorders, problems with attention issues, and they have \nprescribed some very sophisticated pharmaceutical pills and \nprescriptions that he, frankly, has trouble managing because he is not \na child psychiatrist. Yet they have difficulty getting access from the \ngeneral practitioner to the specialist, the child psychologist to the \nchild psychiatrist.\n  The other thing is, the system has been built upon adult standards. \nOne of the great examples given to me is that there are new standards \nnow to reimburse physicians when they are doing a physical, but they \nare based upon adult standards. The important things a physician has to \ndo to evaluate a child are not even compensated because they are \nimmaterial to an adult. Why would the company spend money paying a \ndoctor to do that? This whole bias towards adults distorts the care for \nchildren in the United States.\n  The Democratic alternative which is being presented today recognizes \nthese issues in a very pronounced and emphatic way. We do explicitly \nprovide for access to pediatric specialists; we do specifically \nrequire, in making judgments about health care, the development of a \nchild must be considered as part of the medical necessity test; and we \nalso talk about developing standards, measurements, and evaluations of \nhealth care plans that are based on children and not just adults.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to endorse this concept. The best reason \nto pass this Democratic alternative is to help the children of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, I rise today to continue the discussion \nof the Patients' Bill of Rights and lend my voice to the Graham \namendment for access to emergency care without penalty by an HMO when \nany prudent person presents their symptoms.\n  Before I do that, I congratulate the Senator from Rhode Island for \nhis most eloquent and insightful remarks. For my colleagues, the \nSenator from Rhode Island has devoted his life to protecting the lives \nof Americans. As a West Point graduate serving in the U.S. military, he \ndid that abroad, and now he does it in the Senate Chamber standing up \nfor America's children. I thank him for his devotion and his gallantry. \nI am happy to be an able member of the Reed platoon.\n  I am pleased today to join with Senator Bob Graham and other \ncolleagues in speaking out about the people who go to an emergency room \nand want to be treated for their symptoms without fear of not having \ntheir visit covered by their HMO. When it comes to emergency care, \npeople are afraid of both the symptoms they face as well as being \ndenied coverage by their insurance company.\n  ``ER'' is not just a TV show; it is a real-life situation which \nthousands of Americans face every day. Yet I hear countless stories \nfrom friends and neighbors and constituents, as well as from talking to \nER docs in my own State, who tell me they are afraid to see their \ndoctor or take their child or parent to the emergency room because they \nwill not be reimbursed and will be saddled with debt.\n  Patients must be covered for emergency visits that any prudent person \nwould make. That means if they have symptoms that any prudent person \nsays could constitute a threat to their life and safety, they should be \nreimbursed. The prudent layperson standard is at the heart of this \namendment. It is supported by the American College of Emergency \nPhysicians which has stated that the way the Republican bill is \nwritten, it ``must be interpreted as constraints on a patient's use of \nthe `prudent layperson' standard.''\n  The Republican bill only goes part way. We need to restore common \nsense to our health care system.\n  Let me give an example, the case of Jackie, a resident of Bethesda, \nMD. She went hiking in the Shenandoah mountains. She lost her footing \nand fell off a 40-foot cliff. She had to be airlifted to a hospital. \nThanks to our American medical system, she survived. After she regained \nconsciousness and was being treated at the hospital for these severe \ninjuries, Jackie learned that her HMO refused to pay her hospital bill \nbecause she did not get prior authorization. This is outrageous. \nImagine falling off of a 40-foot cliff, waking up in a hospital and \nbeing told that your HMO will not cover your bills because you did not \ncall while you were unconscious.\n\n  In America, we think if you need emergency care, you should be able \nto call 911, not your HMO's 800 number.\n  Incredibly, some of my colleagues in the Senate say that all these \nstories are anecdotes and they are horror stories. These are not \nanecdotes. We are talking about people's lives.\n  If you would come with me to the emergency rooms at Johns Hopkins \nHospital, the University of Maryland, Salisbury General on a major \nhighway on the Eastern Shore, all over the State, you would learn that \nmany people come to the ER because of not only accidents but they are \nexperiencing symptoms where they wonder if their life could be \nthreatened or the life of\n\n[[Page S8313]]\n\ntheir child. The child is having acute breathing, and you do not know \nif that child is having an undetected asthma attack; or a man sitting \nat Oriole Park suddenly has shortness of breath, pains in his left side \nand leaves to go to the ER at the University of Maryland next to Camden \nYards. Should they call 911 or should they call 800 HMO? I think they \nshould call 911, and they should worry about themselves and their \nfamily and not about reimbursement.\n  So when we come to a vote, I really hope that we will pass the Graham \namendment. The Republicans say they have an alternative. But it does \nnot guarantee that a patient can go to the closest emergency room \nwithout financial penalty. Do not forget, it covers only 48 million \nAmericans; it leaves out 113 million other Americans.\n  Let's do the right thing. Let's make sure that patients with \ninsurance cannot be saddled with huge bills after emergency treatment.\n  I thank the Senate and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1235\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I understand we are currently on the Graham \namendment. Could you tell us how much time remains on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 33 minutes 8 seconds for the \nmajority; and 7 minutes 59 seconds for the minority.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, today we will be talking about a number of issues that \nhave to do with the Patients' Bill of Rights. Yesterday, the \ndiscussions began on what I regard as a very significant, important \npiece of legislation that is called the Patients' Bill of Rights. The \ndebates that we will be having on the floor address really two \nunderlying bills that were introduced formally yesterday: One is the \nKennedy bill from the Democratic side, and the other is the Republican \nleadership bill. Both bills set out to accomplish what I think we all \nabsolutely must keep in mind as we go through this process, and that is \nto make sure that we are focusing on the patients in improving the \nquality and the access of care for those patients and at the same time \nhelp this pendulum swing back to where patients and doctors are \nempowered once again; not to have this be so much in favor of managed \ncare that, when it comes down to an individual patient versus managed \ncare on certain issues, managed care enters into this realm of \npracticing medicine.\n  Again, I think if we keep coming back to focusing on the individual \npatient, we are going to end up with a very good bill.\n  We left off last night with the discussion of the Graham amendment \nwhich focuses on emergency services. In the Republican bill, basically \nthere are a list of patient protections which include a prohibition of \ngag clauses, access to medical specialists, access to an emergency \nroom, which is the real thrust of the Graham amendment, continuity of \ncare--a range of issues that we call patient protections.\n  A second very important part of our bill focuses on quality and how \nwe can improve quality for all Americans. I am very excited about that \naspect of the bill. We will be discussing that later this week. That is \nour responsibility as the Federal Government, to invest in figuring out \nwhat good quality of care actually is. It is similar to investing in \nthe National Institutes of Health: The research behind determining \nwhere the quality is, and spreading that information around the country \nso that excellent quality can be practiced and people can have access \nto that.\n  A third component of the Republican bill which I think is, again, \nvery important that we will keep coming back to, is the access issue, \nthe problem of 43 million people in this country who are uninsured. \nSome people say: No, that is a separate issue; we can put it off for \nanother day.\n  But when you look at patient protections, you look at quality and you \nlook at access. It is almost like a triangle. If you push patient \nprotections too far you end up hurting access. If you push issues \nbeyond what is necessary, to get that balance between coordinated care \nand managed care and fee for service and individual physicians' and \npatients' rights, if you get too far out of kilter, all of a sudden \npremiums go sky-high.\n  When premiums go sky-high in the private sector, employers, small \nemployers start dropping that insurance. It becomes too expensive for \nan individual to go out and purchase a policy, and therefore instead of \nhaving 43 million uninsured, you will have 44 million, 45 million, or \n46 million, all of which is totally unacceptable. As trustees to the \nAmerican people, we simply cannot let that happen. Therefore, you will \nhear this quality and access and patient protection discussion go on \nover the course of the week.\n  Last night and today over the next 45 minutes or so we will be \nfocusing on this patient access to emergency medical care. Let me just \nsay that I have had the opportunity to work in emergency rooms in \nMassachusetts for years, in California on and off for about a year and \na half, in Tennessee for about 6 years, and almost a year in \nSouthampton, England.\n  Whether it is a laceration, whether it is a sore throat, whether it \nis chest pain, whether it is cardiogenic shock from a heart attack, \naccess to emergency room care is critically important to all Americans.\n  We have certain Federal legislation which guarantees that access, but \nit is clear there are certain barriers that are felt today by \nindividuals that their managed care plan is not going to allow them to \ngo to a certain emergency room or, once they go, those services are not \ncovered. That is the gist of what we have in the Republican bill--a \nvery strong provision for patient access to emergency medical care.\n  This Republican provision, as reported out of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pension Committee where this was debated several months ago, \nrequires group health plans, covered by the scope of our bill, to pay, \nwithout any prior authorization, for an emergency medical screening \nexam and stabilization of whatever that problem is--whether it is \ncardiogenic shock, whether it is a laceration or a broken bone or \nfalling down the steps or a broken hip--to pay for that screening and \nthat stabilization process with no questions asked--no authorization, \nno preauthorization, whether you are in the network or outside of the \nnetwork.\n  The prudent layperson standard is very important for people to \nunderstand. The prudent layperson standard is at the heart of the \nRepublican bill. We use the words ``prudent layperson.'' By prudent \nlayperson, we define it as an individual who has an average knowledge \nof health and medicine. The example I have used before is, if you have \na feeling in your chest, and you do not know if it is a heart attack or \nindigestion, and you go to the emergency room, a prudent layperson, an \naverage person, would go to the emergency room in the event that that \nwas a heart attack, and therefore is the standard that is at the heart \nof the Republican bill. Now, there are two issues that need to be \naddressed. We talked about them a little bit yesterday. One is what \nhappens with the\n\n[[Page S8314]]\n\npoststabilization period. You are at home. You have this feeling in \nyour chest. You go to the emergency room. Under our bill, you are \nscreened; you are examined. Initial treatment stabilization of that \ncondition is given.\n\n  Then the question is, What happens with poststabilization? This is \nwhere I have great concern in terms of what my colleague from Florida \nhas proposed and what is in the underlying Kennedy bill. That is, once \nyou get in the door, you can't open that door so widely that any \ncondition is taken care of out of network. Why? Because it blows open \nthe whole idea of having coordinated care, having a more managed \napproach to the delivery of health care.\n  This is a huge door you could get into. Then, once you get into that \nhospital door, you might say: Well, I have a little ache over here. Can \nyou examine that and put me through all the diagnostic tests, \nregardless of what my health plan says and what I have contracted with \nmy health plan to do?\n  That is where the concern is. The issue of poststabilization needs to \nbe addressed; we need to talk more about it. Over the course of last \nnight and, actually, the last several weeks, we have worked very hard \nto look at that poststabilization period. In just a minute, I will turn \nthe floor over to my colleague from Arkansas to talk more about that.\n  The other issue is on cost sharing. We need to make sure there is no \nbarrier there that would prevent somebody going to the closest \nemergency room or the emergency room of choice. It is an issue, I \nbelieve, we, as a body, Democrat and Republican, are obligated to \naddress, to make sure that barrier is not there --again, returning to \nthe patient so if the patient has any question at all, they don't have \nto think about payment and barriers and will they turn me away or, once \nI get in the emergency room, will they refuse to treat, but basically \ncan I get the necessary care.\n  That is what is in the Republican bill. I am very proud of that. Can \nit be improved? Let's discuss it and see if there is anything we can do \nto make it better.\n  That is where we were yesterday, and that is where we are this \nmorning. We will have a number of amendments as we go forward. Right \nnow we are on the Graham amendment on emergency services.\n  At this juncture, on the amendment, I yield the time necessary to the \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank my colleague, the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee. I express not only my appreciation but the appreciation of \nall Senators for the expertise that Senator Frist brings to this \nimportant issue, as well as the care and compassion he has demonstrated \nthroughout his career, even during his time in the Senate, in caring \nfor other people in emergencies. He certainly brings a great deal of \npersonal experience and expertise to this issue.\n  I rise to speak on this issue of access to emergency services and to \nexplain why I believe my colleagues should oppose the Graham amendment. \nThe amendment tree to which the Graham amendment was filed is now full. \nI alert my colleagues to an amendment I will be offering further along \nin the debate--I have been assured of the opportunity to do that--which \nwill address the concerns raised by Senator Graham but, I think, \naddresses them in a far more responsible way.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is Graham of Florida.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. The Senator from Texas asks for that clarification.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment by Senator Graham of \nFlorida, knowing they will have an opportunity to vote for a \nclarification amendment dealing with emergency services later on.\n  My amendment will remove the ambiguity that I think is so evident in \nthe Graham amendment which will create such problems. The Republican \nprovision, as reported out of the HELP Committee, requires group health \nplans covered by the scope of our bill to pay, without prior \nauthorization, for an emergency medical screening exam and any \nadditional emergency care required to stabilize the emergency condition \nfor an individual who has sought emergency medical services as a \nprudent layperson.\n  As I listened to the comments of the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland, it is clear that what the Republican bill does and what my \namendment will do needs clarification for my colleagues, because \nJackie, the example that was given, would be covered, very clearly. The \nprior authorization issue is clearly covered. The closest emergency \nroom issue is covered. The prudent layperson definition is repeatedly \nused.\n  Prudent layperson is defined as an individual who possesses an \naverage knowledge of health and medicine. The purpose of this provision \nis to ensure that a person who has a reason to believe they are \nexperiencing an emergency, according to the prudent layperson standard, \nwill not, cannot, be denied coverage. If they are diagnosed with \nheartburn instead of a heart attack, they are still going to be covered \nunder the prudent layperson definition.\n  In addition, by eliminating the requirement for prior authorization, \nno prior authorization will be required. Jackie doesn't have to make a \nphone call while she is unconscious; no one has to make a phone call \nasking for prior authorization. We ensure that individuals can go to \nthe nearest emergency facility.\n  On the issue of cost sharing, plans may impose cost sharing on \nemergency services, but the cost-sharing requirement cannot be greater \nfor out-of-network emergency services than they require for in-network \nservices.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will be glad to yield when I conclude my comments. \nLet me go ahead because I think I may answer many of those questions as \nI go through.\n  An individual who has sought emergency services from a \nnonparticipating provider cannot be held liable for charges beyond what \nthat individual would have paid for services from a participating \nprovider.\n  Senator Enzi and I offered an amendment to this effect in the \ncommittee, and it was adopted by the committee. That amendment and the \nprovision that is in the underlying Republican bill says that if a \ngroup health plan, other than a fully insured group health plan, \nprovides any benefits with respect to emergency medical care as defined \nin subsection (c), the plan shall cover emergency medical care under \nthe plan in a manner so that if such care is provided to a participant \nor beneficiary by a nonparticipating health care provider, the \nparticipant or beneficiary is not liable for amounts that exceed the \namounts of liability that would be incurred if the services were \nprovided by a participating provider. It is not going to cost the \npatient more if they go to a nonparticipating provider in that \nemergency room than they would if they went to one that was within \ntheir network.\n  As I think was pointed out by my colleague, Senator Frist, and \nSenator Graham of Florida last evening, the committee report language \nneeds clarification on the committee's intention on cost sharing for \nin- and out-of-network emergency services. My amendment will certainly \nmake that clarification.\n  My amendment will also improve the access to emergency services \nprovision reported by the HELP Committee by requiring the plan to pay \nfor necessary care provided in the emergency room to maintain medical \nstability following the stabilization of an emergency medical condition \nuntil the plan contacts the nonparticipating provider to arrange for \ntransfer or discharge. If the plan fails to respond within a very \nnarrow, specific time period, the plan is responsible for necessary \nstabilizing care in any setting, including in-patient admission.\n  We clearly state in the amendment which I will offer that these \nstabilizing services must be directly related to the emergency \ncondition that has been stabilized. I think this was the point Senator \nFrist made so very eloquently: If you do not make that connection, if \nyou do not have the requirement that it has to be related to the \nemergency condition that has been stabilized, then you truly have a \nloophole. You open the door that totally undermines the concept of \ncoordinated care.\n  To understand the true impact of the Republican access to emergency \nservices provision as clarified and improved\n\n[[Page S8315]]\n\nby my amendment, let me offer the following scenarios and show how they \nare addressed by our provision in the bill.\n  Several examples have been repeated a number of times by my \ncolleagues across the aisle. Let me use their examples. They \nspecifically mentioned the case of a mother with a febrile child who \ncalled her health plan before going to the emergency room and was \nrequired to go to an in-network emergency facility, passing several \nnearby facilities on the way. Her child, tragically, had a serious \ninfection which, due to the delay in care, resulted in amputation. \nThere were very moving pictures of this particular child. Under our \nbill, a mother with a sick child will be able to access the closest \nemergency room, and she won't get stuck with the bill because she did \nnot get prior authorization.\n  In a case referred to by my colleague from North Dakota, Senator \nDorgan, if someone has taken a 40-foot fall and has been helicoptered \nto a hospital and delivered to an emergency room in a state of \nunconsciousness with fractured bones in three parts of her body, does \nthat person have a right to emergency care under the Republican bill? \nThe answer is yes, because we eliminate the prior authorization \nrequirement. The case cited by my colleague from Montana, Mr. Baucus, \nwhere a woman came into an emergency room after falling and sustaining \na complex fracture to her elbow, and the emergency physician diagnosed \nthe problem and stabilized the patient. The stabilization process took \nless than 2 hours, but the patient's stay in the emergency room lasted \nfor another 10 hours while the staff attempted to coordinate the care \nwith the patient's health plan. The plan was unable to make a timely \ndecision.\n\n  Under the Republican bill, the woman in this case will not have to \nwait hours on end for a response from her health plan. Under our \nprovision, as improved by my amendment, the health plan must respond to \nthe nonparticipating provider within a specific timeframe to arrange \nfor further care.\n  Under the Democrats' bill, plans are required to pay, without prior \nauthorization, for emergency services and ``maintenance and post \nstabilization services as defined by HCFA [Health Care Financing \nAdministration] and Federal regulations to implement the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997.'' I believe this is where the Democrat provision \ngoes wrong and, quite frankly, it shows where we can make a much-needed \nimprovement to the Balanced Budget Act language.\n  In the September 28th Federal Register, Volume 63, HCFA defines \npoststabilization as ``medically necessary, nonemergency services \nfurnished to an enrollee after he or she is stabilized following an \nemergency medical condition.''\n  Now, that definition is completely vague and completely open-ended. I \nthink it would be a serious mistake to take that language and to \ntransport it into this very important bill.\n  Under this definition, a plan could conceivably be required to pay \nfor services by a nonparticipating provider that are completely \nunrelated to the emergency conditions for which that patient was \ntreated. To go in for one particular emergency, and while you are in \nthat poststabilization period, to say: By the way, I also have a \nproblem here and here; can you deal with that? And then require the \nplan to cover it, I think that would be a very serious mistake. The \nconfusion and the ambiguity in the language is further perpetuated by \nconflicting statements on the meaning of ``poststabilization'' found in \nother places in the regulations.\n  So my amendment will provide for timely coordination of care. It \nensures that the patient will receive the appropriate stabilizing \nservices related to their emergency medical condition. The prudent \nlayperson standard assures that a plan cannot retrospectively deny \ncoverage for an event that was felt to be an emergency medical \ncondition at the time the individual sought emergency care. It \neliminates the prior authorization requirement so an individual can go \nto the nearest emergency facility and not have to worry about whether \nthey are going to be covered if they go to a nonparticipating provider \nand that they might get stuck with the bill.\n  While my colleagues say they are simply adopting what was passed \nunder Medicare, it is my contention that the provision I am offering \nwill be an improvement on what is in Medicare because of the open-\nendedness and ambiguity of the language. I suggest that at some point \nwe are going to have to revisit the Medicare provision and improve it \nas well.\n  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Graham of Florida \nemergency room amendment and vote for the amendment I will be offering \nlater in the debate. Since this amendment tree is now full, I will have \nto offer that at a later point.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator from Arkansas yield?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will be glad to yield if I can yield on your time. \nWe have limited time remaining on our side.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will try to ask short questions, and I will appreciate \nshort answers.\n  One, you signed the committee report which, on page 29, says the \ncommittee believes it would be acceptable to have a differential cost \nsharing for in-network and out-of-network emergency charges. Are you \nsaying that statement of explanation of the bill is incorrect?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I believe that needs to be clarified, and my \namendment will do that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. When will you submit the language that will clarify what \nthe committee report states?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will be glad to do that this morning.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Two, with reference to poststabilization, what the \ncurrent law for Medicare requires, and what this would require, is that \nthe emergency room call the HMO and request the HMO's authorization as \nto what treatment to provide in the poststabilization environment. It \nis only when the HMO is unresponsive--in the case of Medicare, within 1 \nhour. If they fail to respond, then the emergency room has the right to \ndo what it thinks is medically necessary for the patient.\n  Now, did the committee hear any testimony that there had been major \nabuses under the Medicare 1-hour-respond-to-call standard?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. What I suggest to the Senator is that my amendment \nwill make that same requirement, only that the poststabilization \nservices have to be related to the emergency room event.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The question is, Was there any testimony to the kinds of \nabuses you have outlined under the current Medicare law?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I am not certain at this point.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Did the committee hold hearings on this bill, and did \nthey not ask anybody what has happened under the 2\\1/2\\ years of \nexperience we have had with Medicare and Medicaid?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I say to the Senator from Florida that, in fact, \nthere are abuses, I believe----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Can the opponents of this amendment put into evidence \nbefore the full Senate and the American people what those abuses have \nbeen? We have had 2\\1/2\\ years of experience, covering 70 million \nAmericans. If there have been abuses, they ought to be available and \nnot just speculated about.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. In responding to the Senator, if there are no abuses, \nthere should be no concern about clarifying language to ensure that, in \nfact, poststabilization treatment is related to the emergency room \nevent. That is what I believe needs to be done. I think whether or not \nwe can point to specific abuses in Medicare or not, the ambiguity in \nthe language in Medicare is open to those kinds of abuses, and we will \ncertainly see that occur if it is expanded to all managed care plans in \nthe country. We certainly need to clarify that and ensure that the \npoststabilizations are related to the emergency room event.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let me go to a third issue. I discussed this yesterday. \nIn the Republican bill, it states that while the person is stretched \nout in the emergency room under tremendous physical and emotional \nstress, they have the responsibility of monitoring the emergency room \nphysician to determine if the type of diagnosis that the emergency room \nphysician is rendering is appropriate. Could you explain how a person \nin an emergency room circumstance is supposed to provide that\n\n[[Page S8316]]\n\nkind of second-guessing of an emergency room physician?\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. To the extent that the word ``appropriate'' should be \nremoved, our amendment will, in fact, remove that. I don't believe that \nis an accurate reflection of what the Republican underlying bill would \ndo.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is another defect. The use of the word \n``appropriate'' is a gaping loophole.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. And which will be removed and clarified.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am concerned about the further provision which says \nthat the patient is responsible for second-guessing the appropriateness \nof care rendered by the emergency room physician. Is that going to be \ntaken care of?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I do not believe that is an accurate reflection of \nthat provision.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I suggest that the Senator might read the bill and see \nthat it is precisely what the bill says. I am concerned because we had \na discussion last night with Dr. Frist, and now today, which indicates \nthat the Republican proposal has a number of admitted inconsistencies, \ninaccuracies, and gaping holes. Rather than us relying upon an \namendment nobody has seen that is supposed to rectify those, why don't \nwe vote for the Democratic amendment that would solve these problems?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I think I have very clearly outlined what my \namendment will do, and I have expressed very clearly my concerns about \nthe Graham of Florida amendment. I will read right now, if you would \nlike, the entire summary of the amendment and what it would do. I think \nit will respond to the concerns that many of my colleagues on the other \nside simply have misrepresented. What you call ``gaping holes'' simply \nneed clarification, which my amendment will do. It will address it in a \nmuch more rational and responsible way than the very ambiguous language \nthat I believe the Graham amendment contains.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, I just offer a conclusion--not a question but a \nstatement of fact. We have had 2\\1/2\\ years of experience with 70 \nmillion Americans. Our proposal will be available to all Americans in \nthe instances of rampant abuse. I think it is incumbent upon those who \nmake these charges to document it rather than just pontificate.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Reclaiming my time, I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that Mina Addo, Leah Palmer, Jana \nLinderman, and Deborah Garcia be given floor privileges today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday I described a case dealing with \nemergency rooms which I understand my colleague referred to in his \nremarks. I want to go back to that case because I think it describes \nthe difference between our two proposals with respect to protections \nfor emergency room treatment for patients.\n  I described the case of little Jimmy Adams. This is a picture of \nJimmy. This is a picture of a young, healthy Jimmy tugging on his big \nsister's shirt.\n  Here is a picture of Jimmy Adams after he lost both his hands and \nboth his feet because he couldn't get care at the closest emergency \nroom.\n  This is what happened. He was sick with a 104 degree fever. His \nmother called the family HMO. Officials there said you must go to a \ncertain hospital in our network. So his parents loaded Jimmy up at 2 \no'clock or so in the morning and started driving. They had to drive \npast the first hospital, the second hospital, and then drove past the \nthird hospital. Finally they got to the hospital the HMO asked them to \ntake Jimmy to. By that time, Jimmy's heart had stopped. They brought \nout the crash cart, intubated, and revived him. Regrettably, however, \nhe suffered gangrene, and his hands and his feet had to be amputated.\n  Why didn't they stop at the first emergency room? Because they \ncouldn't; the HMO said they won't pay for that. Why didn't they stop at \nthe second hospital emergency room or the third? The HMO won't fully \npay for that care. So they drove over an hour with a young, sick child \nwho, because he didn't get medical treatment in time, lost his hands \nand his feet.\n  Now, my colleague says the Republican plan will solve little Jimmy's \nsituation. Regrettably, it will not. Yes, the Republican plan will \nprovide that that family could stop at that first hospital for \nemergency care, but it also allows the HMO to penalize the family \nfinancially for doing so. It allows the HMO to establish a financial \npenalty for this family to stop at out-of-network hospitals.\n  If their bill doesn't do that, I want to see it. As I read the \nRepublican proposal, they say: We have protections here.\n  In fact, they don't have protections. In virtually every area of the \ntwo proposals on managed care, we see exactly the same thing. They have \nan emergency room provision. Is it better than currently exists? Yes, \nit is better. Does it solve the problem? No. This family would have \nbeen told: If you stop at the first emergency room with Jimmy, we will \nimpose a penalty upon you. We have the right to impose a financial \npenalty for going to the nearest hospital emergency room.\n  If the other side wants to prevent that, I say, join us in supporting \nthe Graham amendment, because we prevent that. We provide real \nprotection for families with respect to emergency room treatment. Our \namendment won't allow an HMO to say: Take that sick child to an \nemergency room but, by the way, you have to go to an emergency room \nfour hospitals; if you stop sooner than that, we will penalize you.\n  That doesn't make any sense to me.\n  This issue is not about theory. It is about real people like Jimmy. \nIt is about what the two pieces of legislation say regarding patient \nprotection. My colleague from Florida, Senator Graham, described the \ndifferences between the two bills on emergency care. He asked the \nquestions and didn't get the answers, because satisfactory answers \ndon't exist with respect to our opponents' proposal. Their proposal is, \nin fact, a shell. It does not offer the protections that we are \noffering in the proposal before the Senate.\n  Mr. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Graham \nin support of access to emergency room care. During consideration of a \nPatients' Bill Rights in the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, I offered a similar amendment in an effort to prevent \ninsurance companies from denying access to life saving emergency care. \nUnfortunately, my amendment was defeated on a straight party line vote.\n  I had offered the amendment because of problems that I have heard \nfrom emergency room doctors and administrators about creative ways \ninsurance companies seek to deny access to emergency care. I offered \nthe amendment because I have seen in my own state of Washington the \ninadequacy of simply saying care is provided if a prudent lay person \ndeems it an emergency. We have a prudent lay person standard in the \nState yet we have seen where patients are turned away and reimbursement \nis denied.\n  The big flaw with the Republican bill regarding emergency room care \nis the lack of coverage of poststabilization care. This is the key \ndifferent between our bill and that offered by the Republican \nleadership. We recognize the importance of not only administering \nemergency services but stabilizing the patient as well.\n  Let me give my colleagues an example of the important of \npoststabilization care; you rush your sick child to the emergency room \nwith a fever close to 105. The fever escalates quickly and without \nwarning. The emergency room doctors and nurses are able to control the \nfever and stabilize the child, but are concerned about determining the \ncause of the fever. They recommend poststabilization treatment to \ndetermine what caused the child to become so ill so quickly. The \ninsurance company denies this treatment and the parents are told to \ntake their child home and hope to get into see their own primary care \nphysician the next day. Later that evening the child's fever escalates \nand the child begins to have seizures as a result. The child is then \nadmitted to the hospital for more expensive acute care.\n  Why was follow-up poststabilization care not provided? What are the \nlong-term effects on the child? Did the insurance company save a dime \nof the\n\n[[Page S8317]]\n\npremium paid by hard working Americans? No, in fact their callous \nbehavior resulted in additional costs that could have been prevented.\n  I cannot imagine anything more frightening than holding a child who \nis experiencing uncontrollable seizures because their tiny body could \nnot endure the impact of a high raging fever. Poststabilization is \nessential.\n  I urge any of my colleagues who think the Republican bill is \nsufficient to talk to ER doctors and nurses. Ask them how a patient is \ntreated when brought into the ER. Let me give you another example that \nwas discovered by the insurance commissioner's office in Washington \nstate:\n  A 17-year-old victim of a beating suffered serious head injuries and \nwas taken to an emergency room. A CAT scan ordered by an ER physician \nwas rejected by the insurance company because there was no prior \nauthorization for this test. In other words, we can stabilize the \npatient, but cannot do any post stabilization treatment to determine \nthe extent of the injuries without seeking authorization from an \ninsurance company hundreds of miles away.\n  Another example, in a state with a prudent lay person standard: The \ninsurance commissioner's office found that an insurance company denied \nER coverage for a 15-year-old child who was taken to the emergency room \nwith a broken leg. The claim was denied by the insurer as they ruled \nthe circumstances did not constitute an emergency. This is outrageous. \nA broken leg is not an emergency? By any standard, prudent lay person \nor medical standard, treatment of a broken leg would be considered an \nemergency.\n  I use these examples of real people and real cases to illustrate the \nflaws in the Republican bill. You can say you cover emergency room care \nand you can keep saying it hoping that it is true. But, unfortunately, \nthe Republican bill does not provide adequate emergency room coverage.\n  I was disappointed in the HELP Committee markup when my amendment was \ndefeated. I had truly hoped that we could reach a bipartisan agreement \non emergency room care coverage. I had seen that we could reach a \nbipartisan agreement when it came to Medicare and Medicaid \nbeneficiaries. We approved these very same provisions for these \nbeneficiaries during consideration of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. \nI had assumed that we would give the same protections to all insured \nAmericans. It was a priority in 1997 and should be a priority in 1999.\n  We have spent a great deal of public and private resources to build \nan emergency health care and trauma care infrastructure that is the \nenvy of the world. This infrastructure has saved millions of lives and \nprovides a standard of care that is hard to beat. Yet policies focusing \non restricting access to this care threaten the very infrastructure of \nwhich we are so proud. The ER doctor must be the one to administer care \nwithout fear of insurance company retaliation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to provide 160 million \ninsured Americans with access to state-of-the-art emergency room and \ntrauma care. Please do not close the emergency room doors on these \nfamilies.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I inquire as to how much time remains \non each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes 43 seconds. The \ntime has expired for the minority.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I will make a couple of \nclarifications. I am puzzled by the reference to a penalty, the \nallegation, the insinuation, that the Republican bill somehow would \nallow a penalty to be charged.\n  S. 326 as reported by the committee requires plans to pay for \nscreening and stabilizing emergency care under the prudent layperson \nstandard without prior authorization, and the plan cannot impose cost \nsharing for out-of-network emergency care that would exceed the amount \nof cost sharing for similar in-network services. There is no \ndifferential. There can be no penalty charged under the Republican \nbill.\n  The amendment I will offer requires that the plans must pay for \nemergency services required. To maintain the medical stability in the \nemergency department plan, the plan contacts the nonparticipating \nprovider to arrange for discharge of transfer. If the plan does not \nrespond--as under Medicare, does not respond--to authorization of a \nrequest within a set time period, the plan must pay for services \nrequired to maintain stability in any setting, including an inpatient \nadmission.\n  The great difference is that under the language of the Graham of \nFlorida amendment, the emergency room could be required to not only \nprovide services unrelated to the emergency event but that the health \ninsurance plan would then be required to pay for and reimburse.\n  It is a glaring ambiguity. It in fact is the gaping hole in the \nlanguage, and it is that which needs to be rejected. I will ask my \ncolleagues to oppose the Graham of Florida amendment because of that \nambiguity of language. Simply taking language from the Medicare \nbalanced budget amendment, transporting that into this without any \nconcern for the poorly defined ambiguous language that is used, I think \nmy colleagues----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I think I have yielded quite enough. We have used \nquite a bit of our time in yielding.\n  I think it is very difficult to argue that treatment in an emergency \nroom should be related to the emergency event. That is what we want to \nensure.\n  We do not believe you can preserve any sense of coordinated care if \nyou require health plans to pay for, in the poststabilization period, \nmedical needs totally unrelated to the emergency that brought that \npatient to the emergency room.\n  That is sufficient for rejection of the Graham of Florida language.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, the time running is the majority's time.\n  Mr. REID. That is because there is no time left on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. With the additional time that the majority has, would \nthey respond to questions on their time? Would they at least cite in \nthe bill the language that they believe is insufficient and creates an \nambiguity?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I inform my colleagues, since we are on \nmanaged time, they are more than welcome to use time on the bill. They \nhave that option, and I am sure the Senator from Nevada will yield to \nthe Senator.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, we can't have quorum calls. The time \nshould be running so that in 10 minutes you can offer your next \namendment. A quorum call is not in keeping with what we are supposed to \nbe doing.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, to respond to my colleague, we have had \nalmost no quorum calls since the debate has begun. I am preparing to \noffer an amendment in a moment. That amendment will be ready.\n  I will suggest the absence of a quorum and send the amendment to the \ndesk momentarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I want to take just one moment to \nrespond to the question that was posed as to our specific concern about \nthe language in the Graham of Florida amendment. The Graham of Florida \namendment adopts the Medicare language. I will quote that Medicare \nlanguage, from the September 28 Federal Register, volume 63. HCFA \ndefines poststabilization, and I quote as I did before:\n\n       . . . medically necessary nonemergency services furnished \n     to an enrollee after he or she is stabilized following an \n     emergency medical condition.\n\n  That is as vague and open-ended as any language I could conceive. It \nis, in\n\n[[Page S8318]]\n\neffect, a blank check for the emergency room, for the provider, for the \npatient. That is the language that needs clarification.\n  We believe the poststabilization medical services that are provided \nmust be related to the emergency event that caused the individual to go \nto the emergency room. That is the clarification that is necessary. I \nwill be delighted to once again go through the amendment summary that I \nwill be offering, but that is a critical flaw in the Graham of Florida \namendment. Because of that flaw in the language, I ask my colleagues to \noppose the Graham of Florida amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator from Arkansas yield? The Senator from \nArkansas will not yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the amendment. The \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I think we have some colleagues who are \nout right now. It is my anticipation the majority leader will want to \nhave the vote afterwards. If my colleague wants me to pursue it, I can \nsend an amendment to the desk or I can ask for a quorum call and we can \ntalk to the leaders to determine what time we want to vote.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I think it would be appropriate. I \nthink there has been a general agreement as of yesterday that we would \nvote sometime this afternoon at the agreement of the two leaders. So I \nthink it would be better to offer an amendment and move this matter \nalong.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, momentarily I will send an amendment to \nthe desk. I ask consent the time be charged on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1236\n\n(Purpose: To protect Americans from steep health care cost increases or \n                loss of health care insurance coverage)\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, one of the big concerns many of us have \nwith the underlying legislation of the so-called Kennedy bill is its \ncost. How much will it cost employers? How much will it cost employees? \nWhat will it cost employees in lost wages? If employers have to pay \nincreased costs for health insurance, are they not paying their \nemployees as much as they would pay them?\n  Health care costs a lot. Many of us would say health care already \ncosts too much. It is unaffordable for millions of Americans. They \nwould like to have it. We have 43 million uninsured Americans today. \nMost of those Americans, I imagine, would like to be insured but they \ncannot afford it. So health care already costs too much. Unfortunately, \nthe bill proposed by Senator Kennedy and many of the Democrats would \nmake it worse. They would make the insurance a lot more expensive and \ntherefore less affordable. As a result, millions of Americans would \nprobably lose their health care insurance. We think that would be a \nmistake.\n  I said yesterday we should make sure we do no harm. We should not \nincrease the number of uninsured. I am afraid the Kennedy bill, with \nits estimated increase of cost of 6.1 percent over and above the \ninflation already expected, would increase the number of uninsured by \nwhat is estimated to be about 1.8 million persons. That is too many. \nThat is far too many. So the amendment I will be sending to the desk, \nas soon as I get a copy of it, will say we should not increase the cost \nof health insurance by more than 1 percent. If we do, the provisions of \nthe bill are null and void.\n  Let's not do any damage. Let's make sure at the outset we say very \nplainly we are not going to increase the cost of health care by more \nthan 1 percent. Let's not increase the number of uninsured by over \n100,000. If we do that, we have done harm, we have done damage, we have \ndone more damage than good.\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of myself, \nSenator Gramm, and Senator Collins, and I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for himself, Mr. \n     Gramm, and Ms. Collins, proposes an amendment numbered 1236.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. EXEMPTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, the provisions of this Act shall not apply with \n     respect to a group health plan (or health insurance coverage \n     offered in connection with the group health plan) if the \n     provisions of this Act for a plan year during which this Act \n     is fully implemented result in--\n       (1) a greater than 1 percent increase in the cost of the \n     group health plan's premiums for the plan year, as determined \n     under subsection (b); or\n       (2) a decrease, in the plan year, of 100,000 or more in the \n     number of individuals in the United States with private \n     health insurance, as determined under subsection (c).\n       (b) Exemption for Increased Cost.--For purposes of \n     subsection (a)(1), if an actuary certified in accordance with \n     generally recognized standards of actuarial practice by a \n     member of the American Academy of Actuaries or by another \n     individual whom the Secretary has determined to have an \n     equivalent level of training and expertise certifies that the \n     application of this Act to a group health plan (or health \n     insurance coverage offered in connection with the group \n     health plan) will result in the increase described in \n     subsection (a)(1) for a plan year during which this Act is \n     fully implemented, the provisions of this Act shall not apply \n     with respect to the group health plan (or the coverage).\n       (c) Exemption for Decreased Number of Insured Persons.--For \n     purposes of subsection (a)(2), unless the Administrator of \n     the Health Care Financing Administration certifies, on the \n     basis of projections by the National Association of Insurance \n     Commissioners, that the provisions of this Act will not \n     result in the decrease described in subsection (a)(2) for a \n     plan year during which this Act is fully implemented, the \n     provisions of this Act shall not apply with respect to a \n     group health plan (or health insurance coverage offered in \n     connection with a group health plan).\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, let me back up a little bit and bring our \ncolleagues, and maybe the public, up to speed as far as where we are \nbecause, from a parliamentary procedure standpoint, this is getting \nmaybe a little bit confusing.\n  The Republicans offered as the underlying vehicle the so-called \nKennedy bill, S. 6, the Patients' Bill of Rights. We did it because we \nwanted to expose that it has a lot of expensive provisions that, \nfrankly, need to be deleted.\n  The Democrats offered a substitute yesterday, the Republicans' \nPatients' Bill of Rights Plus that was reported out of the HELP \nCommittee. They offered that as a substitute.\n  Then Senator Daschle, on behalf of Senator Kennedy, offered a \nperfecting amendment to the substitute--``the substitute'' being the \nRepublican bill--that said that should apply in scope to all plans. The \nRepublican plan basically applies to self-insured plans. It does not \nduplicate State insurance, unlike the Democrats' bill that says we do \nnot care what the States have done; we are going to insist you do \neverything we have dictated. They expanded the scope. That was a first-\ndegree perfecting amendment.\n  The Republicans offered a second-degree amendment yesterday to the \nunderlying first-degree amendment of the Democrats on scope that says \ntwo things: One, we think the primary function of regulating insurance \nshould be maintained by the States. That was in the findings of the \nbill. And then in the legislative language: We should expand access and \ncoverage to health care plans.\n  When the Democrats were so kind as to offer the Republican bill as a \nsubstitute, they forgot to offer our tax provisions. We included one of \nthe tax provisions which we included in our Patients' Bill of Rights \nPlus, and that is 100 percent deductibility for the self-employed. We \nwill be voting on that, and that will be the first vote this afternoon. \nWe will probably be voting on that at the conclusion of Senator Smith's \nstatement or shortly thereafter. I expect that votes will occur on that \nsometime after 3 o'clock, maybe closer to 3:30.\n  The Democrats then were entitled to a second-degree amendment, and \nSenator Graham of Florida offered a second-degree amendment dealing \nwith emergency rooms. Senator Hutchinson and Senator Frist debated \nagainst that and stated they would come up\n\n[[Page S8319]]\n\nwith an alternative dealing with emergency rooms. That will be voted on \nat some later point in the debate.\n\n  This afternoon we will have a debate on the Republican amendment \ndealing with 100-percent deductibility of self-employed persons, and we \nwill have a vote on the Graham amendment dealing with the emergency \nroom provision, and then the next amendment we will actually vote on, \ndepending on whether or not either of these second-degree amendments is \nadopted, will be to the amendment tree or the side to which I just sent \nan amendment.\n  I sent an amendment to the first-degree amendment on the so-called \nKennedy bill. This amendment says, whatever we do, let's not increase \nhealth care costs by more than 1 percent or increase the number of \nuninsured by over 100,000. It is very simple and very plain: Congress, \ndon't do it; whatever you do, whatever mandates you are considering--\nand we recognize and applaud everybody for having good intentions--\nlet's do no harm; let's not increase health care costs by more than 1 \npercent; let's not increase the number of uninsured by over 100,000.\n  If the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that it \nwould increase costs by that amount or increase the number of uninsured \nby that amount, then the underlying bill will not take effect.\n  Those are the basic provisions of the bill. I hope and expect all of \nour colleagues will support this amendment. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi) Who yields time?\n  If neither side yields time, time runs equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from North Dakota 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have not seen the specifics of this \namendment, but I have heard the description. It is interesting to hear \nthis discussion of costs because we already have experience on this \nissue. The President has implemented the Patients' Bill of Rights for \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. This is already in place \nfor Federal employees around the country. And we know what it costs; we \ndon't have to guess. It costs $1 a month. CBO says the patients' \nprotection bill will cost $2 a month. We know it costs $1 a month in \nthe Federal employees health insurance program.\n  The costs that are described by my friend from Oklahoma are inflated \nfor reasons I do not understand. We know what it costs. It costs $1 a \nmonth in the Federal health benefits program, because it is already \nimplemented, and the Congressional Budget Office says it will cost $2 a \nmonth for our Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Let's talk about costs from a different angle for a moment. I find it \ninteresting that, when people talk about costs, they do not talk about \nthe costs that have been imposed upon American citizens who need health \ncare but are denied it by their HMO even though they have paid their \npremiums in good faith. What about the costs imposed on this young boy \nwho was taken past three hospitals to go to the fourth because the \nfamily's HMO would not allow him to stop at the first. What is the cost \nimposed on that young boy who lost his hands and feet or the young boy \nI described yesterday whose HMO denied him therapy because it said a \n50-percent chance of walking by age 5 is a minimum benefit?\n  Or let's talk about other costs, costs on the HMO side.\n  Let me read a table of the 25 highest paid HMO executives. I wonder \nif there is any interest or concern about their salaries while we are \nwithholding treatment for people under the aegis of cost cutting. Let \nme list some of the 25 highest paid CEO executives.\n  Annual compensation, 1997: one CEO makes $30.7 million, another has a \n$12 million salary, a $8.6 million salary, a $7.3 million salary, a \n$6.9 million salary--these are annual salaries--$5.7 million, $5.3 \nmillion, $5.2 million, $5.1 million, all the way down the list of the \n25 highest salaries.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from North Dakota has talked about the salaries \nthese executives make. Mr. President, he has not included the value of \ntheir stock, has he?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have not. I have that on the next page. Let me describe \nthat, starting at the top. Twenty-five companies: $61 million in \nunexercised stock options, on top of the salary, for one person in \n1997, $32.7 million, $19.9 million, $19.0 million, $17 million--all the \nway down the list of 25.\n  It is interesting when people talk about costs. Is there any interest \nin this, any interest in talking about $35 million, $37 million, $38 \nmillion in unrealized stock options?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator add the stock options for that one \nindividual and find out what it comes out to per year?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I do not have it listed quite that way, but I can tell my \ncolleague that the average compensation plus stock options for these 25 \nexecutives is $16.7 million.\n  Mr. REID. It is fair to say it is a huge amount of money; isn't that \ntrue?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Oh, yes. One of them, for example, makes well over $30 \nmillion. Another is over $40 million. Of course that is a substantial \namount of money.\n  The only point I am making is this: There is a lot of money and a lot \nof profit in this system. This has a lot to do with profits in for-\nprofit medicine. On the other side, on the counterbalance, is the care \nfor patients. Some people objected yesterday because we cited examples \nof patients who have been mistreated. They said this debate is not \nabout individual patients. Of course it is. That is exactly what it is \nabout. This debate is not about theory, it is about what kind of health \ncare patients are going to get when they need it.\n  When your child is sick, what kind of treatment is your child going \nto get? Or if your spouse has breast cancer and your employer changes \nHMO plans, will someone say--I ask for 1 additional minute by consent--\nyou cannot keep your same oncologist, you have to change doctors, even \nthough you are in the midst of treatment? If your child needs to go to \nan emergency room, will someone say: We're sorry, you can't go to the \none 2 miles away, you must go to the one 20 miles away? These are the \nkinds of issues, real people with real problems, that this debate is \nabout. That is what this is about.\n\n  Every health organization in the country supports our bill. USA \nToday, in an editorial said: If you want a Patients' Bill of Rights \nfrom the Republican plan, you had better be patient because it doesn't \nprovide a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  There is a difference in these plans. At least we are on the right \nsubject. But while we are on the subject of cost, let's talk a little \nabout who is making the money here--$30 million, $20 million, $15 \nmillion in annual compensation--and then you talk to us about cost. We \ncan't afford $1 a month to provide protection to Jimmy Adams so he can \ngo to the nearest emergency room when he is desperately ill? Of course \nwe can do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Maine.\n  Who yields time?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I yield myself such time on this amendment as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. President, this amendment goes to the heart of this debate. All \nof us agree HMOs must be held accountable for providing the care that \nthey have promised. All of us agree we need a strong appeals process so \nthat anyone who is denied medical treatment or medical care has an \navenue that is cost free, expeditious, and easy to appeal an adverse \ndecision from an HMO. That is not what this debate is about.\n  The debate is whether we solve these problems in a way that is going \nto cause health insurance premiums to soar, thus jeopardizing the \nhealth insurance coverage of millions of Americans, or are we going to \ntake the approach that the HELP Committee bill takes, which is to \naddress these problems in a way that is sensible and that\n\n[[Page S8320]]\n\naddresses the concerns about quality, about unfair denial of care, \nwithout imposing such onerous and expensive Federal regulations that we \ndrive up the cost of health insurance and cause some people to lose \ntheir coverage altogether.\n  That is the heart of this debate. That is the key difference between \nthe bill advocated by my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle \nand the bill which we support.\n  This amendment is simple; it is straightforward. What this amendment \nsays is, if the Kennedy bill, in fact, increases the cost of health \ninsurance along the lines projected by the independent Congressional \nBudget Office, then it would be essentially no longer in effect for \ngroup health plans.\n\n  This is an important amendment. It recognizes that cost is the single \nbiggest obstacle to providing health insurance. It addresses the issues \nthe CBO has outlined in its report in which it warned about what would \nhappen if the Kennedy bill goes into effect. What would happen is, \nunder the Kennedy bill that is before us, 1.8 million Americans would \nmost likely lose their health insurance; employers would drop coverage, \nparticularly small businesses that may be operating on the margin \nalready; self-employed individuals would find health insurance still \nfurther out of reach; and we would further exacerbate the problem of \nthe growing number of uninsured in this Nation.\n  We have a record 43 million Americans without health insurance. We \nshould not be increasing the number of uninsured.\n  So what our amendment does is very simple. It says if there is an \nincrease in health insurance premiums beyond 1 percent, or if the \nnumber of uninsured Americans increases by more than 100,000 people, \nthat we will take a second look, we will put a stop to the mandates \nthat would be imposed by the Kennedy bill.\n  Surely, we should be able to come to an agreement that this is the \nright approach to take. If my colleagues on the Democratic side of the \naisle believe that their bill will not have the kind of cost estimate \nthat the independent CBO says it will have, then they should join with \nus in supporting this amendment because this amendment offers important \nsafeguards.\n  It says the Senate should not be implementing, we should not be \npassing legislation that is going to drive up the cost of health \ninsurance and further increase the number of uninsured Americans--a \nnumber that already stands far too high at 43 million people.\n  By contrast, the Republican approach seeks to expand, not contract, \nthe number of Americans with insurance. We would do that, for example, \nby providing full deductibility for health insurance for self-employed \nindividuals. This is a critical issue in my State of Maine where we \nhave so many Mainers who are self-employed. Perhaps it is in keeping \nwith the independent Yankee spirit of the State of Maine that we do \nhave so many people who run their own businesses. We see them \neverywhere. It is the small businesses on Main Street of every town in \nMaine. It is our lobstermen, our fishermen, our gift shop owners, our \nelectricians, our plumbers. We see it throughout our State. It would be \nthe most important thing that we could do to help them to afford health \ninsurance if we made their health insurance premium fully deductible.\n  So we have a very clear choice. Do we want the Kennedy approach, \nwhich is going to cause health insurance premiums to soar, causing \nsmall businesses to be unable to provide coverage at all and putting \nhealth insurance further out of reach for the 43 million uninsured \nAmericans or do we want the approach that we have proposed through the \nHELP Committee bill?\n  Our legislation addresses the very real problems that do exist with \nmanaged care. Our approach would put treatment decisions back in the \nhands of physicians, not insurance company accountants, not trial \nlawyers. But our approach strikes that critical balance. We do so not \nby so overloading the system that we are going to drive up costs but, \nrather, by putting in commonsense safeguards that will solve the \nproblems with managed care without jeopardizing the health insurance \ncoverage of millions of Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to join, I hope in a bipartisan way, in \nsupporting this very important amendment. It is a way for the Senate to \nput itself on record as recognizing that cost is the single biggest \nobstacle to expanded health insurance coverage. I hope we will have \nbipartisan support for this amendment.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor but reserve the remainder \nof our time.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to respond just a little bit to \nour colleague from North Dakota who said: Well, the Democrat bill would \nonly increase costs by $1 a month. CBO says --I just read the CBO \nreport. CBO does not say it. Or if my colleague would show me where it \nsays that, I would be happy to maybe consume that page on the floor of \nthe Senate. I don't know, but I read rather quickly. Maybe I missed it. \nI read fairly fast.\n  But the section I am looking at in CBO says--this is talking about \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights, S. 6:\n\n       Most of the provisions would reach their full effect within \n     the first 3 years after enactment. CBO estimates the premiums \n     for employer-sponsored health care plans would rise by an \n     average of 6.1 percent in the absence of any compensating \n     changes on the part of employers.\n\n  That is 6.1 percent. The annual premium for health insurance for a \nfamily, according to Peat Marwick, in 1998, in an employer survey, was \n$5,800. And 6.1 percent of that is $355 per year.\n  If you divide that by 12, it is almost $30 a month--not $1 a month; \n$30 a month. That is not even close.\n  So I make mention of this. Again, I think people are entitled to \ntheir own opinion; they are not entitled to their own facts.\n  If CBO says this Kennedy bill only increases costs by $1 a month, I \nwould like to see where it is. I just read the report--April 23, 1999. \nIt says: 6.1 percent.\n  That is a fairly big difference. When I am saying the cost is almost \n$30 a month--$29.50 a month--versus $1 a month, we have a little \ndifference. I am using CBO. Maybe my colleague from North Dakota reads \nit a little differently.\n  I think that is a rather significant difference: $30 a month will \nprice a lot of people out of health insurance. This additional 6-\npercent increase, on top of the 9-percent increase which is already \nprojected, is going to put a lot of people in the uninsured category. \nWe don't want to do that. We should do no harm. We shouldn't put \nmillions of people in the uninsured category.\n  I refer, again, to the CBO report, because I heard my colleague from \nMassachusetts assert that this will only cost a family one Big Mac a \nmonth. I don't know if he is using CBO, but we are using CBO. CBO says \nS. 6, the Patients' Bill of Rights, the Kennedy bill, will increase \nhealth care premiums by 6.1 percent, resulting in an $8 billion \nreduction in Social Security payroll taxes over the next 10 years. This \nis in the report. If Social Security taxes are going down by $8 \nbillion, that means total payroll goes down over that same period of \ntime by $64 billion, total payroll reduction.\n  Employers are going to say: Wait a minute, if you are driving up my \nhealth care costs, I can't pay you as much. I am going to pay you less \nor we will offset this reduction.\n  That is CBO. That is not the Republican organization. That is not Don \nNickles penciling it in. This is CBO, a nonpartisan group, saying there \nis $64 billion in lost wages if we pass the Kennedy bill. That is a \nwhole lot of Big Macs. That is 32 billion Big Macs, if they cost $2 \napiece. That isn't one Big Mac. As Senator Gramm said, you can buy the \nMcDonald's franchises for that. I expect you could.\n  For people who say the cost impact of the Kennedy bill is trivial and \nit would do no damage, if they believe that, have them vote for this \namendment. I hope they will vote for this amendment.\n  We should do no harm. We should not increase the cost of health care \nby more than 1 percent. Shame on us if we do. We should do no harm. We \nshould not increase the number of uninsured. We should not be passing \nbills that make matters worse. Let's work on quality. Let's improve \naccess. Let's make sure more people have health\n\n[[Page S8321]]\n\ncare. Let's not do just the opposite. Let's not uninsure a couple \nmillion people by increasing the cost of health care so dramatically, \nas the Kennedy bill would do. That is the purpose of our amendment.\n  I compliment my colleague from Texas, who has been working on this \namendment as the principal cosponsor with me, and also my colleague \nfrom Maine who spoke so eloquently on it earlier.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield, on the amendment, 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, virtually every provision in both versions \nof the Patients' Bill of Rights starts with a phrase similar to this: \nIf a group health plan or health insurance coverage offered by a health \ninsurer provides any benefits with respect to specialist care, \nemergency service care, primary care, then this is what they have to \ndo. What does that say?\n  One, it says no health plan is required to offer virtually any of the \nservices that are covered by this bill. It is all a matter of free \ncontract between the HMO and those persons to whom an HMO contract is \nbeing sold. The analogy is, what is it that you buy when you sign an \nHMO contract that says you are going to get access to specialists.\n  To stay with the McDonald's example, the question is not what the \nhamburger costs. The question is whether there is any beef inside the \nhamburger or whether all you are paying for with your $2 is a couple of \nbuns.\n  The fact is, if there is an increase in cost, it probably means \npeople aren't getting the kind of services they think they are getting \nwhen they contract with an HMO. We found out, as it relates to \nMedicare, that 40 percent of the complaints by Medicare beneficiaries \nagainst their HMO were in the emergency room. They went to the \nemergency room, they got treatment, and then they were found not to \nhave a heart attack, not to have the onset of a stroke. That was the \ngood news. The bad news was the HMO said: Well, because you went to the \nemergency room and you didn't have a heart attack, we are not going to \npay your bill.\n  Is that the way we want to hold down the cost of care, by having \nessentially a bait-and-switch process built into one of the most \nintimate aspects of an American family's relationships, and that is how \ntheir health care will be provided and paid for?\n  The issue is whether people are going to get what they contracted \nfor. If they don't want to contract for these services and therefore \nhave a lower cost product, they are at liberty to do so.\n  The irony is, to go back to the last discussion we were having on the \nemergency room, the very provision that apparently is going to be \nsubstantially altered, in the unseen, unread, unknown Republican \namendment that is being offered as an alternative to my emergency room \namendment, has to do with poststabilization care. According to the \noldest and one of the largest HMOs in the country, Kaiser-Permanente, \nwhich has voluntarily adopted exactly the procedure we are suggesting \nshould be the standard for emergency room contract provisions, their \nuse of poststabilization has saved them money. How has that happened?\n  Take the case of a child who has a high fever. The parents take the \nchild to the emergency room. It is determined the child does not have a \nlife-threatening condition, but there is uncertainty as to why they \nhave had this high fever.\n  Under the Kaiser plan, the emergency room calls the HMO and says: \nHere is what the situation is with this child. What do you think would \nbe the appropriate medical treatment? The HMO, Kaiser, and the \nemergency room work out a coordinated plan of treatment. In many cases, \nwhat it says is the child can go back home if the child, at 9 o'clock \nin the morning, will come to Kaiser's primary care physician to be \ntreated. That is why Kaiser says it is not only good health but also it \nsaves money.\n  Ironically, the first amendment offered, after it is stated by the \nopposition that they are going to strip, dilute, adulterate this \nprovision which has the potential of saving money, is to offer this \nsaccharin amendment which says: Now we will put a limitation on \nincreases in cost.\n\n  I think we are all concerned about cost. We are all concerned about \nmaking health care more affordable and reducing the number of \nuninsured. But we want people who contract with an HMO to get what they \npaid for, not to get the two buns but no beef in their McDonald's \nhamburger.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  I have to say we often see people do 180 degree turns around here. It \nnever ceases to amaze me to hear our Democrat colleagues savaging HMOs. \nLet us remember they are the people who have been in love with HMOs for \n25 years.\n  In fact, they loved HMOs so much that in these bills virtually \ncrushing this ancient desk--the 1994 Clinton health care bill and the \ntwo Kennedy variations of it--they loved HMOs so much they would have \nset up health care collectives all over the Nation, run by the Federal \nGovernment, and would have fined Americans $5,000 for refusing to join \ntheir health care collective. They loved HMOs so much in 1994, they \nwould have imposed a $50,000 fine on a doctor who prescribed medical \ntreatment that was not dictated or allowed by their Government-run HMO \nhealth care collective.\n  They loved HMOs so much in 1994, if a doctor provided treatment you \nneeded for your baby that was not provided for in their Government-run \nhealth care collective, and you paid him for it, he could go to prison \nfor 15 years. That was their vision of a health care future for \nAmerica.\n  But having loved HMOs so much that they wanted to mandate that \neverybody in America be a member of one run by the Government, now all \nof a sudden they have done a public opinion survey. They have gotten \nfocus groups together, and they have decided Americans are not as much \nin love with HMOs as they are. And so as a result, now they have a bill \nthat doesn't say, as they said in 1994, HMOs are the answer to \neverything. They have a bill that now says HMOs are the problem.\n\n  What we try to do in our bill is fix the problems, but we do \nsomething they will not do: We empower Americans to fire their HMO. We \nallow Americans to buy medical savings accounts, where they have the \nright to choose for themselves.\n  Our Democrat colleagues are adamantly opposed to that freedom because \nthey want the Government to run the health care system. And you can't \nget the Government running the health care system if you start giving \npeople the power to fire their HMO. So they want to regulate the HMOs. \nThey want to give you the ability to contact a bureaucrat if you are \nunhappy. They want to give you total freedom to hire a lawyer. You can \nhire whatever lawyer you want to hire.\n  But what they will not do is give you the ability to hire your \ndoctor. Why don't they want to do it? Because this is simply one step \nin the direction of this health care bill that they want and love, and \nwhich we killed. But in their heart, they still want Government health \ncare collectives, and they want people fined and imprisoned if they \ndon't provide medicine exactly the way the Democrats want it provided.\n  Now they say, well, something is wrong with the Republican bill \nbecause they are not overriding State law. They think that somehow \nSenator Kennedy and President Clinton know more about Texas than the \npeople in the Texas Legislature and the Texas Governor. They believe we \nshould trample State law and we ought to make every decision in \nWashington, DC. We don't agree. They say they want America to know the \ndifference. Please know that this is the difference.\n  If Senator Kennedy and President Clinton know so much about Texas, \nwhen President Clinton finishes in the White House, maybe he ought to \nmove to Texas and run for some public office. It would be an \neducational experience, I can assure you, both for him and the people \nof Texas.\n  But the point is, I am not going to let Senator Kennedy and President \nClinton tell the people in Texas how to run\n\n[[Page S8322]]\n\ntheir State. I am not going to do it either. If I wanted to do that, I \nwould run for the state legislature.\n  Let's get to the issue we are talking about here. The problem with \nthe Kennedy bill is it drives up costs. The problem with the Kennedy \nbill is that the Congressional Budget Office has concluded that the \nKennedy bill would drive up health care costs by 6.1 percent.\n  What that means is two things: One, 1.8 million Americans would lose \ntheir health insurance. Now, granted, if their bill passed, you would \nhave the ability to pick up the phone book, look in the blue pages and \ncall any government agency you wanted; you could hire any lawyer you \nwanted. But 1.8 million people would not have health insurance under \nthis bill. Their bill would drive up health costs for those who got to \nkeep their insurance by $72.7 billion over a 5-year period.\n  Let me convert that into something people understand. By 1.8 million \npeople being denied health insurance because of the cost of all these \nlawyers and Government bureaucrats and therefore losing their insurance \nunder the Kennedy bill, that would mean that in breast exams, 188,595 \nAmerican women would lose breast exams that they would have under \ncurrent law because Senator Kennedy's bill would drive up health \ninsurance costs so much.\n  Because 1.8 million people would lose their health insurance under \nthe Kennedy bill, there would be 52,973 fewer mammograms. Why? Is \nSenator Kennedy against mammograms? Of course he is not. But the point \nis, his bill, by driving up costs, by hiring all these bureaucrats and \nall these lawyers, where 60 percent of what comes out of these lawsuits \ngoes to lawyers and not to people who have been damaged, hurt, or are \nsick--by imposing those new costs, 52,973 women per year would lose \nmammograms that they are getting, which are funded today under their \nhealth insurance policies.\n\n  Under Senator Kennedy's bill, 135,122 women that get annual pap tests \nfunded by their insurance policy would not get them because they would \nlose their insurance.\n  And so that no one thinks I am totally discriminating against men, \nprostate screenings would decline by 23,135. That's 23,135 men who \nwould not get screened, who might die of prostate cancer because \nSenator Kennedy thinks it is more important to be able to hire a lawyer \nthan it is for people to have insurance so that they can get prostate \nscreening.\n  Really, the bill before us is not about doctors. Nothing in Senator \nKennedy's bill lets you choose your doctor or fire your HMO. It lets \nyou choose a lawyer and contact a bureaucrat. In doing so, it drives up \ncosts by 6.1 percent and it denies 1.8 million people their health \ninsurance. As a result, we get less care, not more; we get more \nexpensive care, not cheaper. And anybody that believes that being able \nto hire a lawyer or contact a bureaucrat heals people clearly does not \nunderstand how medicine works.\n  The amendment before us is a very simple amendment. My guess is that \nafter they pray over it a while, everybody will vote for it. It kills \nthe Kennedy bill, no question about that. But I don't think they are \ngoing to want to vote against it because what this amendment says very \nsimply is this: It sets up a triggering mechanism. It says that if this \nbill were to be adopted--which it won't be because we are going to \ndefeat it this week because we have a better bill that works better--if \nit was found and certified that in any year, when fully implemented, \nthis bill would drive up costs by more than 1 percent, the law would \nnot go into effect. Or if in any year more than 100,000 people lost \ntheir health insurance as a result of the cost increase also imposed, \nthen this bill would not be operative.\n  Now we know from CBO estimates that both of these things will occur. \nWe have offered this amendment basically to point out the fact that the \nproblem with the Kennedy bill is that it drives up costs, and it denies \npeople health insurance.\n  Finally, let me say do I believe this is the end game? Suppose for a \nmoment that we could pass their bill, if President Clinton could \noverride every legislature and State, and we could have the Government \ndecide, by law, what is the preferred service, what is the means of \ntreating every disease so we would set by Federal statute all those \nthings. Suppose that we did all those things and drove up health care \ncosts, would the Democrats be happy? No, and neither would the American \npeople.\n  Next year, they would come back with their old faithful, the Clinton \nhealth care bill, and they would say: Medical costs have risen by 6.1 \npercent, 1.8 million people have lost their health insurance, and there \nis only one solution. We have to have the Government take over the \nhealth care system. We will make everybody join an HMO. We will take \ntheir freedom completely away, and, in fact, we will fine them $5,000 \nif they refuse to do it, and we will make doctors practice medicine our \nway. We will fine them $50,000 if they give a treatment we don't \napprove, or we will put them in prison if they provide medical care \nthat is not on our approved Federal list. That will be their answer to \nthe problem they create with this bill. That is what this debate is \nabout.\n\n  I am sure, having looked at their bill, they have done a poll, they \nhave looked at a focus group, and they have determined that somehow \nthey are going to gain some political points by the bill they put \nforward.\n  We have gone about it a little bit differently. We have spent 2 years \nwith people such as Bill Frist--who has actually practiced medicine; \nnot only practiced, he is one of the premier doctors in America--\nputting together a bill that fixes the problems with HMOs, that doesn't \nwrite medical practice into law. If we had written medical practice \ninto law 100 years ago, we would still be bleeding people for fevers.\n  We have put together a bill that tries to deal with abuses in HMOs so \na final decision is made by an independent doctor as to what \n``necessity'' is. We go a step further. We expand freedom so that \npeople get a chance with our reforms, if they are not happy with their \nHMO, they can say something under our bill to the HMO that they can't \nsay under Senator Kennedy's bill. Under our bill, if all else fails, \nthey can say to their HMO: You didn't do the job. You didn't take care \nof me, you didn't take care of my children, and you are fired. I'm \ngoing to get a medical savings account. I'm going to make my own \ndecisions.\n  That is the difference between what Democrats call rights and what \nRepublicans call freedom. Their rights are the right to more \ngovernment, the right to more regulation, the right to look in the blue \npages and call up a government bureaucrat, to look in the Yellow Pages \nunder ``Attorney'' and call up a lawyer.\n  But their health care rights do not include the right to hire your \nown doctor or to fire your HMO. What kind of right is it when you have \na right to complain and petition but you don't have a right to act?\n  Our bill is about freedom, the freedom to choose. That is the \ndifference. Our Democrat colleagues don't support that freedom, because \nthey want a government-run system.\n  Senator Kennedy is not deterred. We may have killed the Clinton-\nKennedy bill in 1994 taking over the health care system, but he dreams \nof bringing it back. If he can win on his bill this week, it is a step \nin that direction. But he is not going to be successful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no time is yielded, the time is shared equally.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to make a couple more comments. I \nthink some people have been loose with facts on saying the Kennedy bill \nwould only cost $1 a month. One Member said it would only cost one Big \nMac a month. That is absolutely, totally false.\n  I have been looking at the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate \nof the Kennedy bill, S. 6, the Patients' Bill of Rights of 1999. I will \nread a couple of provisions. If this report is wrong, I wish to be \ncorrected. Members are making statements that it will only cost $2 a \nmonth, or one hamburger a month--unless they are buying that hamburger \nin Cape Cod or Hyannis Port. Maybe that is $30 a month. It is not a Big \nMac in Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S8323]]\n\n  Page 3 of the CBO report says most of the provisions would reach the \nfull effect within the first 3 years after enactment. CBO estimates the \npremiums for employer-sponsored health care plans would rise by an \naverage of 6.1 percent in the absence of any compensating changes on \nthe part of employers.\n  What would the compensating changes be? CBO says, on page 4, \nemployers could drop health insurance entirely if we pass the Kennedy \nbill. Employers could drop health insurance entirely, which I am afraid \nmany would do. They could reduce the generosity of the benefit package, \naccording to CBO, increase the cost sharing by beneficiaries, or \nincrease the employee's share of the premium.\n  This is CBO. This is not just Don Nickles. This is not some right-\nwing conspiracy. They are saying if health care costs are increased \nthis much, some employers will drop plans. Some employers will say \nemployees have to pay a lot more. Some employers will come up with \ncheaper plans. CBO said some will reduce the generosity of the benefit \npackage, come up with cheaper plans, not cover so much.\n  I thought the purpose of the bill was to improve health care quality, \nnot come up with cheaper plans, not come up with fewer plans, not come \nup with greater uninsured. That is what CBO is saying increased costs \nwould be.\n  How much would it cost? Again, I am a stickler for having facts. What \nis the estimated budgetary impact of the Kennedy bill? CBO says it \nwould reduce Social Security payroll taxes by about $8 billion over the \nnext 10 years, reducing Social Security payroll taxes by $8 billion. \nThat means total payroll goes down by $64 billion. That is a big \nreduction. That is a lot of money coming out. That is a lot of money \nthat people won't receive in wages, according to the CBO, because \nCongress passed a bill. Congress said: We know better; we should \nmicromanage health care from Washington, DC. The net result is lost \nwages of $64 billion. That is not one Big Mac per month.\n  What is the cost per month? Family premium for health insurance, \naccording to Peat Marwick: $5,826 in 1998; 6.1 percent of that is $355 \nper year. That is right at $30 per month an employer would pay. What \ndoes CBO say the employer would do if they were saddled with those \nkinds of increases? They would drop plans, drop health insurance \nentirely, reduce the generosity of the benefit package, increase cost \nsharing by beneficiaries, or increase the employees' share of the \npremium.\n\n  We should use facts. The cost of the Kennedy bill is not one Big Mac; \nit is about $30 a month for a family plan. According to CBO, I am \nafraid a couple of million people, at least 1.8 million people, would \nlose the insurance they already have. We should not do that. That would \nbe a serious mistake.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. FRIST. It is important for us to look at the CBO reports because \nthey have obviously looked at various mandates in this bill. I ask the \nSenator if this is correct. It says:\n\n       CBO finds the bill as introduced [Senator Kennedy's bill] \n     would increase the cost of health insurance premiums by 6.1 \n     percent.\n\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. Does that 6.1-percent increase include the cost of \ninflation in health care? Or is that separate from that?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator makes an excellent point. That is over and \nabove whatever inflation is already anticipated for health care costs.\n  Mr. FRIST. So we have health care inflation. We know we worked hard \nto reduce it, but the rate of health care inflation already is two or \nthree times that of general inflation. So that is already built into \nthe equation. The increase, because of the Kennedy bill, is an \nadditional 6.1 percent; is that correct?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. So we are talking about a potential increase of 9, 10, 11 \npercent in premiums?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Even higher than that. I think the estimate I have, that \nwas done by the National Survey of the Employee-Sponsored Health Care \nPlans, Mercer, which is probably one of the biggest actuaries in health \ncare, estimates a 9-percent increase for next year in health care \ncosts. So if you put 6.1 percent on top of that, that is a 15-percent \nincrease in health care costs for next year.\n  Mr. FRIST. So we have health care going to 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 \npercent, possibly higher because of the bill, coupled with things we \ncannot control. Yet we know this bill is something we can control.\n  For every 1 percent increase in premiums--you say it is going to be \n10, 12, 13, 14, 15--how many people are driven to the ranks of the \nuninsured?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Most of the professionals and actuaries usually estimate \nabout 300,000.\n  Mr. FRIST. The reasons for that seem to me to be fairly obvious. With \npremiums going sky high, and you are a small employer and trying to do \nthe very best to take care of your employees and offer them insurance \nand you are barely scraping by with your margins, as small \nbusinesspeople are working so hard to do, is it not correct that an 11-\n, 12-, 15-percent increase is enough to make you say I just cannot do \nit anymore?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Unfortunately, that is the case.\n  Mr. FRIST. Is it correct, what the CBO says, responding to, ``How \nwill employers deal with these costs?'' Do you agree with what the CBO \nsays:\n\n       Employers could respond to premium increases in a variety \n     of ways. They could drop health insurance entirely, reduce \n     the generosity of the benefit package . . .\n\n  I tell you, as a physician, neither of those sound very attractive to \nme. We have to be very careful in this body that we don't cause them to \ndrop their insurance or decrease their benefits package. I continue \nback with the quote:\n\n       . . . increase cost sharing by beneficiaries . . .\n\n  As an aside, I am not sure we want to throw that increased cost \nsharing on our beneficiaries unless it is absolutely necessary.\n\n       . . . increase the employees' share of the premium. CBO \n     assumed employers would deflect about 60 percent of the \n     increase in premiums through these strategies.\n\n  Mr. President, 60 percent, that is almost unconscionable unless these \nmandates are entirely necessary.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend and colleague. He makes an excellent \npoint. Again, this is CBO saying if we do this, employers are going to \ndrop health insurance or they are going to drop the quality of the \npackage. He makes an excellent point.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Parliamentary inquiry. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. And on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the other side, 5 minutes 51 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this Patients' Bill of Rights is critical. \nFor us to come in and return the balance between physicians and \npatients in managed care--and I think managed care has gone too far--we \nneed to absolutely make sure patients and physicians are empowered so \nthe very best care is given to that patient. It means we in this body \nhave to be very careful not to drive the cost just sky high, through \nthe roof. Why? Because all the information, all the data presented to \nus is if we make these premiums skyrocket people are going to lose \ntheir insurance.\n  We have not talked about that very much. I mentioned it to my \ncolleagues. Is very important to get some insurance coverage. Some \ncoverage gets you into the door. That makes sure you have access to \nhealth care.\n  If we look at the President's own advisory commission on managed \ncare, they were very careful to consider costs. I think we should be, \njust as they were, very careful.\n  This is one of their guiding principles of President Clinton's \nAdvisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health \nCare Industry. They basically say:\n\n       Costs matter . . . the commission has sought to balance the \n     need for stronger consumer rights . . .\n\n  As an aside, we have to do that and accomplish that in this bill we \nhave before us this week.\n\n        . . . with the need to keep coverage affordable . . . \n     Health coverage is the best consumer protection.\n\n\n[[Page S8324]]\n\n\n  I agree with this. We need to come back to this guiding principle and \nconsider cost.\n  We talk about the mandates. Let me say, because I mentioned the \ncommission, we have a lot of mandates in the underlying Kennedy bill. I \nthink we need to go through and see what other people have said about \nthese mandates; are they necessary? Because we know unlimited mandates \nimposed on insurance companies, States, individuals, if they are not \nnecessary, are going to drive costs up and decrease access. If we look \nat the Democratic mandates--and I just put a few on here to see whether \nor not President Clinton's Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection \nand Quality recommended them--you will find the following.\n  Under a medical necessities definition, something we will be debating \nover the next couple of days: Rejected under the President's \ncommission.\n  Under the health plan liability, coming back to bringing the lawyers \ninto the emergency room and suing everyone: Rejected; mandatory repeal \nof standardized data, rejected by President Clinton's commission; \nState-run ombudsman program, rejected by the President's commission; \nrestriction on provider financial incentives, rejected by the \nPresident's commission. All of these are mandates in the Kennedy bill \ntoday, all of which were rejected by the President's own commission.\n\n  Rules for utilization review, section 115 in S. 6, the Kennedy bill: \nRejected by the commission. Provider nondiscrimination based on \nlicensure, rejected by the commission.\n  The point is not so much each of these and the sections I have \nenumerated here, 151, 302, 112, 151. The point is, in this body, as we \ngo forward, we have to be very careful in all of the rhetoric and all \nof our commitment and all of our hard work, legitimately, on both \nsides, to protect patients. We have to be very careful not to go too \nfar out of good intentions, to the point that it is unnecessary, if \nthey do not need those rights, and it also drives the cost up.\n  So when you go through the Kennedy bill and see these mandates, \nPresident Clinton's own Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and \nQuality looked at them, considered them, but rejected them.\n  Why? I cannot tell you for sure why because I was not in the room, \nbut I think it comes back to the amendment we are talking about today \nand to what they have actually said in their guiding principles: Costs \ndo matter.\n\n       The commission has sought to balance the need for stronger \n     consumer rights----\n\n  Just as we are in our Republican Patients' Bill of Rights Plus bill--\n--\n\n       with the need to keep coverage affordable. . . . Health \n     coverage is the best consumer protection.\n\n  I look back at Tennessee. Looking at the uninsured and the costs \nassociated with the underlying Kennedy bill, the number in Tennessee \nthat we throw to the ranks of the uninsured would be 20,872. Again, we \ntalked about the 1.8 million nationwide. Look to our own individual \nStates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will close simply by saying I am very \nglad this amendment was brought to the floor because very early on it \nsays this debate is more, it is in addition to just patient \nprotections. Why? Because the ultimate patient protection means you get \ngood quality of care and you have access to that care. So over the next \nseveral days our primary objective is to increase that quality of care, \nstrong patient protections, but do all that without hurting people, \nwithout throwing them to the ranks of the uninsured.\n  That is our challenge. That is why I am very proud of our underlying \nRepublican bill and look forward to supporting it and gathering more \nsupport as we go over the next several days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If neither side yields time, time will be charged equally.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The side of the Senator from Massachusetts has \n35 minutes; the other side has used up all its time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is our intention to respond to these arguments \nbriefly and then offer an amendment. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, as we see in this institution, there are amendments \nwhich are offered that are poison pill amendments. They are amendments \nthat effectively kill legislation. That is really the purpose of this; \nwe ought to be very clear about it. Senator Gramm of Texas has \nindicated if that amendment is accepted, this whole debate comes to a \nhalt and it ends any possibility of a Patients' Bill of Rights. That is \nwhat we are faced with at this time.\n  We will have an opportunity to judge whether the Senate wants to end \nany consideration of a Patients' Bill of Rights--or whether this is an \nissue that ought to be considered--when we vote on that particular \namendment. We will have a chance to vote on the various amendments we \nhave outlined and presented in different forms. We will continue to \ndiscuss these amendments over the course of this debate.\n  One of the techniques used in this institution--perhaps less so now \nthan in the past--is to present the opposition's arguments with \ndistortion and misrepresentation, and then differ with the distortions \nand misrepresentations. We saw a classic example of that with my good \nfriend, the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm. He went through this whole \nroutine about what was in this bill and then he, in his wonderful way, \ndiffered with it, like only he had common sense and understanding of \nwhat is in that legislation.\n  Before responding to that, I start out with the basic core issues, \nwhich have been raised again and again by those who are opposed to our \nbill: One, costs; and, two, coverage.\n  When all is said and done and after we have listened to the \ndistortions and misrepresentations of our good Republican friends, here \nis, majority leader Trent Lott on NBC ``Meet the Press'' saying: By the \nway, the Democrat's bill would add a 4.8 percent cost.\n  This is the Republican majority leader agreeing with the \nCongressional Budget Office figures. Maybe the other side gets a great \ndeal of satisfaction--they certainly take a lot of time to distort and \nmisrepresent the facts. But let's look at 4.8 percent--or even 5 \npercent--impact on a family's premium over 5 years. The family's \npremium might be $5,000 a year. Looking cumulatively at 5 percent--1 \npercent a year--that would be $250 for the total of 5 years, $50 a \nyear.\n  You can misrepresent the figures, you can distort the figures, you \ncan frighten the American people, which is a common technique; it was \ndone on family and medical leave. Do you remember that argument put out \nby the Chamber of Commerce about the cost of family and medical leave \nto American business? They still cannot document it. Do you remember, \nwhen we had the minimum wage debate, claims about the cost to American \nbusiness? They still cannot document it. As a matter of fact, Business \nWeek even supports an increase in the minimum wage.\n  Now on the third issue, here it comes again, the bought-and-paid-for \nstudies by the insurance industry. That is what these studies are all \nabout. They are bought and paid for by the insurance companies, and \nthey distort and misrepresent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will not yield at this time. You would not yield last \nevening when I was trying to ask Republicans about particular \nprovisions.\n\n  How many times did we hear from the other side: Let's rely on the \nCongressional Budget Office, they know what is best. We were just with \nthe President of the United States. He said every time he sat down with \nthe Republican leadership, they said: We will not do anything unless we \nget the CBO figures.\n  We have given you the CBO figure. The majority leader agrees with the \nCBO figure. Let's put that aside.\n  The second issue is coverage. The issue is whether more people will \nlose their health insurance coverage because we are going to do all of \nthe things that Senator Gramm talked about. I yield to no one on the \npassage of health care in order to expand coverage. The idea that the \ngroups in support of this particular proposal would support a proposal \nwhich means that 2\n\n[[Page S8325]]\n\nmillion Americans would lose coverage is preposterous on its face. On \nthe one hand, they are so busy over here saying: Look who is supporting \nyour program, the AFL-CIO. Do you think they are going to support \nlegislation--I yield myself 2 more minutes--that will cause 2 million \nAmericans to lose coverage? Are we supposed to actually believe that? \nOr all the many groups--I will not take the time to enumerate them--\nthat support a comprehensive program to expand coverage? That is \npoppycock. That is baloney. They even understand that in Texas. It is \nbaloney.\n  The idea that 180,000 women are going to lose breast cancer \nscreening, 52,000 a year are going to lose mammograms, 135,000 women in \nthis country are going to lose Pap tests when the American Cancer \nSociety supports us lock, stock, and barrel--come on, let's get real. \nWhom do you think you are talking to, the insurance companies again? \nCan you imagine a preposterous statement and comment like that coming \nfrom the Senator from Texas? That just goes beyond belief.\n  I will make a final comment or two about freedom. We heard a lot \nabout freedom. Remember that, we heard all yesterday afternoon about \nfreedom? We heard about freedom this morning. We heard about freedom: \nWe are for freedom. The other side is not for freedom, but we are for \nfreedom. Support our position, you will be for freedom.\n  The insurance companies want freedom from accountability. That is \nwhat they want, freedom to undermine good quality health care for \nchildren, for women who have cancer, for the disabled. That is what \nthey want--freedom from accountability and responsibility.\n  That is baloney, too. We want accountability. I am surprised to hear \nfrom the other side all the time about how they want personal \nresponsibility and accountability.\n  I ask for another 2 minutes.\n  They always want personal responsibility and accountability with the \nexception of HMOs. Sue your doctors, fine, but not your HMOs, not your \ninsurance companies, not those that have paid $100 million and \neffectively bought this Republican bill--yes; that is right--those \nprovisions are dictated by the insurance companies.\n\n  That is what we have. The American people are too smart to buy that.\n  I know there are others who want to speak. I yield back my time.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1237 To Amendment No. 1236\n\n(Purpose: To provide coverage for certain items and services related to \n  the treatment of breast cancer and to provide access to appropriate \nobstetrical and gynecological care, and to accelerate the deductibility \n               of health insurance for the self-employed)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for Mr. Robb, \n     for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Reid, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Lincoln, \n     Mr. Daschle and Mr. Byrd proposes an amendment numbered 1237 \n     to amendment No. 1236.\n\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry. That amendment is offered on behalf \nof Senator Robb and others; is that so?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would like to make a few comments. I will not address \nthe amendment that was just sent to the desk, but I would like to \nrespond to my colleague.\n  First, I started to call Senator Frist. Sometimes I call him because \nwe need help on the floor to debate things, such as medical necessity \nor other medical procedures. This time I thought I would call him \nbecause I thought we might need him because I was afraid somebody might \nhave a heart attack getting so excited in the debate.\n  But let me just touch on a couple of comments that my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Kennedy, made. He said: Enough about this cost \nstuff. He said: That was done by some study that was bought and paid \nfor by the insurance companies.\n  Correct me if I am wrong, but I stand corrected if the Congressional \nBudget Office is bought and paid for by the insurance companies. If so, \nI would like to know it. I am not aware of that.\n  My colleague alluded to the fact that Republicans are bought and paid \nfor. He was close to getting a rule invoked. I do not think he meant to \nsay that. I will let that go.\n  I am not going to make allusions that trial lawyers have bought one \nside or that the unions have bought one side, although he did mention \nthat the unions support his bill. It just happens to be that the unions \nare exempt from his bill. That is interesting. They are exempt for the \nduration of their contracts.\n  So his bill basically tells every private employer: You have to \nrewrite your contract next year, except for unions. Oh, if you have \nunions, you don't have to redo it until the end of your contract. If \nthe contract is for 4 years, you don't have to touch it for 4 years. \nBut anybody else, you rewrite it next year.\n\n  Maybe that is the reason the unions have signed on. Maybe there are \nother reasons or other special interest groups that have gotten into \nhis bill.\n  But back to the cost. My colleague says: Well, it is only 1 percent \nper year. CBO says the cost would be 6 percent when it is fully \nimplemented in 3 years--not 5 years. So Senator Kennedy is able to say: \nWell, we think it is about 5 percent over 5 years; therefore, it is a \n1-percent per year cost increase. And employees only pay 20 percent, \nwhich is how he gets his one Big Mac per month. It just does not work. \nIt does not equate. The bill, when fully implemented, is 6.1 percent. \nThat is in 3 years, and the cost is $355 per year.\n  If that happens, you are going to have a lot of people, according to \nCBO--not some study financed by the insurance companies--who are going \nto lose their coverage, a lot of people who are going to get less \nquality coverage, people who are going to have to pay a greater \npercentage of the coverage, people who are going to have to pay a \ngreater percentage of the premiums if we pass the Kennedy bill. That is \nthe bad news. The good news is we are not going to pass it.\n  But I think we have to stay with the facts. The facts are that the \nKennedy bill increases costs dramatically and increases the number of \nuninsured dramatically. That would be a serious mistake. That is \nsomething we are not going to allow to happen.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Before the Senator speaks, may I do two quick things?\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Renato Mariotti, an \nintern, be allowed on the floor during this debate today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that I follow Senator Robb \nafter we get back from caucuses, that I be first in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. President, while I would concede that most Members of this body \nare very concerned about issues that have special relevance to women, \nwe all too often leave much of the advocacy on those issues to women \nwho are colleagues in the Senate. In a legislative body with only 9 \nwomen and 91 men, the amount of time focused on issues of special \nconcern to women is often skewed. As someone who has always\n\n[[Page S8326]]\n\nprided himself on standing up for equality of opportunity, that seems \nprofoundly unfair.\n  Women's health--and, specifically, the choices women have in our \nhealth care system--ought to be a special concern to everyone.\n  As a father of three daughters, I have come to better understand that \nthe types of health care women need and the way they access it are \noften very different from the health care needs of men.\n  Unfortunately, our health care system has long ignored some important \nfacts about women's health. During this important debate on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, I have offered an amendment that would do \nsomething to correct that. I rise to explain the amendment which was \njust sent to the desk which will help women get the medical care they \nneed.\n  The amendment has been crafted with Senators Murray, Boxer, and \nMikulski and will remove two of the greatest obstacles to quality care \nthat women face in our current system today: No. 1, inadequate access \nto obstetricians and gynecologists; and, No. 2, inadequate hospital \ncare after a mastectomy.\n  We know today that for many women, their OB/GYN is the only physician \nthey regularly see. While they have a special focus on women's \nreproductive health, obstetricians and gynecologists provide a full \nrange of preventive health services to women, and many women consider \ntheir OB/GYN to be their primary care physician.\n\n  Unfortunately, some insurers have failed to recognize the ways in \nwhich women access health care services. Some managed care companies \nrequire a woman to first visit a primary care doctor before she is \ngranted permission to see an obstetrician or gynecologist. Others will \nallow a woman to obtain some primary care services from her OB/GYN but \nthen prohibit her from visiting any specialists to whom her OB/GYN \nrefers her without first visiting a standard primary care physician. \nThis isn't just cumbersome to women; it is bad for their health.\n  According to a survey by the Commonwealth Fund, women who regularly \nsee an OB/GYN are more likely to have had a complete physical exam and \nother preventative services--like mammograms, cholesterol tests, and \nPap smears.\n  At a time when we need to focus our health care dollars more toward \nprevention, allowing insurers to restrict access to health \nprofessionals most likely to offer women preventative care only \nincreases the possibility that greater complications and greater \nexpenditures arise down the road.\n  We ought to grant women the right to access medical care from \nobstetricians and gynecologists without any interference from remote \ninsurance company representatives. This amendment is designed to do \njust that.\n  I offer this amendment on behalf of my colleagues because the \nRepublican bill, which has been offered for the purposes of debate by \nSenator Daschle, will not grant women direct access to care.\n  First of all, their bill only covers a limited percentage of the \nwomen who have health care insurance in our country, leaving more than \n113 million Americans without any basic floor for patient protections. \nThen, for the minority of patients that they do cover, the Republicans \noffer only a hollow set of protections but leave many women without \ndirect access to the care they need. While their bill would allow a \nwoman to obtain routine care from an OB/GYN, such as an annual checkup, \nthe bill would not ensure that a woman can directly access important \nfollowup obstetrical or gynecological care after her initial visit. For \nexample, if a woman were to have a Pap smear during a routine checkup \nat her gynecologist, and that Pap smear came back abnormal, the \nRepublican bill would not guarantee that she could access important \nfollowup care from the same doctor.\n\n  Instead, their bill would allow insurers to force her to go back to a \nprimary care gatekeeper physician to get permission for a followup \nvisit to her gynecologist. This may sound unbelievable, but a recent \nsurvey showed that women face this obstacle 75 percent of the time. In \naddition, the Republican bill will now allow a woman to designate her \nOB/GYN as her primary care provider.\n  Their provision ignores one of the basic facts about the ways women \nreceive health care in America today. While OB/GYNs have a special \nexpertise on women's reproductive systems, they are also trained at \nprimary care. For women, their OB/GYN is the only doctor that they see \non a regular basis.\n  Because many of these women consider their OB/GYN to be their primary \ncare physician, they depend on him or her for the full range of \ndiagnostic and preventative services that are offered by other general \npractitioners. Statistics show that women are more likely to have had a \nphysical from an OB/GYN in the past year than from any other doctor. \nOne survey from the University of Maryland showed that OB/GYNs provide \n57 percent of the general physical exams given to women. In another \nsurvey, when asked who they go to for primary care, 54 percent of the \nwomen said it is to their OB/GYN.\n  We know how women access primary care and we know that by allowing \nthem to get this care, their health care will improve. Yet insurers \noften ignore the fact that many women rely on their OB/GYN for primary \ncare, making it more difficult for them to access preventative care and \nother services.\n  Our amendment will grant women more direct access to health care \nprofessionals that they have come to depend upon.\n  The second piece of this amendment will address the inhumane \ntreatment that some women have received after they have experienced the \ntrauma of a mastectomy. Each year, millions of women are screened for \ncancer by mammogram and, sadly, nearly 200,000 of them are diagnosed \nwith breast cancer.\n  The options women face in such circumstances are difficult, and in a \ntime of great uncertainty, women ought not be forced to face \nunnecessary additional burdens. Unfortunately, some women have been \ntold by their health insurer that a mastectomy will only be covered on \nan outpatient basis. Given the trauma that a woman faces with such \nmajor surgery, both physical and emotional, it is unconscionable that \nsome insurers refuse to cover proper hospital care after a mastectomy. \nMuch like the restrictions on access to obstetricians and \ngynecologists, these restrictions on hospital care after such traumatic \nsurgery are simply bad for women's health. After a mastectomy, doctors \ntell us that hospitalization is often critical to foster proper \nhealing, as well as to provide support to women who have just \nexperienced the emotional trauma of such major surgery.\n  Our amendment will return control over this important medical \ndecision to the medical professionals and ensure that doctors who \nactually know and examine their patients, not some distant, impersonal \ninsurance company representative, make decisions about the length of \nstay in the hospital following a mastectomy. It would put into law the \nrecommendations of the American Association of Health Plans, who said \nin 1996, that:\n\n       The decision about whether outpatient or inpatient care \n     best meets the needs of a woman undergoing removal of a \n     breast should be made by the woman's physician after \n     consultation with the patient . . . as a matter of practice, \n     physicians should make all medical treatment decisions based \n     on the best available scientific information and the unique \n     characteristics of each patient.\n\n  Although this commonsense, important provision was included in \nlegislation offered by the other side of the aisle last year, it has \ninexplicably been dropped from their bill this year. We cannot, \nhowever, retreat from our commitment to the health and well-being of \nthe women of America.\n  Finally, this amendment would help self-employed women and, indeed, \nall self-employed Americans better access affordable health insurance \nby making the cost of their insurance fully tax deductible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. ROBB. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine. Are we still recessing at 12:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. That is the order.\n  Mr. ROBB. Finally, this amendment would help self-employed women and, \nindeed, all self-employed Americans better access affordable health \ncare by making the cost of their insurance fully tax deductible. The \ncurrent tax\n\n[[Page S8327]]\n\nsystem penalizes self-employed individuals, and this amendment will \nensure they are treated equally.\n  I am concerned that the bill offered by the other side doesn't even \ncover 70 percent of Americans with health insurance. I am even more \nconcerned, however, that the protections they offered to this limited \nnumber of Americans doesn't reflect the health needs of half of our \npopulation, the women in our population.\n  I know we can do better. We should do better. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment which recognizes the critical needs facing the \nwomen in this country today.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I reserve any time remaining on my \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous unanimous consent, the \nSenator from Minnesota----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that consent \nagreement be vacated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from Washington \nand 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise as a sponsor of this amendment to \nprotect women's health. This amendment offers true security to women; \nit deals with women's access to health care and women's treatment when \nthey receive that care. This amendment ensures women get more than just \nroutine care when they visit their obstetrician/gynecologist and it \nprotects women against the pain and danger of so-called drive-through \nmastectomies.\n  While the underlying Republican bill does allow access to OB/GYN \ncare, the HELP Committee went to great lengths to ensure women only had \naccess for routine care--and nothing more. Let me quote from the \ncommittee report, ``The purpose of this section is to provide women \nwith access to routine OB/GYN care by removing any barriers that could \ndeter women from seeking this type of preventive care.'' While the \nRepublicans recognize the need for direct access, the language of their \nbill and their report makes it clear that direct access is guaranteed \nonly for routine care.\n  Let me explain what that means. If during a routine examination, a \nwoman's OB/GYN finds a lump or an inconsistency in her breast, the OB/\nGYN would not be allowed to refer the patient for further examination. \nInstead, the woman would have to go back to the gate keeper and hope \nthat her primary care physician approved the referral. We should all \nagree this is a waste of time and energy--time and energy that would be \nbetter spent dealing with the potential breast cancer.\n  A recent study conducted by the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists shows that managed care plans are keeping women from \nreceiving the health care they need and seeing the providers they \nchoose. Sixty percent of all women who need gynecological care and 28 \npercent of all women who need obstetric care are either limited or \nbarred from seeing their OB/GYNs without first getting permission from \nanother physician. Once the patient is able to gain access to her own \nOB/GYN, she is forced to return to her primary care gate keeper for \npermission to allow her OB/GYN to provide necessary follow-up care \nalmost 75 percent of the time.\n  What my Republican colleagues fail to understand is that women need \nOB/GYN care for much more than simple routine care. They also fail to \nunderstand the important relationship between a woman and her own OB/\nGYN. OB/GYN providers are often a women's only point of entry into the \nhealth care system.\n  Our amendment would allow women direct access to OB/GYN care and \nfollow-up care as well. It would also allow a woman to designate an OB/\nGYN provider as her primary care physician. We know historically that \nwomen have not been treated equally in receiving health care. We know \nthat some physicians do not treat women with the same aggressive \nstrategies as they treat their male patients, especially when women \ncomplain about depression or stress.\n  What we do know is that OB/GYNs have traditionally been strong \nadvocates for women's health. They understand the physical and \nemotional changes a women experiences throughout her life. The 1993 \nCommonwealth Fund Survey of Women's Health found the number of \npreventive services received by women, including a complete physical \nexam, blood pressure test, cholesterol test, breast exam, mammogram, \npelvic exam, and pap smear, are higher for those whose regular \nphysician is an OB/GYN than for those whose primary care doctor is not. \nWomen are simply afforded greater access to preventive and aggressive \nhealth care services with OB/GYNs.\n  I am not sure why some of my Republican colleagues want to deny \nunobstructed access to important health care services for women. It \ncannot be about costs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that \nthe cost of direct access and primary care by OB/GYNs as only 0.1 \npercent of premiums. If my colleagues are so concerned about costs, \ncan't they at least guarantee that women get the quality health care \nthey pay for? This amendment ensures they will.\n  The other important provision in this amendment prohibits drive \nthrough mastectomies. It is outrageous that current trends in health \ncare could force women to endure a mastectomy on an outpatient basis. \nIt is wrong to send these women home to deal with the emotional and \nphysical pain of the operation--as well as with the responsibility for \ndraining surgical wounds and performing other post-surgical care. These \nwomen should not be abandoned during their time of need.\n\n  However, our amendment does not require a woman to stay in the \nhospital. Our amendment does not require a hospital stay for a set \nnumber of hours. Our amendment does require that the physician, in \nconsultation with the patient, decides how long the woman should remain \nin the hospital. The physician determines what is medically necessary \nand what is in the patient's best interest.\n  I cannot believe there is anyone in this chamber who would want to \nsee a loved one go through a mastectomy and be forced by her insurance \ncompany to go home immediately. If we have any compassion at all we \nshould adopt this provision.\n  Let me respond to one criticism I've heard about this amendment from \ninsurance companies. Some have claimed they do not have a policy of \ndrive through mastectomies. I commend them and hope they would support \nthis amendment to prohibit this cruel practice by other companies. I \nwould also add that while most insurance companies may not engage in \nthis kind of outrageous behavior today, how can we insure they will not \ntomorrow?\n  Our amendment is about protecting and improving women's health. For \nthat reason, the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists support it. \nIf my colleagues truly consider themselves champions of women's health, \nthey must vote for this amendment. I can assure you that women will not \nbe fooled by the empty promises in the Republican bill. We know the \ndifference between routine and comprehensive OB/GYN care. We know how \ntraumatic and life-altering a mastectomy can be. We know we need real \nprotection and this amendment provides it.\n  Mr. President, I especially thank Senator Robb for his leadership on \nthis issue.\n  He is right. There are only nine women in the Senate. We shouldn't \nhave to rush to the floor to defend all of the women in this country \nevery time an issue comes up that affects women's health. This is an \nissue that affects men as well. It affects their daughters, their wives \nand mothers, their aunts. I appreciate Senator Robb and his leadership \nin making sure that women are protected when it comes to their health \ncare.\n  Senator Robb did an excellent job of outlining what our amendment \ndoes. It does two basic things:\n  It allows a woman the right to choose an OB/GYN as her primary care \nphysician. As every woman in this country knows, their OB/GYN, their \nobstetrician/gynecologist, is the doctor they go to, whether it is for \npregnancy, whether it is for breast cancer, whether it is for health \ncare decisions that affect them later on in life. We want to make sure \nthat women have access to those doctors without having to go back to a \nprimary care physician.\n  When a woman is pregnant and she gets an ear infection, she may be \ntreated dramatically different than someone\n\n[[Page S8328]]\n\nelse who has an ear infection, for example. A woman needs to have \naccess to the OB/GYN, and this amendment Senator Robb and I and the \nother Democratic women are offering assures the woman that access.\n  Secondly, it deals with the so-called drive-through mastectomy \nlegislation where too many HMOs today are telling a woman after this \nradical surgery----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Too many women today are told they need to go home \nbefore they are ready to take care of themselves or their families. \nThis amendment doesn't designate a time. It says the doctor will \ndetermine whether that woman is ready to go home after this radical \nsurgery.\n  I commend my colleagues for this issue. I urge the Members of the \nSenate to stand up, finally, for women's health and vote for this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Robb and Senator Kennedy for their \nsupport of this very crucial legislation. We, the women of the Senate, \nreally turn to men we call the ``Galahads,'' who have stood with us and \nbeen advocates on very important issues concerning women's health.\n  Often we have had bipartisan support. I ask today that the good men \non the other side of the aisle come together and support the Robb \namendment. We have raced for the cure together. We have done it on a \nbipartisan basis. Certainly, today we could pass this amendment. I \nchallenge the other party to vote for this amendment because what it \nwill do is absolutely save lives and save misery.\n  There are many things that a woman faces in her life, but one of the \nmost terrible things that she fears is that she will go to visit her \ndoctor and find out from her mammogram and her physician that she has \nbreast cancer. The worst thing after that is that she needs a \nmastectomy. Make no mistake, a mastectomy is an amputation, and it has \nall of the horrible, terrible consequences of having an amputation. \nTherefore, when the woman is told she can come in and only stay a few \nhours--after this significant surgery that changes her body, changes \nthe relationships in her family, she is told she is supposed to call a \ncab and go back home; it only adds to the trauma for her.\n  Well, the Robb amendment, which many of us support, really says that \nit is the doctor and the patient that decides how long a woman should \nstay in the hospital after she has had the surgery. Certainly, we \nshould leave this to the doctor and to the patient. An 80 year old is \ndifferent than a 38 year old. This legislation parallels the D'Amato \nlegislation that had such tremendous support on both sides of the \naisle. I say to my colleagues, if we are going to race for the cure, \nlet's race to support this amendment.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Byrd is on his way here. He has \nasked for 1 minute. If the Senator from Oklahoma would indulge me, he \nshould be here momentarily. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd \nbe entitled to 1 minute when he gets here, which should be momentarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time remains before the recess?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent allows 1 minute.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak for \nnot to exceed 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is finally \nconsidering managed care reform legislation. I believe that the \nDemocratic version of the Patients' Bill of Rights is the right vehicle \non which to bring reform to the nation.\n  Our colleague from Virginia, Mr. Robb, has offered an amendment that \nhighlights an important aspect of managed care that needs to be fine-\ntuned, and that is women's access to health care. This amendment would \nallow a woman to designate her obstetrician/gynecologist (ob/gyn) as \nher primary care provider and to seek care from her ob/gyn without \nneeding to get preauthorization from the plan or from her primary care \nprovider. Even though many women consider their ob/gyn as their regular \ndoctor, a number of plans require women to first see their primary care \nprovider before seeing their ob/gyn. This means that a costly and \npotentially dangerous level of delay is built into the system for \nwomen. This amendment would allow a woman's ob/gyn to refer her to \nother specialists and order tests without jumping through the \nadditional hoop of visiting the general practitioner.\n  This amendment would also address the care a woman receives when \nundergoing the traumatic surgery of mastectomy. This provision would \nleave the decision about how long a woman would stay in the hospital \nfollowing a mastectomy up to the physician and the woman. Some plans \nhave required that this major surgery be done on an outpatient basis. \nIn other instances, women have been sent home shortly after the \nprocedure with tubes still in their bodies and still feeling the \neffects of anesthesia. This should not be allowed to happen. Plans \nshould not put concern about costs before the well-being of women.\n  The Republican bill does not provide women with sufficient access to \ncare. Plans would not be required to allow women to choose their ob/gyn \nas their primary care provider. In addition, the Republican bill would \nallow health plans to limit women's direct access to her ob/gyn to \nroutine care which could potentially be defined by a plan as one visit \na year. In addition, ``drive-through mastectomies'' would not be \nprevented under their bill.\n   Mr. President, the Robb amendment contains commonsense protections \nwomen need and deserve. I urge my colleagues to support this important \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/13/senate-section/article/S8328-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as many of you know, it \nhas been a very difficult period of time for me these past several \ndays. I want to recognize the sacrifices of my wife and three children \nover the past several weeks as I agonized through this gut-wrenching \npolitical decision. My wife, Mary Jo, and my daughter, Jenny, and son, \nBobby, and son, Jason, have had to endure the ups and the downs and the \ndifficulties of making such a decision. I am deeply grateful to them \nfor their support and comfort because, without\n\n[[Page S8329]]\n\nthem, I could not really have gotten through it all.\n  My first political memories are of talking to my grandfather, who was \na died-in-the-wool Republican. He always said he would vote for a \ngorilla on the Republican ticket if he had to. I remember conversations \nwith him about the Dewey-Truman campaign. He was obviously for Dewey. \nIt didn't work out very well. But I can also remember having \nconversations with my classmates, telling them that I, too, was for \nDewey and explaining why I was for Dewey in that election.\n  At that time I was 7 years old. Years went by, and, in 1952, in the \nEisenhower-Stevenson election, I was 11 years old. I bet a friend, who \nlived down the road and had a farm, a dollar versus a chicken that \nEisenhower would win the election. I won, and my grandfather \nimmediately drove me down to my neighbor's farm to pick up the chicken \nI had won. The young man's parents graciously acknowledged that I won \nthe bet and provided me a nice barred rock hen that laid a lot of eggs \nover the next year or so.\n  In 1956, I volunteered to pass out literature for Eisenhower, and, as \na college student, I worked for Nixon in 1964. But 1964 was the first \nelection I voted in. Barry Goldwater's campaign was the one that really \nsparked my conservative passions. I worked as a volunteer in the Nixon \ncampaigns in 1968 and 1972, but it wasn't like the Goldwater campaign. \nI remember walking into the booth, saying, this is a man I really \nbelieve in, and I said I really felt good about that vote.\n  In 1976, these conservative passions were again awakened while I \nworked for the conservative Ronald Reagan in the New Hampshire \nprimaries against the incumbent President of the United States, Gerald \nFord--not an easy thing to do for a lot of us who were basically \ngrassroots idealists, if you will, who believed that Ronald Reagan \nshould win that primary. In those days I was not a political operative; \nI was not a Senator; I was not a candidate; I was not an elected \nofficial. I was a teacher, a coach, a school board member, husband, \nfather, small businessman--just an ordinary guy who cared about his \ncountry. I got involved because I cared, and I believed deeply in the \nRepublican Party.\n  I came to this party on principle, pretty much initiating with Barry \nGoldwater but certainly finalized with Ronald Reagan. I was \ndisappointed in Reagan's loss in 1976 because I believed that \ngrassroots conservatives in the party, who had worked so hard for \nReagan, lost to what I considered the party elitists, the \nestablishment, who were there for Ford because he was President, not \nwith the same passion that was out there for Reagan.\n  Watching that convention in 1976, I remember those enthusiastic \ngrassroots party members who were unable to defeat that party machinery \nthat was so firmly behind the incumbent President. I remember seeing \nthe tears in their eyes, and the passion. It was a difficult decision. \nIt was close, as we all remember--just a few delegates. That was 1976. \nAt that time, as a result of the election, it inspired me to run for \npolitical office for the first time.\n\n  When Reagan sought the nomination again in 1980 I ran in the primary, \nhoping to be part of this great Reagan revolution. Reagan was pro-life. \nHe was for strengthening our military. He was anti-Communist. He was \npatriotic. He brought the best out in the American people. I was \nexcited. In all those years that Reagan was President, the criticism, \nthe hostile questions, the political cheap shots, he rose above it all. \nAnd most of them, indeed probably all who criticized him, weren't \nqualified to kiss the hem of his garment. He rose above them all. He \nwas the best.\n  As a result of that, I began a grassroots campaign in 1979, and I \nlost by about a thousand votes with seven or eight candidates in the \nrace, including one candidate, ironically, who was from my hometown. It \nwas tough, but I decided to come back again in 1982, after losing, \nbecause I still wanted so much to be a part of the Reagan revolution. \nSo I did come back in 1982. And that, my colleagues and friends, is \nwhen I had the first taste of the Republican establishment.\n  I had a phone call that I thought was a great sign. I had a call from \nthe National Republican Party. Boy, was I excited. They told me that \nsome representatives wanted to come up to New Hampshire from Washington \nto meet with me. They came to New Hampshire. We sat down at a meeting. \nIt was brief. They asked me to get out of the race, please, because my \nopponent in the primary had more money than I did and had a better \nchance to win. I had been a Republican all my life, a Republican in \nphilosophy, but that was my first experience with what we would call \nthe national Republican establishment. I did not get out of the race. I \nbeat my wealthy opponent in the primary, and I received the highest \nvote percentage against the incumbent Democrat that any Republican had \never received against him, and it was 1982, which was a pretty bad year \nfor Republicans, as you all remember.\n  In 1984, several candidates joined the Republican primary again for \nan open seat in the Reagan landslide. Now everybody wanted it because \nthe seat was open. I was just a school board chairman from a small town \nof 1,500, no political power base, no money, but I beat, in that \nprimary, the president of the State senate, who was well known, and an \nUnder Secretary of Commerce who was well financed. They still do not \nknow how I did it, but it was door to door, and I fulfilled my dream of \ncoming to Washington as part of the Reagan revolution in Congress.\n  I then had successful reelections in 1986 and 1988 and, of course, \nwas elected to the Senate in 1990 and 1996. In the Reagan era, as in \nthe Goldwater era, the pragmatists took a back seat to those who stood \non principle. Idealists ruled; those who stood up for the right to \nlife, a strong national defense, the second amendment, less spending, \nless taxes, less government. Man, it was exciting. Even though we were \na minority in the Congress, it was exciting because Reagan was there. \nPrinciples in, pragmatism out. Man, it was great to be a Republican.\n  In 1988, a skeptical--including me--conservative movement rallied \nbehind the Vice President in hopes that he would continue the \nrevolution.\n  The signal that this revolution was over was when the President broke \nhis ``no new tax'' pledge. We let pragmatism prevail. We compromised \nour pledge to the voters and our core principles, and we allowed the \nDemocrats to take over the Government.\n  In 1994, idealism again came back. The idealistic wing of the party \ntook charge. Led by Newt Gingrich, we crafted an issues-based campaign \nembodied in the Contract With America. We put idealism over pragmatism, \nand we were rewarded with a tremendous electoral victory in 1994, none \nlike I have ever seen. I remember sitting there seeing those results \ncome in on the House. I was happy for the Senate, but I was a lot \nhappier for the House. Those of us who were there know how it felt.\n  As we moved into the 1996 elections, we again began to see this tug-\nof-war between the principal ideals of the party and the pragmatism of \nthose who said we need ``Republican'' victories. Conservatives became a \nproblem: We have to keep the conservatives quiet; let's not antagonize \nthe conservatives, while the pragmatists talked about how we must win \nmore Republican seats. Conservatives should be grateful, we were told, \nbecause we were playing smart politics, we were broadening the case. \nElect more Republicans to Congress, elect more Republicans to the \nSenate and win the White House. What do we get? Power. We are going to \ngovern.\n  In meeting after meeting, conference after conference, the pollsters \nand the consultants--and I have been a part of all of this. Mea culpa, \nmea culpa, mea maxima culpa. I have been involved in it. I am not \nsaying I have not, but the pollsters and consultants advised us not to \ndebate the controversial issues. Ignore them. We can win elections if \nwe do not talk about abortion and other controversial issues, even \nthough past elections have proven that when we ignore our principles, \nwe lose, and when we stick to our principles, we win. In spite of all \nthis, we continued to listen to the pollsters and to the consultants \nwho insisted day in and day out they were right. Harry Truman, a good \nDemocrat--my grandfather did not like him, but I did--said, ``Party \nplatforms are contracts with the people.'' Harry Truman was right.\n  Why did we change? We won the revolution on issues. We won the \nrevolution\n\n[[Page S8330]]\n\non principles. But the desire to stay in power caused us to start \nlistening to the pollsters and the consultants again who are now \ntelling us, for some inexplicable reason, that we need to walk away \nfrom the issues that got us here to remain in power. Maybe somebody can \ntell me why.\n  Some of the pollsters who are here now who we are listening to were \nhere in 1984. Indeed, they were here in 1980 when I first ran. I had \nalways thought the purpose of a party was to effect policy, to advocate \nprinciples, to elect candidates who generally support the values we \nespouse, but it is not.\n  Let me be very specific on where we are ignoring the core values of \nour party.\n  ``We defend the constitutional right to keep and bear arms,'' says \nthe platform of the Republican Party, but vote after vote, day after \nday, that right is eroded with Republican support. I announced my \nintention to filibuster the gun control bill. Not only does it violate \nthe Republican platform, but it violates the Constitution itself, which \nI took an oath to support and defend.\n  Then I hear my own party is planning to work with the other side to \nallow more gun control to be steamrolled through the Congress which \nviolates our platform. Not only does it violate our platform, it \ninsults millions and millions of law-abiding, peaceful gun owners in \nthis country whose rights we have an obligation to protect under the \nConstitution.\n\n  The Republican platform says:\n\n       We will make further improvement of relations with Vietnam \n     and North Korea contingent upon their cooperation in \n     achieving a full and complete accounting of our POWs and MIAs \n     from those Asian conflicts.\n\n  Sounds great. So I got up on the floor a short time ago and offered \nan amendment saying that ``further improvement of relations with \nVietnam are contingent upon achieving a full and complete accounting of \nour POWs and MIAs. . .''--right out of the platform word for word. \nThirty-three Republicans supported me. The amendment lost.\n  The platform says:\n\n       Republicans will not subordinate the United States \n     sovereignty to any international authority.\n\n  Only one--right here, Bob Smith--voted against funding for the U.N. I \ncan go through a litany--NAFTA, GATT, chemical weapons, and so forth. \nVote after vote, with Republican support, the sovereignty of the United \nStates takes a hit in violation of the platform of the Republican Party \nand the Constitution.\n  The establishment of our party and, indeed, the majority of our party \nvoted to send $18 billion to the IMF. Let me make something very clear. \nI am not criticizing anybody's motives. Everybody has a right to make a \nvote here, and there is no argument from me on that. But I am talking \nabout the relationship between the platform and those of us who serve.\n  This $18 billion came from the taxpayers of the United States of \nAmerica, and it went to a faceless bureaucracy with no guarantee that \nit would be spent in the interest of the United States. We have no idea \nwhere this money will go and no control of it once it goes there.\n  Meanwhile, while $18 billion goes to the IMF, I drive into work and I \nfind Vietnam veterans and other veterans lying homeless on the grates \nin Washington, DC, in the Capital of our Nation. How many of them could \nwe take care of with a pittance of that $18 billion?\n  As Republicans who supposedly support tax relief for the American \nfamily, can we really say that $18 billion to IMF justifies taking the \nmoney out of the pocket of that farmer in Iowa who is trying to make \nhis mortgage payment? Can we really say that? I do not think so.\n  Another quote out of the Republican platform:\n\n       As a first step in reforming Government, we support \n     elimination of the Departments of Commerce, Housing and Urban \n     Development, Education, and Energy, the elimination, \n     defunding or privatization of agencies which are obsolete, \n     redundant, of limited value, or too regional in focus. \n     Examples of agencies we seek to defund or privatize are the \n     National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for \n     the Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and \n     the Legal Services Corporation.\n\n  That is right out of the Republican platform. If I were to hold a \nvote today to eliminate any of these agencies, it would fail \noverwhelmingly, and it would be Republican votes that would take it \ndown. Every Republican in this body knows it.\n  Can you imagine how much money we could save the taxpayers of this \ncountry if we eliminated those agencies and those Departments that the \nplatform I just quoted calls for us to eliminate? It is not what I call \nfor; it is what our party platform calls for. Why don't we do it? The \nanswer is obvious why we don't do it: because we do not mean it, \nbecause the platform does not mean it. We do not mean it.\n  In education, our platform:\n\n       Our formula is as simple as it is sweeping: The Federal \n     Government has no constitutional authority to be involved in \n     school curricula or to control jobs in the workplace. That is \n     why we will abolish the Department of Education, end Federal \n     meddling in our schools, and promote family choice at all \n     levels of learning. We therefore call for prompt repeal of \n     the Goals 2000 and the School to Work Act of 1994 which put \n     new Federal controls, as well as unfunded mandates, on the \n     States. We further urge that Federal attempts to impose \n     outcome- or performance-based education on local schools be \n     ended.\n\n  If I were to introduce a bill on the Senate floor to end the \nDepartment of Education, to abolish it, how many votes do you think I \nwould get? How many Republican votes do you think I would get?\n  If, as Truman said, it is a contract, then we broke it. Where I went \nto school, breaking a contract is immoral, it is unethical, and it is \nunprincipled, and we ought not to write it if we are going to break it. \nLet's not have a platform.\n  Our party platform says also:\n\n       We support the appointment of judges who respect \n     traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human \n     life.\n\n  Listen carefully, I say to my colleagues.\n  In 1987, when President Ronald Reagan nominated Robert Bork to the \nSupreme Court, six Republicans voted against him, and he was rejected. \nWhat was Robert Bork's offense? That he stood up for what he believed \nin, that he was pro-life? He told us. He answered the questions in the \nhearing. God forbid he should do that. But when President Clinton \nnominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an ACLU lawyer who is stridently pro-\nabortion, only three Republicans voted no--Senator Helms, Senator \nNickles, and myself.\n  Of course, all of the Republicans who voted against Bork voted for \nGinsburg. I voted against Ginsburg because, as the Republican platform \nsays, I want judges who respect the sanctity of innocent human life. I \nwant my party to stand for something. Thirty-five million unborn \nchildren have died since that decision in 1973--35 million of our \nbest--never to get a chance to be a Senator, to be a spectator in the \ngallery, to be a staff person, to be a teacher, to be a father, a \nmother--denied--35 million, one-ninth of the entire population of the \nUnited States of America. And we are going to do it for the next 25 \nyears because we will not stand up. And I am not going to stand up any \nmore as a Republican and allow it to happen. I am not going to do it.\n  Most interestingly, since that Roe V. Wade decision was written by a \nRepublican, I might add, a Republican appointee, and upheld most \nrecently in the Casey case, it is interesting there was only one \nDemocrat appointee on the Court, Byron White, who voted pro-life. He \nvoted with the four-Justice, pro-life minority. Five Republican \nappointments gave us that decision.\n  We are to blame. This is not a party. Maybe it is a party in the \nsense of wearing hats and blowing whistles, but it is not a political \nparty that means anything.\n  About a week ago, my daughter, who works in my campaign office, told \nme the story of a 9-year-old girl whose dad called our office to say \nthat his little daughter, 9-year-old Mary Frances--I will protect her \nprivacy by giving only her first name--had said that she was born \nbecause of an aborted pregnancy, not an intentional one, an aborted \npregnancy, a miscarriage at 22 weeks--22 weeks, 5\\1/2\\ months--and she \nlived.\n  She is 9 years old. She said: I want to empty my piggy bank, Senator \nSmith, and send that to you because of your stand for life because I \nknow that children who are 5\\1/2\\ months in the womb can live.\n  That is power.\n\n[[Page S8331]]\n\n  Let me read from the pro-life plank of the Republican Party:\n\n       [W]e endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth \n     Amendment's protections apply to unborn children.\n\n  Anything complicated about that? Anything my colleagues don't \nunderstand about that?\n\n       We endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth \n     Amendment's protections apply to unborn children.\n\n  We are not going to apply any protections to unborn children. We will \npass a few votes here, 50-49, if you can switch somebody at the last \nminute. I have been involved in those. Yes, we will do that, but we \nwill not win. We are not going to commit to putting judges on the \ncourts to get it done. Oh, no, we can't do that because we might lose \nsome votes. So meanwhile another 35 million children are going to die.\n  This year I sponsored a bill out of the platform that says the 14th \namendment's protections apply to unborn children. Do you want to know \nhow many sponsors I have? You are looking at him. One. Me. That is it. \nNot one other Republican cosponsor.\n  In his letter to me--nice letter that it was--from Chairman \nNicholson, he claims that ``every one of our Republican candidates \nshares your proven commitment to life''--he says. Gee, could have \nfooled me. Then how come every candidate isn't endorsing the bill or \nspeaking out on the platform if they don't want to endorse the bill?\n\n  The party, to put it bluntly, is hypocritical. It criticizes Bill \nClinton, a Democrat, for vetoing partial-birth abortion and for being \npro-abortion, but it does not criticize our own. It does not criticize \nthe Republicans who are pro-choice. So why criticize Bill Clinton? Or \nwhy criticize any Democrat? We cannot get it done. We don't say \nanything about those people.\n  How about the Governors who vetoed the bill, the partial-birth \nabortion bill? You know, there are a lot of fancy words in the \nRepublican platform. Every 4 years we go to the convention and we fight \nover the wording. Sometimes even a nominee says: Well, I haven't read \nit. At least he is being honest. Or, which is probably more the truth, \nwe just ignore it. It is a charade. And I am not going to take part in \nit any more. I am not going to take part in it any more.\n  In the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' after his own \npolitical party has launched attacks on him for daring to raise an \nindependent voice, Jimmy Stewart's character is seated on the steps of \nthe Lincoln Memorial, and here is what he says: ``There are a lot of \nfancy words around this town. Some of them are carved in stone. Some of \n'em, I guess, were put there so suckers like me can read 'em.''\n  You ought to watch the movie. It is a good movie. It will make you \nfeel good.\n  Mr. President, I have come to the cold realization that the \nRepublican Party is more interested in winning elections than \nsupporting the principles of the platform. There is nothing wrong with \nwinning elections. I am all for it. I have helped a few and I have won \nsome myself, and there is nothing wrong with it. But what is wrong with \nit is when you put winning ahead of principle.\n  The Republican platform is a meaningless document that has been put \nout there so suckers like me and maybe suckers like you out there can \nread it. I did not come here for that reason. I did not come here to \ncompromise my values to promote the interests of a political party.\n  I came here to promote the interests of my country. And after a lot \nof soul-searching, and no anger--no anger--I have decided to change my \nregistration from Republican to Independent. There is no contempt; \nthere is no anger. It is a decision of conscience.\n  Many of my colleagues have called me, and I deeply appreciate the \nconversations that I have had privately with many of you on both sides, \nbut I ask my colleagues to respect this decision. It is a decision of \nconscience. Millions and millions of Independents and conservative \nDemocrats and members of other political parties have already made this \ndecision of conscience. As a matter of fact, there are more \nIndependents than there are Republicans or Democrats.\n  I would ask you to give me the same respect that you give them when \nyou ask them to vote for you in election after election. Indeed, we win \nelections because of Independents.\n  I found a poem, written by a man by the name of Edgar Guest, which my \nfather, who was killed at the end of the Second World War, when I was 3 \nyears old, had placed in his Navy scrapbook in 1941, just prior to \ngoing off to war in the Pacific--newly married about 2\\1/2\\ years. I \ncan imagine what was going through his mind. But he placed it in his \nscrapbook and highlighted it.\n\n  I am just going to quote one excerpt. The poem is entitled, ``Plea \nfor Strength.''\n\n       Grant me the fighting spirit and fashion me stout of will,\n       Arouse in me that strange something that fear cannot chill.\n       Let me not whimper at hardship.\n       This is the gift that I ask.\n       Not ease and escape from trial,\n       But strength for the difficult task.\n\n  Many have said that what I am doing is foolish. I have heard it from \na lot of people--friends and colleagues. But you know what Mark Twain \nsaid--I think the Chaplain will like this:\n\n       I am a great and sublime fool. But, then I am God's fool. \n     And all His works must be contemplated with respect.\n\n  I called Senator Lott last week personally. It was the most difficult \ntelephone call I think I had ever made.\n  I told him it was my intention to continue to vote in caucus with the \nRepublicans, if he wanted me, provided that there was no retaliatory or \npunitive action taken against me. He was very gracious. He didn't like \nit--I don't blame him--but he was gracious. I appreciate his \nunderstanding, and I appreciate the compassion and understanding of \nmany of my colleagues on both sides who have spoken with me these past \nfew days.\n  I made another phone call, Mr. President. I called the chairman of \nthe Republican Party, Mr. Jim Nicholson, last week to inform him of my \ndecision and asked him if he could please maintain confidentiality \nuntil I had a chance to make my decision public. Before I had a chance \nto do that--indeed, about 20 hours after I had made the call--my home \nwas staked out in New Hampshire. Where I was going to visit friends, \ntheir homes were staked out, sometimes until late into the evening, by \nthe media, because the chairman put out a letter attacking me \npersonally.\n  I am not going to dignify the letter by reading it here on the Senate \nfloor. I do ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed into the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Republican National Committee,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1999.\n     Hon. Robert C. Smith,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith, I am writing concerning published \n     reports that you have decided to abandon the Republican party \n     and seek the Presidential nomination of a third party \n     instead.\n       I believe this would be a serious mistake for you \n     personally, with only a marginal political impact--and a \n     counterproductive one, at that.\n       This would not be a case of the party leaving you, Bob, but \n     rather of you leaving our party. Far from turning away from \n     the conservative themes we both share, the party has \n     championed them--and become America's majority party by doing \n     so.\n       I truly believe, Bob, that your 1% standing in New \n     Hampshire doesn't reflect Republican primary voters' \n     rejection of your message, but rather its redundancy. Every \n     one of our Republican candidates shares your proven \n     commitment to life and to the goals of smaller government, \n     lower taxes and less regulation of our lives and \n     livelihoods--as does the party itself. In other words, I hope \n     you do not confuse the success of our shared message with \n     your own failure as its messenger.\n       I also urge that you reconsider turning your back on your \n     many Republican friends and supporters, people who've always \n     stood by you, even in the most difficult and challenging \n     times. Most of all, I hope you will think of your legacy: it \n     would be tragic for your decades of work in the conservative \n     movement to be undone by a short-sighted decision whose only \n     negligible impact would be to provide marginal help to Al \n     Gore, the most extreme liberal in a generation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jim Nicholson,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I will only characterize the letter in \nthe following way: It is petty, it is vindictive, and it is insulting. \nIt is beneath the dignity of the chairman of any political party. It is \nan affront to the millions of voters who choose not to carry\n\n[[Page S8332]]\n\na Republican membership card but have given the party its margin of \nvictory in election after election.\n  Remember that little girl I talked to you about a little while ago, \nMary Frances? I do not know what she is going to grow up to be. She \nmight be a Democrat. She might be a Republican. Maybe she will be an \nIndependent. Maybe she won't vote. I don't know. But I'll tell you \nwhat, in the old baseball tradition, I wouldn't trade her for 1,000 Jim \nNicholsons, not in a minute.\n  There was talk on the shows this weekend that I might be removed as \nchairman of the Ethics Committee. I must say, I was disappointed at the \nintensity of the attacks on me by unidentified sources, I might add, in \nthe Republican Party. Interestingly, one of those reports was that the \nparty is considering suing me for the money it spent during my \nreelection.\n  I want to make it very clear, because press reports were inaccurate \non one point. Senator McConnell called me personally yesterday to \nclarify that this particular report of a lawsuit is not true, and I \naccept his answer as absolute fact with no question. But some faceless \nparty bureaucrat had a really good time writing that and then leaking \nit to the press. That is what is wrong with politics. He ought to be \nfired, but you will never find out who it is.\n  Another interesting report was that a different party operative \npresumed to suggest that ``Smith should be booted out of the conference \naltogether if he is not a Republican; he shouldn't be in the Republican \ncaucus.'' I wonder how much he is being paid to sit up there using up \nthe party faithful's contributions to write that kind of garbage.\n  The chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party, where for 15 \nyears I have been a member, went on ``Crossfire'' the other night to \ndebate Bob Smith, but Bob Smith wasn't there to answer for himself. He \ntook the anti-Bob position. He attacked me viciously, saying it was a \nselfish move and that it meant the end of my political career.\n  There is something a little strange in that. If it is selfish and I \nam throwing away my political career, maybe somebody can explain what \nhe means. Not a mention of 15 years of service to the State and to the \nparty. Even Bill Press said: Can't you find something nice to say about \nBob?\n  That is what is wrong with politics. It is the ugly. It is the bad. \nIt is the worst. It is the worst.\n  In 1866 Abraham Lincoln said this--it is a very famous quote:\n\n       If I were to try to read, much less answer, all the attacks \n     made on me, this shop might as well be closed for any other \n     business. I do the very best I know how, the very best I can, \n     and I am going to keep right on doing so until the end. If \n     the end brings me out all right, what is said against me \n     won't amount to anything. If the end brings me out wrong, 10 \n     angels swearing I was right will make no difference.\n\n  Lincoln really knew how to say it. In a way, perhaps Chairman Duprey \nis right about my being selfish. I am putting my selfish desire to save \nmy country ahead of the interests of the Republican Party, and some \nnameless, faceless bureaucrat in the party machinery decides to take \noff on me. I wish he would surface. I would like to meet him.\n\n  If that is selfish, then Duprey is right. If putting your country \nahead of your party, if standing up for the principles you believe in \nis wrong, maybe it is time to get out of politics.\n  Over the past 15 years I have traveled all over America helping \nRepublican candidates. I don't very often ask for help. I don't \nremember ever asking for help from the Republican Party to do it. I \nspent hours and hours on the phone raising money. And the party has \nhelped me; I will be the first to admit it. Some have made a big deal \nout of that. They should help me. I think that is what the party is \nthere for. I went to California, Louisiana, Iowa, Missouri, and North \nCarolina during the last year on behalf of Republican candidates. It \nhad nothing to do with my Presidential campaign; it was entirely on \nbehalf of other candidates. When the chairman of the senatorial \ncommittee asked Members to pony up money, he gave me a bill. He said: \nYou have X in your account, and you owe me $25,000. I wrote him a check \nthe next day. Everybody didn't do it though, did they, Mr. Chairman?\n  I have a bureaucrat out there somewhere in the party saying throw me \nout of the caucus. Frankly, I gave without hesitation because I \nbelieved things were changing. I don't take a back seat in my \nwillingness as a Republican to help candidates in need. But oh, no, I \nhave committed the unforgivable sin here in Washington; I have exposed \nthe fraud. It is a fraud, and everybody in here knows it.\n  It is true in both parties that the party platform is not worth the \npaper it is written on. That is why I am an Independent. That is why I \nam going to stay an Independent, whatever happens in the future. I am \nstill the same formula. I am still Classic Coke. I am not a new Coke. I \nam the same ingredients. I have merely redesigned the label. It is the \nsame Bob Smith. My colleagues over there looking for help, you are not \ngoing to get it. You know where my votes come from, so don't get \nexcited.\n  In my travels, I have attended hundreds of Republican Party events, \nbut the most consistent message I hear from the voters is one of \nfrustration, deep frustration that the party is not standing on \nprinciple. Last year CQ published a list of leading scorers on party \nunity. This is a list they do every year, ranking the most loyal \nRepublican votes.\n  It is interesting because I don't look at them as loyalty votes. I \njust make the votes. Well, guess what. Let's see--Larry Craig was here. \nHe is not here right now. Larry Craig and I were No. 1--very \ninteresting, when you look down the list. So I am No. 1 in party \nloyalty. How many major committee chairmen in the conference are on the \nlist? Take a look at the list. I am not going to embarrass colleagues.\n  I am the most reliable Republican vote in the Senate, but I am \nattacked--not by colleagues, not by colleagues. It is obvious from \nthese kinds of attacks that it is not about me. What it shows is a \ncomplete and final divorce between the party machinery and the \nprinciples for which it professes to stand. I say, with all due respect \nto my colleagues in the Senate, whether you are running a campaign for \nPresident or whether you are in the House or something else, we have to \nstop it. We have to get a handle on it. I think it is true in the other \nparty as well.\n  We have to get a handle on it. They don't represent us well. It is an \ninjustice to the candidates who run for and the people who serve in the \nRepublican Party, and it has to stop. It is a cancer, and it is eating \naway at the two great political parties that rose to power; in this \ncase, the Republican Party that rose to power on the moral opposition \nto slavery; and it killed the Whig Party, because it wouldn't stand up \nagainst slavery. It will kill the Republican Party if it doesn't stand \nup for what it believes in, especially against abortion.\n  I told you I watched the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes To Washington'' again \nover the weekend. I remember talking to Mike Mansfield, who was here a \nfew weeks ago for one of the seminars that the leader puts on. He said \nthat after he left the Senate was the first time he really went around \nand looked at the monuments; he read the writings; he took the time to \nsmell the roses. He said: These just aren't hollow words or statues \nanymore; they have meaning to me.\n  This morning--I am not trying to be melodramatic--but I did it. I \nleft early, about 5:45. I took Jimmy Stewart's example from the movie \n``Mr. Smith Goes To Washington.''\n  I went to the Lincoln Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial, the Vietnam \nWall, and the Arlington Cemetery where my parents are buried. I tried \nto smell the roses. Do you know what? These aren't memorials to people \nwho fought for political parties. Lincoln helped to destroy his own \npolitical party. On that visit to Arlington this morning, I stopped at \nmy parents' grave site. My father didn't fight for a political party. \nHe didn't die for a political party. He fought for his country, as \nmillions of others have done, and the ideals for which it was founded. \nI looked out at those stones all across Arlington Cemetery, and I \ndidn't see any R's or D's next to their names. Then I went to the \nVietnam Wall, and I didn't see any R's or D's next to anybody's name \nthere. How about that?\n  Like Jimmy Stewart's character in the movie, I stand right here at \nthe desk of Daniel Webster, one of the greatest lawyers of all time, \none of the greatest Senators of all time, whose\n\n[[Page S8333]]\n\npicture is on statues everywhere. Most people probably could not even \ntell you what party he belonged to, unless you are a history buff. Who \ncares what party he belonged to? You will remember that he stood up \nagainst slavery, and his quote, ``Nothing is so powerful but the \ntruth.'' And the opposite was John C. Calhoun, Henry Clay, the great \norators of their time. You remember them for what they were and what \nthey said, not for their party. Webster was an abolitionist and Calhoun \nthe defender of slavery.\n  Calhoun said:\n\n       The very essence of a free government consists in \n     considering offices as public trusts, bestowed for the good \n     of the country, and not for the benefit of an individual or a \n     party.\n\n  We have lost sight of it. Man, there is so much history in this \nplace. My wife conducts tours for people from New Hampshire and at \ntimes people she finds on the streets. If we would just take a few \nmoments away from the bickering and the arguing and look around and \nenjoy it, do you know what. It would inspire us. It inspired me today. \nMaybe I should be doing it every day. Every year, a Senator is chosen \nto read Washington's Farewell Address. I have been here 9 years and was \nnever asked. I never understood how that person gets picked, but they \ndo. How many of us have actually taken the time to sit and listen to \nthat Farewell Address? Well, Washington, in that Farewell Address, \nwarns us that:\n\n       The common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party \n     are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise \n     people to discourage and restrain it.\n\n  He spends a large part of his speech expounding on this point, and I \nencourage my colleagues to read it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the relevant sections of Washington's \nFarewell Address be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. In the spirit of what Washington is \nsaying, I think we need to rid ourselves of the nastiness and the \npartisanship that has destroyed the comity of this great body and has \nbecome a barrier to a full and spirited discussion of the issues in \nAmerica generally. You may say: That is pretty good coming from Smith; \nhe is as partisan as they come. There is a time and place for \npartisanship. Harry Reid knows when I put the partisanship at the door. \nHe knows, as cochair of the Ethics Committee with me.\n  Americans deserve an honest debate, an honest exchange of ideas. They \nwant us to put these partisan interests aside. It is not partisan if \nsomebody is against abortion or is for abortion; it is issue generated.\n  Americans want people who will lead, not follow polls. The American \npeople are losing the faith in their ability to effect change, and \nrightfully so.\n  Since I came to Washington, I have seen Senators and Congressmen come \nand go. Do you know what. I will tell you what doesn't go. I refer to \nthe entrenched political industry that is here to stay. Oh, it changes \na little bit at the top when somebody else becomes the chairman. But \nthe entrenchment is still there. The pollsters, the spin doctors, and \nthe campaign consultants are all there. They all have their hands in \nyour pockets, and they are doing pretty well.\n  They run the show, for the most part. They don't directly choose \ncandidates in the sense of a smoke-filled backroom, but they do \ninfluence it because they are the ones who tried to talk me out of \nrunning in 1980--the same ones.\n  Some of the pollsters in the party have been around since I first \ncame to town. Every time there is a Republican retreat--and I assume it \nis the same for the other party--and often at Republican conferences \nhere in the Senate, we hear from the professional consultants and \npollsters. They tell us what the message should be. They tell us how to \nmake ourselves look good and how to make the other guys look bad.\n  We need to get out the fumigation equipment. We need to clean out the \npollsters, the consultants, the spin doctors, and the bloated staffs \nwho tell us what to say, how to say it, when to say it, and how long to \nsay it. The American people elected us. Isn't it time we start thinking \nfor ourselves and leading?\n\n  This well-paid political industry, let me tell you, colleagues, is \nnot interested in whether or not you believe in the issues of your \nparty. Don't kid yourselves. This is about power, access, and jobs. I \ncan have tea and crumpets with the President of the United States if I \nhelp him win it. As long as you look like a winner, it doesn't matter \nwhat you believe. Don't kid yourselves. They seek out the candidates \nwho have the package they want--name ID, money, slickness. But, most \nimportantly, they want candidates who won't make waves, or say anything \ncontroversial about an issue that might cost us a seat. They package \nyou, wrap you up, put a little bow on it, tell you what to say, and \nthen they sell you to the American voters.\n  The political professionals tell us all the time, ``Don't be \ncontroversial; it can cause you to lose your election.''\n  Why are we afraid of controversy? Was Lincoln afraid of it? Was FDR? \nWas Calhoun? Was Washington? With controversy comes change--positive \nchange sometimes. Imagine Patrick Henry, striding up to the podium in \n1773 before the Virginia Assembly, prepared to give his great speech: \n``Give me liberty or give me . . .'' and then he turns to his pollster \nand says: I wonder whether they want liberty or death. I better take a \npoll and find out.\n  Let's not declare our independence; that is pretty controversial. \nThey could have said that in 1776. Let's not abolish slavery; that is \ncontroversial.\n  In the 1850s, the great Whig Party said:\n       Let's not talk about slavery, it's too controversial. Let's \n     put the issue aside and focus on electing more Whigs.\n  But a loyal Whig Congressman named Abraham Lincoln thought otherwise.\n  The pollsters come into the hallowed Halls in meetings of Senators to \ntell us how we can talk to people, to all the men who are 35 and over, \nwhat to say to them; and women 25 and under, what to say to them; to \nSocial Security people; to black people; and what we should say to \nHispanics; or white people; what do we say to pro-choice or to pro-\nlife. Pollsters, pollsters, pollsters.\n  We are looking at polls to decide whether or not to go to Kosovo. We \ntake a poll to decide whether or not we should send our kids to die in \na foreign country. Did Roosevelt do a poll on whether or not to \nretaliate against the Japanese? Partisanship is poisoning this town. \nThe pollsters are poisoning this town. Help members of your own party \nand destroy the other guy.\n  My proudest moment in the Senate in the 9 years I have been here--\nother than some of the meetings Harry Reid and I have had together \nwhere we have to discuss the futures of some of you quietly--was when \nwe went into the Old Senate Chamber and talked during the impeachment \ntrial. You know it, all of you; it was the best moment we have had \nsince we have been here. We took the hats off and we sat down and \ntalked about things, and we did it the right way.\n  I wanted to have every caucus that we had on the impeachment trial \nbipartisan; I didn't want any separation. But we didn't get that. Boy, \nwhat a delight it would have been had we done that. I am not saying it \nwould have made the difference; maybe it would not have. But that is \nnot the purpose of bringing it up. It is my belief that if we had come \ntogether and looked at the evidence--you never know.\n  I am proudest of my service on the Senate Ethics Committee where six \nSenators, including my good friend, Senator Reid, and I, discuss issues \nwithout one iota of partisanship.\n  When we investigated Bob Packwood, a fellow Republican came up to me \nafter that vote in which we voted to expel a colleague, and he was \nangry. He was a powerful Republican, and this was not an easy \nconversation. He scolded me, saying, ``I can't believe that you would \nvote to expel a fellow Republican. It's outrageous. How can you do \nthat?'' I said, ``You will have the opportunity to sustain or overrule \nthat vote on the floor of the Senate very shortly.''\n  He came back later and said: Thank you for saving me a difficult \nvote.\n  We on the committee ignored the partisan mud balls. We did what was \nright.\n  I am not ashamed of being a member of a political party. The question \nis, Does party take precedence over principle? I want the 21st century \nto be remembered for debating important and\n\n[[Page S8334]]\n\ncontroversial issues in public: Abortion, taxes, size of government, \nrestoring our sovereignty, gun control, moral decadence, freedom. Don't \navoid these issues simply to help our own political fortunes or to \ndestroy our opponents.\n  Lt. William Hobby, Jr., wrote a poem called ``The Navigator'' during \nthe Second World War. I think it captures the vision and spirit of what \nI believe America should be.\n\n     The Morning Watch is mustered, and the middle watch withdrawn\n     Now Ghostlike glides the vessel in the hush before the dawn.\n     Friendly gleams polaris on the gently rolling sea,\n     He set the course for sailors and tonight he shines for me.\n\n  We have the opportunity to take America into the 21st century of \nfreedom, morality, support for the Constitution, respect for life, \nrespect for the sacrifices made for us by our founders and the millions \nof veterans who have given so much of their precious blood. Politics \nshould be about each one of us joining together to rediscover our moral \ncompass, to reignite the torch of freedom, to return to our \nnavigational chart: The Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, \nand the Bible.\n  In conclusion, in the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' Jimmy \nStewart portrayed a U.S. Senator who believed that America was good, \nthat politics was good, and that the American people deserve good, \nhonest leaders. I agree.\n  Chaplain Ogilvie said to me a few weeks ago:\n\n       Our time in History is God's gift to us. What we do with it \n     is our gift to him. Let's not squander it with petty partisan \n     politics.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              Excerpts from Washington's Farewell Address\n\n\n                   To the people of the United States\n\n  Friends and Fellow Citizens: The period for a new election of a \nCitizen, to administer the Executive Government of the United States, \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived, when your \nthoughts must be employed in designating the person, who is to be \nclothed with that important trust, it appears to me proper, especially \nas it may conduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, \nthat I should now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to \ndecline being considered among the number of those, out of whom a \nchoice is to be made.\n  I beg you, at the same time to do me the justice to be assured, that \nthis resolution has not been taken, without a strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation, which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness; but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in, the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what \nappeared to be your desire.--I constantly hoped, that it would have \nbeen much earlier in my power, consistently with motives, which I was \nnot at liberty to disregard, to return to that retirement, from which I \nhad been reluctantly drawn.--The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign Nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.--\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of Parties in the State, \nwith particular reference to the founding of them on Geographical \ndiscriminations.--Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn \nyou in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the Spirit \nof Party, generally.\n  This Spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind.--It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all Governments, more or less stifled, controuled, \nor repressed; but, in those of the popular form, it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.--\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism.--But this leads at length to a more \nformal and permanent despotism.--The disorders and miseries, which \nresult, gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose \nin the absolute power of an Individual: and sooner or later the chief \nof some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his \ncompetitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own \nelevation, on the ruins of Public Liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight,) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of Party are sufficient to make it \nthe interest and duty of a wise People to discourage and restrain it.--\n  It serves always to distract the Public Councils, and enfeeble the \nPublic administration.--It agitates the community with ill-founded \njealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother, foments occasionally by riot and insurrection.--It opens the \ndoors to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated \naccess to the Government itself through the channels of party passions. \nThus the policy and the will of one country, are subjected to the \npolicy and will of another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the Administration of the Government, and serve to keep alive the \nSpirit of Liberty.--This within certain limits is probably true--and in \nGovernments of a Monarchical cast, Patriotism may look with indulgence, \nif not with favour, upon the spirit of party.--But in those of the \npopular character, in Governments purely elective, it is a spirit not \nto be encouraged.--From their natural tendency, it is certain there \nwill always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose,--and \nthere being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be, by force \nof public opinion, to mitigate and assuage it.--A fire not to be \nquenched; it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a \nflame, lest, instead of warming, it should consume.--\n  It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those entrusted with its \nadministration, to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres; avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment to encroach upon another.--The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism.--A just \nestimate of that love of power, and proneness to abuse it, which \npredominates in the human heart, is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position.--The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories, and constituting each the Guardian of the \nPublic Weal against invasions by the others, has been evinced by \nexperiments ancient and modern; some of them in our country and under \nour own eyes.--To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute \nthem. If in the opinion of the People, the distribution or modification \nof the Constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be \ncorrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution \ndesignates.--But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, \nin one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary \nweapon by which free governments are destroyed.--The precedent must \nalways greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient \nbenefit which the use can at any time yield.--\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, Religion and morality are indispensable supports.--In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of Patriotism, who should labor to \nsubvert these great Pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of Men and Citizens.--The mere Politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them.--A volume could not \ntrace all their connexions with private and public felicity.--Let it \nsimply\n\n[[Page S8335]]\n\nbe asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, \nif the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are the \ninstruments of investigation in Courts of Justice? And let us with \ncaution indulge the supposition, that morality can be maintained \nwithout religion.--Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure--reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect, that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.--\n  'T is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government.--The rule indeed extends with more or \nless force to every species of Free Government.--Who that is a sincere \nfriend to it, can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the \nfoundation of the fabric?--\n  Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge.--In proportion as the structure of \na government gives force to public opinion, it is essential that the \npublic opinion should be enlightened.--\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all Nations. Cultivate peace \nand harmony with all. Religion and Morality enjoin this conduct; and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it?--It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \nPeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence.--Who can \ndoubt that in the course of time and things, the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages, which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected \nthe permanent felicity of a Nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature.--\nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachment, for others should be excluded; and that in place \nof them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated.--\nThe Nation, which indulges towards another an habitual hatred or an \nhabitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \nanimosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it \nastray from its duty and its interest.--Antipathy in one nation against \nanother disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay \nhold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable, \nwhen accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur.--Hence frequent \ncollisions, obstinate, envenomed and bloody contests.--The Nation \nprompted by ill-will and resentment sometimes impels to War the \nGovernment, contrary to the best calculations of policy.--The \nGovernment sometimes participates in the national propensity, and \nadopts through passion what reason would reject;--at other times, it \nmakes the animosity of the Nation subservient to projects of hostility \ninstigated by pride, ambition, and other sinister and pernicious \nmotives.--The peace often, sometimes perhaps the Liberty, of Nations \nhas been the victim.--\n  So likewise a passionate attachment of one Nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils.--Sympathy for the favourite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the \nenmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the \nquarrels and wars of the latter, without adequate inducement or \njustification: It leads also to concessions to the favourite Nation of \nprivileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the Nation \nmaking the concessions; by unnecessarily parting with what ought to \nhave been retained, and by exciting jealously, ill-will, and a \ndisposition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal privileges are \nwithheld; and it gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens, \n(who devote themselves to the favourite Nation) facility to betray, or \nsacrifice the interests of their own country, without odium, sometimes \neven with popularity:--gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense \nof obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a \nlaudable zeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of \nambition, corruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \nPatriot.--How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practise the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small \nor weak, towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be \nthe satellite of the latter.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it, which is so natural to a man, who views \nin it the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations;--I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in \nwhich I promise myself to realize, without alloy, the sweet enjoyment \nof partaking, in the midst of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence \nof good Laws under a free Government,--the ever favourite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labours \nand dangers.\n                                                  GEO. WASHINGTON.\n  United States,\n      17th September, 1796.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/13/senate-section/article/S8335-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8335-S8367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 1999\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1237\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we \nwere in the process of debating the Robb amendment dealing with \nmandatory length of stays for mastectomies. That is a second-degree \namendment to an amendment I offered on behalf of myself, Senator Gramm, \nand Senator Collins that had a limitation on the cost. The cost of the \nunderlying bill cannot exceed 1 percent, nor could it increase the \ncosts or increase the number of uninsured by over 100,000 or the bill \nwould not be in effect.\n  Senator Robb's amendment strikes the amendment that limits the 1-\npercent cost. It is our intention to finish the debate on the Robb \namendment. We will vote on the Robb amendment, and it will be our \nintention for the Republican side to offer a second-degree amendment. \nWe will debate that amendment and vote on it and work our way through \nthe amendments that have been stacked today.\n  I ask the Parliamentarian how much time remains on the Robb \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 46 minutes remaining and the \nminority has 28 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, what does a woman do in a few days \nbefore she is scheduled to have a mastectomy? How should she spend her \ntime? What should she be doing? Should she be on the phone calling her \nHMO, trying to figure out what will happen to her after surgery? Who \nwill take care of her, how long will she be in the hospital? Should she \nbe on the phone, dealing with bureaucracy? Should she be dealing with \npaperwork? Should she be on the phone, dealing with an insurance \ngatekeeper?\n  No, I do not think that is what she should be doing and I think the \nSenate will agree with me. I think she should be with her family. I \nthink she should be talking with her husband, because he is as scared \nas she is. He is terrified that she might die. He is wondering how can \nhe support her when she comes home.\n  She needs to talk to her children so that they understand that even \nthough she is going in for an operation, they know their mother will be \nthere when she comes back home but she might not be quite the same. She \nneeds to be with her family. She needs to be with her clergyman. She \nneeds to be with those who love her and support her.\n  This is what we are voting on here today. Who should be in charge of \nthis decision? When a woman has a mastectomy she needs to recover where \nshe\n\n[[Page S8336]]\n\ncan recover best. That should be decided by the doctor and the patient. \nWe hear about these drive through mastectomies, where women are in and \nout in outpatient therapy. They are dumped back home, often sent home \nstill groggy with anesthesia, sometimes with drainage tubes still in \nplace or even at great risk for infection.\n  Make no mistake, we cannot practice cookbook medicine and insurance \ngatekeepers cannot give cookbook answers. An 80-year-old woman who \nneeds a mastectomy needs a different type of care than a 38-year-old \nwoman. And a 70-year-old woman whose spouse himself may be 80 might \nhave different family resources than a 40-year-old woman.\n  Even the board of directors of the American Association of Health \nPlans states this: ``. . . the decision about whether outpatient or \ninpatient care meets the needs of a woman undergoing removal of a \nbreast should be made by the woman's physician after consultation with \nthe patient.''\n  As I said earlier, we go out there and we Race for the Cure. Now we \nhave to race to support this amendment. Let's look at what we have done \nwith our discoveries. We in America have discovered more medical and \nscientific breakthroughs than any other country in world history. It is \nAmerica who knew how to handle infectious diseases. It is America who \ncomes up with lifesaving pharmaceuticals.\n  We have been working together on a bipartisan basis to double the NIH \nbudget. We have joined together on a bipartisan basis to have mammogram \nquality standards for women. Now we have to join together on a \nbipartisan basis and pass this amendment.\n  We must continue our discovery, we must continue our research, and we \nmust continue to make sure that we have access to the discoveries we \nhave made.\n  This is what this amendment is all about. It allows a woman and her \nphysician to make this decision.\n  Some time ago very similar legislation was offered by the former \nSenator of New York, Mr. D'Amato. People on the other side of the aisle \nhad cosponsored this bill. What we are saying here is, if you \ncosponsored it under Senator D'Amato, vote for it under the Robb-\nMikulski-Boxer-Murray amendment. This should not be about partisan \npolitics.\n  Let's put patients first. Let's understand what is going to happen to \na woman. Let's understand what is going to happen to her family. And \nlet the doctors decide. I told my colleagues a few weeks ago--I \nrecalled a few months ago I had gall bladder surgery. I could stay \novernight because it was medically necessary and medically appropriate. \nSurely if I can stay overnight for gall bladder surgery a woman should \nbe able to stay overnight when she has had a mastectomy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy for his work on \nthis, and Senator Mikulski for her inspirational talk, and Senator Robb \nfor offering an amendment that I think is crucial to the women of this \ncountry. I am eternally grateful to him for putting this amendment \ntogether.\n  Earlier, Senator Smith made a very eloquent talk about the need to \nset aside politics and do what is right for the people. I think we have \nan extraordinary opportunity to do that on this Patients' Bill of \nRights. It is really very simple to do. Whether we are Democrats or \nRepublicans or Independents, we can set all that aside and follow this \nsimple rule, asking every time we vote: What is best for the people of \nour Nation? That is it, the simple question: What is best for the \nchildren? What is best for the women? What is best for the men? What is \nbest for the families, the old or the young, et cetera.\n  The Robb amendment is good for American women. As a matter of fact, \nthe Robb amendment is crucially needed. It is desperately needed. The \nSenator from Maryland was eloquent on the point. Think about finding \nout you have breast cancer and learning you have to have a mastectomy. \nYou do not need to be a genius to understand that you want a doctor \nmaking the decision as to how long you stay in the hospital.\n  It is very simple: Mastectomies are major surgery. Cancer is life-\nthreatening and difficult. It is physical pain. It is mental anguish \nfor you and your family. You don't want an accountant or a chief \noperating officer in an HMO telling you to leave after a few hours, \nwith tubes running up and down you and being sick as a dog and throwing \nup and all the rest. I hate to be graphic about it, but we have to come \nto our senses in this debate. What is the argument against this? It is \ngoing to cost more? We know the CBO says it is maybe $2 a month to \nobtain all the benefits in the Patients' Bill of Rights. I think it is \nworth $2 a month to know a doctor makes the decision.\n  I want to talk about the CEOs of these HMOs. They make millions of \ndollars a year. They are skimming off the top, off of our health care \nquality, and putting it in their pockets. They make $10 million a year, \n$20 million a year, $30 million a year--one person. If his wife comes \ndown with cancer and needs a mastectomy, do you think he is going to \nleave the decision to an accountant in an HMO? You know he is not. He \nis going to dig into his pocket, into his $30-million-a-year pocket, \nand pay for her to obtain good care.\n  What about the average woman? What about our aunts and our uncles and \nour neighbors? They deserve the same kind of attention and care. That \nis what the Robb amendment will do.\n  It will do something else. Again, I am so grateful to the Senator \nfrom Virginia on this point. Senator Murray had offered the mastectomy \namendment in committee, and even Senators who were on the original \nFeinstein-D'Amato bill, Republican Senators, voted against her \namendment in the committee. She is on the floor fighting for this.\n  Senator Snowe and I, in a bipartisan way, introduced a bill that \nwould require your OB/GYN, your obstetrician/gynecologist, to be your \nbasic health care provider. Senator Robb has included that in his \namendment.\n  The reality is that a woman does consider her OB/GYN as her primary \ncare physician. Let's make it a guarantee that her OB/GYN can refer her \nto a specialist. You do not have to jump through hoops.\n  Mr. President, 70 percent of the women in this country use their OB/\nGYN as their only physician from the time they are quite young. So the \nRobb amendment recognizes the reality.\n  Let me tell you why we should come together, both parties, on this \namendment. Let's look at what happens to women who regularly see an OB/\nGYN. A woman whose OB/GYN is her regular doctor is more likely to have \na complete physical exam, blood pressure readings, cholesterol test, \nclinical breast exam, mammogram, pelvic exam, and Pap test.\n  This is why it is so important. These are the threats to women.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So you can see that the women who use their OB/GYN on a \nregular basis get what is necessary for them to stay healthy, to avoid \nthe traumas, to avoid the problem of missing, for example, a breast \ncancer because they do not have that regular mammogram.\n  In conclusion, we have Senator Robb who has long been a champion for \nwomen's health, and I can tell you chapter and verse that I have worked \nwith him over these years and he has taken the most important issues to \nthe women of this country and has rolled them into one, plus an \nadditional part that deals with the deductibility of premiums if you \nare self-employed.\n  This is a wonderful amendment. This is not an amendment that responds \nto Democrats, Republicans, or any other party. It is for American women \nand their families. I urge us to support this fine amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I take 30 seconds to note that on Tuesday \nafternoon at 3:30 on the Patients' Bill of Rights, on an issue that is \nso basic and fundamental and important to American women, we have our \nMembers who are prepared to debate this issue, an issue on which, if my \ncolleagues on the other side have a difference, we ought to be \ndebating. We\n\n[[Page S8337]]\n\ncannot even get an engagement of debate on this.\n  I do not know if that means they are willing to accept it. I would \nhave thought they would have the respect at least for the position of \nseveral Members, led by our friend and colleague from Virginia, to \nspeak to this issue.\n  I yield the Senator from Arkansas 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to make clear my position on such a very \nimportant issue. In the forefront of the managed care debate in the \nearly nineties, I diligently supported the concept of trying to manage \ncare, to control the cost of health care in this country in order to \nprovide more health care to more Americans. When we did that, we in \nCongress never envisioned that medical decisions would be taken away \nfrom medical professionals or that an insurance company would \ncircumvent a patient's access to specialists.\n  Again we are debating this issue of how to provide better health care \nfor more Americans. Today we are talking about the Robb amendment which \nis absolutely essential to women across this country.\n  Managed care has been a very necessary and useful tool in our \nnationwide health care network. It has helped us cut the costs, \nespecially in Medicare. But the issue of making sure women have the \nopportunity to choose as their primary care giver an OB/GYN is \nabsolutely essential. Most women in this day and age go from a \npediatrician to an OB/GYN. To have to go back through a primary care \ngiver in order to see an OB/GYN is absolutely ridiculous.\n  It is so important to do more to see that women have access to \nquality care. The Robb amendment takes us in the right direction with \nthree very important provisions. It provides women with direct access \nto an OB/GYN. They should not have to obtain permission from a \ngatekeeper. I have had staffers in the past who had awful experiences \nof having to go to a primary care giver and not even bothering to see \ntheir OB/GYN to get the speciality care they needed because it took so \nmuch time to go through a primary care giver. That is absolutely \ninexcusable in this day and age with the kind of speciality care, \nresearch, and knowledge we have in our medical professionals.\n\n  A great example: A lump is discovered in a woman's breast during a \nroutine checkup. The OB/GYN ought to be able to refer that woman for a \nmammogram rather than sending her back to the primary care physician. \nThe Robb amendment would designate the OB/GYN as the primary care \ngiver. Most women try to do that already. They already view their OB/\nGYN as their primary physician.\n  It is especially important for women in rural areas. They are limited \nin their access and capability to get to their physicians, and if they \ncannot see an OB/GYN from a rural area, then they likely are never \ngoing to get the speciality care they need and deserve.\n  Most important, we have to make sure our physicians are able to make \nthose medical decisions. One of the most frustrating comments I ever \nheard from my husband, who is a physician, is when he spent 1 hour 45 \nminutes on the telephone with an insurance adjustor after seeing one of \nhis partner's patients who had come through surgery. She was still \nrunning a fever, and the nurse called him and said: We have to send \nthis woman home because the insurance company said we had to.\n  He spent 1 hour 45 minutes on the phone with that insurance adjustor, \nand at the end of that conversation he finally said: If you can send me \nyour medical diploma and if you will sign an affidavit that you will \ntake complete responsibility for this woman's life, then, and only \nthen, should I be able to discharge her from this hospital, because she \nis sick.\n  Yet they were not going to pay for it. He said: We are going to keep \nher in the hospital, and you are going to be responsible, you are going \nto pay for that bill, and we are going to ensure the woman is well \ntaken care of.\n  It is so important for the women across this country to know they \nwill have the primary care they need through their OB/GYN.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' involvement.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, the manager of the \nbill, can he indicate to me why no debate is taking place on the most \nimportant amendment we have had to the Patients' Bill of Rights in the \n2 days we have been here? What has happened?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator raises a good question. We are not going to \ntake advantage of the absence of our Republican colleagues. We are \nasking where they are. We know they are someplace. I can understand why \nthey do not want to engage in this debate. We have a limited period of \ntime. We are ready to debate. Our cosponsors are here and ready to \ndebate this basic, very important issue. I believe they have made a \nvery strong case.\n  I guess what they are waiting for is for us to run through the time \nand perhaps they will come out. Wherever they are, they will come out \nperhaps at least to try to defend their indefensible position on their \nlegislation.\n  I note the Senator from Minnesota is here and wants to speak for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I did not rise to defend the Republican \nParty position. I am sorry to disappoint my colleagues. I say to the \ngood Senator from Virginia, I am not here to speak against his \namendment.\n  I do find it interesting. I do not think I can repeat with the same \neloquence and power what my colleagues have said about what this debate \nis about in personal terms when we are talking about women. But we \ncould also be talking about a child having to get access to the \nservices he or she needs. This is really a life-or-death issue. It is \nvery important for people to make sure their loved ones, whether it be \na wife, a husband, or children, get the care they need and deserve. \nThat is what this debate is all about.\n  I notice that the insurance industry is spending millions and \nmillions of dollars on all sorts of ads talking about how we are going \nto have 1.8 million more people lose coverage.\n  All of a sudden, the insurance industry is concerned about the cost \nof health care insurance. All of a sudden, the insurance industry in \nthe United States of America is concerned about the uninsured. My \ncolleague from Massachusetts says: Where are our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle? Not too long ago, just a couple of hours ago, \nI heard colleagues come out on the Republican side and talk about how \nthis patient protection was too expensive, families would lose their \ninsurance company, the poor insurance industry--which is making record \nprofits--cannot afford to provide this coverage. Where are they now?\n  As I look at the figures, 10 leading managed care companies recorded \nprofits of $1.5 billion last year. United Health Care Corporation, $21 \nmillion to its CEO; CIGNA Corporation, $12 million to its CEO; and the \nfigures go on and on. Yet we have colleagues coming out to this \nChamber--apparently not now--trying to make the argument, even though \nthe Congressional Budget Office says otherwise, even though independent \nstudies say otherwise, that we cannot provide decent patient protection \nfor women because it will be too expensive.\n  It is not going to be too expensive. What will be too expensive and \nwhat will be too costly is when women and children and our family \nmembers do not get the care they need and deserve and, as a result of \nthat, maybe lose their lives, as a result of that they are sicker, as a \nresult that there is more illness.\n  Where do the patients fit in? Where do the women fit in? Where do the \nchildren fit in? Where do the families fit in?\n  I say to Senator Kennedy, we know where the insurance industry fits \nin. Here are their ads: Sure, the Kennedy-Dingell bill will change \nhealth care; people will lose coverage.\n  This is outrageous. The insurance industry thinks that by pouring \n$100 million, or whatever, into TV ads and scaring people, they are \ngoing to be able to defeat this effort. They are wrong. The vote on \nthis amendment, and on other amendments, and on this\n\n[[Page S8338]]\n\nlegislation, will be all about whether Senators belong to the insurance \nindustry or Senators belong to the people who elected us. We should be \nhere advocating for people, not for the insurance industry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 14 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the Senator from Virginia 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank you. And I thank our distinguished \ncolleague from Massachusetts for his leadership on this whole bill.\n  I use this moment to simply commend our colleagues, who happen to be \nwomen, who have made the most passionate, persuasive case for this \nparticular amendment that could be made.\n  Frankly, in listening to my colleague from Maryland about the agony \nwomen go through before they have to make a decision about a \nmastectomy, talking about the difficult choices that women have to \nmake, and adding to it the bureaucracy, where we bounce them back and \nforth, and talking about money--for this particular amendment, I have \nheard one estimate that it will be 12 cents a year for the increased \ncost--we will probably, I suggest, save more money in the lack of \nadministration and bureaucracy than it would cost if we allow women to \nhave as their designated primary care provider their obstetrician or \ngynecologist. This is the person they go to right now to receive their \nhealth care, as pointed out so eloquently by the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  As the Senator from Arkansas has noted, this is a very real problem. \nHer husband happens to practice this particular form of medicine. She \ngave us a compelling reason as to why we should not subject the women \nof America to this kind of burden.\n  I am very grateful to my colleague from Washington, who has long led \nthe fight on this particular issue, and my colleague from Minnesota, \nand others who have spoken out.\n  I, frankly, do not understand the argument against this particular \nproposal. There is no one here to make that argument. I am, frankly, \nsurprised. This makes sense for the women of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, with that, I yield back my time to the \nSenator from Massachusetts so we might hear again from the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President,\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Virginia, Senator Robb, and all of \nthe women and men on the Democratic side who have come out to speak for \nthe Robb-Murray-Mikulski-Boxer amendment, which is so essential to \nwomen in this country.\n  I am astounded that the Republicans have fled the Chamber and have \nnot returned to either agree with us in fighting for women's health or \nto explain why they are going to vote no.\n  I was astounded in committee when I offered this amendment and it was \ndefeated on a partisan vote. Where are our colleagues on the Republican \nside who have come before us so many times and said that they are going \nto be there at the Race for the Cure? Where are the men of the Senate, \nwhen they have been there so many times, saying: You bet we stand for \nwomen's health.\n  This is a women's health issue. Young girls go to a pediatrician \nuntil they are 12, 13, or 14. At that time, they change doctors, not a \nprimary care physician but an OB/GYN. Why should they be subjected now \nto HMO rules that say: We are going to change this, and you are going \nto have to go to a primary care physician in order to be sent to an OB/\nGYN? OB/GYNs are our primary care physicians.\n  As I stated this morning, if you are pregnant and have a serious cold \nor ear infection, or any other challenging problem that develops when \nyou are pregnant, you will be given a different medication, a different \nprocedure that you need to go through than if you are not pregnant.\n  Your OB/GYN is your primary care physician from the time you are a \nteenager until the time you reach menopause, whether you are there \nbecause you are pregnant or there because a physician is examining you \nto determine treatment. But you are there. The OB/GYN is your primary \ncare physician. This amendment will guarantee it.\n\n  As Senator Mikulski so eloquently stated, a woman who has a \nmastectomy should not be sent home too soon whether she is 25 years old \nor 80 years old. In this country, on a daily basis, women are sent home \ntoo soon because it is considered, by HMOs, to be cosmetic surgery. \nThis is not cosmetic surgery. A mastectomy is serious surgery. Women \nshould be sent home when their doctor determines they are able to go \nhome. That is what this amendment is about.\n  We urge our colleagues on the other side to vote with us, to join \nwith us in being for women's health care.\n  I thank my colleagues who have been here to debate this issue. I \nespecially thank Senator Robb, who has been a champion for all of us. I \nlook forward, obviously, to the adoption of this amendment since no one \nhas spoken out against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's side has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are reaching the final moments for \nconsidering this amendment. We, on this side, who have been strong \nsupporters of the Patients' Bill of Rights, think this is one of the \nmost important issues to be raised in the course of this debate. It is \nan extremely basic, fundamental, and important issue for women in this \ncountry.\n  Our outstanding colleagues have presented an absolutely powerful and \nindisputable case for our positions. We are troubled that we have had \nsilence from the other side.\n  We listened yesterday about how beneficial the Republican bill was--\nwhen it refuses to provide protections to the millions of Americans our \ncolleagues have talked about.\n  We are down to the most basic and fundamental purpose of our bill; \nthat doctors and, in this case, women are going to make the decision on \ntheir health care needs, not the bureaucrats in the insurance industry.\n  This is one more example of the need for protections. Our colleagues \nhave demonstrated what this issue is really all about. That is why I \nhope those Members on the other side that really care about women's \nhealth will support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, we are prepared to move ahead and vote on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If neither side yields time, time runs equally against both sides.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Do I have 1 minute left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen seconds.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-five minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I know that my worthy opponents have \nmade note of our absence. We are not ignoring this issue. We have a \nbetter answer. There will be a Snowe-Abraham amendment presented, \nprobably tomorrow, that will handle this issue. I think the Members \nwill agree that the approach we take will be preferable to the one \nbeing taken right now.\n  I would like to address my colleagues generally on the situation at \nthis time. The Patients' Bill of Rights Act addresses those areas of \nhealth quality on which there is broad consensus. It is solid \nlegislation that will result in a greatly improved health care system \nfor all Americans.\n  The Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, the HELP \nCommittee, has been long dedicated to action in order to improve the \nquality of health care. Our commitment to developing appropriate \nmanaged care standards has been demonstrated by the 17 additional \nhearings related to health care quality. Senator Frist's Public Health \nand Safety Subcommittee held three hearings on the work of the Agency \nfor Health Care\n\n[[Page S8339]]\n\nPolicy and Research, sometimes referred to as AHCPR. Each of these \nhearings helped us to develop the separate pieces of legislation that \nare reflected in S. 326, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act. People need \nto know what their plan will cover and how they will get their health \ncare.\n\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights requires full disclosure by an employer \nabout health plans it offers to employees. Patients also need to know \nhow adverse decisions by a plan can be appealed, both internally--that \nis, within the HMO--and externally, through an independent medical \nreviewer. Under our bill, the reviewer's decision will be binding on \nthe health plan. We are talking about an external, outside reviewer, \nand it is binding. There is no appeal. It is binding. They have to do \nit. However, the patient will retain his or her current rights to go to \ncourt.\n  Timely utilization decisions and a defined process for appealing such \ndecisions are the keys to restoring trust in the health care system. \nOur legislation also provides Americans covered by health insurance \nwith new rights to prevent discrimination based on predictive genetic \ninformation. This is a crucial provision. It ensures that medical \ndecisions are made by physicians in consultation with their patients \nand are based on the best scientific evidence. That is the key phrase. \nWe want to remember that one because you won't see it on the other \nside.\n  It provides a stronger emphasis on quality improvement in our health \ncare system with a refocused role for AHCPR, taking advantage of all \nthe abilities we have now to understand better what is going on with \nrespect to health care in this country, to sift through the information \nthat comes through AHCPR and make judgments on what the best medicine \nis.\n  Some believe that the answer to improving our Nation's health care \nquality is to allow greater access to the tort system, maybe a better \nlawsuit. However, you simply cannot sue your way to better health. We \nbelieve that patients must get the care they need when they need it. \nThey ought not to have to go to court with a lawsuit. They ought to get \nit when they need it. It is a question of whether you want good health \nor you want a good lawsuit.\n  In the Patients' Bill of Rights, we make sure each patient is \nafforded every opportunity to have the right treatment decision made by \nhealth care professionals. In the event that does not occur, patients \nhave the recourse of pursuing an outside appeal to get medical \ndecisions by medical people to give them good medical treatment. \nPrevention, not litigation, is the best medicine.\n  Our bill creates new, enforceable Federal health standards to cover \nthose 48 million people of the 124 million Americans covered by \nemployer-sponsored plans. These are the very same people that the \nStates, through their regulation of private health insurance companies, \ncannot protect. We will protect them.\n  What are these standards? They include, first, a prudent layperson \nstandard for emergency care; second, a mandatory point of service \noption; direct access to OB/GYNs and pediatricians--that has not been \nrecognized by the opposition--continuity of care; a prohibition on gag \nrules; access to medication; access to specialists; and self-pay for \nbehavioral health.\n  It would be inappropriate to set Federal health insurance standards \nthat duplicate the responsibility of the 50 State insurance \ndepartments.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that issue?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Can the Senator show us one State that has the patient \nprotections included in our proposal? Is there just one State in this \ncountry, one State that provides those types of protections?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I believe Vermont does.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. All of the protections for the patients? I know the \nSenator understands his State well, but does the Senator know of any \nother State that provides these kinds of protections?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. We are going to provide them with better protections.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The scope of your legislation only includes a third of \nall the people who have private health coverage.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Well, in some areas we go beyond that, as the Senator \nwell knows.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No, I don't know. I don't know, because you talk about \nself-insured plans, and there are only 48 million Americans in those \nplans. You don't cover the 110 million Americans who have other health \ninsurance plans.\n  Does the Senator know a single State that provides specialized care \nfor children if they have a critical need for specialty care--one State \nin the country? We provide that kind of protection. Does the Senator \nknow a single State that has that kind of protection?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I tell you, we have a better health care bill. That is \nall I am telling you. It will protect more people at less cost. Your \nbill is so expensive that you are going to affect a million people, and \nthose people are the ones we want most to protect. Those are the people \nwho are working low-income jobs and who will be torn off and removed \nfrom health care protection by your bill. We will not do that. We are \ngoing to protect those people who need the protection the most from \nbeing denied health insurance.\n  I take back the remainder of my time.\n  It would be inappropriate to set Federal health insurance standards \nthat duplicate the responsibility of the 50 State insurance \ndepartments. As the National Association of Insurance Commissioners put \nit:\n\n       We do not want States to be preempted by Congressional or \n     administrative actions. . .Congress should focus attention on \n     those consumers who have no protections in the self-funded \n     ERISA plans.\n\n  Senator Kennedy's approach would set health insurance standards that \nduplicate the responsibility of the 50 State insurance departments. \nWorse yet, it would mandate that the Health Care Financing \nAdministration, HCFA, enforce them, if the State decides otherwise. It \nwould be a disaster--HCFA can't even handle the small things they have \nwith HIPAA, the Medicare and Medicaid problems--to get involved in the \ndemands that would be placed upon them by the Democratic bill.\n  This past recess, Senator Leahy and I held a meeting in Vermont to \nlet New England home health providers meet with HCFA. It was a packed \nand angry house, with providers traveling from New Hampshire, \nMassachusetts, and Connecticut. That is who the Democrats would have \nenforce their bill. It is in no one's best interests to build a dual \nsystem of overlapping State and Federal health insurance regulation.\n  Increasing health insurance premiums causes significant losses in \ncoverage. The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, pegged the cost of the \nDemocratic bill at six times higher than S. 326. Based on our best \nestimates, passage of the Democratic bill would result in the loss of \ncoverage for over 1.5 million working Americans and their families.\n  Now, why do you want to charge forward with that plan? To put this in \nperspective, this would mean they would have their family's coverage \ncanceled under the Democratic bill--canceled. Let me repeat that. \nAdoption of the Democratic approach would cancel the insurance policies \nof almost 1.5 million Americans, CBO estimates. I cannot support \nlegislation that would result in the loss of health insurance coverage \nfor the combined population of the States of Virginia, Delaware, South \nDakota, and Wyoming--no coverage.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Fortunately, we can provide the key protections that \nconsumers want, at a minimal cost and without the disruption of \ncoverage, if we apply these protections responsibly and where they are \nneeded.\n\n  In sharp contrast to the Democratic alternative, our bill would \nactually increase coverage. With the additional Tax Code provisions of \nS. 326, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act, our bill allows for full \ndeduction of health insurance for the self-employed, the full \navailability of medical savings accounts, and the carryover of unused \nbenefits from flexible spending accounts.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator from Vermont yield for a question?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. With the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, we provide \nAmericans with greater choice of more affordable health insurance.\n\n[[Page S8340]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator from Vermont yield for a question?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator.\n  I was listening to his discussion about the Republican bill. The \ncurrent pending amendment, the Robb-Murray amendment, allows women \naccess to OB/GYNs as their primary care physicians. Will the bill the \nSenator is discussing provide direct access for all of those women who \nare not in self-insured programs in this country?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. We will have an amendment which will deal with that \nproblem.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. All women in this country who are not in self-insured \nprograms will have access under the amendment you are going to be \noffering?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. First of all, we defer to the States in that regard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Then I can assume that the women who are not in self-\ninsured programs will not be covered by the Republican amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Our bill covers, as we intended to cover, those who \nneed the coverage now who have no coverage and get the protection to \nthose who need the protection. We will have an amendment that will take \ncare of the problems that are----\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Not the self-employed. That is the answer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I think the Senator has her own time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wanted to ask the Senator one question.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is the Senator aware that when he talks about people \nlosing their insurance, there is a $100 million effort going on by the \nHMOs to scare people into thinking that if the Democratic Patients' \nBill of Rights passes--which is supported by all the health care \nadvocate groups in the country--they will lose their insurance?\n  Is the Senator aware that his own Congressional Budget Office has \nclearly stated the maximum cost of the Democratic Patients' Bill of \nRights is $2 a month?\n  And further, is the Senator aware that the President, by executive \norder, gave the Patients' Bill of Rights to Federal employees, and \nthere has been no increase in the premium?\n  So what I am asking the Senator is, is he aware of this campaign by \nthe HMOs? Has he seen the commercials? Does he believe the HMOs that \nwho have an interest in this, the CEOs of which are getting $30 million \na year, really have the interests of patients in their heart?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I say that the Senator was successful in stealing some \ntime from me. Let me say that we have differences of opinions on these \nbills. There is no question that your bill is much more expensive, that \nit is going to cost 6 percent, and that CBO estimates 1.5 million \npeople--all of which you say you care most about, I say to the Senator \nfrom California, the low-income people, the people who are just barely \nable to have plans right now, and small businesses that won't be able--\n1.5 million people will lose their health insurance if your plan is put \nin.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to the Senator----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. S. 326, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, provides \nnecessary consumer protections without adding significant new costs, \nwithout increasing litigation, and without micromanaging health plans.\n  Our goal is to give Americans the protections they want and need in a \npackage they can afford and that we can enact. This is why I hope the \nPatients' Bill of Rights we are offering today will be enacted and \nsigned into law by the President.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to return to \nthe underlying amendment. It has taken me a while to read through the \namendment. The first time I saw the amendment was 30 minutes ago. I \nhave just read through the amendment offered by Senator Kennedy and \nothers which relates to certain breast cancer treatment and access to \nappropriate obstetrical and gynecological care.\n  I apologize for not being able to participate directly on in this \nissue earlier. At the outset, I will say that about 2 years ago, \nSenator Bradley from New Jersey and I had the opportunity to \nparticipate in writing an amendment that actually eventually became law \nwhich addressed the issue of postmaternity stay, postdelivery stay. We \nwrote that particular piece of legislation because we felt strongly \nthat managed care had gone too far in dictating how long people stayed \nin the hospital and pushing them out after deliveries, and it was a \nlittle controversial, although I think a very good bill for the time, \nbecause it sent a message very loudly and clearly to the managed care \nindustry that you need to leave those decisions, as much as possible, \nat the local level where physicians and patients, in consultation with \neach other, determine that type of care.\n\n  The amendment on the floor is different in that it focuses on another \naspect of women's care and that is breast cancer treatment. As to the \ndebate from the other side of the aisle, I agree with 98 percent of \nwhat was said in terms of the importance of having a woman be able to \naccess her obstetrician and gynecologist in an appropriate manner, the \nneed for looking at inpatient care, to some extent as it relates to \nbreast disease. Yet I think the approach that Senator Kennedy and \nothers have put on the floor is a good start but has several problems. \nTherefore, I urge all of my colleagues to vote against that amendment, \nwith the understanding we can take the good efforts from that \namendment, correct the deficiencies, and address the very same issues \nthat have been identified so eloquently by my colleagues across the \naisle.\n  Now, in looking at the Kennedy-Robb amendment, on page 2, they talk \nabout:\n\n       . . . health insurance coverage, that provides medical and \n     surgical benefits shall ensure that inpatient coverage with \n     respect to the treatment of breast cancer is provided for a \n     period of time as is determined by the attending physician, \n     in his or her professional judgment. . . .\n\n  So far, I agree wholeheartedly. But where I cannot vote in good \nconscience, or allow my colleagues to, without fully understanding the \nimplications, is where they continue and say:\n\n       . . . consistent with generally accepted medical standards, \n     and the patient, to be medically appropriate following--(A) a \n     mastectomy; (B) a lumpectomy; or (C) a lymph node dissection.\n\n  I agree with all of that and inpatient care. The part that bothers me \nis the ``consistent with generally accepted medical standards.'' This \ngoes into the debate we will go into tomorrow, or the next day, on \nmedical necessity and what medical necessity means.\n  When we talk about what is medically appropriate and medically \nnecessary, you are going to hear me say again and again that we should \nnot try to put that into law, Federal statute. We should not define \n``medical necessity'' as generally accepted medical practices or \nstandards. The reason is, as exemplified in this chart, nobody can \ndefine generally accepted medical standards. You will go up to a \nphysician and a physician will say: That is what I do every day.\n  Well, that is not much of a definition, I don't think. Therefore, I \nam not sure we should use those terms and put them into a law and pass \nit as an amendment and make it part of the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  This chart is a chart that shows the significant variation of the way \nmedicine is practiced today, and that generally accepted medical \nstandards has such huge variations that the definition means nothing. \nTherefore, I am not going to put into a Federal statute a definition \nthat means very little because I think, downstream, that can cause some \nharm because maybe a bunch of bureaucrats will try to give that \ndefinition.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield, he is arguing that it \ndoesn't mean anything. It means everything. Really it is sort of the \nopposite of that. It has such an expansive character to it that it can \ninclude inappropriate medicine, which is, I think, the point the \nSenator is making.\n  Mr. FRIST. I think that is right. My colleague said it much more \nclearly than I. The definition itself of ``medically necessary and \nappropriate'' is so important that we should not lock the definition \ninto something that is so\n\n[[Page S8341]]\n\nsmall, so rigid, that we can't take into consideration the new advances \nthat are coming along. That is why when we say generally accepted \nmedical standards or practices, it leaves out the best evidence, the \nnew types of discoveries that are coming on line. That decision should \nbe made locally and should not be definitions put into a statute. \nTherefore, I am going to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. ROBB. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me try to get through my presentation.\n  Mr. ROBB. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will not yield.\n  Let me go through for my colleagues why the variation in medical \npractice has implications that may be unintended and therefore we \ncannot let the amendment pass.\n  Reviewing regional medical variations for breast-sparing surgery--\nbasically for breast cancer today--I don't want to categorize this too \nmuch because the indications change a little bit. In a lumpectomy--\ntaking out the lump itself and radiating because it is the least \ndisfiguring--the outcome is equally good as doing a mastectomy and \ntaking off the whole breast.\n  In my training--not that long ago, 25 years--the only treatment was \nmastectomy. As we learned more and more and radiation therapy became \nmore powerful, we began to understand there are synergies in doing \nsurgical operations and radiation therapy and chemotherapy. We didn't \nhave to remove or disfigure the whole breast. The new therapy ended up \nbeing better for the patient but was not generally accepted medically. \nThat sort of variation is shown in this chart.\n  In this chart, the very dark areas use lumpectomy versus mastectomy. \nComparing the two, the high ratio of around 20 to 50 percent, versus \ngoing down to the light colors on the chart where this procedure is not \nused very much, there is tremendous variation. The different patterns \nof color on the chart demonstrate that a procedure generally accepted \nin one part of the country may be very different in another part of the \ncountry.\n  For example, in South Dakota, using this ratio of lumpectomy versus \nmastectomy, the ratio is only 1.4 percent.\n  In Paterson, NJ, the generally accepted medical standards in that \ncommunity go up almost fortyfold to 37.8 percent--the relative use of \none procedure, an older procedure, versus a newer procedure.\n  Which of those are generally accepted medical standards? That shows \nthe definition itself has such huge variation that we have to be very \ncareful when putting it into Federal statute. We will come back to that \nbecause it is a fundamentally important issue. Medicine is practiced \ndifferently around the country. Therefore, the words ``generally \naccepted medical standards'' have huge variations. We have to be \ncareful what we write into law.\n  What I am about to say builds on the work of Senators Snowe and \nAbraham.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. Again, Senators Snowe and Abraham will talk more about \nthis a little bit later.\n  Instead of using language such as ``generally accepted medical \nstandards,'' it has a built-in inherent danger because it defines what \n``medical necessity and appropriate'' are.\n  We should be looking at words as follows: That provides a group \nhealth plan and a health insurance issuer providing health insurance \ncoverage, that provides medical and surgical benefits, shall ensure \nthat inpatient coverage--just like the Kennedy-Robb amendment with \nrespect to the treatment of breast cancer--is provided for a period of \ntime as determined by the attending physician, as the Kennedy-Robb \namendment does, in consultation with the patient. I think this is ``in \nconsultation with the patient.''\n\n  No, they do not have in their bill ``in consultation with the \npatient.'' I suggest ``in consultation with the patient'' should be \npart of their amendment.\n  We would put in ``in consultation with the patient'' to be \n``medically necessary and appropriate,'' instead of using their words \n``generally accepted medical standards,'' which has such huge \nvariation.\n  Why not use the better terminology, ``medically necessary and \nappropriate''?\n  Use the same indications. Mastectomy is what we will propose, what \nthey propose. Lumpectomy is what we propose, what they will propose. \nLymph node dissection, we will use that language.\n  But ``generally accepted medical standards'' is dangerous. We ought \nto use such words as ``medically necessary and appropriate.'' Then we \nare not locked into the variation where there is a fortyfold difference \nin mastectomies versus lumpectomy, which shows the importance of being \nvery careful before placing Federal definitions of what is ``medically \nnecessary and appropriate'' in Federal law.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was going to make a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield to the unanimous consent request.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that Alex Steele of my office be \ngranted privilege of the floor today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. In the Kennedy-Robb amendment is the issue of access.\n  Again, my colleagues on the other side hit it right on the head: \nWomen today want to have access to their obstetrician. They don't want \nto go through gatekeepers to have to get to their obstetrician or \ngynecologist. That relationship is very special and very important when \nwe are talking about women's health and women's diseases.\n  In the Kennedy-Robb amendment, the language is that the plan or \ninsurer shall permit such an individual who is a female to designate a \nparticipating physician who specializes in obstetrics and gynecology as \nthe individual's primary care provider.\n  It is true that in our underlying bill we don't say the plan has to \nsay that all obstetricians and gynecologists are primary care \nproviders. That is exactly right. The reasons for that are manyfold.\n  Let me share with Members what one person told me. Dr. Robert \nYelverton, chairman of the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists' Primary Care Committee, stated:\n\n       The vast majority of OB/GYNs in this country have opted to \n     remain as specialists rather than act as primary care \n     physicians.\n\n  He attributes this to the high standards that health plans have for \nprimary care physicians, saying:\n\n       None of us could really qualify as primary care physicians \n     under most of the plans, and most OB/GYNs would have to go \n     back to school for a year or more to do so.\n\n  You can argue whether that is good or bad, but it shows that \nautomatically taking specialists and making them primary care \nphysicians and putting it in Federal statute is a little bit like \ntaking Bill Frist, heart and lung transplant surgeon, and saying: You \nought to take care of all of the primary care of anybody who walks into \nyour office.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will finish my one presentation, and we will come back \nto this.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Why do you not yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator did not agree to yield.\n  Mr. FRIST. I simply want the courtesy of completing my statement. I \nknow people want to jump in and ask questions, but we have listened to \nthe other side for 50 minutes on this very topic. I am trying to use \nour time in an instructive manner, point by point, if people could just \nwait a bit and allow me to get through my initial presentation of why I \nthink this amendment must be defeated with a very good alternative.\n  I want to get into this issue of access to obstetricians and \ngynecologists. In our bill that has been introduced, we take care of \nthis. I believe strongly we take care of it. We say, in section 723: \nThe plan shall waive the referral requirement in the case of a female \nparticipant or beneficiary who seeks coverage for routine obstetrical \ncare or routine gynecological care.\n  We are talking about routine women's health issues. We waive the \nreferral process. There is not a gatekeeper. A patient goes straight to \ntheir obstetrician and gynecologist. That is what women tell me they \nwant in terms of access to that particular specialized, trained \nindividual.\n\n[[Page S8342]]\n\n  It is written in our bill. Let me read what is in our bill.\n\n       The plan shall waive the referring requirement in the case \n     of a female participant or beneficiary who seeks routine \n     obstetrical care or routine gynecological care.\n\n  Therefore, I think the access provisions in the Kennedy-Robb \namendment are unnecessary and are addressed in our underlying bill. \nPlus, they go one step further in saying that this specialist is the \nindividual's primary care provider. I am just not sure of the total \nimplications of that, especially after an obstetrician who is the \nchairman of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology very \nclearly states that merely assuming that a specialist is a good primary \ncare physician is not necessarily correct.\n  Also, in our bill, beyond the routine care--this is in section 725 of \nour bill where we address access to specialists--we say:\n\n       A group health plan other than a fully insured health plan \n     shall ensure that participants and beneficiaries have access \n     to specialty care when such care is covered under the plan.\n\n  So they have access to specialty care when obstetrics care and \ngynecological care is part of that plan.\n  So both here and in the earlier provision of section 723, where we \ntalk about routine obstetrical care, there is no gatekeeper; there is \nno barrier; a woman can go directly to her obstetrician and her \ngynecologist, which is what they want. Or, if you fall into the \nspecialty category in provision 725, you have access to specialty care \nwhen such care is covered under the plan.\n  As I go through the Kennedy-Robb plan, and this is obviously the \namendment that we are debating on the floor, there are a number of very \nreasonable issues in there. Again, I think the intent of the amendment \nis very good. I do notice secondary consultations in the amendment. I \nthink, as we address the issue of women's health, obstetrical care, \nbreast cancer treatment, access to appropriate care, which we plan on \naddressing and we will address, I believe, this is the amendment \nSenators Snowe and Abraham have been working on so diligently, the idea \nof secondary consultations.\n  About 2 months ago we did a women's health conference. It was \nwonderful. It was in Memphis, TN. It was on women's health issues. \nMaybe 200 or 300 people attended, focusing on women's health issues. We \ntalked about the range of issues, whether it was breast cancer, \ncervical cancer, osteoporosis, diseases of the aging process, but an \nissue which came up was the issue of secondary consultations. Because \nit is dealing with something that is very personal to them, women say: \nIs there any way we can reach out in some way with health plans to \nlower the barriers for us to get a second opinion?\n  Why is that important? Part of that is important because of this huge \nvariation. If you go to one doctor and he says do a mastectomy, which \nis very disfiguring, it is very clearly indicated--there are clear-cut \nindications for mastectomy or lumpectomy today. If you hear two \ndifferent versions, you may want to get a secondary opinion or a \nsecondary consultation.\n  What we are looking at in that regard is language similar to this: to \nprovide coverage with respect to medical and surgical services provided \nin relation to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer shall ensure that \nfull coverage is provided for secondary consultations by specialists in \nthe appropriate medical fields.\n  ``Medical fields,'' I think we need to go a little bit further and \nfocus on whether it is pathology or radiology or oncology or surgery to \nconfirm--and I think it should be part of the language--to confirm or \nto refute the diagnosis itself. That is full coverage by the plan for \nsecondary consultations for cancer as it deals with women's health \nissues.\n  I think that will be an important part to include as we address this \nvery specific field. It is totally absent in the Kennedy-Robb \namendment. I propose offering an amendment which does much of what they \nsay in terms of inpatient care, changing this terminology from \n``generally accepted medical standards,'' which I think is potentially \ndangerous, and move on to the language which I think should be used, \nwhich is ``medically necessary and appropriate.''\n  The access issue, I believe, we have developed. There are other \nissues in the bill that I will work with Senators Abraham and Snowe to \naddress, in a systematically and well-thought-out way, so we can do \nwhat is best for women in this treatment of cancer, breast cancer, \nmastectomy, and access to obstetricians and gynecologists. That is \nsomething about which we need to ensure that no managed care plan says: \nNo, you cannot go see your obstetrician; or, no, you cannot go see your \ngynecologist; or, no, you have to hop through a barrier; or, no, you \nhave to go see a gatekeeper before you can see your obstetrician/\ngynecologist. We are going to stop that practice, and we are going to \nstop that in the Republican bill we put forward.\n  I have introduced the concept today--again, it is very important--of \nmedical necessity and how we define what is medically necessary and \nappropriate. It is something critical. It is something we are going to \ncome back to. I think with all the issues we are discussing, if we try \nto put in Federal law, Federal statute, a definition of what is \nmedically necessary and appropriate instead of leaving it up to a \nphysician who is trained in the field, a specialist, we are going in \nthe wrong direction and have the potential for broadly harming people.\n  I urge defeat of this amendment with the understanding we are going \nto come back and very specifically address the issues I have talked \nabout today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe Robb-Murray amendment, which provides our mothers, wives, daughters \nand sisters with direct access to OB/GYN care and strengthens the \nability of a woman and her doctor to make personal medical decisions.\n  The sponsors of this amendment, along with most women and most \nAmericans, believe that a woman should have the choice and the freedom \nto select an OB/GYN physician as her primary care provider and to \ndetermine, in consultation with her doctor, how long she should stay in \nthe hospital following surgery.\n  Those critical and deeply personal judgments should not be trumped by \nthe arbitrary guidelines of managed care companies. The women in our \nlives deserve better than drive-by mastectomies. With the Robb-Murray \namendment, we will say so in law, and ensure that women receive the \nservices they need and the respect they are owed.\n  Studies show that when women have a primary care physician trained in \nOB/GYN, they receive more comprehensive care and greater personal \nsatisfaction when they are treated by doctors trained in other \nspecialties.\n  We should consider, too, that breast cancer is the second leading \nkiller of women in this country. New cases of this disease occur more \nthan twice as often as second most common type of cancer, lung cancer. \nMore than 178,000 women in this country were diagnosed with breast \ncancer in 1998. I have no doubt we will someday find the origin and \ncure for this terrible malady. Until then, though, we have a duty to \nmake the system charged with treating these women respectful and \nresponsive to their needs.\n  Sadly, the evidence suggests we have a long way to go. We continue to \nreceive disturbing reports about the insistence of some insurance \ncompanies to force women out of the hospital immediately after \nphysically demanding and emotionally traumatic surgeries. We have been \nshocked by stories of women being sent home with drainage tubes still \nin their bodies and groggy from general anesthesia. This is distressing \nto me not just as a policy-maker, but as a son, father, and husband.\n  Now, some critics of the Robb-Murray Amendment want to sidestep this \nproblem, and suggest that we are legislating by body part. To that, I \nsay:\n  Those who oppose this provision are wasting a valuable opportunity to \nincrease the quality of physical health care for over half the \npopulation of the United States.\n  Those who oppose are ignoring the suffering and inconvenience of \nwomen throughout this country trying to receive the basic health care \nthat they have every right to expect.\n  Those who oppose are failing to right a wrong that we have tolerated \nfor too long.\n\n[[Page S8343]]\n\n  Mr. President, women are being denied the quality of care they are \npaying for and to which they have a moral right. And this Senate has a \nchance today to begin fixing this inequity. I urge my colleagues to \nlook beyond the rhetoric and see the very simple and fair logic that \ncalls for the passage of this amendment, and join us in supporting it.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 7 minutes and 26 seconds on the side \nof the Senator from Oklahoma. The other side has used all its time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, let me make a couple of comments. I heard \nmy friend and colleague from Massachusetts say: Where is everybody in \nthe debate? We have just received the amendment. I would like to look \nat it, and I had a chance to look at it while some of the debate was \ngoing on. I would like to make a couple of comments on it.\n  I found in the amendment--\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On that point, will the Senator yield?\n  Just on the point of the representation you just made. It is \nvirtually the same amendment that was offered in the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. No, I do not.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is not a surprise. It is the same amendment, \neffectively.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator from Massachusetts says it is the same \namendment offered in committee, but that is not factual. The Senator \ncan correct me if I am wrong, but this amendment deals with Superfund. \nThis amendment deals with transferring money from general revenue into \nSocial Security. That was not offered in committee. There are few tax \nprovisions in here. I asked somebody: What is this extension of taxes \non page 17? My staff tells me it is a tax increase of $6.7 billion on \nSuperfund. I don't know what that has to do with breast cancer, but it \nis a tax increase on Superfund.\n  I know we need to reauthorize Superfund. I didn't know we were going \nto do it on this bill. I stated in the past we are not going to pass \nthe Superfund extension until we reauthorize it. We should do the two \ntogether. Why are we doing it on this bill?\n  So there are tax increases in here that nobody has looked at. They \ndid not do that in the Labor Committee or the health committee, I do \nnot think. I asked the Chairman of the committee. I don't think they \npassed tax increases on Superfund. That does not belong in the HELP \nCommittee.\n  Certainly transferring money from the general revenue fund, as this \nbill does, into the Social Security trust fund, was not done in the \nHELP Committee, I do not think. It should not have been done. My guess \nis the Finance Committee might have some objections. Senator Roth is \ngoing to be on the floor saying: Wait a minute, what is going on?\n  So there is a lot of mischief in these amendments. Some of us have \nnot had enough time. One of the crazy things about this agreement is we \nare going to have amendments coming at us quickly. We have to have a \nlittle time to study them. Sometimes we find some things stuck in the \namendments which some of us might have some objections with.\n  I want to make a couple of comments on the amendment. In addition to \nthe big tax increases hidden in the bill, this amendment also strikes \nthe underlying amendment that many of us have proposed on this side \nthat says, whatever we should do we should do no harm. If we are going \nto increase premiums by over 1 percent; let us not do a bill. Maybe \npeople forgot about that, but that is an amendment we offered earlier. \nThis amendment, the Robb amendment, says, let's strike that provision. \nWe do not care how much the Kennedy bill costs.\n  Some of us do care how much it costs. We do not want to put millions \nof people into the ranks of the uninsured. We do not want to do harm. \nUnfortunately, the amendment proposed by Senator Robb and others would \ndo that. It would strike that provision. It would eliminate that \nprovision.\n  On the issue of breast cancer and mastectomy and lumpectomy and so \non, Senator Frist has addressed it a little bit. Senator Snowe and \nothers will be offering an amendment that is related and, I will tell \nyou, far superior to the amendment we have on the floor.\n  I do not know if we will get to it tonight. Certainly, we will get to \nit tomorrow. It is a much better amendment. It is an amendment that has \nbeen thought out. It is an amendment that does not have Superfund taxes \nin it. It is an amendment that includes, as this bill does, transfers \nfrom the general revenue fund into the Social Security trust.\n  I urge my colleagues at the appropriate time to vote ``no'' on the \nRobb amendment, and then let's adopt the underlying amendment which \nsays we should not increase health care costs by more than 1 percent; \nlet's not do damage to the system; let's not put people into the ranks \nof uninsured by playing games, maybe trying to score points with one \ngroup or another group. Let's not do that. Let's not make those kinds \nof mistakes.\n  If people have serious concerns dealing with breast cancer and how \nthat should be treated, again, Senator Snowe, Senator Abraham, and \nSenator Frist have an amendment they have worked on for some time that \nI believe is much better drafted. It does not have Superfund taxes in \nit. It does not have a transfer of general revenue funds into the \nSocial Security trust fund. It does not make these kinds of mistakes \nthat we have, unfortunately, with this pending amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask how much time we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. As I understand it, by repealing the underlying amendment, \nwhich would limit the cost increase to 1 percent and would say, in the \nalternative, if 100,000 people are knocked off the rolls of insured, \nthe bill will not go forward. If we repeal that and those 100,000 \npeople are knocked off the rolls, they are not going to have any \ninsurance for mastectomies; right?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is exactly right.\n  Mr. GREGG. Basically, the proposal of the Senator from Virginia, \nsupported by Senator Kennedy, uninsures potentially 100,000 women from \nany mastectomy coverage as a result of their amendment or any other \ncoverage.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator makes a good point, but probably not \n100,000. Estimates would probably be much closer to 2 million people \nwould be uninsured and have no coverage whatsoever in any insurance \nproposal if we adopt the underlying Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Of those 2 million people, we can assume potentially half \nwould be women. So we have approximately 1 million women who would not \nhave insurance as a result of this amendment being put forward on the \nother side.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator from Oklahoma yield for \na question? As a matter of fact, we have some information just provided \nto us that under the Kennedy legislation, S. 6, with 1.9 million people \nno longer being insured, you would have 188,595 fewer breast \nexaminations. If people had their routine breast examinations, of those \n1.9 million, a certain percentage would be women, that would be the \nnumber of breast exams that would no longer take place if this \nlegislation passed.\n  We hear so much talk about ``in human terms,'' and they say this \nargument does not cut. These people are going to lose insurance. They \nwill lose insurance. They will not get coverage so you do not have to \nworry about covering them for a mastectomy. They are going to find out, \nin many cases, unfortunately, far too late for even those kinds of \ntreatments to be helpful. That is what we are trying to prevent in not \npassing a bill that drives up costs dramatically which drives people \nout of the insurance area.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate my colleague's comment. I yield back the \nremainder of my time and ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n\n[[Page S8344]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2 minutes on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the more we debate, the more confused our \ngood colleagues on the other side, quite frankly, become. The \nunderlying amendment dealing with the OB/GYN is the amendment that was \noffered in committee and that is no surprise.\n  The other provision the Senator from Oklahoma talks about is funding \nthe self-insurance tax deduction introduced by the Senator from \nOklahoma without paying for it. This would subject the bill to a point \nof order if it was carried all the way through. He did not pay for it.\n  It is a red herring. Time and time again we have put in the General \nAccounting Office document which states that the protections in this \nbill will enhance the number of people insured, not reduce the number.\n  Does the Senator from Pennsylvania actually believe we are \nendangering breast cancer tests for women, reducing Pap tests, reducing \nexaminations for breast cancer and yet the breast cancer coalition \nsupports our proposal? Is he suggesting any logic to his position?\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of the time and look \nforward to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute on the bill.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is right. The whole essence of the \nsecond-degree amendment is to kill the underlying amendment because the \nSenator from Massachusetts does not want to say we will not increase \ncosts by more than 1 percent, because, frankly, he wants to, and \nexpects to, increase costs by 5 or 6 percent. The net result of that \nwill be to uninsure a couple million people, half of which could be \nwomen, half of which will not get those exams, half of which will not \nget those screenings, half of which will not get the care they need. \nThat is the purpose of the amendment.\n  In the process, he also increases Superfund taxes and also comes up \nwith general transfers of money from the general revenue fund to the \nSocial Security fund. That is a mistake.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no and keep in mind that in dealing with \nbreast cancer, Senator Snowe, Senator Frist, and Senator Abraham will \noffer a much better proposal later in this debate. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is on agreeing to amendment No. 1237. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for Mr. Frist, for \n     himself and Mr. Jeffords, proposes an amendment numbered 1238 \n     to amendment No. 1236.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we \nhave now disposed of the Democrats' second-degree amendment to the \nfirst-degree amendment proposed by the Republicans, which first-degree \namendment would limit the cost of the Kennedy health care bill to 1 \npercent. Now I have sent a second-degree amendment up under the \nunanimous consent agreement. Each side could offer a second-degree.\n  The amendment I sent to the desk on behalf of Senators Frist, \nJeffords, and others, is a very important amendment, so I hope all of \nour colleagues will listen to it. The amendment would strike the \nmedical necessity definition that was in the Kennedy bill and replace \nit with the grievance/appeals process we have in our bill. In other \nwords, it is a very significant amendment, one that we had significant \ndiscussion on last week. Some of our colleagues said they really wanted \nto vote on it last week. We will get to vote on it, depending on the \nmajority leader's intention. If the time runs on this amendment, all \ntime would be used, and we would probably be ready for a vote at about \n6:40. Of course, it would be the majority leader's call whether or not \nto have a vote.\n  The amendment deals with medical necessity. It replaces the \ndefinition in the Kennedy bill with the grievance and appeals process \nthat we have in the Republican package, which I think is a far superior \npackage as far as improving the quality of care. I compliment Senator \nJeffords, Senator Frist, and others for putting this together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is an extremely important \namendment. I think everyone ought to understand exactly what we are \ntrying to do.\n  We are entering into a new era with respect to the availability of \nhealth care, good health care, excellent health care. We have seen \npharmaceuticals being devised which would do miraculous things. We are \nalso having medical procedures designed and devices created. But what \nwe have not seen is their being available everywhere, or a standard \nthat will make them available in areas where they ought to be \navailable.\n  What we are trying to do today is establish that every American is \nentitled to the best medical care available, not that which is \ngenerally available in your area; not be different from one end of the \ncountry to the other but that everyone is entitled to that health care, \nespecially if you are in an HMO. They should be, and must be, aware of \nwhat is the best health care that would serve you to make you a well \nperson.\n  For a couple of days now, we have heard many tragic stories about \nchildren who were born with birth defects or who were injured because \nthe private health care system failed them in some manner. I know my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have a bill they believe \nwould address these situations. The Republican health care bill \naddresses the concerns people have about their health care without \ncausing new problems.\n  Americans want assurance that they will get the health care they need \nwhen they need it. I am going to describe exactly how the Republican \nbill does just that. I am also going to describe how the Republican \nbill will create new patient rights and protections which\n\n[[Page S8345]]\n\nwould have prevented the tragic situations described by my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle.\n\n  Finally, I want to talk about how the Republican bill achieves these \ngoals in an accountable manner, without increasing health care costs, \nwithout a massive new Federal Government bureaucracy, and without \ntaking health care insurance away from children and families. It \ndoesn't cost money to increase your ability to make sure you are aware \nof what is available. The heart of the Republican Patients' Bill of \nRights Plus Act is a fair process for independent external review that \naddresses consumer concerns about getting access to appropriate and \ntimely medical care in a managed care plan.\n  The Republican bill establishes gateways that ensure medical disputes \nget heard by an independent, external reviewer. The plan does not have \nveto power in these decisions. Denials or disputes about medical \nnecessity and appropriateness are eligible for review, period. If a \nplan considers a treatment to be experimental or investigational, it is \neligible for external review. The reviewer is an independent physician \nof the same specialty as the treating physician. In addition, the \nreviewer must have adequate expertise and qualifications, including \nage-appropriate expertise in the patient's diagnosis.\n  So, in other words, a pediatrician must review a pediatric case and a \ncardiologist must review a cardiology case. In the Republican bill, \nonly qualified physicians are permitted to overturn medical decisions \nby treating physicians. The reviewer then makes an independent medical \ndecision based on the valid, relevant scientific and clinical evidence. \nThis standard ensures that patients get medical care based on the most \nup-to-date science and technology.\n  The Kennedy bill describes medical necessity in the statute. It does \nnot define it in a manner that ensures that patients will get the \nhighest quality care and the most up-to-date technology.\n  The Republican bill ensures that physicians will make independent \ndeterminations based on the best available scientific evidence. That is \nthe standard, the best available scientific evidence. It is that \nsimple. Health plans cannot game the system and block access to \nexternal review. To ensure this is the case, I have asked the private \nlaw firm of Ivins, Phillips & Baker to analyze the Republican external \nreview provision, asking two key questions: First, could a plan block a \npatient from getting access to external review in a manner that is \ninconsistent with the intent of our provision?\n  Second, is there any factor that would prevent the external reviewer \nfrom rendering a fair and independent medical decision?\n  I request that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                     Ivins, Phillips & Barker,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 1999.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: You have asked us to provide you with \n     our opinion on the outcomes of certain medical claims denials \n     under the bill reported out of your Committee, The Patients' \n     Bill of Rights Act of 1999, S. 326 (the ``Bill'').\n       In each of these examples, a claim is made for coverage or \n     reimbursements under an employer-provided health plan, and \n     the claim is denied. You have specifically asked us to \n     comment on whether the claims would be eligible for \n     independent external review under the Bill, which provides \n     the right to such review for denials of items that would be \n     covered under the plan but for a determination that the item \n     is not medically necessary and appropriate, or is \n     experimental or investigational.\n     A. Bill's provisions for independent external review\n       If a participant or beneficiary in an employer-provided \n     health plan makes a claim for coverage or reimbursement under \n     the plan, and the claim is denied, the Bill amends the \n     Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to \n     provide that he or she has the right to written notice and \n     internal appeal of the denial within certain time-frames set \n     forth by statute.\\1\\ If the adverse coverage determination is \n     upheld on internal appeal, the Bill provides that the \n     participant or beneficiary in certain cases has the right to \n     independent external review.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The right to independent external review exists for denial \n     of an item or service that (1) would be a covered benefit \n     when medically necessary and appropriate under the terms of \n     the plan, and has been determined not to be medically \n     necessary and appropriate; or (2) would be a covered benefit \n     when not experimental or investigational under the terms of \n     the plan, and has been determined to be experimental or \n     investigational.\\3\\\n       A participant or beneficiary who seeks an independent \n     external review must request one in writing, and the plan \n     must select an entity qualified under the Bill to designate \n     an independent external reviewer. Under the Bill's standard \n     of review, the independent external reviewer must make an \n     ``independent determination'' based on ``valid, relevant, \n     scientific and clinical evidence'' to determine the medical \n     necessity and appropriateness, or experimental or \n     investigational nature of the proposed treatment. \\5\\\n     B. Fact patterns\n       You have asked us to review whether the following fact \n     patterns would be eligible for external review under the \n     terms of the Bill. You have also asked for our judgment on \n     whether any factor in these examples would compromise the \n     reviewer's ability to make an independent decision.\n       Fact Pattern 1: An employer contracts with an HMO. The HMO \n     contract (the plan document) states that the ``HMO will cover \n     everything that is medically necessary'' and that the ``HMO \n     has the sole discretion to determine what is medically \n     necessary.''\n       Question 1: Would any denial of coverage or treatment based \n     on medical necessity be eligible for external review?\n       Answer: All claims denials would be eligible for \n     independent external review under the Bill.\n       The hypothetical employer who drafted this plan may have \n     thought that, by covering all ``medically necessary'' items, \n     the plan incorporates medical necessity as one of the plan's \n     terms. Under this apparent view, any coverage denial by \n     the HMO at its sole discretion, would be a fiduciary act \n     of plan interpretation, rather than a medical judgment. \n     Under this view, then, all claims denials would be \n     contract decisions rather than medical ones, and no \n     denials would be eligible for independent external review.\n       The terms of the Bill clearly prevent this end-run around \n     its intent. The Bill provides that the right of external \n     review exists for any denial of an item that is covered but \n     for a determination based on medical necessity, etc., ``under \n     the terms of the plan.'' That is, the statutory language \n     provides for external review of any determination of medical \n     necessity, etc., even when that determination is intertwined \n     with an interpretation of the plan's terms.\n       The report of your Committee clarifies that intent. The \n     report explicitly notes that ``some coverage discussions \n     involve an element of medical judgment or a determination of \n     medical necessity.'' After walking through an example of a \n     coverage decision which involves such a judgment, the report \n     concludes that your Committee intends that such ``coverage \n     denials that involved a determination about medical necessity \n     and appropriateness'' would be eligible for independent \n     external review.\\5\\\n       That is, under the Bill any interpretation of the plan's \n     terms triggers independent external review when that \n     interpretation involves an ``element of medical judgment.''\n       To further remove any ambiguity on this point, the \n     Committee report states that any determination of medical \n     necessity is eligible for independent external review, even \n     if the criteria of medical necessity are partly included as \n     plan terms requiring contract interpretation: ``The committee \n     is interested in ensuring that, in cases where a plan \n     document's coverage policy on experimental or investigational \n     treatment is not explicit or is linked to another policy that \n     requires interpretation, disputes arising out of these kinds \n     of situations will be eligible for external review.'' \\6\\\n       Thus, even assuming that the HMO's determinations in this \n     example are plan interpretations by a fiduciary, they are not \n     saved from independent external review under your bill. Any \n     coverage determination by the HMO in this example involves \n     ``an element of medical judgment or a determination of \n     medical necessity,'' and is therefore eligible for \n     independent external review under the Bill and Committee \n     report. Moreover, the standard used by the HMO in this \n     example for determining medical necessity is not \n     ``explicit,'' and is therefore eligible for independent \n     external review under the Bill and Committee report.\n       In short, under the hypothetical plan of this example, all \n     claims would involve determinations of medical necessity, and \n     all denials would be eligible for independent external \n     review.\n       Question 2: Is there any factor that would prevent the \n     reviewer from rendering an independent decision?\n       Answer. No. The reviewer's decision must be independent. \n     Under the Bill, the reviewer shall consider the standards and \n     evidence used by the plan, but is intended to use other \n     appropriate standards as well. It is expressly intended that \n     the review not defer to the plan's judgment under the \n     deferential ``arbitrary and capricious'' standard of review.\n       Under the Bill, the independent external review must make \n     an ``independent determination'' based on ``valid, relevant, \n     scientific and clinical evidence,'' to determine medical \n     necessity, etc. In making his or her determination, the \n     independent external reviewer must ``take into consideration \n     appropriate and available information,'' which includes any \n     ``evidence based decision making\n\n[[Page S8346]]\n\n     or clinical practice guidelines used by the group health \n     plan,'' as well as timely evidence or information submitted \n     by the plan, the patient or the patient's physician, the \n     patient's medical record, expert consensus, and medical \n     literature.\\7\\\n       That is, under the Bill the reviewer is instructed to \n     consider standards and evidence used by the plan, but is \n     intended to include other standards and evidence as well. The \n     Committee report clarifies this by stating that the external \n     review shall ``make an assessment that takes into account the \n     spectrum of appropriate and available information.'' \\8\\ \n     Fleshing out the above-cited list set forth in the statute, \n     the report further clarifies that such information can \n     include, for example, peer-reviewed scientific studies, \n     literature, medical journals, and the research results of \n     Federal agency studies.\\9\\\n       Moreover, the reviewer is not bound by the standard or \n     evidence use by the plan, but must rather ``make an \n     independent determination and not be bound by any one \n     particular element.'' \\10\\ The Committee report further \n     states that the independent reviewer should not use an \n     ``arbitrary and capricious'' standard in reviewing the plan's \n     decision.\\11\\ That is, the reviewer is specifically \n     prohibited from using the deferential standard now used by \n     federal courts in reviewing certain coverage determinations \n     by ERISA plan fiduciaries.\n       In short, the Bill provides that the reviewer shall use not \n     only the standards and evidence considered by the plan, but \n     other appropriate standards as well, in rendering its \n     independent judgment.\n       Fact Pattern 2: A plan covers medically necessary \n     procedures but specifically excludes cosmetic procedures. An \n     infant born to a participant is born with a severe cleft \n     palate. The infant's physician contends that plastic surgery \n     to correct the cleft palate is necessary so the child can \n     perform normal functions like eating and speaking. The plan \n     denies the request on the grounds that it does not cover \n     cosmetic surgery. The participant appeals the decision, \n     arguing that the procedure is medically necessary. The \n     treating physician provides supporting documentation that the \n     procedure is medically necessary.\n       Question 1: Is the denial of surgery in this example \n     eligible for external review?\n       Answer: Yes, the denial of surgery in this example is \n     eligible for independent external review under the Bill.\n       The plan in this example covers surgery generally, but \n     excludes ``cosmetic'' surgery. As with many plans, the term \n     ``cosmetic'' is not defined. There is therefore no express \n     basis in the plan's terms for inferring that ``cosmetic'' is \n     defined as a procedure that is not ``medically necessary and \n     appropriate.'' Does this mean that the claims denial in this \n     example is merely an act of plan interpretation, without any \n     determination of medical necessity? And if so, does this mean \n     that the denial is not eligible for external review?\n       No. Under the terms of the Bill, any denial based on \n     medical necessity, etc., is eligible for external review. \n     This is so even if the denial is based on plan terms that do \n     not expressly incorporate a reference to medical necessity, \n     as long as interpretation of those terms involves ``an \n     element of medical judgment.''\n       This intent is spelled out in the report of your Committee, \n     which, as already noted, states that ``The committee \n     recognizes that some coverage determinations involve an \n     element of medical judgment or a determination of medical \n     necessity and appropriateness.'' \\12\\ The report goes on to \n     give an example: ``For instance, a plan might cover surgery \n     that is medically necessary and appropriate, but exclude from \n     coverage surgery that is performed solely to enhance physical \n     appearance. In these cases, a plan must make a determination \n     of medical necessity and appropriateness in order to \n     determine whether the procedure is a covered benefit.''\n       The report concludes that, ``It is the committee's \n     intention that coverage denials that involved a determination \n     about medical necessity and appropriateness, such as the \n     example above, would be eligible for external review.''\n       In the example discussed here, the plan's denial is based \n     on its determination that the procedure is ``cosmetic'' under \n     the terms of the plan. This interpretation of the plan \n     includes a significant element of medical judgment. This is \n     so despite the fact that plan uses the term ``cosmetic'' \n     without an express reference to medical necessity. The \n     essential element of medical judgment is evidenced in part by \n     the fact that the treating physician provides documentation \n     for his or her judgment that the treatment is necessary for \n     certain basic life functions.\n       In short, the coverage dispute in this example turns on \n     whether the procedure is cosmetic under the plan's terms. \n     Under the Bill as amplified by the report of your Committee, \n     this determination includes an ``element of medical judgment \n     or determination of medical necessity.'' Therefore, the \n     denial is eligible for independent external review under the \n     Bill.\n       Question 2: Is there any factor that would prevent the \n     reviewer from rendering an independent decision?\n       Answer: No, the reviewer's decision is independent, for the \n     reasons set forth in our answer to this question in the above \n     Fact Pattern 1. That is, under the Bill the reviewer shall \n     use not only the standards and evidence considered by the \n     plan, but other appropriate standards as well, in \n     rendering its independent, nondeferential judgment as to \n     whether the requested treatment is medically necessary and \n     appropriate or experimental and investigational.\n       Fact Pattern 3: The employer contracts with an HMO that has \n     a closed-panel network of providers which includes \n     pediatricians. A baby born to a participant is born with a \n     severe and rare heart defect. The infant's own network \n     pediatrician, who is not a pediatric cardiologist (i.e., a \n     pediatric sub-specialist), recommends that the infant be \n     treated by such a specialist. The network does not include a \n     pediatric cardiologist. The plan denies coverage for a non-\n     network pediatric sub-specialist, saying that one of the \n     plan's network pediatricians can provide any medically \n     necessary care for the infant.\n       Question 1: Is the denial in this case eligible for \n     independent external review?\n       Answer: Yes, the denial of pediatric sub-specialist care in \n     this example is eligible for independent external review \n     under the Bill.\n       The Bill requires that participants have access to \n     specialty care if covered under the plan.\\13\\ The report of \n     your Committee explains that a health plan must ``ensure that \n     plan enrollees have access to specialty care when such care \n     is needed by an enrollee and covered under the plan and when \n     such access is not otherwise available under the plan.'' \\14\\\n       The bill defines specialty care with respect to a condition \n     as ``care and treatment provided by a health care \n     practitioner . . . that has adequate expertise (including age \n     appropriate expertise) through appropriate training and \n     experience.'' \\15\\\n       In short, the Bill defines specialty care in terms of \n     whether the care is ``needed'' by the enrollee, and by \n     reference to whether the care is ``adequate,'' and the \n     expertise ``appropriate.''\n       Under the terms of the Bill, then, a physician's \n     determination that specialty care is required is by its terms \n     a judgment based on the medical necessity and appropriateness \n     of that care. Therefore, the treating physician's \n     recommendation in this example that the infant be treated by \n     a pediatric subspecialist is a judgment of medical necessity. \n     The plan's denial of such specialty care is a denial of an \n     otherwise covered service, based on a judgment of the medical \n     necessity or appropriateness of that service. The denial is \n     eligible for independent external review under the terms of \n     the Bill.\n       Question 2: Is there any factor that would prevent the \n     reviewer from rendering an independent decision in this case?\n       Answer: No, the reviewer's decision is independent, for the \n     reasons set forth in our answer to this questions in the \n     above Fact Patterns 1 and 2. That is, under the Bill the \n     reviewer shall use not only the standards and evidence \n     considered by the plan, but other appropriate standards as \n     well, in rendering its independent judgment as to whether the \n     requested treatment is medically necessary and appropriate or \n     experimental and investigations.\n       Fact Pattern 4: A participant calls the plan to report that \n     the participant's infant is very sick, and inquiries about \n     emergency services. The plan representative pre-authorizes \n     coverage in a participating emergency facility, which is 20 \n     miles away. Alarmed by the infant's various severe symptoms, \n     the participant instead takes the infant to a nearby \n     emergency facility which is only 5 minutes away. Shortly \n     after arrival, the baby is diagnosed as having spinal \n     meningitis, and goes into respiratory arrest. The baby is \n     immediately treated and stabilized, and tissue damage that \n     might otherwise have resulted is avoided. The participant \n     submits a claim to the plan for reimbursement of the \n     emergency treatment. The claim for reimbursement is denied on \n     the grounds that coverage was preauthorized only if provided \n     in the more distant, in-network, emergency facility specified \n     by the plan representative.\n       Question 1: Would the denial of reimbursement in this case \n     be eligible for independent external review?\n       Answer: Yes, under the Bill the denial of reimbursement \n     would be eligible for review by an independent external \n     reviewer.\n       The Bill requires that if a plan covers emergency services, \n     it must in some cases cover such services without pre-\n     authorization, and without regard to whether the services are \n     provide out-of-network.\n       Specifically, such coverage must be provided for \n     ``appropriate emergency medical screening examinations'' and \n     for additional medical care to ``stabilize the emergency \n     medical condition,'' to the extent a ``prudent layperson who \n     possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine'' would \n     determine that an examination was needed to determine \n     whether ``emergency medical care'' is needed.\\16\\ \n     ``Emergency medical care'' is defined as care to evaluate \n     or stabilize a medical condition manifesting itself by \n     ``acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe \n     pain)'' such that a ``prudent layperson who possesses an \n     average knowledge of health and medicine'' could \n     reasonably expect the absence of medical care to endanger \n     the health of the patient or result in serious impairment \n     of a bodily function or serious dysfunction of any bodily \n     organ or part.\\17\\\n       That is, under the Bill, reimbursement for the services in \n     this example must be provided if the services satisfy the \n     ``prudent layperson'' standard of the bill. The prudent \n     layperson standard is met if an individual without \n     specialized medical knowledge could reasonably reach the \n     decision, based on the patient's symptoms, that lack of \n     medical care could possibly result in severely worsened \n     health or injury, and that expert medical observation is \n     therefore necessary.\n\n[[Page S8347]]\n\n       A determination made by the ``prudent layperson'' is \n     therefore a determination of medical necessity or \n     appropriateness--albeit one made under a nontechnical, \n     nonexpert, standard. Under the Bill, a plan is required to \n     incorporate this lower, non-expert or ``prudent layperson'' \n     standard in evaluating whether to cover non-pre-authorized, \n     out-of-network emergency medical care.\n       In this example, the participant's judgment, based on the \n     baby's symptoms, that the baby should be observed as quickly \n     as possible by medical experts at the nearer facility, is a \n     judgment of medical necessity and appropriateness, made under \n     this lower, non-expert standard. Likewise, the plan's denial \n     of coverage in this case is based on the plan's determination \n     that the participant's judgment concerning medical necessity \n     was in error even under this lower standard.\n       In short, the coverage dispute in this case involves a \n     judgment of medical necessity and appropriateness under the \n     ``prudent layperson'' standard mandated by the Bill, and is \n     therefore eligible for independent external review under the \n     Bill.\n       Question 2: Is there any factor that would prevent the \n     reviewer from rendering an independent decision?\n       Answer: No, the reviewer's decision is independent, for the \n     reasons set forth in our answer to this question in the above \n     Fact Patterns 1, 2 and 3. That is, under the Bill the \n     reviewer shall use not only the standards and evidence \n     considered by the plan, but other appropriate standards as \n     well, in rendering its independent judgment as to whether the \n     requested treatment is medically necessary and appropriate or \n     experimental and investigational.\n       I hope this letter has been responsive to your request. \n     Please do not hesitate to have your staff contact me for any \n     questions with respect to the points here discussed.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 Rosina B.

Let me provide examples of how our external review \nprovisions ensure that patients and children get medical care.\n  Chart 1 illustrates under the Republican bill that the health plan \ncannot ``game the system'' by blocking access to external review or \nusing some cleverly worded definition of ``medical necessity.'' The \nRepublican provision ensures that people get the medical care they \nneed.\n  Here is an example of an HMO that has a planned contract which says \nthe HMO will cover ``medically necessary care'' but the HMO has the \nsole discretion to determine what is ``medically necessary.''\n  Of course, this is an extreme example. Let's see if it holds up under \nour external review provision. In this example, the patient and \nphysician may not know the plan's rationale for denying a claim since \nit is the HMO's sole discretion to determine medical necessity. This \ncan be frustrating for both the patient and the physician.\n  Under the Republican bill, a denied claim would be eligible for an \noutside independent medical review. In fact, all denied medical claims \nunder this example would be eligible for review under our provision. \nThis is confirmed by the outside legal analysis which I have submitted \nfor the Record. The legal opinion says:\n\n       The statutory language provides for external review of any \n     determination of medical necessity and appropriateness, even \n     when that determination is intertwined with an interpretation \n     of the plan's terms.\n\n  The external reviewer would make an independent medical \ndetermination. There is nothing in the HMO contract or in the \nlegislative provision that prevents the reviewer from making the best \ndecision for the patient. If the patient needs the medical care, the \nreviewer will make this assessment. They will get the care. The \nindependent reviewer's decision is binding on the plan.\n  Chart 2 is an example of a cleft palate. This chart illustrates that \npatients, and especially children, will get necessary health care \nservices. Plans will not be able to deem a procedure as ``cosmetic'' \nand thus block access to external review. Only physicians can make \ncoverage decisions involving medical judgment.\n  An example we have heard many times from our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle is of an infant born with a cleft palate. The \ninfant's physician recommends surgery so the child can perform normal \ndaily functions, such as eating and speaking normally. The treating \nphysician says this surgery is medically necessary and appropriate. In \nthis example, the HMO planned contract states: ``The plan does not \ncover cosmetic surgery.'' It was denied as a claim, saying the child's \nsurgery is not a covered benefit because it is a cosmetic procedure, \ndespite the recommendations of the treating physician.\n  What does this mean? Does this mean this is the end of the road for \nthis child's family? No. Under the Republican bill, this denial of \ncoverage would be eligible for appeal because the decision involves an \n``element of medical judgment.'' Under the Republican bill, medical \ndecisions are made by physicians with appropriate expertise. In this \ncase, it means an independent reviewer would be required to have \npediatric expertise.\n  Finally, the independent medical reviewer would look at the range of \nappropriate clinical information and would have the ability to overturn \nthe plan's decision. The child would receive the surgery to correct the \ncleft palate, and the plan would cover this procedure because the \nreviewer's decision is binding on the plan.\n\n  The next chart is on emergency room coverage. The primary point of \nthis chart is that under the prudent layperson standard, parents can \nuse their judgment and take their sick child to the nearest emergency \nroom without worrying about whether the plan will deny coverage.\n  Another example we are all familiar with is of little Jimmy whose \ntragic story has been told by Senator Durbin. His parents called the \nHMO when their baby fell ill. The HMO nurse recommended the parents \ntake their sick child to a participating hospital an hour's drive away. \nDuring their long drive, the family passed several closer hospitals \nalong the way. The child's symptoms grew worse and the baby went into \nrespiratory arrest. By the time they got to the hospital, the one that \nthe HMO said was covered by a plan, it was too late. The tissue damage \nresulted in the loss of a limb and little Jimmy had to endure a \nquadruple amputation. This is a horrible situation.\n  Let's look at what the Republican bill would do to address this type \nof tragic and unnecessary situation. First, under our prudent layperson \nstandard, a parent would not have to call the HMO to get permission to \ngo to the nearest emergency room. In this case, the parents could have \ngone to the closest emergency room and little Jimmy would not have gone \ninto respiratory arrest. This tragedy would have been averted under the \nRepublican provision because our bill ensures that emergency room \nservices must be provided without preauthorization and without regard \nto whether the services are provided out of network.\n  Say for the sake of argument that the plan denies reimbursements \nafter the hospital has provided the treatment. Under the Republican \nbill, little Jimmy's family would not be stuck with the hospital \ncharges. They could appeal this decision to an outside reviewer because \nthe decisions about whether care is medically necessary are eligible \nfor external review.\n  The law firm of Ivins, Phillips & Baker says that under our \nprovision:\n\n       The coverage dispute in this case involves a judgment of \n     medical necessity and appropriateness under the prudent \n     layperson standard mandated by the bill, and therefore is \n     eligible for independent external review under the bill.\n\n  This is a quote from the letter that has been previously printed in \nthe Record.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The independent medical reviewer can make an \nindependent decision and overturn the plan denying reimbursement. This \ndecision is binding on the plan and not appealable.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would the Senator from Vermont yield for a question?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Let me finish.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. As Members can see from the examples on these charts, \nthe\n\n[[Page S8348]]\n\nRepublican Patients' Bill of Rights ensures patients get the medical \ncare they need, that parents can be assured their children will be \ncared for by appropriate specialists, and that people can go forward to \nemergency rooms when they are sick, when the children are sick, and can \ndo so with the assurance that their health plan will cover these \nservices.\n  Establishing these important rights will help families avoid illness, \ninjury, and improve the quality of health care. I believe this is why \nwe are debating this issue today. You can't sue your way to health \ncare. Congress can't create a definition of ``medical necessity'' that \nis better than letting physician experts make decisions on the best \navailable science. They must practice the best available science.\n  However, we can improve access to health care services and ensure \nthat people get timely access to the medical care they need. We can \nensure that health care we provide is high quality health care. Most \nimportant, we can do all these things without increasing health care \ncosts and causing more Americans to lose their coverage.\n  We accomplish all these goals with the Republican Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment goes to the heart of the \nissue. I urge our colleagues to pay attention to the exchange we are \ngoing to have on the floor of the Senate.\n  Let us look, first, at what is in the Democratic bill. In the \nDemocratic bill, ``medical necessity,'' as defined on page 86, is \n``medically necessary or appropriate.'' That is the standard definition \nmedicine has used for 200 years. It is the standard recommended by none \nother than the Health Insurance Association of America itself, on page \n269:\n\n       Medical necessity. Term used by insurers to describe \n     medical treatment that is appropriate and rendered in \n     accordance with generally accepted standards of medical \n     practice.\n\n  Our legislation does what the Health Insurance Association of America \nrecommended. This is the standard that has been used for 200 years. \nThis is the standard that is supported by the medical profession.\n  The Republican plan knocks that standard out. It knocks it out. What \ndo they put in as a substitute? As a substitute, on page 148, they say \n``medical necessity'' used in making coverage determinations is \ndetermined ``by each plan.'' ``By each plan.'' The plan can define \nmedical necessity any way it wants.\n  In their appeals procedure we find that medical necessity issues can \nbe appealed, but medical necessity is defined by the HMO.\n  That sounds complicated. What does it mean in real terms? Let me read \nyou a few examples of how HMOs have defined medical necessity. Here is \na company--I will not give its name--and their definition. The company:\n\n       . . . will have the sole discretion to determine whether \n     care is medically necessary. The fact that care has been \n     recommended, provided, prescribed or approved by a physician \n     or other provider will not establish the care is medically \n     necessary.\n\n  In other words, medical necessity is whatever the HMO says. Whatever \nthe HMO says.\n  Here is an example of Aetna U.S. Health Care, the provision in their \nTexas contract:\n\n       The least costly of alternative supplies. . . .\n\n  Here is another HMO:\n\n       The shortest, least expensive, or least intensive level. . \n     . .\n\n  They throw out the medical necessity standard used for 200 years and \nsay, medical necessity will be whatever the HMO wants it to be. That is \nthe heart of this issue.\n  What do we find when the HMO uses their own medical necessity \ndefinition? Who makes the judgment? It is an insurance company \nbureaucrat. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  Finally, when you see the appeals procedures which will be addressed \nby my other colleagues, all you have to do is look at the Consumers \nUnion and many other consumer groups. The consumer groups believe their \nappeals procedure does not provide adequate protections.\n  The American Bar Association believes basic consumer protections are \nnot met. The American Arbitration Association makes the same judgment.\n  This is a status quo amendment. If you want to do nothing about the \npain and injury being experienced by children, women, and family \nmembers in our country, go ahead and support this program. It is an \nindustry protection amendment. It will protect the profits of the \nindustry; it puts the profits of the industry ahead of protecting \npatients.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is \nabsolutely correct. This amendment essentially puts into the bill the \nbasic premise of the Republican plan, which is to let the HMO define \nwhat is medically necessary, decide what the treatment should be, what \nthe length of hospitalization should be for a patient, not based on \nthat patient, not based on medical necessity, but based on standards \nthat individuals who have not even seen the patient determine.\n  I must tell you I have a very real problem with that. The insurance \nplan would determine medical necessity, not the physician who sees the \npatient. It would substitute an independent review process for the \nknowledge and the skill of the independent physician who is actually \nseeing the patient, who has done the diagnosis, who knows the patient, \nthe patient's history the patient's problems.\n  This past week I spent a good deal of time in California talking with \nphysicians and patients up and down the State. I probably talked with \nmore than 50 people, including patients, hospital administrators, \ncounty medical societies of many different counties as well as the \nCalifornia Medical Association. What I found was a dispirited, \ndemoralized medical profession because medical decisionmaking was being \ntaken out of their hands. I learned that a physician would prescribe \nmedication, the patient would go to the druggist to have the medication \nfilled and the druggist would make a substitution, often without even \nthe doctor knowing. The patient would say: I cannot take this drug. And \nthe pharmacist would have to say: We cannot furnish what your physician \nprescribed because it was not on your plan's list. This is what we mean \nby medical necessity --the most appropriate medical treatment for that \nparticular patient in the judgment of the treating physician.\n  I contend there is not anyone who has not seen a patient, who doesn't \nknow what patient is all about, who can adequately prescribe for that \nindividual. That, in fact, is what is happening.\n  Let me read a statement by someone who testified before a \ncongressional House committee a couple of years ago in a hearing. This \nindividual was the reviewer for an HMO. As an HMO reviewer, she \ncountermanded a physician. Let me read her words:\n\n       Since that day I have lived with this act and many others \n     eating into my heart and soul. For me, a physician is the \n     professional charged with the care of healing of his or her \n     fellow human beings. The primary ethical norm is, `Do no \n     harm.' I did worse. I caused death.\n       Instead of using a clumsy weapon, I used the simplest, \n     cleanest of tools, my words. This man died because I denied \n     him a necessary operation to save his heart. I felt little \n     pain or remorse at the time. The man's faceless distance \n     soothed my conscience. Like a skilled soldier, I was trained \n     for this moment. When any moral qualms arose I was to \n     remember I am not denying care, I am only denying payment.\n\n  That is why this Republican amendment is so fallacious. Let me read \nthe actual language in the bill:\n\n       A review of an appeal under this subsection relating to a \n     determination to deny coverage based on a lack of medical \n     necessity and appropriateness, or based on a experimental or \n     investigational treatment, shall be made only by a physician \n     with appropriate expertise including age appropriate \n     expertise, who was not involved in the initial determination.\n\n  My father, chief of surgery at the University of California, would \nturn over in his grave with this kind of language. That is not what \nsomeone goes to medical school and does a residency, does a surgical \nresidency, does graduate school work for, to get overturned\n\n[[Page S8349]]\n\nby an insurance company reviewer who has not even seen the patient. \nThis amendment, I contend, is in the worst of medical practice because \nit allows a panel that has never seen the patient to make the \ndetermination of whether a patient gets a lifesaving operation, gets a \ndrug that might make them well, gets a treatment from which the \nphysician thinks they might benefit.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to answer my good friend \nfrom California. I do not believe she was listening to my explanation \nof what this bill does. In fact, we do throw out 200 years of law \npractice. That shakes the legal community up a bit because they have to \nlearn what is going on in modern medical situations. They have to \nbecome aware of how they find out what the best medicine is, not \nnecessarily what is used in that area. It is the best medicine \navailable.\n  We set a higher standard, and that is why the legal profession is a \nlittle bit upset. They do not want to have to learn all this medical \nstuff. They want to go back to the good old days when they could just \ncall the local doctor and say: What is the general medical practice? \nAnd whatever that doctor does is the general medical practice. That is \nthe present standard. We say that is not good enough now.\n  We are going to make sure that every person in an HMO has the right \nto the best medical care available, and that is what we explained with \nchart 1, chart 2, and chart 3. The decision is made by the external \nreviewer who says: Look, you can use this treatment now, you can use \nthis pharmacy prescription, and that can be cured. You did not use it, \nyou are not going to use it--that is wrong. Give them that care.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Certainly.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Does the Senator from Vermont really believe the best \ntreatment can be provided by a reviewer who has never seen the patient?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. There is nothing that says the reviewer never sees the \npatient. The reviewer is an expert. He is the one who is qualified in \nthat profession to know, who reviews the records. There is nothing that \nsays he cannot also see the patient and interview the patient. This is \nnot going to be a judgment done in some courthouse with a jury \ndetermining something. This is going to be done by an expert in the \nfield who is dealing with a patient to make sure that patient gets the \nbest available health care, the best of medicine that is available.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield to me a moment?\n  I met some of the reviewers this past week. They did not see the \npatient. They made the decisions based on their insurance companies' \ndefinitions of medical necessity, not based on the particular needs of \nthe individual patients.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. This is new. This does not exist anywhere. We are \ncreating a new policy to ensure the best health care possible for every \nAmerican.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to ask the Senator from California a question. \nWhere in the earlier response does it say they will use the best \npractices?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It does not.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It does not say that. To the contrary, does the Senator \nnot agree that we have example after example where HMOs have used \ndefinition based on lowest cost?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. As a matter of fact, I can read terminology right out \nof insurance contracts, which I was going to read had my amendment been \nable to come to the floor. As the Senator knows, the purpose of this \namendment is essentially to defeat the amendment I was going to offer, \nthat I did offer to the Agriculture Appropriations bill and that I said \nlast week that I was going to offer to this bill, to allow the \nphysician to give the treatment and prevent the HMO from arbitrarily \ninterfering with or altering the treating physician's decision, whether \nit be the treatment or the hospital length of stay.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  There are two pernicious parts to this amendment. One is removing the \naccurate definition of medical necessity, as the Senators from \nMassachusetts and California have pointed out, and the second is \nputting in an appeals process that is nothing short of bogus in a whole \nvariety of ways. When you look at the appeals process that is being \nsubstituted by the Senator from Vermont, you understand how grudging it \nis, how imperfect it is, how it will not do the job. Let me give a few \nexamples.\n  First, there is no timeliness. The HMO can initiate the appeals \nprocess whenever it wants. It could wait 3 months or 6 months or 9 \nmonths before review. Our amendment, which the Senator from North \nCarolina and I will offer, requires the review process to start when \nthe patient asks.\n  Second, there is no requirement that the appeals process, after it is \nfinished, be implemented. The HMO can appeal and appeal and appeal.\n  The two I want to focus on this afternoon are these: First, it is \nmuch more limited in scope. I say to my friends and my fellow Americans \nwho are watching this debate, this is not two competing bills; this is \none bill that does the job and one bill that seeks to please the \ninsurance industry and still make it look as if the job is being done.\n  One of the main issues is scope: 160 million covered versus 48 \nmillion covered for emergency room, for medical necessity, and for \nother things. Thirty-eight million people would be included in the \nSchumer-Edwards amendment who are excluded by this amendment.\n  Perhaps the greatest area where this amendment is a false promise, is \na hoax, is the independent review. The Senator from Vermont said the \nreview is independent. Not so. In the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Vermont, the reviewer is appointed by the HMO. The reviewer is not \neven required to have no financial relationship with the HMO. \nTheoretically, under this proposal, the HMO could pay an \n``independent'' reviewer. If we want an independent external review, \nwhy shouldn't that reviewer have no ties to the HMO?\n  How can we tell people that an independent review is independent when \nthe insurer selects the reviewer? If you have ever heard of the fox \nguarding the chicken coop, here it is. An independent review, as in the \namendment we will be voting on in the next few days, requires that the \nHMO not pick the reviewer. I know the Senator from Vermont has stressed \nthat a pediatrician would review a child's case. I say to my \ncolleagues, if I were a member of an HMO, I would not want a \npediatrician who has a financial relationship with the HMO to review \nthe case.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator did not yield to me. I will wait until his \ntime to answer a question.\n  What I am saying is this: If you want a real review, and hundreds of \nthousands of Americans want such a review, then vote against this \namendment, wait for the Schumer-Edwards amendment, and you will get a \ntrue independent review.\n  In conclusion, this is not so different from the gun debate we had a \nmonth and a half ago, where we had a powerful special interest on one \nside and the American people on the other side, and there were a series \nof proposals put forward that the powerful special interests liked but \nwere intended to make the American people believe we were making \nprogress.\n  I cannot tell you how or where or when, but just as in the gun \ndebate, the American people will not be fooled. They want, they demand, \na real Patients' Bill of Rights, one that covers 160 million Americans, \nnot 48 million, one that has a real review process, not a sham review \nprocess where the reviewer can be paid by the HMO. Please vote down \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Who yields time to the Senator from Pennsylvania?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the Senator from Pennsylvania 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S8350]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it is extraordinarily complex to work your way through \nthe various provisions. Representations are being made on both sides of \nthe aisle which are contradictory.\n  The Senator from New York has just made a contention that the \nindependent reviewer is not independent at all. My reading of the \nprovisions in S. 326 at page 177 set forth the qualified entities as \nthe reviewers and the designation of independent and external reviewer \nby the external appeals entity which specifies independence.\n  I will not take the time now to read it. But that reference, I think, \nwould establish the true independence of the reviewer.\n  My principal purpose in seeking recognition was to deal with the \ncomparison of the standards for ``medical necessity,'' which is the \ncore of the argument at the present time.\n  The pending amendment seeks to strike the language of the Kennedy \namendment, which defines medical necessity as ``medical necessity or \nappropriate means with respect to a service or benefit which is \nconsistent with generally accepted principles of professional medical \npractice.''\n  The language of the pending amendment, which would be substituted, \nprovides for a standard of review as follows, at pages 179 and 180:\n\n       In General.--An independent external reviewer shall--\n       (I) make an independent determination based on the valid, \n     relevant, scientific and clinical evidence to determine the \n     medical necessity, appropriateness, experimental or \n     investigational nature of the proposed treatment; and\n       (ii) take into consideration appropriate and available \n     information, including any evidence-based decision making or \n     clinical practice guidelines used by the group health plan or \n     health insurance issuer; timely evidence or information \n     submitted by the plan, issuer, patient or patient's \n     physician; the patient's medical record; expert consensus; \n     and medical literature . . .\n\n  The accompanying report amplifies ``expert consensus'' as ``including \nboth what is generally accepted medical practice and recognized best \npractice'' so that the language of the statute itself is more expansive \nin defining ``medical necessity.'' The commentary goes on to include \ngenerally accepted medical practice and adds to it: the recognized best \npractice.\n  There is no doubt that in the articulation of these competing \nprovisions, an effort is being made by one side of the aisle to top the \nother side of the aisle. It is a little hard, candidly, to follow the \nintricacies of these provisions because, as is our practice in the \nSenate, an amendment can be offered at any time, and to work through \nthe sections and subsections is a very challenging undertaking.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would the Senator from Pennsylvania yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No, I will not, but I will yield in a minute. I will not \nnow because I am right in the middle of my train of thought. I will be \nglad to yield in a moment and respond to whatever question the Senator \nfrom New York may have.\n  I supported the Robb amendment, the last vote, because the Robb \namendment had provided a standard for medical necessity, generally \naccepted medical principles, important operative procedures. At this \nstage of the record, without that definition of the requirement, as \narticulated in the Robb amendment, I thought that was improvement.\n  Now we are fencing. To say that the air is filled with politics in \nthis Chamber today would be a vast understatement. But in at least my \neffort to try to understand what is going on and to make an informed \njudgment, I am prepared to make a judgment for the Robb amendment or \nthe Kennedy amendment or the Schumer amendment contrasted with the \nNickles amendment or the Jeffords amendment. It requires a lot of \nanalysis.\n  But as I read these plans, I believe that Senator Jeffords, Senator \nFrist, and Senator Nickles are correct, that when you take a look at \nthe language they are substituting, it places a higher standard on the \nHMO, the managed care operation, than does the provision in the Kennedy \namendment which they are striking.\n  Now I would be glad to yield to the Senator from New York on his \ntime.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am yielding for a question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I appreciate the Senator searching to come up with the \nright solution here. I would ask him--he is an excellent lawyer, far \nbetter than I am--on page 179 of the bill, (iv), says:\n\n       receive only reasonable and customary compensation from the \n     group health plan or health insurance issuer in connection \n     with the independent external review . . .\n\n  It seems to me--and I ask the Senator the question--that the plan \nproposed in the substitute envisions the insurer paying the reviewer. \nThat seems to me not to be an independent review.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask the Senator, where are you reading from?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. This is S. 326, page 179. That is, as I understand it, \nthe exact language of the amendment offered by the Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Would the Senator restate the question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes. My question is, given that the amendment envisions \nthe insurer paying the reviewer, as listed in little number (iv) on \npage 179, how can we say the review in the Jeffords amendment is \nindependent?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The fact that the insurer pays the reviewer does not \nimpugn or impinge upon the reviewer's objectivity when there are \nspecific standards for the selection of the reviewer and specific \nstandards that the reviewer has to follow.\n  If I could use an analogy from a practice that I engaged in for a \nlong time as district attorney of Philadelphia, the State paid the fee \nfor the defendant in first-degree murder cases. But there was no doubt \nthat notwithstanding the fact that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \npaid defense counsel, the defense counsel worked in the interests of \nthe defendant.\n  When you have a determination as to what the HMO ought to be doing, \nthat is something they ought to pay for. But there ought to be a \nstructure to guarantee objectivity by the decisionmaker.\n  Similarly, if I can amplify, if you have a Federal judge paid by the \nFederal Government, and the Federal Government is a party to the \nprocess, nobody would say that Federal judge is going to be biased \ntoward the Federal Government simply because the Federal Government \npays his salary.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If we could give these reviewers lifetime appointments \nand salary, I might agree with the analogy of a federal judge. But, of \ncourse, these reviewers could be immediately----\n  Mr. SPECTER. The defense lawyers do not have lifetime appointments.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I understand.\n  The second question: On page 175, this reviewer is selected by the \nHMO, whereas in our plan there is an independent selection process. \nAgain, I rely on the Senator's much greater knowledge of the law. If \nthe reviewer were not selected by the HMO, they would obviously be more \nindependent. That is on page 175.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may respond, on page 177, the qualified entities \nare defined, and they are the ones that make the determination of the \nindependent reviewer. And a qualified entity is defined to be:\n\n       (I) an independent external review entity licensed or \n     accredited by a State;\n       (II) a State agency established for the purpose of \n     conducting independent external reviews;\n       (III) any entity under contract with the Federal Government \n     to provide independent external review services;\n       (IV) any entity accredited as an independent external \n     review entity by an accrediting body recognized by the \n     Secretary for such purpose; or\n       (V) any other entity meeting criteria established by the \n     Secretary for purposes of this subparagraph.\n\n  I think that language answers the question of the Senator from New \nYork about independence and expertise.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask the Senator, wouldn't we be better in guaranteeing \nindependence by having the selection of the review panel be made \nindependently of the HMO, given that the HMO--I understand there are \nsome criteria here, but if we are trying to get a truly independent \nprocess, it strikes me that it would be a lot better to have the \nselection be made truly independently, not by the HMO, which obviously \nhas an interest, albeit, as the Senator certainly recognizes and \npointed out, with a bunch of criteria.\n\n[[Page S8351]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may respond, I don't understand the \nquestion. The reason I don't understand the question is that the \nspecification of independence here is so comprehensive that it \nguarantees independence.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, if the Senator from Pennsylvania will \nrespond to a question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am glad to respond to a question at this time.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I am looking at page 30 of the actual amendment that has \nbeen offered. Looking under subsection (B)(ii), this is the designation \nof independent external reviewer, which goes to the very heart of \nwhether the review is independent or, in fact, is not independent. In \nsubsection (ii) it says there is a requirement that the reviewer ``not \nhave any material, professional, familial, or financial affiliation \nwith the case under review.''\n  My question to the Senator is--and I would like to see the language \nin the actual amendment, if he could point to it--what is it that \nrequires that the reviewer not have an ongoing financial relationship \nwith the health insurance company or with the HMO, which would in fact, \nas the Senator I am sure would recognize, make them not independent?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, I believe that that is provided by the high level \nof independence specified in the preceding section (3)(A)(ii) which \nestablishes the independence of the qualified entity which selects the \nindependent reviewer.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. My question is, Can you point to specific language in \nthe bill that requires that the reviewer, in order to be independent, \nnot have an ongoing financial relationship with the health insurance \ncompany?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, there is no suggestion that there would be that \nkind of a relationship. The language which the Senator from North \nCarolina cited takes care of one category of potential conflict of \ninterest, that they will not have any material, professional, familial, \nor financial affiliation with the case under review, the participant or \nbeneficiary involved, the treating health care professional, the \ninstitution where the treatment would take place, or the manufacturer \nof any drug, device, procedure, or other therapy proposed for the \nparticipant or beneficiary whose treatment is under review.\n  If your question is, Would there be a triple firewall if you also \nspecify the HMO? I would be inclined to have all the firewalls I could, \nas I do when I draft documents, as my distinguished colleague did when \nhe practiced law.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Senator very much, and I reclaim the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, there are two fundamental problems with this amendment \nthat go to the very heart of this debate. First, as my colleague from \nNew York pointed out, this review is not an independent review. It is \nnot an independent review by any definition of independence. The reason \nis, No. 1, the health insurance company, the HMO, chooses the entity \nwhich chooses the reviewer. I want to be precise here. That is exactly \nwhat the bill provides. The health insurance company chooses an entity; \nthat entity chooses the reviewer. So the health insurance company has \ncontrol over who ultimately does the review.\n  No. 2, the only requirement with respect to financial independence or \nprofessional independence is the requirement that I just read to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, that the reviewing entity not have a \nfinancial or professional relationship with the very specific case \nunder review, which means there is nothing to prohibit a reviewer, the \nso-called independent reviewing body under their amendment, from being \nsomebody who has a longstanding, ongoing relationship with the health \ninsurance company or with the HMO.\n  Nobody in America, certainly none of my colleagues in the Senate, \nwould believe that an independent review could be conducted by somebody \nwho has an ongoing contractual relationship and receives money from the \nhealth insurance company. There is absolutely nothing in this bill \nwhich prohibits that. That is why the Senator from New York and I have \nproposed an amendment that makes it very clear that there is a truly \nindependent reviewing body. That independence is critical and to the \nvery heart of the review process. It is why we need it.\n  I notice both the junior and the senior Senators from Pennsylvania \nare on the floor now. In Pennsylvania, these reviews are conducted by a \nState regulatory body. They are not conducted by some person chosen by \nan HMO or a health insurance company. Second, in terms of what can be \nreviewed under the State law of Pennsylvania, any consumer grievance \ncan be reviewed. It is not, as this bill is, limited to what \nconstitutes medical necessity.\n  Third, under the law of the State of Pennsylvania, the review is de \nnovo, which is absolutely not what this amendment provides.\n  Let me go back and summarize where we are. No. 1, we don't have, \nunder this amendment, an independent review. We don't have it for two \nfundamental reasons: No. 1, the health insurance company, the HMO, is \nallowed to select the body that picks the reviewer. No. 2, the \nreviewing body is allowed to have a longstanding professional or \nfinancial relationship with the HMO that has denied the claim. There is \nabsolutely nothing to prohibit that under this bill. Our amendment, \nwhich will be considered at a later time, would not allow that. So \nthere is no independent review.\n  The second problem is--and this goes to the amendment offered by my \ncolleague from California--this review process is meaningless so long \nas the reviewing body is bound by the definition of medical necessity \ncontained and written by the HMO. It is absolutely bound by the \nlanguage of the HMO.\n  I will add, in committee--I see my colleagues from Massachusetts and \nTennessee are here--Senator Kennedy asked a question to Senator Frist. \nThe question was:\n\n       Would the Senator accept language that mentions that the \n     decision would be made independent of the words of the \n     contract?\n\n  The question Senator Kennedy posed was: Would you agree that in the \nappeals process, the determination could be made without regard to the \nHMO-written definition of medical necessity?\n  Senator Frist's answer was: ``No, sir,'' in the committee. So he \nwould not concur to not be bound by the language in the HMO or health \ninsurance contract.\n  So there are two fundamental problems, and they work in concert to be \ndevastating and to make this amendment devastating to the whole concept \nof the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  No. 1, there is no independent review. The people are picked by the \nHMO, and they are allowed to have an ongoing financial relationship \nwith the HMO. No. 2, they are bound by an HMO-written definition of \nmedical necessity. That is the very heart of the amendment of my \ncolleague from California, because what this debate is ultimately about \nis whether health care decisions are going to be made by medical \nprofessionals, doctors, or whether they are going to be made by \ninsurance company bureaucrats.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 8 minutes have expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Chair.\n  First of all, it is with deep regret that I find myself on the \nopposite side of an issue from my good friend, the senior Senator from \nVermont.\n  The question before us this afternoon is medical necessity. I believe \nthis medical necessity provision is one of the most widely \nmisunderstood issues in this entire debate.\n  I think what we want to make clear is what we are not talking about \nthis afternoon. We are not talking about erasing the gains managed care \nhas made in bringing down costs. We are not talking about forcing plans \nto cover unnecessary, outmoded, or harmful practices. We are not \ntalking about forcing plans to pay for any service or treatment which \nis not already a covered benefit. This is absolutely not about giving \ndoctors a blank check. What we are talking about is making sure that \npatients get what they pay for with their premium dollars. It is\n\n[[Page S8352]]\n\nabout ensuring that an objective standard of what constitutes prudent \nmedical care is used to guide physicians and insurers in making \ntreatment and coverage decisions.\n\n  This provision is about making sure that an infant suffering from \nchronic ear infections gets drainage tubes to ameliorate his or her \ncondition. It is about making sure that a patient with a broken hip is \nnot relegated to a wheelchair in perpetuity but, rather, given the hip \nreplacement surgery that prudent medical practice dictates.\n  Although some would have us believe that ``medical necessity'' would \nundo managed care by giving doctors the power to dictate what \ntreatments and services insurers must cover, this isn't accurate. The \nreal issue is, how will questions of coverage and treatment be decided?\n  S. 1344--a bipartisan bill that I have had the privilege of \nintroducing earlier this year with Senators Graham, Lieberman, Specter, \nBaucus, Robb, and Bayh--would codify the professional standard of \nmedical necessity.\n  As defined, medically necessary services are those ``services or \nbenefits which are consistent with generally accepted principles of \nprofessional medical practice.'' This means the care that a prudent \npractitioner would give. The medical necessity standard is a well-\nsettled principle of legal jurisprudence which has been used by the \ncourts to adjudicate health law cases for nearly a century.\n  Many insurance contracts in force today contain some version of this \nstandard. In fact, remarkably similar language is found in contracts \nwritten by Prudential and Blue Cross and Blue Shield, to name a few. \nThe contractual definition of medical necessity from a Blue Cross \ncontract is care which is ``. . . consistent with standards of good \nmedical practice in the U.S.''\n  One of the reasons managed care plans are so adamantly opposed to \nputting this standard into the law is that some in the industry are \nbeginning to move in a very troubling direction, away from this \nstandard. Here is how an insurance regulator in the State of Missouri \nexplained this very alarming trend:\n\n       Increasingly, insurance regulators in my State are finding \n     that insurers are writing ``sole discretion'' clauses into \n     their contracts--meaning that it is solely up to the insurer \n     to determine whether treatment is medically necessary. \n     Therefore, without an objective standard of what constitutes \n     medically necessary care, and a requirement that treatment \n     and coverage decisions are supported by credible medical \n     evidence, any external appeals process is meaningless.\n\n  If an insurance contract gives the plan sole discretion to determine \nwhat constitutes medically necessary care, an external review panel's \nhands are tied; it will have no choice but to enforce the terms of the \ncontract, even if the coverage decision in question is completely \nirresponsible. Thus, if we don't codify the professional standard, any \nexternal review provision we pass in the Senate could be entirely \nmeaningless.\n  I have a chart here. This includes the actual medical necessity \nprovision from an insurance contract in force today. I have eliminated \nthe company's name, but this tells the whole story. If a plan has the \nsole discretion to determine what is medically necessary care, it can \nignore the doctor's recommendations, the patient's medical record, and \nany other evidence it cares to overlook in making its determination. \nYou will see it here. Here is the name of the company. That company \nwill have the sole discretion to determine whether the care is \nmedically necessary. The fact that the care has been recommended, \nprovided, described, or approved by a physician or other provider will \nnot establish that care is medically necessary. In other words, talk \nabout putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop. This is it. Here \nwe have the company deciding whether care is medically necessary, and \nthey have the final decision.\n\n  Let me give you a real world example of what can happen when a plan \nhas an imprudent definition of medical necessity. A child named Ethan \nBedrick was born with cerebral palsy and needed physical therapy to \nmaintain some degree of mobility. The insurer paid for the physical \ntherapy for a while but one day cut off payment for the services--\nwhich, by the way, were covered as an unlimited benefit under the \nplan's contract. The child's doctor thought the care was medically \nnecessary to prevent further deterioration in Ethan's condition, and \nphysical therapy is routinely provided to patients with cerebral palsy.\n  When the plan was questioned in court as to why the care had been \ndenied, the response was given that it was not medically necessary \nbecause, under the plan's definition, medically necessary care is that \nwhich will restore a person to ``full normalcy.'' Well, this child has \ncerebral palsy and he is not going to be restored to full normalcy.\n  If we do not include an objective standard of medical necessity in \nthis legislation, insurers will be able to bait and switch when it \ncomes to the delivery of services, just as they tried to do with Ethan \nBedrick.\n  The professional objective standard--and not an insurer's practice \nguidelines or opinions--should be used to determine if care is \nmedically necessary. Without the objective standard, what measure would \nan appeals body use to determine whether a treatment or coverage \ndecision was accurate or appropriate? Let me deal with two arguments \nused by those against this medical necessity provision.\n  First, they say it will prevent ``best practices'' and will force \nplans to practice substandard care. I have trouble with that. Since the \nprofessional standard of medical necessity has been the standard used \nby the courts for over a hundred years and it is a feature of many \ninsurance contracts today, why hasn't this already had the effect of \npreventing ``best practice'' medicine? In other words, I don't get the \nargument that somehow you are not going to practice the best medicine \nbecause you have to use what is medically necessary. The fact is that \nthis standard does not lock in the state of medical practice today. Why \ndo we make these giant strides forward? Because we are not locked in, \nas has been suggested.\n  Second, it is suggested that adopting this standard is tantamount to \ngiving doctors a blank check and will force plans to cover a whole \narray of services which are not covered benefits, such as aromatherapy.\n  The plain fact is, if a plan excludes aromatherapy, or any other \nservice, that is the end of the story. It excludes it. It is out. There \nis no fuss after that. If it is written in there, it is out. A patient \nwould have no basis for an external appeal in a case where a denied \nservice was clearly excluded.\n  In summary, I urge colleagues not to be swayed by the health \ninsurance industry. Both Democrats and Republicans alike acknowledge \nthe need for an external appeals process. But make no mistake about it, \nwithout a provision to ensure that plans are held to an objective \nstandard of professional medical practice, legislation giving patients \naccess to the external process will be ineffective.\n  I thank the Chair and the managers of the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes, and then I will \nyield 5 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n  My amendment is pending. I will review where we are today. My \namendment does two things. No. 1, it strikes certain provisions that we \nbelieve will be harmful to the quality of health care, and it goes back \nto medical necessity and defining medical necessity in Federal statute. \nWe will come back and talk about that. My colleagues will talk further \nabout that shortly. We also strike certain provisions that will \nincrease cost and ultimately reduce access to health insurance \ncoverage. Again, people have heard me again and again going back to the \npatients. We can simply not do anything. I believe it diminishes \nquality and at the same time diminishes access to make ourselves feel \ngood.\n  Now, what we have done, we struck that and we replaced that part of \nthe bill--the accountability provisions, the provisions on internal \nappeal, on external appeal, the issues we have been talking about in \nthe last 15 or 20 minutes--although there is a lot of misconception \nthat we need to straighten out before we actually vote on this bill, \nbecause the internal appeals process and external appeals process, \nwhich in many ways are the heart of the Patients' Bill of Rights bill, \nare important to ensure that patients do get the medical care they need \nand ensure that\n\n[[Page S8353]]\n\nultimately it is physicians, not trial lawyers, not bureaucrats, who \nmake the coverage decisions regarding medical necessity. That is what \nthis amendment is all about. I want to steer the discussion right \nthere.\n  To simplify things, so we will know how the process works, if you are \na doctor and you are a patient, and you say that a particular procedure \nshould be covered, and your plan for some reason says no, well, you \nneed an appeals process if that is what you really believe is \nappropriate to get that sort of care. What you do under our bill is go \nto an internal appeals process and work through. That is something in \nthe managed care network. It might be going to another physician within \nthe network. It is a process that has to be set up by each and every \nmanaged care plan. That is what we call an internal appeals process.\n\n  The bill on the other side of the aisle also had an internal appeals \nprocess. If the doctor and patient and the managed care internally \ncould not come to an agreement after going through a specified process, \nat that point the doctor and patient can go outside the plan. This is \nwhere the accountability is so important: Should my plan cover what is \nmedically necessary and appropriate? Outside the external appeals \nprocess is where much of the discussion has taken place.\n  Our bill has that final decision of whether or not something is \ncovered, whether or not it is medically necessary or appropriate, made \nby a medical specialist--these are words actually in the bill--\nindependent medical specialist, physician making the final decision, \nnot some bureaucrat, not some health care plan, not some trial lawyer. \nAn independent medical specialist is making the final decision in this \nexternal process.\n  Mr. President, 20 minutes ago we had discussed that the external \nreviewer has to be independent--it is written into the bill that way--\nhas to be a medical person from the same field, a specialist, if \nnecessary. Are they part of the Health Maintenance Organization? Does \nthe Health Maintenance Organization actually hire that person to make a \ndecision?\n  We have not talked about what our bill does. Our bill says in this \nexternal review process there has to be a designated entity. Nobody has \ntalked about that today. Words such as ``unbiased, external entity'' \nare in the bill. This unbiased entity is regulated by either the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services in Washington, DC, by the \nFederal Government, or by the State government. They regulate that \nentity, not the plan itself.\n  What about the independent reviewer? Where do they come from? The \nimpression which I have heard again and again is the independent \nreviewer has ties to the medical care plan and will give a biased view. \nNo; the independent medical specialist making the binding final \ndecision is appointed by the third party entity--not the plan itself \nbut this third party entity regulated by the Federal Government, State \ngovernment, or signed off for by the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. This independence from plan to entity has to be unbiased. \nThat is No. 1, to assure independence.\n  No. 2, the entity is regulated by the Federal Government or the State \ngovernment or the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  No. 3, it is written in the bill that that entity does the \nappointment of the independent medical specialist who makes the final \ndecision.\n  What information does that medical specialist use to make the final \ndecision? We don't limit the information. In fact, we encourage them to \nconsider all information. It is very specifically written in the bill \nthat the ``independent medical specialist will make an independent \ndetermination based on the valid relevant scientific and clinical \nevidence to determine the medical necessity, appropriateness, \nexperimental or investigational nature of the proposed treatment.'' \nThey will take into consideration ``all appropriate and available \ninformation, including any evidence-based decisionmaking or clinical \npractice guidelines.''\n  The point is this external review person is independent and separate \nfrom the entity and separate from the HMO.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. First, I commend the Senator from Tennessee for his very \nlucid explanation clearing up a lot of the misinformation about what is \nin the Republican package with regard to the independent, impartial, \nunbiased external review.\n  This is a very complicated issue. On the surface, the Kennedy bill \nappears to have a great deal of appeal. It sounds so simple. It reminds \nme of that expression by H.L. Mencken when he said that for every \ncomplicated problem there is a solution that is simple, easy, and \ninvariably wrong.\n  That fits the Kennedy bill on medical necessity.\n  Physicians clearly must play a central role in care decisions. No one \ndisputes or wants to minimize the critical role of treating physicians \nin the process of determining what is medically appropriate and \nnecessary care. However, the very same patient can go to different \nphysicians, be told different things, and receive markedly different \ncare.\n  This chart illustrates the problem. The Washington Family Physicians \nCollaborative Research Network studied how physicians treat bladder \ninfections for adult women. This is the second most common problem seen \nin a physician's office. Mr. President, 137 treating physicians were \nasked to describe their treatment recommendations for a 30-year-old \nwoman with a 1-day history of the infection and an uncomplicated \nurinary tract infection. They responded with 82 different treatment \noptions.\n  Which of these is the prudent physician? Which of these 82 different \ntreatments is the generally accepted principle of medical practice as \nprovided by the Kennedy bill? The Kennedy bill would require health \nplans to cover all 82 different treatments without any thought being \ngiven to what is the best treatment, what is the most effective \ntreatment, what is the newest treatment based on the latest in medical \nresearch.\n  Even if something is consistent with generally accepted principles \nand professional practice, it may not necessarily be the medically best \ntreatment for that patient. Dr. Jack Wennberg is Dartmouth's premier \nexpert in studying quality and medical outcomes. He testified before \nour committee recently that medical necessity in one community is \nunnecessary care in another.\n  Let me give an example from my home State of Maine. The Maine Medical \nAssessment Foundation conducts peer review and studies area variations \nin practice patterns in an effort to identify cases in which too many \nprocedures being performed, unnecessarily putting patients at risk. \nThey did a study that showed that physicians in one city in Maine were \nperforming a disproportionately high rate of hysterectomies. They \ncounseled the physicians in that city and were able to lower the rate, \nthus saving women from being exposed to unnecessary risks of surgery.\n  I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle, wasn't that review \nappropriate? Wasn't that review necessary? Wasn't that review a good \nidea to save these women from undergoing unnecessary hysterectomies?\n  Let me give some other examples. The Centers for Disease Control \nestimates that physicians performed 349,000 unnecessary C sections in \n1991. Again, these women were placed at risk for unnecessary surgery. \nIsn't it a good idea to question in some of these cases the decision of \nthe physician to order this unnecessary surgery?\n  Let me give yet another example. Despite solid evidence that women \nwho undergo breast-sparing surgery followed by chemotherapy or \nradiation and women who undergo total mastectomies have similar \nsurvival rates, regional preferences--as opposed to medical necessity--\nstill prevail in determining treatment.\n  There was a recent article in the New York Times which showed that \nthe rate of mastectomies was 35 times higher for Medicare patients in \none region of the country than in another. According to another study \nat Dartmouth, women in Rapid City, SD, were 33 times less likely to \nhave breast-sparing surgery than women in a similar city in Ohio.\n  Yet another example involves children. Today, treatment for frequent \near infections includes the implantation of tubes. I have a nephew who \nhad this procedure, and I am sure many of\n\n[[Page S8354]]\n\nmy colleagues have children who have gone through this as well. In \nfact, almost 700,000 children in the United States have had this \nprocedure. According to a 1994 study published in the Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association, however, this treatment is inappropriate \nfor more than a quarter of these children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used her time.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for an \nadditional 3 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. In another 41 percent of the cases reviewed, the \nclinical indications for having the tubes implanted were inconclusive \nat best.\n  A 1997 study showed that only 21 percent of elderly patients were \ntreated with beta blockers after a heart attack, despite evidence that \nmortality rates are 75 percent higher for those not receiving \ntreatment.\n  I would note, in contrast, that HMO members in plans that submit data \nto the National Committee on Quality Assurance are 2\\1/2\\ times more \nlikely than members of fee-for-service plans to receive beta blockers.\n  I could go on and on and on. Perhaps the President's own commission \nsaid it best. It concluded that excessive procedures--procedures that \nlack scientific justification--could account for as much as 30 percent \nof our Nation's medical bills.\n  Not to mention posing unnecessary risks as well as pain an suffering \nfor those who undergo these unnecessary procedures.\n  As we can see by these examples and countless more, there may well be \nvalid, indeed, very worthwhile. In fact, there may be very good reasons \nfor the health plan, in some cases, to suggest an alternative treatment \nto the one the treating physician has initially selected. It may be far \nbetter for the patient than the initial recommendation of his or her \nphysician. These examples show that, even if something is consistent \nwith generally accepted principles of professional medical practice, it \nis not necessarily appropriate high quality care. That should be our \ngoal. Our goal should be to put the patient first and to provide the \nbest quality care to that patient.\n  The Republican bill deals with the issue of medical necessity through \na strong, independent, external appeals process. That is the way to \ndeal with disputes about medical coverage. A Federal statutory \ndefinition of medical necessity is unwarranted and unwise.\n  I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 30 seconds; the \nSenator from Massachusetts has 13 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, that means there is about 20 minutes \nremaining. Just for the information of our colleagues, I think they can \nexpect a rollcall vote on this and subsequent amendments to begin at \nabout 6:45. So those offices should notify their Senators to expect \nrollcall votes beginning about 6:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if this definition, the definitions we \nhave been debating on what is medical necessity--if the Republican \ndefinitions were supported by medical organizations, I might think they \nare pretty good. But there is virtually no physician-oriented \norganization anywhere in the United States that I know of that supports \nthis particular definition of medical necessity. Every single one of \nthem supports the definition in the Daschle bill.\n  I think the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from North \nCarolina spoke eloquently as to why. Since the Senator from North \nCarolina remains on the floor, I would like to ask him this question. \nThe Senator from Rhode Island read the definition from a particular \ninsurer. Let me reread it:\n\n       [This company] will have the sole discretion to determine \n     whether care is medically necessary. The fact that care has \n     been recommended, provided, prescribed or approved by a \n     physician or other provider will not establish that the care \n     is medically necessary.\n\n  Then, in view of that, if you read on the top of page 180, in the \nbill, which sets out the guidelines for the standard of review for the \nindependent reviewer, at the top of the page and the bottom of page \n179:\n\n       The independent reviewer will take into consideration \n     appropriate and available information including any evidence-\n     based decisionmaking or clinical practice guidelines used by \n     the group health plan or insurance issuer.\n\n  How would an independent reviewer make a decision?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Under the definition the Senator has just read--and I \nmight point out the appeals process that is contained in this amendment \nis completely controlled by the HMO or health insurance company's \ndefinition of medical necessity. Throughout the process it is totally \ncontrolled by it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Then if I understand you correctly, if an insurer had \nin its plan that they will use the least costly alternative available, \nthe independent reviewer would have to find for the least costly \nalternative?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. That is absolutely correct.\n  Let's suppose we had a young child who needed a particular kind of \ncare and every physician who had treated that child recommended the \ncare for the child. But there was a less costly procedure that could be \nused, so the care was denied. Throughout the appeals process, the \ndetermination of whether it ought to be reversed or not would be based \non what is the least costly, because it is totally controlled by the \ndefinition written by the HMO.\n  In the language the Senator from California has just read to me, \nwhere it says it shall be within the ``sole discretion,'' what that \nultimately means is whatever appealing body is deciding, which is bound \nby that definition, which they are by this amendment--if they are bound \nby that definition, every appealing body would be left with no \nalternative but to affirm the decision because the contract says it is \nleft within the sole discretion of the HMO.\n\n  It goes to the very heart of the Senator's amendment. It goes to the \nvery heart of this debate. The whole question is, Are health insurance \nbureaucrats going to make health care decisions or are health care \ndecisions going to be made by doctors and health care professionals?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I just read the language. There is no language in \nthis that says the independent reviewer, even in a case of life or \ndeath, would necessarily see the patient.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. That is absolutely correct. There is nothing that \nrequires the independent reviewer to see the patient. You could have \nsome doctor who is nothing but a bureaucrat, who has not seen the \npatient, does not know what the patient needs, making the decision.\n  If I could add one thing, another problem with this so-called \nindependent review process is the HMO, the health insurance company, \nare the ones that are determining. Remember, they choose this entity \nthat chooses the reviewer. They determine who is biased or unbiased.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. And the entity pays the reviewer as well.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. They pay the reviewer. We have said it now five \ndifferent times, but talk about putting the fox in charge of the \nchicken coop. What we need to be doing is to have some truly \nindependent body making these determinations. They need to be able to \nmake the determination based upon what the patient, in my example the \nchild, really needs, based on what the doctor says the child needs.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. No, I will not.\n  It is not based on what some insurance company has written into a HMO \nor health insurance contract.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. So, in other words----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, regular order.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I believe I have the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Parliamentary inquiry. Aren't Senators supposed to go \nthrough the Chair?\n\n[[Page S8355]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Regular order. Senators are permitted to inquire and ask \nquestions. That is the regular order, Mr. President. I insist on the \nregular order, not the interruption of the Senator from North Carolina. \nWhose time is this on, Mr. President?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator from North Carolina----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time right now, at this point, is not \nbeing charged. The Senator from California had 5 minutes that she was \ncontrolling after it was allotted by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Parliamentary inquiry. Can the Senator be inquired of by \na Member of the Senate and answer a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The questions are most appropriately addressed \nthrough the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. But the Senator is entitled, the Senator from North \nCarolina, to inquire of the Senator from California, is he not?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Or vice versa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If he does so through the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I inquire of the Senator from North Carolina, through \nthe Chair, if I were a woman suffering from ovarian cancer and I have \nthis policy that I read from, and my physician said there is a small \nchance a bone marrow transplant might help you----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield an additional 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. But there is a small chance a bone marrow transplant \nmight help you, I would advise that you have it, and if the health plan \nwith this language turned it down, I would have no opportunity to have \nthat bone marrow transplant?\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. You would have absolutely no opportunity and no \nopportunity to have the decision reversed. I might add, there is a \ndouble whammy in this amendment. The double whammy is that the only \nthing that can be appealed is the determination of what is medically \nnecessary, and what is medically necessary, under the language of their \nbill is--and I am reading now from the bill--``when medically necessary \nand appropriate under the terms and conditions of the plan,'' which is \nwhat the HMO and the health insurance company's contract says.\n  People are getting whammied twice: No. 1, you cannot appeal but one \nthing, which is: Is it medically necessary? No. 2, that determination \nis based on what the health insurance company or the HMO wrote into the \nplan.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. In other words, if I may, through the Chair, if this \namendment were to be adopted, every enrollee of an HMO plan would have \nto read the fine print very carefully, because all an HMO would have to \ndo is put in a disclaimer, either medical necessity based on least cost \nor medical necessity based on the fact that the plan would have the \nultimate say on how medical necessity is defined.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. The Senator is correct, and the patient would be stuck \nwith that decision initially by the HMO and would be stuck with it \nthroughout the entire appeals process and would have absolutely--it \ngoes to the very heart of this debate: Do we want health insurance \ncompanies deciding what is medically necessary, or do we want health \ncare providers, doctors, and patients making the decisions?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Who have seen the patient.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Absolutely, doctors who have seen the patients. We \nbelieve doctors ought to make the decisions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator very much. This has been a \nhelpful clarification. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 5 \nminutes on the bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I was trying to make sure our colleagues \nunderstand the procedure in the Senate. When you have colloquies, you \ngo through the Chair. I have noticed some colloquies on this side have \nbypassed the Chair. Some colloquies on that side have bypassed the \nChair. That is not the rule of the Senate. It is important we have \ndiscussions according to the rules of the Senate. That is the way we \nshould do it. That way, we do not freeze out other colleagues who want \nto participate in colloquies. I was not trying to get under my \ncolleagues' skin. It is important we follow the rules of the Senate.\n  I want to point out that a couple of the statements made by our \ncolleagues are actually very inaccurate. Actually who pays for the \nplans and entities are very similar in both bills. Under the Democrat \nbill, S. 6, on page 66: A plan or insurer shall be conducted under \ncontract between the plan or insurer in one or more qualified external \nappeals entities.\n  That is page 66.\n  Under the Republican bill, it is the same thing, the plan selects the \nentity. They do not select the person who does the review, they select \nthe entity. The entity is licensed by the State, or it is a State \nagency established for that purpose, or it is an entity with a contract \nwith the Federal Government and they have the reviewers.\n  My point is, both the Democrat plan and the Republican plan select \nthe entities. They are the same. For them to say, oh, the Republican \nplan selects the reviewer is false. The Democrat plan, as well as the \nRepublican plan pay for the entities, they select the entities, and the \nentities themselves are independent, and the entities select the \nindividual reviewer.\n\n  There is a little--I do not want to use the word ``hypocrisy''; it is \nnot a word I often use on the floor. But to be railing against the \nRepublican plan, not stating the facts, and then say, oh, by the way; \noh, the Democrat plan, the plan selects the entities as well, I just \nfind it to be very inconsistent.\n  I urge my colleagues to see that in the Republican plan, the proposal \nwe have before us, we say the plans select the entity, and the entity \nis a qualified entity if it is an independent external reviewer and \ncredentialed by the State or a State agency established for the purpose \nof conducting the external review, or it is an entity under contract \nwith the Federal Government, or it is an entity accredited as an \nindependent external review entity by an accrediting body recognized by \nthe Secretary of HHS.\n  I just mention that. It is important we be consistent and that people \nunderstand on both sides, the Democrat proposal selects an entity very \nsimilar to that of the Republican proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from California and then \n1 minute to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I must respond to the Senator from \nOklahoma because he mischaracterizes the Democratic plan. His statement \nmight be correct if it were taken in an isolated sense. But if you take \nit with the medical necessity definitions on page 85 of the Democratic \nplan, you will see that ``a group health plan and a health insurer, in \nconnection with a provision of health insurance coverage, may not \narbitrarily interfere with or alter the decision of the treating \nphysician regarding the manner or setting in which particular services \nare delivered if the services are medically necessary or appropriate \nfor treatment.''\n  Then it goes on to define medical necessity as a service or benefit \nwhich is consistent with generally accepted principles of professional \nmedical practice. It does not give the plan the opportunity in its fine \nprint to throw out medical necessity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the Senator 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized \nfor 2 minutes.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I say respectfully in response to my \ncolleague from Oklahoma that there are two things about which I \nfundamentally disagree with him. No. 1, under our proposal, the State--\ntotally independent--chooses the reviewing body. If my colleagues are \nreally looking for an independent review, I ask them whether they would \nagree to allow the State to choose the reviewing body instead of the \nhealth insurance company, instead of the HMO choosing the entity that \nchooses the reviewing body. I cannot imagine how they would disagree\n\n[[Page S8356]]\n\nwith that if they are looking for a truly independent review.\n  Secondly, the entire issue revolves around what is medical necessity. \nI say to my colleagues, would they agree to change the language of this \namendment so that the initial decision and every appeals decision of \nthe appeals deciding body is not bound by the definition of ``medical \nnecessity'' contained in the insurance written contract? Because so \nlong as the appeals process is controlled by what the HMO wrote, what \nthe health insurance company wrote at the beginning and all the way \nthrough the process, the patient does not have a chance. They will \nnever have a chance. My question is to my colleagues----\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I will give the Senator an opportunity to respond. My \nquestion is whether they will agree, No. 1, with the State choosing a \ntruly independent reviewing body, and, No. 2, whether they will agree \nthat the reviewing body is not bound by a definition written by the \nhealth insurance or HMO company.\n  I yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. We have no time.\n  Mr. FRIST. We have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 1 minute to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Does the Senator still have time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority side controls 5 minutes 20 \nseconds, the minority side, 5 minutes 4 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have a question for the Senator from \nNorth Carolina which is in reference to the Kennedy bill, section 133, \nsubsection (1)(ii), on page 67:\n\n       If an applicable authority permits--\n\n  That will be the State authority--\n\n       more than one entity to qualify as a qualified external \n     appeals entity with respect to a group health plan or health \n     insurer issuer, then the plan or issuer may select among such \n     qualified entities the applicable plan.\n\n  So basically if the State picks two or three different reviewers, \nunder your plan, then the plan gets to choose; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. FRIST. Whose time is this on?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the majority side.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield another 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. So there is an option under your proposal where plans \nwould have a choice because that is what the language says?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Am I allowed to respond?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the Senator 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. My response is very simple.\n  The language on the preceding page requires that the independent \nexternal review entity be designated by the State. That is, if I am \nreading the language correctly, contained on the preceding page. That \nis designated by the State. In fact, we say--this is at page 11, I say \nto the Senator--that ``No party to the dispute shall be permitted to \nselect the entity conducting the review.''\n  So there are two things operating, I think, in combination in our \nbill. No. 1, the State has to designate an independent body, and, No. \n2, we specifically require that no party to the dispute be involved in \ndesignating the reviewing entity.\n  I might add to that, I think it is also critically important who \ndetermines what is medically necessary and what the appeal decision \nbody is bound by in terms of what is medically necessary because I \nthink all of this becomes meaningless if they are bound by what the HMO \nor health insurance company wrote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield me another 30 seconds?\n  Mr. FRIST. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 20 seconds. The minority has 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. I, therefore, take it in the Kennedy plan, when it says, \n``the plan or issuer may select among such qualified entities,'' that \nthat language is not operative, that that does not exist, that that \nlanguage is a nonfactor.\n  Let's get serious. This is what your bill says. It says the plans can \nbe selected from the qualified entities. You can pick two or three \nplans, that the States have chosen to qualify two or three plans, and \nthe people pick the plans. So you are totally inconsistent with your \nargument.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. May I respond?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the Senator 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized \nfor 30 seconds.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. There is a very simple, straightforward answer to the \nquestion. I understand the Senator is reading the old bill. He is not \nreading the bill that is presently before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield 4\\1/2\\ minutes--how much time is \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority side controls 4 minutes on the \namendment.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the Senator \nfrom Wyoming.\n  Mr. GREGG. Would the Senator yield me 10 seconds? Because a \nmisstatement was made.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield another 30 seconds to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am reading from S. 6. That is the bill that was laid \ndown. That is the bill we are debating.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield 4\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are only 3 minutes 50 seconds remaining \non the majority side. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for that \ntime.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of improved, \nreliable quality care for all Americans. To that end, I am pleased to \njoin my colleagues in debating the dangerous concept of putting into \nlaw a definition of medical necessity.\n  The minority argues that putting a definition of medical necessity \ninto the law would assure health care providers absolute autonomy in \nmaking all treatment decisions for their patients. They say that is \nexactly what they want. It is their prescription for high quality \nhealth care.\n  Well then, when asked what patients and providers would use as a \nguide for the choice of treatment options and delivery of care, \nparticularly in such a dynamic and constantly innovating field such as \nhealth care, the minority relies squarely on ``generally accepted \nmedical practice.''\n  The Democrat plan is a trial lawyer's dream. ``Generally accepted \nmedical practice'' is lawsuit bait. But I can tell you that with the \nDemocrat plan ``medical necessity'' would be absolutely necessary \nbecause it is the only way to bridge the bureaucracy.\n  This is the bill we are looking at from the Democrats. Who can follow \nthe lines? Each one of those lines represent a lawsuit trap. This is \nlawsuit bait.\n  Unfortunately, for patients, ``generally accepted medical practice'' \nis the strict application of medical opinion versus the combination of \nyour doctor's good judgment or opinion and the prevailing evidence-\nbased practice of medicine. The minority approach turns its back on the \nscientific foundation of medicine. But what other solid ground is there \nupon which we could build greater quality into our health care system?\n  The minority, for the first time in Federal law, wants to carve this \nvariability into law, and that law will be followed by rule and \nregulation--more lawsuit bait. This is a Federal one-size-fits-all \nbudget-busting bureaucracy with lots of lawsuit bait and difficulty in \nfollowing the whole process.\n  Let me share with my colleagues the language from the minority bill. \nUnder the subtitle of ``Promoting Good Medical Practice,''--a good \ntitle--lies a provision which, in my estimation, would have the exact \nopposite effect. The bill reads:\n\n       A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer in \n     connection with the provision\n\n[[Page S8357]]\n\n     of health insurance coverage, may not arbitrarily interfere \n     with or alter the decision of the treating physician \n     regarding the manner or setting in which particular services \n     are delivered if the services are medically necessary or \n     appropriate for treatment or diagnosis to the extent that \n     such treatment or diagnosis is otherwise a covered benefit.\n\n  Now, let me loop through the rest of their proposal to demonstrate \nhow they essentially ``ban'' the use of trustworthy science and \nevidence-based medicine. At the end of the same subtitle, we are \noffered a definition of medical necessity or appropriateness. It reads, \n``medically necessary or appropriate means, with respect to a service \nor benefit, a service or benefit which is consistent with generally \naccepted principles of professional medical practice.''\n  To recap the minority policy proposal, they've suggested that doctors \nmake decisions about their patients based just on opinion, and that \nhealth plans would, by law, have to cover any and every treatment \nopinion prescribed by providers. The minority may argue that their \nproposal limits what plans must pay for to the terms of the contract. \nHowever, their plan requires plans to cover all treatments deemed \nmedically necessary, so this provision would, in fact, encompass the \nuniverse of health care, heedless of quality and contract alike.\n  It's my opinion, and a major thrust of the Republican bill, that we \nshould be doing everything we can to help health care providers in \ntheir efforts to provide the highest possible quality of care to \npatients. The minority tells doctors, who are now busier than ever and \ndoing their best to stay atop the innovations in medicine, that ``it's \nall on you.''\n  Mr. President, since there has been an effort to infuse real life \nexamples into this debate, it might be helpful for all of the health \ncare consumers at home if we talk about how medical science versus \n``generally accepted practices'' actually translates into real life. In \nthe following examples, you'll begin to understand that ``generally \naccepted practices'' vary from town to town, and the gap gets wider \nfrom state to state. This basically means that the quality of your \nhealth care may depend more on where you live than on what the \nprevailing best medical science is on your illness.\n\n  Here's an example where I can use my home state of Wyoming. The \naverage number of days spent in the hospital during the last 6 months \nof life for people living in Wyoming was between 4.4 days and 8 days. \nIn contrast, the average number of days spent in the hospital for the \nlast 6 months of life for people living in New York was between 12 and \n22 days. This means that there is nearly a 250 percent variation among \nStates for hospital length-of-stay at the end of life. Who's \nresponsible for this variation and what does it mean about the quality \nof care we're receiving?\n  More importantly, how does this jibe with legislating a definition of \nmedical necessity? Remember, the minority want us, for the first time, \nto carve this variability into law. The law will be followed by rule \nand regulation. Does this mean that for health plans that have \nbeneficiaries in Wyoming and in New York that what might be determined \na medically appropriate treatment for a New Yorker would be deemed \nmedically inappropriate for a patient in Wyoming?\n  This variation is comprehensive, going beyond hospital lengths-of-\nstay, from the use of drug therapies to surgical practices. One of the \nmost disheartening and horrifying statistic is regarding women with \nbreast cancer. Despite the solid evidence that women who undergo \nbreast-sparing surgery followed by chemotherapy or radiation and women \nwho undergo radical mastectomies have similar survival rates, it is \nregional preferences, that is, the general practices of a region, that \nstill prevail in determining a woman's course of treatment. In 1996, \nwomen with breast cancer in Rapid City, SD were 33 times less likely to \nhave breast-sparing surgery than women in Elyria, OH. How can anybody \nlook at these variations and view them as the only answer to good \nmedicine?\n  These inconsistencies in the medical care Americans receive are \nsomething we all need to address; that includes health plans and \ndoctors, and ourselves. Make no mistake about our potential as Congress \nto derail the efforts at quality improvement in American's health care \nif we're not very careful and very thoughtful about what it is we're \ndoing here today.\n  On a positive note, we are seeing signs of improvement when it comes \nto doctors and health plans working together to improve the consistency \nand overall quality of health care. For example, according to a 1997 \nQuality Compass report by the National Committee on Quality Assurance, \nover 50 percent of elderly heart attack patients in HMOs that submitted \ndata were treated with beta blockers, which can reduce mortality rates \nby 75 percent in those patients. In the same year, patients in regular \nfee-for-service plans received beta blocker only 21 percent of the \ntime. This is almost a three-fold difference when you compare a \ncoordinated approach to care with a ``generally accepted practices'' \napproach.\n\n  I am very concerned that we need to pass a proposal that responds to \nthese ``consistent inconsistencies'' in the quality and practice of \nmedicine in this country, while also guarding the doctor-patient \nrelationship. After all, outside of family, many of us view our \nrelationship with our doctor as our most trusted.\n  The solution lies in building on the doctor-patient relationship and \ninfusing our health care system with evidence-based medicine. Our bill \ndoes that. Our bill does not turn a blind eye to either the strengths \nor the weaknesses of today's health care system. Our bill takes a look \nat what we need to preserve and what we need to improve upon, and \noffers a responsible solution to enhancing quality and ensuring access.\n  Our bill will provide patients and their doctors with a new, iron \nclad support system that will insure access to medically necessary \ncare. An independent, external appeals process will be available for \npatients whose plan has initially denied a treatment request that the \npatient and doctor have decided is necessary. In other words, our bill \ngets patients the right treatment, right away. And it's based on the \nindependent decision of a medical professional who is expert in the \npatient's health care needs. In rendering a decision on the medical \nnecessity of the treatment request, the expert review will consider the \npatient's medical record, evidence offered by the patient's doctor and \nany other documents introduced during the internal review. This covers \nthe ``generally accepted practice'' standard that the minority offers \nas a singular solution.\n  Our bill goes further, capturing the other half of good quality \nhealth care, which is the evidence-based medicine rooted in science \nthat I spoke about earlier. We would require the expert reviewer to \nalso consider expert consensus and peer-reviewed literature and \nevidence-based medical practices. Let me say that again; evidence-based \nmedicine, not the varied, town-by-town, tried but not necessarily true, \ngeneral practice of medicine.\n  Because we feel so strongly about preserving the trusted relationship \nbetween doctors and patients by providing them with the best evidence-\nbased medicine in making treatment decisions, we've included another \nlynchpin in our bill. We establish the Agency for Healthcare Research \nand Quality, whose purpose it is to foster overall improvement in \nhealth care quality, firmly bridging the gap between what we know about \ngood medicine and what we actually do in health care today. The Agency \nis built on the platform of the current Agency for Health Care Policy \nand Research, but is refocused and enhanced to become the hub and \ndriving force of Federal efforts to improve the quality of health care \nin all practice environments.\n  The Agency will assist, not burden physicians, by aggressively \nsupporting state-of-the-art information systems for health care \nquality. This is in stark contrast to the minority proposal, which \nwould require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to Mandate a \nnew, onerous data collection bureaucracy. The Agency would support \nresearch in primary care delivery, priority populations and, critical \nto my state of Wyoming, access in underserved areas. Most important \nwith regard to this research, is that it would target quality \nimprovement in all types of health care, not just managed care. The \nAgency would also conduct\n\n[[Page S8358]]\n\nstatistically and scientifically accurate, sample-based surveys, using \nexisting structures, to provide high quality, reliable data on health \noutcomes. Last, the Agency would achieve its mission of promoting \nquality by sharing information with doctors, health plans and the \npublic, not tying it up in the knots of an expanded Federal \nbureaucracy. We need to assist the providers on the front lines. Their \njob is to make clinical decisions. We need to give them the tools to \nmake these medical decisions based on the proven medical advances made \nevery day through our investment in medical research. It would be a \nhuge mistake to put the Secretary and a Federal bureaucracy between \ndoctors and patients.\n  Clearly, medical necessity is a long and complicated issue. It is \nalso where the rubber meets the road on improving the quality of \nmedicine in the purest sense. This is where we all must pony up on the \ntrue intent of our proposals regarding medical necessity. This is where \nwe peel away the rhetoric and reveal the true implications of our \nvastly different standards regarding the quality of care we are willing \nto demand for Americans. I, for one, am demanding that my constituents \nget the best care possible, with a solid basis in proven, quality, \nevidence-based medicine and timely access to the advancements and \ninnovations in health care.\n  Mr. President, I understand and greatly respect the role of doctors \nand all health care providers in this country. It is for that very \nreason that I support the creation of a new, independent appeals \nmechanism to support their efforts in treating their patients. This, in \nconjunction with strengthening the health care system through strong \nFederal support for access to evidence-based medicine.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, much of this debate may seem technical, \nbut the definition of medical necessity and a fair and independent \nappeals process are at the heart of any serious effort to end insurance \ncompany abuse. Our plan has it; their program does not. That is why \nConsumers Union--the outfit that publishes Consumer Reports--calls the \nRepublican program ``woefully inadequate'' and ``far from \nindependent.''\n  No one supports their program but the insurance companies and the \nHMOs, the very organizations that profit from the abuses of the status \nquo. Their program is opposed by the American Cancer Society, and \nvirtually every cancer organization in the country. It is opposed by \nthe American Heart Association. It is opposed by the disability \ncommunity. It is opposed by the women's community, and the people who \nrepresent children. These are the patient groups that have the most to \nlose from low quality and the most to gain from high quality. And they \nlose under the Republican program.\n  This amendment will determine whether Senators stand with the \npatients or with the HMOs.\n  We yield back the remainder of our time and are prepared to vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I reserve my time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Just to clarify, I think my colleague from Massachusetts \nspoke incorrectly. The insurance industry does not support our \namendment. I think he said that they do. He happens to be factually \nwrong. I would like to have the Record be clear. We ought to be stating \nfacts and we ought to be stating the truth. What he said was not \ncorrect. They do not like our bill, either. They have not supported our \nbill.\n  My colleague from Massachusetts earlier said they wrote our bill. He \nis absolutely wrong. I just want to make sure people have the facts.\n  Mr. President, I will yield back the remainder of our time.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent that at the expiration of debate time \non the pending amendment, votes occur on the following pending \namendments: amendment No. 1238, medical necessity, that is the pending \namendment; the next amendment would be amendment No. 1236, which is the \ncost cap, limiting it to 1 percent; the next amendment would be \namendment No. 1235 which deals with emergency rooms, by Senator Graham; \nthe next amendment would be amendment No. 1234, deductibility for the \nself-employed; and the next amendment would be amendment No. 1233, \ndealing with the scope.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the first vote, there \nbe 4 minutes equally divided for closing remarks prior to the beginning \nof each vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, \njust in response to the Senator's earlier statement, I wonder why the \ninsurance companies are spending more than $2 million opposing our \nprogram.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. Unless I \nam entitled to speak, I will object, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if we could have an agreement that on the \nsuccessive votes the Senator from Oklahoma outlined there be a 10-\nminute break, or whatever he suggests, in there.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I think our friend from Rhode Island has made a good \nsuggestion. I suggested possibly doing that. I think we will possibly \ndo that after the first vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. For the information of all of our colleagues, we are now \ngetting ready to begin a series of votes, beginning with the first vote \ndealing with medical necessity. We expect there will be four votes \ntonight, so I encourage all our colleagues to come to the floor to \nvote.\n  I encourage all of our colleagues to stay on the floor because it is \nour intention to reduce the time allotted to each vote to 10 minutes \nafter the first vote.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. NICKLES. I did not make a UC.\n  Mr. REID. Are we going to allow a minute of explanation? Is that in \nthe unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Under the unanimous consent that has already been agreed \nto, we have 4 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. REID. I missed that. I apologize.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Massachusetts yield back \nthe remainder of his time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just 30 seconds of the time to point out, in response to \nthe comments of the Senator from Oklahoma, the insurance industry has \njust spent $2 million in opposition to our program, which basically \nincludes the provisions so eloquently commented on by the Senators from \nCalifornia and North Carolina. Zero has been spent by the insurance \ncompanies in opposition, to my best understanding, to the Republican \nproposal. If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck.\n  This is the insurance company's proposal, the HMO proposal. They are \nthe ones that will gain if this amendment of the Republicans is \naccepted. There is no question about that. It is the disabled, the \ncancer groups, and the children who will gain if our proposal prevails.\n  I yield back the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1238.\n  The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1238.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1236\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Texas 1 minute.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights drives \nup health care costs by 6.1 percent. It causes 1.8 million Americans to \nlose their health insurance. It raises the cost of health care for \nthose who don't lose their health insurance by $72.5 billion. By \ndriving up labor costs, it would destroy 194,041 jobs in the American \neconomy by the year 2003. These are not our numbers. These are numbers \nbased on estimates done by the CBO and private research firms that have \nused those numbers to project the economic impact.\n  Our amendment simply says if the Kennedy bill drives up health care \ncosts by more than 1 percent when it is fully implemented, or if it \npushes more than 100,000 Americans off the private insurance rolls by \ndriving up cost, then the law will not go into effect; it will be \nsuspended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Rhode Island is yielded 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, once again we hear the same old misestimate \nof the costs associated with the legislation. The true cost calculated \nby the Congressional Budget Office is 4.87 percent over 5 years. That \nis exactly what Senator Lott said on ``Meet The Press'' on July 11. In \nhis words, ``By the way, the Democratic bill would add 4.8 percent \ncost. That is less than 1 percent a year.''\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, may we have order. I can't hear the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Those of you who \nhave conversations, please take them to the Cloakroom. This is \nimportant debate.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  As I indicated, the true cost is 4.8 percent over 5 years. ``That is \nless than 1 percent a year.'' That is what Senator Lott said on ``Meet \nThe Press.'' Indeed, if you calculate that down to a monthly cost, it \nis about $2 extra a month to the average family paying health care \npremiums. It is not going to cause a huge eruption of costs.\n  It is also to me somewhat disconcerting to think that the insurance \nindustry is worried about people losing their health care coverage. \nThey raise costs every day. They will raise costs to protect their \nprofits.\n  What this legislation wants to do is guarantee that there is quality \nin the American health care system.\n  Make no mistake, this amendment is calculated and designed to \nundercut all the protections in the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is \ncalculated within 2 years to undercut and remove all of the protections \nthat are so necessary to the American family, which we are fighting \nfor.\n  This would be a recipe also to reward those companies that have \nexcessive costs, and it would be virtually impossible to figure out \nwhat costs are associated with their need for profits versus what costs \nare associated with the increase in quality in the system. They would \nbe doing the audits. They would essentially be exempting themselves. We \nare giving them a key to let them out of the responsibilities to their \npatients and to their consumers. We can't do that.\n  This is just another red herring, another ruse, and another device to \nprevent the American people from achieving what they definitely want--\nrights in the health care system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, just to correct my colleague from Rhode \nIsland, he said the cost of the Kennedy bill is about $2 a month. That \nis not correct. That is not in CBO's report. CBO says most of the \nprovisions would take full effect within the first 3 years, not 5 \nyears; not 1 percent, but a total of 6.1 percent. That is S. 6. That is \nwhat we are debating. That is what we are amending.\n  We are saying that costs shouldn't increase by more than 1 percent.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says the total costs would be $8 \nbillion in lost Social Security taxes and total lost wages would be $64 \nbillion. That is not a McDonald's hamburger. That is $64 billion in \nlost wages, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That is not a \nRepublican insurance study. That was the Congressional Budget Office \nthat said people would lose $64 billion in lost wages.\n  They also said as a result of the Kennedy amendment that people would \ndrop insurance entirely; would reduce the generosity of health benefit \npackages; they would increase cost sharing by beneficiaries.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1235\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the Graham of Florida \namendment. There are 4 minutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, most of us here have already voted in \nfavor of the amendment which is before us. In 1997 we adopted virtually \nthis identical language as it relates to the 70 million Americans who \nare covered either by Medicare or Medicaid. So the question before us \nis, Should we adopt a different standard of emergency room care for the \nrest, for the other 190 million Americans?\n  There are two principal differences between the current law for \nMedicare and Medicaid and what the Republican alternative would \npropose. First, as to access to the nearest available emergency room, \nthe current Medicare/Medicaid law says you have the right to go to the \nnearest emergency room without any additional charge. That is the same \nprovision that is in this amendment. The Republican provision says that \na differential charge can be made so you would have to pay more if it \nhappened that the closest emergency room was not an emergency room \naffiliated with your health maintenance organization.\n  The second difference is poststabilization care. What is \npoststabilization care? I quote the language from the Medicare \nregulations:\n\n       Poststabilization care means medically necessary \n     nonemergency services needed to assure that the enrollee \n     remains stabilized from the time that the treating hospital \n     requests authorization from the health maintenance \n     organization.\n\n  Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries get the benefit of \npoststabilization care. Our amendment would make that benefit available \nto all 190 million non-Medicare/Medicaid Americans. The Republican bill \nwould not. It would not say that you are entitled to medically \nnecessary services to continue you in a stabilized condition after you \nhad contacted your HMO and received authorization to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, there is no reason why all Americans \nshould not have the same benefits that we voted less than 3 years ago \nto make available to the 70 million Medicare and Medicaid \nbeneficiaries.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, in the area of \nemergency group services, both bills eliminate prior authorization, and \nthey should. You should not have to call your insurance company before \nyou go to the emergency room. Both bills establish a process for timely \ncoordination of care, including services to maintain stability of the \npatient.\n  I will be offering an amendment that will make it perfectly clear in \nthe Republican bill that there can be no greater costs charged for \nthose going to an out-of-network emergency room as those going to an \nin-network emergency room. There should not be a differential. I will \nmake very certain in my amendment that there is no such differential.\n  The Graham amendment is flawed, and it is seriously flawed because it \nuses language that is confusing for patients, confusing for plans and \nproviders, it is vague and ambiguous, and it does not ensure that \npoststabilization services are related to the emergency condition. That \nis a gaping loophole. It is a blank check to say you have to provide \nservices for a condition that is absolutely unrelated to the reason you \nwent to the emergency room.\n  My amendment I will be offering will fix that vague and ambiguous \nlanguage to be sure that what is provided in the emergency room for \npoststabilization services are related to the condition for which the \npatient went to the emergency room.\n  This is a very dangerous amendment in that it is vague and ambiguous \nand leaves a blank check, a gaping loophole that needs to be fixed. I \nask my colleagues to reject the Graham amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on amendment No. 1234 by \nSenator Nickles for Senator Santorum. There are 4 minutes equally \ndivided. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the principal sponsor of the \namendment, Senator Santorum, 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in strong support and encourage \nall my colleagues to support this amendment. The amendment does \nbasically two things. No. 1, it establishes 100-percent deductibility \nfor the self-employed, something for which I know many Members of both \nsides of the aisle have been striving. One of the things we have said \nabout our health care proposal is that ours is much more comprehensive \nthan the Democratic plan. It looks at the issue of access.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Could we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order. Again, \nthis is an important debate.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. As I said, our bill is much more comprehensive. We \nlooked at the question of access and making health insurance more \naffordable to cover more people, to bring them into the insurance \nmarket. Our bill, with this amendment, does that.\n  The other thing we do is we emphasize that we do not want the Federal \nGovernment, the Health Care Financing Administration, to oversee State-\nregulated plans. Almost all 50 States have passed a Patients' Bill of \nRights. They traditionally regulate health insurance. They are doing a \nvery good job. We do not need to impose HCFA regulations and HCFA \ncontrol over every State insurance department. It is the wrong \napproach. It is Washington getting its teeth into the State pie. That \nis unnecessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S8361]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this vote is directly related to whether \nthe Senate is really interested in covering all Americans who have \ninsurance or whether whatever passes applies to only the 48 million \npersons who are included in the Republican bill.\n  In the House of Representatives, all of the leading Republican \nlegislation applies to all patients with insurance through their \nprivate employers--the whole 123 million here. The proposals put \nforward by the House Republicans who happen to be doctors also cover \nthe people in the individual market. But not the Senate Republican \nbill.\n  It is an extraordinary irony, but HMOs are found in all of these \nother categories--under the 75 million, the 15 million, the 25 \nmillion--not in self-funded employer plans. So the Republican bill does \nnot even cover the individuals who first raised the whole question of \nwhether their current coverage is adequate. Whatever we are going to \ndo, Republican program or Democrat, let's make sure we provide \nprotections to all patients. Every category here on this chart. That is \nwhat our amendment does.\n  But their amendment would leave out more than 100 million Americans \nlike Frank Raffa, a fire fighter for the city of Worcester, \nMassachusetts. He puts his life on the line every day, but he and \nmillions of others are left out and left behind with the Republican \nprogram. Let's make sure we are going to cover all of them, all the \nworkers in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nMissouri, Senator Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Before the Senator from Missouri starts, the \nSenate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the opponents of this amendment overlook the \nfact that the States are involved. The States do regulate health \ninsurance. The States are taking care of those they can cover.\n  This amendment says we should not wipe out State regulation. It also \ncompletes the job of ending the tremendous inequity in our health care \nsystem which said formerly that self-employed people could only deduct \n25 percent of their health insurance premiums. Thanks to the bipartisan \nsupport we have had, we say now, by 2003, that there will be 100-\npercent deductibility. Right now, however, there are 5.1 million \nuninsured, 1.3 million children. For the woman who is starting a new \nbusiness, the fastest growing sector of our economy, she starts up an \ninformation technology business and she is not able to deduct 100 \npercent of health care insurance for herself and her family until 2003. \nShe cannot afford to wait to get sick until 2003.\n  I urge my colleagues to support immediate deductibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The distinguished minority leader \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania had it right. We all support 100-percent deductibility for \nthe self-employed. We just voted for it an hour or so ago. There is no \nquestion all of the Senate supports it. We are on record in support of \nit. The question is whether we should accelerate it. We just voted to \naccelerate it on this side on the Robb amendment. That isn't the \nquestion on this amendment. This amendment is about whether or not we \noffer 100 million additional Americans the patient protections under \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  In order to clarify that, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndeductibility language be added to both the Republican bill, S. 1344, \nand the Daschle substitute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that at least the deductibility \namendment be allowed as part of the Kennedy amendment as well.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That makes it very clear. This vote is about denying \nmillions of Americans the right to patient protections, not about \nhealth and deductibility for self-employed businessmen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question now is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 1233, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 1233), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1239 To Amendment No. 1232\n\n(Purpose: To provide coverage for individuals participating in approved \n      clinical trials and for approved drugs and medical devices)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] for himself, Mrs. \n     Boxer, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Reid, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n     Durbin, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, and \n     Mr. Daschle, proposes an amendment numbered 1239 to amendment \n     No. 1232.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenators Harkin, Boxer, Feingold, Feinstein, Johnson, Rockefeller, \nKennedy, Murray, and Reid of Nevada.\n  As I understand it, we will debate it briefly this evening, and then \nit will be one of the first orders of business tomorrow morning.\n  This amendment has two parts to it. It would ensure that patients \nhave access to the best possible care in two areas--cutting edge \nclinical trials and medically necessary prescription drugs.\n  Until recently, health plans routinely paid for the doctor and \nhospital costs associated with clinical trials, and many still do. But \na growing number of insurance plans are now refusing to pay, disrupting \nan arrangement that\n\n[[Page S8362]]\n\nimmediately benefited individual patients and advanced our ability to \ntreat future patients.\n  As my colleague from Vermont will recall from our debate in the \nHealth and Education Committee, which he chairs, this amendment is a \nmoderate one. It would require insurance plans to cover the costs of a \npatient's participation in clinical trials in only those circumstances \nthat meet the following criteria: One, the clinical trial must be \nsponsored or funded by the National Institutes of Health, the \nDepartment of Defense, or the Veterans' Administration; two, the \npatient must fit the trial protocol; three, there is no other effective \nstandard treatment available for the patient; four, the patient has a \nserious or life-threatening illness.\n  It seems to me that if a patient's situation meets those criteria, \ninsurance plans ought not to deny access to clinical trials. This ought \nnot to be a controversial proposal.\n  Let me lastly add that the plan's obligation is to pay only for the \nroutine patient costs, not for the costs of running the trial that \nought to be paid for by the sponsor of the trial--such as the \nexperimental drug or medical device.\n  The cost of providing coverage for clinical trials is negligible. \nAfter all, similar routine patient costs for blood tests, physicians' \nvisits, and hospital stays are covered for standard treatment anyway.\n  The Congressional Budget Office found that this patient protection \nwould increase premiums a mere four-tenths of a percent over the next \n10 years. That is less than 12 cents per person per month.\n  Many researchers believe even this minuscule amount is a dramatic \noverstatement of the cost. In fact, when the Memorial Sloan-Kettering \nCancer Center, and the MD Anderson Cancer Center compared the cost of \nclinical trials to standard cancer therapies, both of these world-\nrenowned cancer centers found that the average cost per patient \nactually was lower for those patients enrolled in clinical trials. So \nit actually can save money to give patients access to clinical trials, \nif you believe Sloan-Kettering and the Anderson Cancer Center.\n  The American Association of Health Plans--the trade association for \nthe managed care plans--has urged its members to allow patients to \nparticipate in clinical trials and to pay the associated doctor and \nhospital costs. Let me quote from a news release of the American \nAssociation of Health Plans. They said:\n\n       AAHP supports patients having access to NIH-approved \n     clinical studies, and supports individual health plan \n     linkages with NIH-sponsored clinical trials. AAHP also \n     believes that it is appropriate for health plans choosing to \n     participate in NIH research studies to pay the routine \n     patient-care costs associated with these trials.\n\n  This is the very trade association of the insurance plans urging its \nmembers to allow access to clinical trials and suggesting they ought to \npick up the cost\n  The release goes on to cite the benefits of participating in clinical \ntrials for patients and for the advancement of medicine.\n  We are asking that health plans do nothing more than what they \nalready said they want and they intend to do.\n  The Republican proposal? What do they say about the clinical trials? \nThey say the managed care bill should study this issue further. With \nall due respect, further studies will only cause unnecessary delays. We \nalready have answers to many of the questions they want to study. We \nknow what hinders a patient's participation in clinical trials. It is \nthe plans' refusal to pay for them. We know what the costs are. They \nare minuscule. And plans presumably have figured out how to \ndifferentiate between costs of running the trials and costs of patient \ncare since many of them already are doing it.\n  All we would get from another year of delay is more patients with \nlife-threatening conditions being denied access to research that can \nsave their lives.\n  I know this does not have to be a partisan issue. Republicans have \nnot only supported related legislation but some--including Senator \nMack, and my colleague, Senator Snowe who is on the floor, and Senator \nFrist--have been leaders on this issue. Our good friend and colleague \nfrom Maine, Senator Snowe, has authored excellent legislation widely \nsupported, I might add, by patient groups which would broadly provide \naccess to almost all clinical trials for all privately ensured \npatients. I commend her for that bill. Thirteen of our Republican \ncolleagues have cosponsored the Mack-Rockefeller bill that would \nrequire Medicare to cover the cost of cancer clinical trials. The \nRepresentative from my State, Republican Congresswoman Nancy Johnson, \nhas introduced a companion bill with several Republican cosponsors.\n  What I am offering has broad bipartisan support in a variety of \nlegislative proposals. All we are saying is this Patients' Bill of \nRights ought to include it.\n  Clearly, there is bipartisan interest in making sure patients all \nover this country with breast cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, \ncongestive heart failure, lupus, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, \nAIDS, along with a host of other deadly illnesses, have access to \ncutting-edge treatments. To allow a plan to deny a patient access to \nclinical trials is an outrage.\n\n  I hope this body will find it in its good judgment to adopt this \namendment tomorrow when it comes up for a vote and to allow people to \nhave access to these critical clinical trials.\n  The second part of this amendment deals with prescription drugs.\n  Nearly all HMOs and other insurance plans use a preferred list called \na formulary to extract discounts from drug companies and to save on \ndrug costs. Many of the best plans already take steps to ensure these \nformularies aren't unreasonably rigid by putting processes in place \nthat allows patients access to nonformulary medicines when their own \ndoctors say those drugs are absolutely needed. In fact, the HMO trade \nassociation supports this practice as part of its Code of Conduct for \nmember plans.\n  Why would a patient need a drug that is not in the plan's formulary? \nPatients have allergies in some cases to drugs on the formulary. They \nmay be taking medications that would have bad interactions with the \nplan's preferred drugs, or simply have a medical need for access to \nsome product that is not listed in the formulary--rather commonsensical \nreasons.\n  Without access to a reasonable process for making exceptions to the \nformulary, patients may be forced to try two or three different types \nof older, less effective medications and demonstrate that those drugs \ndon't work or have negative side effects before the plan would allow \naccess to offer formulary prescription drugs.\n  No patient, in my view, should be exposed to dangerous side effects, \nor ineffective treatment, just because the cheaper drug in their plan \nthat was chosen does not work as well as the one their doctor would \nrecommend.\n  I was pleased that during our committee markup our chairman, who is \non the floor, and our Republican colleagues agreed to support a portion \nof the protection in the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights plan that \nrelates to access to prescription drugs. I will point out that, as with \nthe majority of provisions in the Republican bill, even its limited \nprotection would be denied to more than 100 million Americans whose \nemployers don't self-insure their own health care coverage.\n  In addition, their provision contains a significant loophole that \nneeds to be corrected. The Republican proposal requires plans to \nprovide access to drugs off the formulary. However, it also says that \nthe insurers can charge patients whatever they want to get those off-\nformulary products, even if they are medically necessary, and even if \nthe drug is the only drug that can save that patient's life.\n  This subverts the purported intent of the very provision the \nRepublican bill proposes; and that is to ensure that patients have \naccess to medically necessary care. If a determination has been made by \na doctor and the plan that a patient needs that specific drug and no \nother, why should that patient be subjected to higher costs--\nconceivably even a 99-percent copay?\n  The issue is not about patients simply preferring one brand over \nanother. Our concern is for patients for whom a certain product is \nmedically necessary. It is inconceivable they should be charged more \nfor the care they need just because it doesn't make the plans \nformulary. This amendment would remedy that situation.\n\n[[Page S8363]]\n\n  Lastly, our amendment would also address another roadblock that \npatients encounter trying to get life-saving prescription drugs. That \nis the practice of a plan issuing blanket denials on the ground that a \ndrug is experimental even when it is an FDA-approved product.\n  If there is any question in your mind why the plans would resort to \nsuch a practice, I think it's useful to listen to their own \nexplanation. In a letter to the majority leader in July of last year, \nthe American Association of Health Plans, Blue Cross and Blue Shield, \nand the Health Insurance Association of America wrote:\n\n       If health plans are not allowed to deny coverage on the \n     basis that the device is investigational, the health plans \n     would have to perform a much more costly case-by-case review \n     on the basis of ``medical necessity''.\n\n  They state the case for me.\n  In other words, according to the health plans themselves, their fear \nis that if they are prevented from issuing blanket, unfounded denials \nthey might actually have to look at an individual patient's medical \nneeds.\n  These two provisions of this amendment are critically important. \nPatients need access to clinical trials and they need access to \nprescription drugs. It doesn't get more basic than that.\n  Denying access to clinical trials doesn't just deny good care to the \npatient today who is desperately in need of a cure, but it denies state \nof the art health care to future patients as well, by impeding the \ndevelopment of knowledge about new therapies.\n  Senator Mack, Senator Snowe, and many others have strongly supported \nlegislation in this area. Some of their bills go further than my \namendment does.\n  I hope tomorrow when the vote occurs we will have the support of a \nbroad bipartisan coalition.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Connecticut, isn't it true we spend \nbillions of dollars at the National Institutes of Health, the Veterans' \nAdministration, and the Department of Defense on medical research that \ncan only be made effective if they have clinical trials?\n  Mr. DODD. That is correct. The process of finding cures starts with \nan unknown product first being tested in the laboratory. The second \nplace it is tested is with animals. Third is the clinical trial before \nit is on the market for general use.\n  If insurers impede enrollment in clinical trials that phase of \nresearch development will be adversely affected and valuable, life-\nsaving products will be delayed from getting on the market for general \nuse by the public.\n  It is an excellent question.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, all the money, the billions and \nbillions of dollars, spent by the entities I previously talked about, \nthe money we spend is basically worthless unless we can have clinical \ntrials.\n  Mr. DODD. To answer my colleague from Nevada, the Senator is \nabsolutely correct. This is a tremendous waste of taxpayer money. There \nare those, I suppose, who are only concerned about that issue. I \nappreciate the Senator raising the point because it is indeed a waste \nof money.\n  It is also a waste of human lives. I think that people watching this \ndebate here on the floor of the Senate will ask the question: What did \nthe Senate do when it had a chance to protect my family, my child, my \nwife or my husband, to give them access to the cutting edge \ntechnologies when my insurer says no. I think they will be outraged if \nwe don't provide them this protection.\n  In addition to the monetary cost issue, which our distinguished \nfriend from Nevada has raised, to cause a human life to be lost because \nwe denied access to clinical trials, I argue, is an even greater loss.\n  Mr. REID. There have been some who say it is too expensive. The \nSenator is aware of plans that have cut off clinical trials because it \nis ``too expensive.''\n  What I hear my friend saying is, the real expense is in the pain and \nsuffering of the families who suffer from Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, \nlupus, and all the other diseases that the Senator has outlined so \nclearly.\n\n  Is it not true that is where the real suffering comes and that is \nwhere the expense comes--in the pain and suffering to those people--if \nwe don't allow the clinical trials?\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate the question of my colleague.\n  He is absolutely correct. I will make a dollars-and-cents case. The \ncost is 12 cents per patient per month, a negligible cost.\n  As I mentioned in earlier remarks, when Sloan-Kettering Cancer \nInstitute and the MD Anderson Cancer Center examined the issue of \ncost--two world-class cancer research centers--their conclusion was \nthat clinical trials are actually less costly than the standard care \nthat will be used in the absence of clinical trials. ``Less costly'' is \ntheir conclusion.\n  If your argument is we cannot do this because it costs too much, one \nestimate suggests 12 cents per patient per month, and two of the world-\nclass cancer centers in the world think it is actually a lower cost \nusing the clinical trials.\n  Mr. REID. The final question I ask my friend from Connecticut: Isn't \nit true that huge amounts of money will be saved if these clinical \ntrials are proved effective? The Senator knows that half the people in \nour rest and extended care facilities are there because of Parkinson's \nand Alzheimer's.\n  Assume, for example, that these clinical trials would delay the onset \nof one of these two diseases or if some miracle would occur we could \ncure those diseases. Would that save this country money?\n  Mr. DODD. The cost in savings would be astronomical.\n  When we delay a product going from the research phase to general use \nbecause patients are shut out of clinical trials, not only do patients \ntoday suffer, but future patients suffer, and the costs to the health \ncare system as a whole go up.\n  AIDS is a wonderful example of this--the AIDS clinical trials have \nsaved literally thousands of lives. People are working today who would \nnot have been able to do so had it not been for clinical trials that \nhelped to develop powerful new drugs. Imagine if the treatments that \nexist today existed a few years ago, what a different world it would be \nand how many lives would not have been lost--productive citizens today \nwho would make a contribution to our society.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend my good friend on the \ncommittee for the work he has done in this area. This is an area where \nwe have joined together. It will ensure that we have a change, a \npositive change in the clinical trial aspect. I want to work together \nwith the Senator in that regard.\n  I also want to say this bill is not finished yet. We have places to \ngo and time to spend to bring it to a better form than it is now. I \nlook forward to continuing to work to improve the bill.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 29 minutes 33 \nseconds, and the Senator from Vermont has 49 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think we are ready to do wrap-up.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is my intention.\n  Mr. REID. The time has stopped running on the bill for both the \nmajority and minority.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this evening I cast several difficult \nvotes regarding core principles facing this body as we work to ensure \nthe health care rights of Americans are protected.\n  I voted for an amendment creating an external appeals process for \npatients who are denied medical care by their health plan. While I \nstrongly support this initiative, I am concerned that this specific \nproposal needs further strengthening ensuring that the individual \nhealth care rights of Americans are the priority. I will be working \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to strengthen the \nexternal appeals process, including access to reasonable legal remedies \nwhile ensuring that the external review process is conducted by \nunbiased and independent entities whose sole purpose is to protect the \nrights of American patients.\n  In addition, I support guaranteeing an individual medical care in an \nemergency room without prior approval from their HMO if the person \nbelieves that it is an emergency situation. However, I was forced to \nvote against an\n\n[[Page S8364]]\n\namendment which provided this protection but then superseded state \nrights and created an opportunity for emergency rooms to begin \nproviding a litany of treatments outside of the realm of the perceived \nemergency which could have negative financial repercussions.\n  Finally, I support providing American women with direct access to OB/\nGYNs and ensuring they receive quality health care while battling \nbreast cancer. However, I was forced to vote against an amendment \nproviding this critical access because it eliminated an important \nprovision ensuring that health care costs do not skyrocket thereby \ncausing thousands, if not millions of new Americans to lose their \nhealth care coverage.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I take this opportunity to comment \non the pending bill.\n  In my view, what we are discussing today is the most costly big-\ngovernment health care plan since the Clinton health care reform plan \nwas debated earlier this decade. We all know the fate of that attempt, \nand it is my hope we might now allow common sense to play a part in \ncreating a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  The demands on our health care system have changed dramatically in \nthe past decade. So has our health care system. But, those changes have \nnot affected all people evenly, and it's clear many people have had \nunfortunate experiences.\n  Going from the traditional doctor-patient relationship into a system \nwhere all aspects of care are subject to approval and authorization is \nunderstandably difficult. But, as the cost of quality care became an \nobstacle to access, the concept of managing care has evolved as the \npredominate method of insured medical service.\n  While health care in America, and our advances in medical technology \nremain the envy of the world, it would be a serious mistake to pretend \nthat all are well-served by our present health care system.\n  The Federal Government, in an effort to give all Americans access to \naffordable care, has, in fact, encouraged participation in managed care \nplans. All federally-sponsored health care, which includes Medicare, \nMedicaid, the Federal Employees Health Benefit program and military \nhealth care, has experienced the emergence of managed care. Now we must \ndeal with the issue of ensuring health care quality as a first \npriority. And we must do it in a way that will not raise costs of care \nor cause employers to stop offering health insurance.\n  While managed care has become the dominant delivery method of cost-\neffective healthcare in our nation, what is missing are standards that \nwill ensure fairness to both patients and providers, and clarify what \nare often confusing medical and legal terms and hidden rules for both \nparties. The question before us now is how best to protect these \npatients while giving the health care industry incentives for finding \nefficient methods of delivering care.\n  All of us expect the highest quality health care for the citizens of \nthis country, but, that care must be affordable. Anyone that believes \nhaving Congress dictate a costly, one-size-fits-all mandate will make \nhealth care more affordable or more available is, I believe, severely \nout of touch with reality.\n  That is why I am concerned about the pending legislation. This bill \nmandates new regulations which would increase premiums by 6.1 percent, \nnot including inflation. It could raise the cost of a typical family's \nhealth insurance policy by more than $300 per year. That is not \nlogical, responsible or acceptable. We have been down this road before \nwith the ``catastrophic health'' bill of 10 years ago. The Senate \npassed it because people were told premium increases would be minimal. \nThen people got their bill. This pending bill will drive up the number \nof uninsured Americans. In my State of Colorado, it is estimated that \nthis legislation would add more than 32,000 persons to the rolls of the \nuninsured. Our biggest health care problem already is that there are \ncurrently 43.5 million uninsured Americans. Who pays for their \ninevitable medical care? You, I, and every other taxpayer. It is clear \nthat increased mandates increase costs, and that those increased costs \nreduce coverage.\n  It is no secret that higher health insurance premiums will force \nemployers to drop optional medical coverage they offer employees. That \nshould not be the intention of this legislation, but it is the reality. \nEvery time a mandate raises the cost of insurance by one percent, more \nthan 200,000 Americans lose their coverage.\n  Small businesses would drop coverage if exposed to the pending bill's \nliability provisions. Canceling coverage leaves patients exposed to \nexpensive medical bills. That's not patient protection. We cannot pass \nlegislation that forces employers to provide health care. They will \nclose shop, because they can't afford it. The pending bill will lead to \ngovernment-run health care. The bill's mandates could cost the private \nsector more than $56 billion, greatly exceeding the annual threshold \nestablished in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, which most Members of \nthis body voted for.\n  Many States are currently developing patient-protection legislation \nthrough their State legislatures and assemblies. My State of Colorado \nhas already established mandates concerning an independent external \nreview process for denied claims, a ban on gag clauses, and direct \naccess to OB-GYN services.\n  Despite that fact, the pending bill, in an attempt to tighten federal \ncontrol over the entire U.S. health system, applies federal mandates to \nall health insurance products.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is time to put the brakes on the runaway \none-size-fits-all mandates which are inflicting hardship on our most \nvulnerable citizens and legitimate health care providers. The time to \nprotect patients and providers is before costly mandates are enacted \ninto law.\n  Let us think ahead. We have already seen through our experience with \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997, that well-intentioned solutions \nenacted by Congress can turn into unworkable, burdensome regulations \nwhen imposed on the entire health care system. We are discussing \nsweeping legislation which, if passed and enacted, will have \nsignificant consequences for all Americans and their health care. I \nbelieve we can best protect these Americans by making reasonable \nchanges which give them more choices. Let's provide access to \naffordable, quality care without inventing unnecessary new federal \nmandates for an already top-heavy health care structure.\n  I believe the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights Plus will do just \nthat. It will improve quality of care and expand consumer choice as \nwell as protect patients' rights.\n  It will hold HMOs accountable for providing the care they promised. \nIt places treatment decisions in the hands of doctors, not lawyers. \nAnd, patients have the right to coverage for emergency care that a \nprudent lay-person would consider medically necessary.\n  The purpose of our bill is to solve problems when care is needed, not \nlater after harm has occurred. Common sense demands we act reasonably. \nMore importantly, the future health care of hundreds of millions of \nAmericans demands we act with their interests in mind.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, in the 1970s, the State of Colorado \nadopted a well-child care law, legislation concerning the treatment of \nalcoholism and mental health, as well as legislation concerning \ninsurance coverage of psychologists. In the 1980s home health care, \nhospice care, and mammography screening legislation was passed into \nlaw. In the 1990s, those who represent the people of Colorado in the \nState House saw fit to pass laws concerning the coverage of nurses, \nnurse midwives, nurse anesthetists, nurse practitioners, psychiatric \nnurses, the continuation of coverage for dependents and employees, and \nconversion to non-group health care.\n  This decade the Colorado Legislature also passed consumer grievance \nprocedures, children's dental anesthesia and general dental provisions, \ndirect access to OB-GYN, direct access to midwives for OB-GYN, \nemergency room services legislation, a ban on gag clauses, prostate \ncancer screening, breast reconstruction, maternity stay, and mental \nhealth parity legislation. Last, but certainly not least, among State \nlaws enacted in my home State is a law concerning independent external \nappeals\n\n[[Page S8365]]\n\nfor patients and a comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights, passed in \n1997.\n  I am proud to have served in the Colorado State Senate, and I am \nproud to say that today I represent a state that has been responsive \nand aggressive in addressing health care issues and patients' rights.\n  At the same time, Mr. President, I am deeply troubled that there are \nthose in this body who are advocates of Senator Kennedy's Patients' \nBill of Rights that would preempt a number of the laws that I just \nmentioned in the State of Colorado. In this country of 260 million \nAmericans throughout the fifty states I believe that the people of \nthose States are in the best position to make these specific decisions. \nI come from our nation's 8th largest State with a population of just \n3.9 million people. I will not assume that any federal entity is more \nprepared to develop policy for Colorado than the people of Colorado, \nnor would I impose the policies unique to Colorado's needs on another \nState.\n  Something I find equally troubling is that in addition to infringing \non the laws of the State of Colorado, the legislation that Senator \nKennedy and the Democrats have developed has the potential to increase \nhealth care costs, deprive 1.9 million Americans of health insurance \nwho are currently covered, and cast heavy mandates down on individual \nstates who are in a far better position to make these decisions for \nthemselves.\n  I will speak today about a number of things I believe will enhance \nthe quality of health care, increase access to care, and provide \nimportant protections for patients without unnecessarily placing \nmandates on individual states. These provisions are all part of a \ncomprehensive package called the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, \nwhich I feel properly addresses the needs of America's patients, \nphysicians and health care providers.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act establishes consumer protection \nstandards for self-funded plans currently governed by the Employee \nRetirement and Income Security Act (ERISA). 48 million Americans are \ncurrently covered by plans governed by ERISA--these are American health \ncare consumers who are not under the jurisdiction of state laws.\n  Our bill would eliminate gag rule clauses in providers' contracts and \nensure that patients have access to specialty care. The legislation \nalso requires that health plans that use formularies to provide \nprescription medications ensure the participation of doctors and \npharmacists in the construction of the formulary. Further addressing \npatient choice and access, health plans would be required to allow \nwomen direct access to obstetricians and gynecologists, and direct \naccess to pediatricians for children, without referrals from general \npractitioners.\n  These provisions are important steps in removing barriers that may \nprevent patients covered under ERISA from receiving necessary and \nproper treatment in a timely manner.\n  As a former small business owner I have a keen understanding of the \nissues that confront the self-employed. I also have experience in \nbalancing the wages and benefits you extend to an employee with a \nhealthy bottom line. I think it is important that we remember \nthroughout the course of this debate that employers provide health care \nbenefits as a voluntary form of compensation for their employees. We \nmust be wary of legislation that will increase costs and liability for \nemployers in a way that may reduce the quality and scope of benefit \npackages for employees.\n  Our bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, would make health \ninsurance deductible for the self-employed and increase the \navailability of medical savings accounts. I believe that each of these \nprovisions would give greater power to the individual and make private \ninsurance more affordable for families and individuals. Large \ncorporations can claim a 100 percent deduction for health care and \nsmall business should be treated the same.\n  Medical savings accounts, otherwise known as MSAs, combine a high \ndeductible and low cost catastrophic policy with tax free savings that \ncan be used for routine medical expenses. We should increase the \navailability to all families who desire MSAs. These efforts will prove \nparticularly helpful to those individuals working for small business, \nand those in transition from one job to another since MSAs are fully \nportable.\n  I want to stress that our legislation will not mandate these accounts \nfor everyone, but will simply establish the accounts as an option to \nthose who feel they will be best served by MSAs. I believe that medical \nsavings accounts are particularly important for uninsured, lower income \nAmericans. Allowing consumers to pay for medical expenses through these \naffordable tax-deductible plans, tailored to their needs, is a viable \nfree-market approach to decreasing the number of uninsured in America. \nThis is a question of providing greater choice for health care \nconsumers.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act would also permit the carryover \nof unused benefits from flexible spending accounts, again increasing \nthe number of options available to the consumers of health care.\n  In keeping with presenting more options to the consumer, The \nPatients' Bill of Rights Plus Act includes language that would require \nall group health plans to provide a wide range of comparative \ninformation about the health coverage they provide. This information \nwould include descriptions of health insurance coverage and the \nnetworks who provide care so that consumers covered by self insured and \nfully insured group health plans can make the best decisions based on \ntheir needs and preferences.\n  One of the most contentious issues in health care has been the issue \nof malpractice liability, grievance procedures and the mechanism for \nthe appeal of decisions made by managed care companies. My colleagues \nacross the aisle are interested in taking the grievance procedure into \na court of law, allowing a patient greater access to litigation as a \nmeans of challenging a managed care organization's decision.\n  Lawsuits and the increased threat of litigation will demand that more \nmoney to be funneled into non-medical administration and away from what \npatients really want--quality health care. Furthermore, making the \ncourts a de facto arbiter of health care decisions seems to me to be \nless efficient and less effective in dealing with the interests of the \npatient. The Kennedy bill is an enormous gift for the trial lawyers in \nAmerica who stand to profit by high cost, long-term cases. Patients, \nnot lawyers, will fare far better under the Patients' Bill of Rights \nPlus.\n  I am also concerned that expanding medical malpractice liability will \nlead to more defensive medical decisions regardless of the merit of a \nparticular treatment. High liability exposure and cost has driven \ncountless physicians from their profession for years, particularly in \nhigh-need rural areas.\n  This is not a provision we can afford in rural areas of western \nStates like Colorado that are already under-served.\n  Rather than take health care out of the doctor's office and into the \ncourts, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act establishes strict time \nframes for internal and external appeals for the 124 million Americans \nwho receive care from self insured and fully insured group plans. \nRoutine requests would need to be completed within 30 days, or 72 hours \nin specific cases when a delay would be detrimental to the patient. \nRather than use the courts in cases of health care appeals our \nlegislation would establish a system of independent, internal and \nexternal review by physicians with appropriate expertise. We are \ntalking about doctors with years of experience and medical training \nmaking health care decisions, not legal arguments.\n  I believe that such a system will be more responsive and more \ntailored to the needs of every individual patient--and it will do so \nwithout creating unnecessary bureaucracy. It is also important to note \nthat these internal and external appeals will cost patients and \nemployers considerably less than the alternative proposal that is heavy \non lawsuits, lawyers and litigation.\n  Another area of concern that I believe needs to be incorporated in \nany sensible managed care reform legislation is the inclusion of \nprotections for patients from genetic discrimination. The Patients' \nBill of Rights Plus Act would prohibit all group health plans and \ninsurers from denying coverage or adjusting premiums based on \npredictive genetic information. The protected genetic information \nincludes an\n\n[[Page S8366]]\n\nindividual's genetic tests, genetic tests of family members, or \ninformation about the medical history of family members.\n  No one should live in fear of being without health care based on \ngenetic traits that may not develop into a health problem.\n  Mr. President, I believe these provisions will empower the \nindividual, not the lawyers or bureaucracies. I am committed to the \nnotion that each individual American consumer of health care is in the \nbest position to chose where his or her health care dollar is best \nspent.\n  An administrative issue involved in this debate that I am very \nconcerned with is the effort to attempt to force all health plans--not \njust HMOs--to report the medical outcomes of their subscribers and the \nphysicians who treat them. This makes sense for a managed care plan \nsuch as an HMO, but it would be virtually impossible for a PPO or \nindemnity plan to monitor and classify this data without becoming \ninvolved in individual medical cases.\n  I believe that if we require all health plans to collect and report \ndata like this we will be requiring all plans to be organized like an \nHMO. This would significantly reduce the number of choices consumers \nand employers currently enjoy in selecting their health care.\n  The Congressional Budget Office recently determined that if S. 6, the \nKennedy version of the Patients' Bill of Rights, were to pass that this \ncountry would see private health insurance premiums increase 6.1 \npercent above inflation. What appears to be a minor increase to health \ncare premiums would have disastrous and immediate consequences around \nthe country, adding 1.9 million Americans to the ranks of the \nuninsured. In my home state that translates to 32,384 people. In \nColorado the average household would lose $203 in wages and 2,989 jobs \nwould be lost by 2003 for this ``minor'' increase.\n  We are talking about people in Colorado losing their jobs and their \nhealth care coverage because Washington wants to do what the State of \nColorado has been working on for the last thirty years.\n  The Congressional Budget Office determined that our bill, the \nPatients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, would increase costs by less than 1 \npercent. While I urge my colleagues to be wary of any potential \nincrease in costs for the American people, I also believe that the \nPatients' Bill of Rights Plus, and not the current Kennedy bill, \ndirectly addresses health care quality issues and increases choice for \nconsumers with a minimal cost.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a very important \npiece of legislation--legislation that is vital to the future of health \ncare in this country, the Patients' Bill of Rights. Democrats have \nfought long and hard to debate this bill on the floor of the Senate and \nI am thankful for the opportunity to speak in support of the underlying \nmeasure.\n  Today more than 160 million Americans, over 75 percent of the insured \npopulation, obtain health coverage through some form of managed care. \nManaged care arrangements can and do provide affordable, quality health \ncare to large numbers of people. Yet reports of financial consideration \ntaking precedence over patients health needs deserve our attention. We \nhear stories and read news articles about people who have paid for \nhealth insurance or received employer-sponsored insurance, became ill, \nonly to discover that their insurance does not provide coverage. Recent \nsurveys indicate that Americans are increasingly worried about their \nhealth care coverage. 115 million Americans report having a bad \nexperience with a health insurance company or knowing someone who has. \nThis undermining of confidence in our health care system must be \naddressed. We must act to restore the peace of mind of families in \nknowing that their health insurance will be there when they need it \nmost. We can accomplish this by establishing real consumer protections, \nrestoring the doctors decision-making authority, and ensuring that \npatients get the care they need.\n  Some of the important issues that we are debating include the scope \nof coverage, definition of who determines ``medically necessity,'' \nprotecting the doctor/patient relationship, access to care, and \naccountability.\n  True managed care reform cannot come from a narrow bill that covers \nonly a certain segment of the population. Today much of the regulation \nof managed care plans comes form the states. However, federal laws such \nas the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the \nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, combined with the \nvarious state regulations, form a patchwork of regulation for managed \ncare plans. Some in this chamber believe that the protections we are \nconsidering should only apply to ERISA-covered plans and not to the 113 \nmillion Americans who have private insurance that is regulated by the \nstates. They argue that these issues should be left to the states to \naddress. Democrats believe that everyone deserves equal protection, \nregardless of where they may live or work. The Patients' Bill of Rights \nwould not interfere with patient protection laws passed by the states, \nit would simply extend these patient protection rights to all \nAmericans.\n  As managed care has grown, so has the pressure on doctors and other \nhealth care providers to control costs. Complaints receiving widespread \nattention include denials of necessary care, lack of accountability, \nlimited choice of providers, inadequate access to care, and deficient \ninformation disclosure for consumers to make informed plan decisions. \nMr. President, a strong Patients' Bill of Rights should address the \nshortcomings of managed care. S. 6 takes a comprehensive approach in \ndealing with these issues, which is why I am a cosponsor of the \nmeasure.\n  The dominance of managed care has undermined the doctor-patient \nrelationship. Often tools are used to restrain doctors from \ncommunicating freely with patients or providing them with incentives to \nlimit care. We need to ensure that insurers cannot arbitrarily \ninterfere in the medical decision making. The Patients' Bill of Rights \nincludes a number of provisions to prevent arbitrary interference by \ninsurers. Our bill establishes an independent definition of medical \nnecessity, prohibits gag clauses on physicians and other restrictions \non medical communications, and protects providers from retaliation if \nthey advocate for their patients.\n  The issue of who decides what is medically necessary is probably the \nmost fundamental issue of this debate. We must empower patients so they \nreceive appropriate medical treatment, not necessarily the cheapest \ntreatment, not necessarily the treatment that an insurance company \ndetermines is appropriate, but the best treatment. Currently, many \ndoctors are finding insurance plans second-guessing and overriding \ntheir medical decisions. Democrats believe that the ``medical \nnecessity'' of patient care should be determined by physicians, \nconsistent with generally accepted standards of medical practice. \nDoctors are trained to diagnose and make treatment decisions based on \nthe best professional medical practice. We need to keep the medical \ndecisions in the hands of doctors and not insurance company \nbureaucrats.\n  Families in managed care plans often face numerous obstacles when \nseeking access to doctors and health care services. Some of these \nbarriers include restrictions on access to emergency room services, \nspecialists, needed drugs, and clinical trials. S. 6 would ensure \naccess to the closest emergency room, without requiring prior \nauthorization. It would provide access to qualified specialists, \nincluding providers outside of the network if the managed care \ncompany's choices are inadequate, and direct access to obstetricians \nand gynecologists for women and pediatricians for children. S. 6 would \nalso ensure access to drugs not included in a managed care plan's \ncovered list when medically indicated and provide access to quality \nclinical trials.\n  Finally, the underlying bill allows consumers to hold managed care \ncompanies accountable for medical negligence. Currently, insurers make \ndecisions with almost no accountability. Patients deserve the right to \na timely internal appeal and an unbiased external review process when \nthey disagree with a decision made by the insurer. Patients also \ndeserve recourse when the misconduct of managed care plans results in \nserious injury or death. However, under ERISA plans, patients have no \nright to obtain remedy under state\n\n[[Page S8367]]\n\nlaw. These patients are limited to the narrow federal remedy under \nERISA, which covers only the cost of the procedure the plan failed to \npay for. S. 6 would ensure that managed care companies can be held \naccountable for their actions. It does not establish a right to sue, \nbut prevents federal law from blocking what the states deem to be \nappropriate remedies. A strong legal liability provision will \ndiscourage insurers from improper treatment denials or delays and \nresult in better health care.\n  Mr. President, only a comprehensive bill will guarantee patient \nprotection with access to quality, affordable health care. We should \nnot miss this important opportunity to enact meaningful legislation \nthat is federally enforceable and will improve care and restore \nconfidence in our health care system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/13/senate-section/article/S8367-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

MARY E. STUCKEY, THE 1999 ELSIE M. HOOD OUTSTANDING \n                                TEACHER\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I pay tribute \nto The University of Mississippi's 1999 Outstanding Teacher of the \nYear, Dr. Mary E. Stuckey.\n  Each year my alma mater The University of Mississippi, known as Ole \nMiss, recognizes excellence in the classroom with the Elsie M. Hood \nOutstanding Teacher Award during its Honors Day Convocation. \nNominations for this honor are accepted from students, alumni, and \nfaculty. A committee of former recipients then selects the faculty \nmember who best demonstrates enthusiasm and engages students \nintellectually.\n  Dr. Mary E. Stuckey is an Associate Professor of Political Science. \nAn 11-year veteran of the Ole Miss Political Science Department, Dr. \nStuckey's teaching interests include the Presidency and political \ncommunications as well as American Indian politics. Her research \nfocuses on Presidential rhetoric, media coverage of the President, and \ninstitutional aspects of Presidential communication. Dr. Stuckey is \nalso working on several projects regarding depictions of American \nIndians in the media and in national politics. In addition to these \nareas of interest, she also teaches in the McDonnell-Barksdale Honors \nCollege.\n  Dr. Stuckey's research has earned her several prestigious grants. \nThese include the President Gerald R. Ford Library, the C-SPAN in the \nClassroom Faculty Development, a National Endowment for the Humanities \nFellowship, and the Canadian Studies Faculty Research. She has also \npublished several studies such as ``The President as Interpreter-in-\nChief'' and ``Strategic Failures in the Modern Presidency.''\n  A native of southern California, Dr. Stuckey earned a bachelor's \ndegree in political science from the University of California at Davis. \nShe then completed her graduate studies at the University of Notre Dame \nand joined the Ole Miss faculty in 1987.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me tell you that Dr. Stuckey and I probably \nwill not agree on much when it comes to political issues. But three \nmembers of my current staff, Steven Wall, Beth Miller, and Brian \nWilson, tell me she is outstanding in the classroom. They all agree \nthat she is an equal opportunity challenger, regardless of political \nviews, when it comes to the study of politics. She requires her \nstudents to use logic rather than emotions when advocating any \nviewpoint. Dr. Stuckey does not penalize her students when they don't \nshare her views; rather she rewards academic scholarship.\n  The study of political science is essential to any society. And I \nbelieve it is even more incumbent on us, as Americans, to do so. Thomas \nJefferson once said, ``Self-government is not possible unless the \ncitizens are educated sufficiently to enable them to exercise \noversight.'' He was right. Universities are an important institution to \nhelp instill in each generation an appreciation for the unique and \nhonorable character required for our democratic republic. Americans \nwant to learn from their past mistakes so they can strive to build a \nbetter society for their children and grandchildren. Dedicated and \ninspiring teachers, such as Dr. Mary E. Stuckey, this year's Elsie M. \nHood Award recipient, are key to ensuring that our next generation of \npolitical leaders will have the necessary knowledge and character to \nmake America strong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/13/senate-section/article/S8367-3", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8367-S8369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ECONOMIC REFORMS IN RUSSIA\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I draw my colleagues' attention to an \narticle that appeared earlier this year in Economic Reform Today. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full text of ``Safeguarding Russian \nInvestors: Securities Chief Speaks Out'' be printed at the end of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, Economic Reform Today is a quarterly \nmagazine published by the Center for International Private Investment. \nCIPE is one of the core grantees of the National Endowment for \nDemocracy and is dedicated to promoting democratic governance and \nmarket oriented economic reform. Their work has been particularly \nimportant in assisting the ongoing transition to free markets in the \nformer communist countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet \nUnion.\n  The article I will include in the Record, highlights Russia's \ncontinuing effort to implement political and economic reforms. This has \nbeen a painful process in Russia. However, it is my firm belief that \nRussia's transition to a free-market democracy will be measured in \ndecades, not years. During this important time--CIPE and the other NED \ngrantees--have been working to ensure that the Russian people have \naccess to the information and resources necessary to make a successful \ntransition.\n  Again, I encourage my colleagues to read this important article.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n      Safeguarding Russian Investors: Securities Chief Speaks Out\n\n(If Russia is to gain economic stability and attract foreign investors \nit will need to respond better to the needs and concerns of investors. \n    Dmitry Vasiliyev has made this the chief reform priority of the \nsecurities commission that he heads. He is one of the strongest voices \n in Russia today calling for more efficient and transparent markets to \n   provide the necessary foreign and domestic capital to jump start \nRussia's newly privatized enterprises. In this interview with Economic \n  Reform Today, Vasiliyev underscores the importance of establishing \n    strong shareholders' rights as a cornerstone of economic reform)\n\n       ERT: You have made upholding shareholder rights one of the \n     top priorities of the Federal Securities Commission (FSC). \n     Why is this so important?\n       Mr. Vasiliyev: Protecting investors' rights is an important \n     prerequisite for attracting foreign investment, and, \n     unfortunately, Russia faces serious problems in this area. \n     Although we are gradually improving the quality of corporate \n     governance, Russia is losing billions of dollars in \n     investments because of poor investor safeguards, both in \n     corporate and government securities. This is reflected in the \n     lower value of Russian stock prices as compared with those of \n     other emerging market countries. Better protection of \n     investors' rights will attract more investors and allow \n     companies to raise more capital and lead to the development \n     of new technologies and more production.\n       ERT: Can you gauge the damage that denying these \n     shareholder rights inflicts on the Russian economy?\n       Mr. Vasiliyev: The Russian economy faces serious \n     consequences unless it can offer adequate safeguards. Not \n     only are foreigners reluctant to invest in Russia, but \n     Russians do not trust it either. People are putting their \n     savings into dollars because other forms of investment don't \n     offer enough protection.\n       That's why we have concentrated our efforts on protecting \n     the market from low-quality securities. Last year we denied \n     registration to 2,600 issues; that is, we turned down 14% of \n     all submitted prospectuses. That means we prevented 2,600 \n     possible violations of shareholder rights. Of course we also \n     had to cancel some issues that were already registered; for \n     example, the well-publicized cases involving the largest \n     Russian oil companies, such as Sidanko and Sibneft. Last week \n     the Commission launched an investigation into the case of \n     Yukos. We are determined to use all measure necessary to \n     defend minority shareholders. In some cases the exchange or \n     brokers themselves violate shareholder rights through \n     manipulation. Our investigations have increased sevenfold in \n     the last two years. We recognize, however, that we are only \n     at the beginning of a long process.\n\n[[Page S8368]]\n\n       A responsible government should observe a strict financial \n     policy and minimize its borrowing, including \n     issuing government bonds. The crisis over the past year \n     was also a crisis of sovereign debt: the crash of the GKO \n     (government bond) pyramid caused tremendous losses to the \n     real economy and to the financial sector. As a result, the \n     government is developing twelve new laws aimed at \n     protecting investors. In March, Parliament adopted one of \n     these laws, which protects investors in the securities \n     markets. We also need to improve our joint stock company \n     law in order to reduce share dilution and asset stripping, \n     as well as to allow shareholders to dismiss management and \n     stop asset theft. We also want to change the criminal code \n     and make nondisclosure to investors and crime. I believe \n     that we can learn from other countries' experiences, \n     including the United States, in this area.\n       There are several typical violations of shareholder rights \n     in Russia. The first is share dilution, which we have been \n     trying to counter by denying issue registrations. The bill \n     approved in March also introduces stricter procedures that \n     should protect against share dilution.\n       The second is nondisclosure or provision of false \n     information. We have begun to address this issue through the \n     same bill, which allows the FSC to fine issuers of securities \n     if they provide insufficient disclosure or misleading data. \n     For example, if a prospectus contains false information, \n     those who have signed it--the CEO, the auditor and the \n     independent appraiser--bear a subsidiary responsibility if \n     investors lost money because the information was false. Of \n     course this is only the first step; we still have to iron \n     out how to enforce the law and other procedural matters. \n     In the West, for instance, you have ``class action'' \n     suits, but courts do not hear such cases in Russia.\n       Another typical violation is transfer pricing abuse; that \n     is, when commodities or securities are sold at artificial \n     prices between or among affiliated companies. Here, as in the \n     case of asset stripping, shareholders need to have stricter \n     control over the actions of management. The FSC is trying to \n     prevent the execution of large transactions without prior \n     shareholders' approval. While we do not always succeed, we \n     are trying to close this important loophole.\n       The issue of share conversion between a holding company and \n     its subsidiaries is very serious. Shareholders of both the \n     holding company and the subsidiaries must insist on a fair \n     and independent appraisal of assets and establishment of a \n     fair conversion rate. Government officials cannot solve this \n     question; it's a matter for management and the shareholders \n     and points up the importance of appropriate procedures for \n     corporate decision making. For example, in some cases, such \n     as Lukoil's, the share conversion process went pretty \n     smoothly because Lukoil management took a balanced and well-\n     conceived position. Other cases, such as Sibneft, resulted in \n     huge scandals. This is a long-term process and the FSC will \n     be focusing on this issue indefinitely.\n       ERT: Financial industrial groups have a very strong \n     presence in the Russian economy. Experts argue that they need \n     to be reformed or regulated. In your view, what type of \n     regulation is necessary?\n       Mr. Vasiliyev: The economic crisis last year delivered a \n     very serious blow to financial industrial groups (FIGs). It \n     destroyed many of them, and weakened many of the so-called \n     ``oligarchs,'' who were forced to sell off parts of their \n     empires. Yukos is just one example of the troubles facing \n     these groups.\n       I believe that FIGs are not the most efficient way to \n     achieve economic development. Equity or investment financing \n     through the securities market and the banking system \n     should be kept--and regulated--as separate systems. The \n     experiences of other countries, including the US, show \n     that heavy investment in industry by banks and financial \n     institutions can have catastrophic consequences. Back in \n     1997, I was already insisting that Russia needs banks to \n     stay away from risky speculative operations, not to hold \n     stock in companies and not to invest in industry. What we \n     had in the August 1998 crisis was the collapse of the \n     settlement system.\n       At the same time we need investment banks involved in \n     corporate finance, but investors know that many Russian banks \n     are used for speculative operations not for settlement \n     purposes. Russia's President Yeltsin recently sent a message \n     to the Federation Council stating that the country needs both \n     ``settlement'' banks and ``investment'' banks. The fact that \n     President Yeltsin highlighted this critical issue is an \n     encouraging sign for the ailing banking sector.\n       Creditors' rights also need to be protected. In Russia \n     creditors are not offered adequate protection. The banks say \n     that they need a controlling interest in a company in order \n     to be able to lend money to it. Creditors' rights should be \n     protected, but the solution to that is for banks not to \n     participate in a company's equity capital. If banks would \n     lend to companies rather than invest in government bonds, \n     they would not be so involved in speculation and not be so \n     dependent on getting controlling interest in companies.\n       State involvement in the economy should be minimal, but \n     today it is still very high. Sweeping privatization is not \n     the most important objective; the goal should be to privatize \n     the land held by industrial companies so they can use it as \n     collateral for loans. The sooner this is done the better, but \n     this process has moved very slowly since 1994. In my opinion \n     this aspect of privatization is more important than \n     agricultural reform.\n       ERT: Can you delineate the responsibilities of the FSC and \n     the Central Bank in regulating corporate transactions and \n     capital markets? In what areas should they cooperate and \n     in what areas should they have separate responsibilities?\n       Mr. Vasiliyev: I believe that each has its own functions--\n     the main objective of the Central Bank, just like in any \n     other country, is supporting the national currency. My task \n     at the FSC is to protect investors and regulate the \n     securities market.\n       ERT: In your view, what is the Russian public's perception \n     of the local business community? If it is negative, how \n     should businesses work to revamp this perception?\n       Mr. Vasiliyev: The attitude toward business people is not \n     very good. I believe that the country's private sector should \n     work on changing its tarnished image. It should be \n     prestigious to be involved in business and society should \n     appreciate that it has an important function. Changing the \n     poor image of business will, of course, take a long time. The \n     ideology of the old Soviet regime won't disappear overnight. \n     In Russia it is the younger generation that is leaning toward \n     capitalism.\n       The private sector, of course, will play a key role in the \n     economy. It already plays an important role, but often in the \n     form of speculation and the ``shadow'' economy. The Russian \n     economy needs to move from the shadows to the daylight \n     through simplification of regulation and licensing. We need \n     to make it profitable to pay taxes. (See ERT No. 4, 1997 pp. \n     6-9 for a detailed discussion of how Russia's ``shadow'' \n     economy operates.)\n       ERT: In Russia, much of the public perceives the \n     privatization process as unfair. How would the changes in \n     regulations that you have outlined in this interview improve \n     this process?\n       Mr. Vasiliyev: We believe that the structure of ownership \n     will gradually change. Many companies that were privatized as \n     joint stock companies will probably leave the securities \n     market. They are not interested in remaining publicly traded. \n     We will probably have 500 to 1,000 publicly traded companies. \n     Most small shops or factories employing less than 100 persons \n     will gradually end up being privately owned or become closely \n     held companies, which is fine. The number of publicly traded \n     companies is declining in countries that went through mass \n     privatization. We see this happening in the Czech Republic \n     and it will eventually happen in Russia, too.\n       There were two components of Russia's privatization \n     process. One was land privatization--the land ``under'' \n     companies--and the other was securities markets development \n     intended to rectify privatizations that were not done in a \n     very efficient manner. We were forced to implement \n     privatizations in the way we did. Other options then were not \n     politically or psychologically acceptable in our country. I \n     still believe this. But it is obvious that we encountered a \n     lot of insider influence and very limited transparency \n     because of the very fast pace of transition.\n       When we were first starting to privatize, I worked in the \n     state property commission as a deputy to Mr. Anatoly Chubais, \n     its chairman, and I drafted many documents on privatization. \n     One of the main conditions we asked for was that companies \n     become open joint stock corporations so that stock could \n     be sold and bought. Now that there is a battle for control \n     of these companies and the advent of outside shareholders \n     is beginning to strengthen their positions, Russian \n     companies are changing bit by bit. The securities markets \n     are helping this transition.\n       The use of a central depository as a privatization \n     mechanism has been adopted by many emerging market countries \n     and is accepted by all securities commissions. If we could \n     establish a central depository, we would be able to reduce \n     the number of registrars and eventually move toward not using \n     them at all. Later we could introduce centralized clearing \n     settlements. These will lower investors' costs and \n     significantly improve protection of their rights since they \n     would then be protected from registrar-related risks. The \n     attractiveness of the Russian market would benefit \n     significantly from the results. So my position was and is \n     that sooner or later this central depository will be created \n     in Russia.\n       Right now our policy is that no single issuer can control \n     more than 20% of a registrar, and that registrars handle a \n     large number of issuers. They gradually are becoming more \n     independent. Our largest registrars handle 200 to 300 issuers \n     and millions of accounts so that they are no longer dependent \n     on a particular issuer.\n       Of course, there are still registrars who are under the \n     strong influence of a single issuer--Yukos, for example. But \n     they are subject to strict control by the Commission. In \n     the past year, we checked up on three-fourths of all \n     registrars and have 125 of them left to check. Almost all \n     of them are checked once a year.\n       ERT: More broadly, what lessons should policymakers in \n     other developing countries learn from Russia's ongoing \n     transition to a market-oriented economy?\n       Mr. Vasiliyev: The first lesson is that emerging markets \n     cannot borrow the experience of Western countries. You cannot \n     just transfer their legislation to other countries. We are at \n     a different stage of development. The Russian economy and its \n     financial instruments are nearly a century behind those of \n     the US, for example, in terms of our legal base, the \n     capitalization of our institutions,\n\n[[Page S8369]]\n\n     and our familiarity with how a market economy works.\n       The Russian economy faces several key obstacles. First is a \n     lack of expertise among Russian managers. A typical manager \n     cannot write a reasonable plan for investors. A manager may \n     have a project and an investor may have cash to invest, but \n     without a decent plan, nothing will develop. Second, Russia \n     must simplify its taxation rules and reduce the tax burden. \n     Only then will we see real economic growth and more revenues. \n     Third, we must greatly simplify procedures for the control \n     and licensing of businesses. Starting up and/or liquidating a \n     business should be easy. This would enable us to reduce crime \n     and corruption and transfer part of the informal economy to \n     the formal sector.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/13/senate-section/article/S8369-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleague \nSenator James Jeffords of Vermont on legislation he introduced that \nmakes several important first steps in addressing some serious access \nproblems in the Medicare home health care program. Senator Jeffords' \nlegislation, the Preserving Access to Care in the Home (PATCH) Act of \n1999, contains several important provisions to ensure that all Medicare \nbeneficiaries have access to home health services.\n  Mr. President, I have been working to promote the availability of \nhome care and long-term care options for my entire public life. I \nbelieve it is vitally important that we in Congress work to enable \npeople to stay in their own homes. Ensuring the availability of home \nhealth services is integral to preserving independence, dignity and \nhope for some of our frailest and most vulnerable fellow Americans. I \nfeel strongly that where there is a choice, we should do our best to \nallow patients to choose home health care. I think Seniors need and \ndeserve that choice. I applaud Senator Jeffords for his leadership on \nthis issue, and I look forward to working with him to ensure that \nSeniors have access to the care that they need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/13/senate-section/article/S8369-3", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8369-S8370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNTS\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, within the next several weeks, the Senate \nwill debate an issue of extreme importance to the future of our \neconomy--whether and in what manner to return nearly $800 billion in \ntax relief to the American people over the next ten years.\n  I strongly support this tax cut. I believe we owe it to the American \npeople, who after all provided the hard work that produced our current \nsurpluses. I also believe that these surpluses provide us with a unique \nopportunity to reduce and simplify our current onerous, Byzantine tax \ncode. Finally, and most important for my purposes here today, we now \nhave an important opportunity to target and encourage further saving \nand investment.\n  To keep our economy growing and our budget balanced, we must do more \nto encourage saving and investment. Therefore, it is my view that part \nof the tax cut should be crafted following an innovative concept called \nIndividual Development Accounts or IDAs. IDAs are emerging as one of \nthe most promising tools to help low income working families save \nmoney, build wealth, and achieve economic independence. This pro-asset \nbuilding idea is designed to reward the monthly savings of working-poor \nfamilies who are trying to buy their first home, pay for post-secondary \neducation, or start a small business. The reward or incentive can be \nprovided through the use of tax credits to financial institutions that \nprovide matching contributions to savings deposited by low income \npeople. In this way those savings will accumulate more quickly, \nbuilding assets and further incentives to save.\n  I believe so strongly in the many benefits that IDAs can provide to \nlow income families that I have cosponsored S. 895, the Savings for \nWorking Families Act written by my colleagues, Senators Lieberman and \nSantorum. Similar to 401(k) plans, IDAs will make it easier for low \nincome families to build the financial assets they need to achieve \ntheir economic goals. But availability is not enough. We also must \nempower the working poor in America to make use of this important \neconomic tool. That is why a second key component of the IDA concept \nconsists of financial education and counseling services to IDA account-\nholders. These services will allow IDA users to further improve their \nability to save and improve their quality of life.\n  Let me briefly outline the four key reasons why I believe the IDA \nconcept is so crucial to a well-crafted tax cut.\n  First, asset building is crucial to the long-term health and well \nbeing of low income families. Assets not only provide an economic \ncushion and enable people to make investments in their futures, they \nalso provide a psychological orientation--toward the future, about \none's children, about having a stake in the community--that income \nalone cannot provide. Put simply, families that fail to save fail to \nmove up the ladder of economic success and well-being. Unfortunately, \nsaving strategies have been ignored in the poverty assistance programs \nestablished over the past 35 years. IDAs will fill this critical gap in \nour social policy.\n  Second, our great Nation needs to address the wealth gap, and bring \nmore people into the financial mainstream. While there has been \nconsiderable attention given to the income cap among our citizens, I \nwonder how many Americans realize that ten percent of the families \ncontrol two-thirds of our Nation's wealth or that one-half of all \nAmerican households have less that $1,000 in net financial assets, or \nthat 20 percent of all American households do not have a checking or a \nsavings account?\n  Current Federal tax policy provides more than $300 billion per year \nin incentives for middle-class and wealthy families to purchase \nhousing, prepare for retirement, and invest in businesses and job \ncreation. Yet, public policies have largely penalized low income people \nwho try to save and build assets and savings incentives in the tax code \nare beyond their reach. It is time for us to find ways to expand these \ntax incentives so that they can reach low income families who want to \nwork and save.\n  Third, IDAs are a good national investment, yielding over $5 for \nevery $1 invested. According to the Corporation for Enterprise \nDevelopment or CFED, the initial investment in IDAs would be multiplied \nmore than five times in the form of new businesses, new jobs, increased \nearnings, higher tax receipts, and reduced welfare expenditures. And \nthese increases will come from genuinely new asset development. Savings \nwill be produced that could not have been produced by other, more \ngeneral means, and in areas where there were no savings before.\n  Finally, IDAs have a successful track record we should not ignore. \nIDAs are working now in our communities and they are having a \ntremendous effect on families who choose to save for the future. There \nare already 150 active IDA programs around the country, with at least \nanother 100 in development. Approximately 3,000 people are regularly \nsaving in their IDAs. The CFED has compiled encouraging evidence from \ntheir IDA pilot programs showing that poor people, with proper \nincentives and\n\n[[Page S8370]]\n\nsupport will save regularly and acquire productive assets. There are \nalmost 1,000 families participating in CFEDs privately funded IDA \ndemonstration and as of December 31, 1998 these families saved over \n$165,000, an amount which leveraged another $343,000 in matching funds.\n  IDAs are already a tremendous success. But, unless additional \nresources can be found to provide the matching contributions so \nessential for IDAs to succeed, most low income families will never have \nthe opportunity to save and build assets for the future. The major \nfactor in delaying the creation of IDAs in the 100 communities \nmentioned above is the lack of a funding source that can provide the \nneeded matching contributions. Our tax cut bill will and should provide \nnearly $800 billion in tax cuts over the next ten years. I believe \nthat, within this bill, we should make a small investment of only $5-\n$10 billion in IDAs. This would ensure that millions of working, low \nincome families who want to work and save for their first home, provide \na post-secondary education for a child, or start a small business could \nestablish their own IDA accounts.\n  I strongly encourage the Senate Finance Committee to look closely at \nIDAs as a means of helping low income families build the financial \nassets they need to achieve the American Dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/13/senate-section/article/S8370-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8370-S8371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FAIRNESS FOR FEDERAL WORKERS IN RHODE ISLAND\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue of critical \nimportance to nearly 6,000 federal workers in the state of Rhode Island \nand to the agencies that employ them.\n  The absence of federal locality pay for workers in Rhode Island has \ncreated serious recruitment and retention problems for federal offices \ndue to the substantial federal pay differential between Rhode Island \nand the neighboring states of Massachusetts and Connecticut.\n  Let me briefly give the background on this complex issue. Nine years \nago, Congress enacted the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of \n1990 to correct disparities between Federal and private salaries. The \nAct authorized the President to grant interim geographic pay \nadjustments of up to 8% in certain areas with significant pay \ndisparities during 1991-1993. Beginning in 1994, the Act provided for a \nnationwide system of locality pay intended to close the gap between \nFederal and private salaries over a nine-year period.\n  Unfortunately, implementation of the Act has created significant pay \ndisparities among Federal employees in southern New England, in \nparticular between Federal employees in Rhode Island and those in \nMassachusetts and Connecticut.\n  Rhode Island is literally surrounded by locality pay areas. On its \nwestern border, Rhode Island is adjacent to the Hartford locality pay \narea, which includes all of New London County, Connecticut. Rhode \nIsland's entire northern border is adjacent to the Boston-Worcester-\nLawrence locality pay area, which includes the towns of Douglas, \nUxbridge, Millville, and Blackstone in Worcester County, Massachusetts; \nand all of Norfolk County, Massachusetts. The Boston pay locality even \nreaches around the state of Rhode Island to encompass the adjacent town \nof Thompson, Connecticut, which lies directly west of Woonsocket, Rhode \nIsland, on the opposite side of our state from Boston. Finally, Rhode \nIsland's eastern border is separated from the Boston locality pay area \nby as little as four miles.\n  One facility within a few miles of the Boston locality pay area, the \nNaval Undersea Warfare Center in Newport--a premier Navy R laboratory \nwith world class facilities and progressive employee benefits--has seen \nits starting salaries continue to fall below the industry average. As a \nresult, the Center's acceptance rate has dropped to approximately 40% \nand the average GPA of new employees is down.\n  The Federal Salary Council's eligibility criteria have created what I \nfrequently refer to as a ``donut hole'' in locality pay in our region \nthat leaves thousands of federal employees in Rhode Island with a minus \n3.45% pay differential in 1999 when compared to federal employees just \na few miles to the north, east, and west.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. I will be happy to yield to the senior Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It is no wonder that Federal agencies in Rhode Island \nhave trouble recruiting and retaining qualified employees given the \nvery short travel time to the higher-paying Boston or Hartford locality \npay areas. Most Americans know that Rhode Island is the smallest state \nin the nation, but I think it is worth emphasizing just how small the \ndimensions are, and the impact that has on commuting patterns in our \nregion.\n  It is only 35 miles from the eastern edge of the Hartford locality \npay area in Connecticut to the Boston locality pay area in Dartmouth, \nMassachusetts. In between, a little more than 30 miles across, is the \nstate of Rhode Island and 3,700 federal employees without locality pay \nin Newport County. Where is the incentive for a federal employee living \nin central Rhode Island to continue working for a federal agency in our \nstate when he or she could drive less than 20 miles in any direction \nand receive a nearly 4% raise?\n  Mr. REED. The Senator is correct. This situation makes no sense given \nthe similar cost of labor across southern New England and the unusually \nheavy commuting patterns between Rhode Island and the Boston and \nHartford pay localities, especially with the Boston area. It is only 45 \nmiles from Providence to downtown Boston.\n  The question before us now is, how did we get into this situation, \nand how can we correct it? The main obstacle to federal locality pay in \nRhode Island is the federal government's use of county data to \ndetermine the eligibility of ``Areas of Application'' to existing pay \nlocalities. First of all, I would note that Rhode Island has no county \ngovernments, and the Federal Salary Council's use of county data is, \ntherefore, impractical and arbitrary. Secondly, the criteria for \napplication are structured in such a way that our state cannot become \neligible. To be considered, a county must be contiguous to a pay \nlocality; contain at least 2,000 General Schedule employees; have a \nsignificant level of urbanization; and demonstrate some economic \nlinkage with the pay locality, defined as commuting at a level of 5% or \nmore into or from the areas in question.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. If the Senator will yield, I would point out that in our \nstate, Newport County surpasses the employee requirement but is not \ncontiguous to a pay locality because the President's Pay Agent excluded \nthe towns of Westport and Fall River, Massachusetts from the Boston-\nWorcester-Lawrence pay locality. As a result, less than four miles \nseparate the 3,700 Federal employees in Newport County from the \nlocality pay provided to employees in the Boston pay locality.\n  Given our State's extremely small size and, as the Senator mentioned, \nthe fact that Rhode Island has no county governments, the Salary \nCouncil's use of county data is inappropriate. The total land area of \nRhode Island is only about two-thirds the size of Worcester County, \nMassachusetts, nearly all of which falls inside the Boston pay \nlocality. As long as the Pay Agent applies its criteria on a county-by-\ncounty basis, no part of Rhode Island will be eligible for a higher \nlevel of locality pay, and existing Federal pay disparities between \nRhode Island and its neighbors will continue to degrade Federal \nservices in our state.\n  Simply put, the FEPCA law was intended to resolve a public-private \npay disparity. In southern New England, however, it has created a \npublic-public pay disparity.\n  Mr. REED. The Senator is absolutely right. And to remedy this \nsituation, the bill we have introduced, S. 1313, the Rhode Island \nFederal Worker Fairness Act, will require the President's Pay Agent to \nconsider the State of Rhode Island as one county strictly for the \npurposes of locality pay. We believe this bill will enable Rhode \nIsland, the smallest state in the nation and about the same size as the \naverage county in the United States, to apply for locality pay on an \nequal footing with county governments in other parts of the country.\n  We look forward to working with the distinguished Chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Senator Thompson, and the Committee's \nranking member, Senator Lieberman, in our effort to reduce the \ninequities among Federal employees in our region\n\n[[Page S8371]]\n\nand enable federal offices in Rhode Island to attract and retain \nqualified employees.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/13/senate-section/article/S8371-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                       executive message referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a treaty \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/13/senate-section/article/S8371-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY CONCERNING WEAPONS OF MASS \n             DESTRUCTION--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 47\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 204 of the International Emergency Economics \nPowers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)) and section 401(c) of the National \nEmergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)), I transmit herewith a 6-month \nreport on the national emergency declared by Executive Order 12938 of \nNovember 14, 1994, in response to the threat posed by the proliferation \nof nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons (``weapons of mass \ndestruction'') and of the means of delivering such weapons.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to combat criminal misuse of explosives; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n         dangerous explosives background checks requirement act\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, every year, thousands of people are \nkilled or maimed because of the use or misuse of illegal explosive \ndevices, and millions of dollars in property is lost. Between 1991 and \n1995, there were more than 14,000 actual and attempted criminal \nbombings. Three hundred and twenty-six people were killed in those \nincidents and another 2,970 injured. More than $6 million in property \ndamage resulted.\n  One bombing in particular, is carved into the national memory. On the \nmorning of April 19, 1995, in one horrible moment, an explosion \ndevastated the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, OK, \nand took the lives of 168 Americans. This tragedy, together with the \nbombing of the World Trade Center in New York, took the lives of many \ninnocent men, women, and children, left others permanently scarred, and \ncaused great suffering for the families of the victims--as well as all \nof America. These crimes were intended to tear the very fabric of our \nsociety; instead, their tragic consequences served to strengthen our \nresolve to stand firm against the insanity of terrorism and the \ncriminal use of explosives.\n  In the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, I was stunned--as were \nmany--to learn how few restrictions on the use and sale of explosives \nreally exist. I soon after introduced legislation to take a first step \ntowards protecting the American people from those who would use \nexplosives to do them harm. That bill, the Explosives Protection Act, \nwould bring explosives law into line with gun laws. Specifically, it \nwould take the list of categories of people who cannot obtain firearms \nand would add any of those categories not currently covered under the \nexplosives law.\n  Today, I am taking the next step by introducing the Dangerous \nExplosives Background Check Requirement Act requiring background checks \nbefore the sale of explosives material identical to those already \nmandated for firearms sales. Current law prohibits felons and others \nfrom possessing explosives, but does little to actually stop these \nmaterials from getting into the wrong hands. This failure defies logic \nwhen we already have a system in place to facilitate background checks \nand assure that persons who are legally prohibited from purchasing \nexplosives are not able to do so.\n  In November, 1998, the National Instant Criminal Background Check \nSystem (NICS) became operational. NICS is a new national database \naccessible to licensed firearms dealers that allows them to perform \nover-the-counter background checks on potential firearms purchasers. \nNICS, which checks national criminal history databases as well as \ninformation on other prohibited categories, such as illegal aliens and \npersons under domestic violence restraining orders, has already \nprocessed more than 3.7 million background checks and has stopped more \nthan 39,000 felons and other prohibited persons from getting guns. In \nso doing, it has undoubtedly saved lives and prevented crimes from \noccurring.\n  Once again, it is time to bring the explosives law into line with gun \nlaws by taking advantage of the success of the NICS system and \nexpanding its use to include explosives purchases. In so doing, we will \nmake it harder for many of the most dangerous or least accountable \nmembers of society to obtain materials which can result in a great loss \nof life. My hope is that this bill will, in some small way, prevent \nfuture bombings--whether by terrorists of symbolic targets, malcontents \nof random ones, or even spouses involved in marital disputes.\n  I hope we can quickly move to get this passed and protect Americans \nfrom future acts of explosive destruction. I ask unanimous consent that \na copy of the legislation appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1353\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the Consumers Dairy \nRelief Act, a bill that will save American consumers $500 million a \nyear on their milk, cheese and dairy purchases. This legislation \nterminates the Federal Milk Marketing Orders by the year 2001.\n  Consumers are paying far more than necessary for their dairy \npurchases because our current system encourages milk production in high \ncost areas. Our nation's milk pricing laws, which were designed in the \n1930's, are seriously outdated and long overdue to be reformed. Dairy \nfarmers in Wisconsin have suffered under the present system for too \nlong. Wisconsin loses, 1,500 dairy farmers a year, not because they are \ninefficient, but because a federal law discriminates against them by \npreventing them from competing on a level playing field.\n  Opponents of this legislation will tell you that we need to keep the \npresent system in order to maintain a fresh milk supply in their \nstates. While that may have been true in the 1930's, when we lacked the \nrefrigeration technology necessary to store and transport milk, it is \ncertainly not true today. We can now easily and safely transport \nperishable milk and cheese products between regions of the United \nStates. In fact, the industry has actually perfected the system to such \na degree that we now export cheese to countries around the world.\n  Mr. President, as the United States expands its role in the export \ndairy market and enters into more trade agreements, our domestic \nagricultural policy is coming under intense scrutiny. Another reason to \neliminate our antiquated milk pricing system is that it will give us \nanother negotiating tool to use during the next round of WTO \ndiscussions scheduled to take place in Seattle this fall.\n  Our trading partners are growing increasingly concerned about the \nintervention of the federal government in the pricing of milk. Earlier \nthis month, The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature Management and \nFisheries said\n\n[[Page S8375]]\n\nthey want to put the issue of USDA's Federal Milk Marketing Orders and \ndairy compacts on the table for discussion at the next round of \nAgricultural discussions in Seattle this fall.\n  By passing this legislation and reforming our milk pricing laws, we \ncan eliminate another hurdle currently in the way of negotiating \nagricultural trade agreements that would open up new markets for our \nfarmers.\n  Mr. President, if the Senate decides to discuss reforming our milk \npricing system, we must give serious consideration to eliminating the \npresent system. Today I have touched on a few of the reasons we need to \nscrap our current milk pricing system. There are many others, but I \nwill save those for another time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1354\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish demonstration projects to provide family \nincome to respond to significant transitions, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n    The Family Income to Respond to Significant Transitions (FIRST) \n                             Insurance Act\n\n  Ms. DODD. Mr. President. These last several weeks have been filled \nwith profound questions about the strength of the American family and \nthe priority we place on our children and on meeting the \nresponsibilities of parenthood.\n  In my view, we must start at the very beginning. We know that some of \nthe key moments of parenthood are in the first days and weeks of a \nchild's life. These are the moments when parents fall in love with \ntheir children--when they learn the feel of their soft hair, the joy of \ntheir touch and the immense peacefulness of their sleeping faces.\n  These emotional bonds carry parents and children through all the \nchallenging years that intervene between infancy and adulthood--from \nthe terrible twos to adolescence.\n  Research tells us this bonding with parents is critical to a child's \nemotional, cognitive, and physical development. Scientists have \nproduced vivid pictures of children's functioning brains--so not only \ndo we know, we can also see that there is a difference between the way \nthe brain of a neglected child and the brain of a nurtured child works.\n  Parents bonding with their children is not something one can mandate \nby law--but we must make sure that our policies support parents in \nthese early days. And frankly, today as we sit on the cusp of the next \nmillennium, we offer parents very limited support at this most critical \ntime.\n  Today's working parents have less time to spend with their infants \nthan past generations. Compared to 30 years ago, there has been an \naverage decrease of 22 hours per week in time that parents spend with \ntheir children. That is nearly one day out of every week--or 52 days a \nyear.\n  More parents work today than every before--fully 46 percent of \nworkers are parents. Nearly one in five employed parents. Nearly one in \nfive employed parents are single, and among these 27 percent are single \nfathers. The number of parents who were employed increased from 18.3 \nmillion in 1985 to 24.1 million in 1997.\n  One could argue whether these trends are going in the right \ndirection. But no one can argue that they are the facts--the reality in \nwhich American families live everyday. And, my view, that reality is \nwhere public policy must operate.\n  Since 1986, I've worked, with many of my colleagues, to help working \nAmericans meet these demands and care for new children and their close \nfamily members. In 1993, the Family and Medical Leave Act was finally \nsigned into law, establishing a key safety net for America's families. \nI couldn't have done it without the support of my colleagues here in \nthe Senate and the House, and without the support of the President.\n  But let's face it--the FMLA is like 911 for working Americans. It \nprovides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to qualifying employees for the \nbirth or adoption of a child, their own illness or the serious illness \nof a parent, child or spouse without fear of losing their jobs or \nhealth insurance. But the fact remains this leave is unpaid--and that \nis a high bar for most American families.\n  While millions of Americans--many estimate over twenty million \nfamilies--have benefitted from the law and have taken the time they \nneeded, for many it has been at major financial cost. In fact, taking \nan unpaid leave often drives employees earning low wages into poverty. \nTwenty-one percent of low-wage earners who take a leave without full \nwage replacement wind up on public assistance; 40 percent cut their \nleaves short because of financial concerns; 39 percent put off paying \nbills; and, 25 percent borrow money.\n  And there are many more families who do not take a needed leave \nbecause they can't afford it. Nearly two-thirds of employees who need \nto take a family or medical leave, but do not do so, report that the \nreason they did not take the leave was that they could not afford it. \nThese are families with brand new children or where a spouse, parent or \nchild is seriously ill.\n  Many employers do provide workers with some pay during these \ndifficult times--but the benefit of these policies is not distributed \nequally. Employees with less education, lower income, female employees, \nemployees from racial minority groups and younger employees are less \nlikely to receive any income during leaves.\n  Our nation is a leader in so many areas. And yet not when it comes to \nhelping families balance the responsibilities of work and home. Nearly \nevery industrialized nation other than\n\n[[Page S8376]]\n\nthe United States, as well as most developing nations, provide parents \nwith paid leave for infant care.\n  I believe that we should learn from these nations, our own \nexperiences, and the calls of American families and provide parents \nwith the means to access desperately needed leave to care for new \nbabies. This effort cannot be out of reach for a nation as rich and \nprosperous as our own.\n  The bi-partisan Commission on Leave, established as a part of the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act and which I chaired, recommended further \nconsideration and exploration of paid leave policies. Specifically, and \nI quote from the unanimous recommendations of the Commission, ``the \nCommission recommends that the development of a uniform system of wage \nreplacement for periods of family and medical leave be given serious \nconsideration by employers, employee representatives and others.'' The \nCommission went on to recommend that we should look to expanding \nemployer-provided systems of paid leave, and expanding state systems \nlike unemployment insurance or temporary disability insurance, in \nstates with those systems.\n  Mr. President, this is not a pie in the sky idea. Many states have \nalready recognized the need for such support for new parents. \nCalifornia, New Jersey, three other states and Puerto Rico have in \nplace temporary disability insurance programs, that at a minimal cost \nto employees and employers, provide support to mothers who are \ntemporarily disabled after pregnancy and childbirth as well as other \nworkers temporarily disabled.\n  Other states are moving to provide income to families through \ndifferent mechanisms. Massachusetts, Vermont, Washington and several \nother states are all considering legislation to expand their state \nunemployment compensation systems to provide partial wage replacement \nto workers taking family or medical leave. Just a few weeks ago, \nPresident Clinton announced his support of these bold initiatives and \ndirected the Department of Labor to work with the states to allow for \nthis expansion of these state unemployment insurance systems.\n  But I believe there is more for the federal government to do. We \nshould be a partner in these state efforts and help spur the \ndevelopment of the unemployment insurance model as well as other \nfinancial mechanism that will, I hope, make paid leave a reality for \nall new parents in America.\n  I am proposing today legislation that would establish a federal \ndemonstration program--which I am calling FIRST (Family Income to \nRespond to Significant Transitions) Insurance.\n  FIRST Insurance would support state demonstration projects that \nprovide partial or full wage replacement to new parents who take time \noff from work for the birth or adoption of a child. States could also \nchoose to expand these benefits to support other care giving needs, \nsuch as taking time to care for an ill parent, spouse or child, or to \nsupport parents who choose to stay home with an infant.\n  These would be state or community-based projects, entirely \nvoluntary--in no way mandated by federal law. Clearly, there is already \nmuch going on in this area. Thousands of employers offer their \nemployees and their families paid leave. There are private insurance \nsystems that cover wages in various circumstances including the birth \nof a new child. There are state and local dollars that supplement the \nincomes of new families as well as protect families at other times of \neconomic crisis. These federal dollars would leverage these state, \nprivate and other dollars to expand access to paid leave to more \nparents.\n  The demonstrations funded will form the basis of a large-scale \ninvestigation of the most effective way to provide support to families \nat these critical times in a family's life. Key questions to be \nanswered include the costs of these projects, the reach and the impact \non families and children. The demonstrations will also allow \ncomparisons of different mechanisms to provide leave--including \nexpansion of state unemployment insurance systems, temporary disability \nprograms, and other viable mechanisms.\n  Mr. President, when a person is injured on the job, or when someone \nloses their job because of a plant closing or some other factor beyond \ntheir control, our nation rightly protects their families from the risk \nof catastrophic financial loss. That's the purpose of workman's \ncompensation and unemployment insurance.\n  If we can protect families at times like this, shouldn't we protect \nthem at another time of crucial family need as they struggle to meet \nthe joyful challenge of raising a newborn?\n  Mr. President, this initiative is just one part of a better deal we \nowe to America's families. Just as the horrible tragedy in Littleton, \nColorado was a wake up call to parents across the country, it must be a \nwake up call to us to re-examine our policies around children, families \nand parenthood.\n  There is much to be done--child care, education, expanding the basic \nprotection of the Family and Medical Leave Act to more workers, \nintelligent gun control policies, and better alternatives for our youth \nout of school. But I believe a key piece is supporting parents in the \nvery first days, weeks and months of a child's life--and hope that we \ncan work together to make sure these all important days are possible \nfor all parents.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this measure be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows.\n\n                                S. 1355\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Family Income to Respond to \n     Significant Transitions Insurance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) nearly every industrialized nation other than the \n     United States, and most developing nations, provide parents \n     with paid leave for infant care;\n       (2)(A) parents' interactions with their infants have a \n     major influence on the physical, cognitive, and social \n     development of the infants; and\n       (B) optimal development of an infant depends on a strong \n     attachment between an infant and the infant's parents;\n       (3) nearly \\2/3\\ of employees, who need to take family or \n     medical leave, but do not take the leave, report that they \n     cannot afford to take the leave;\n       (4) although some employees in the United States receive \n     wage replacement during periods of family or medical leave, \n     the benefit of wage replacement is not shared equally in the \n     workforce, as demonstrated by the fact that--\n       (A) employees with less education and lower income are less \n     likely to receive wage replacement than employees with more \n     education and higher salaries; and\n       (B) female employees, employees from racial minority \n     groups, and younger employees are slightly less likely to \n     receive wage replacement than male employees, white \n     employees, and older employees, respectively;\n       (5) in order to cope financially with taking family or \n     medical leave, of persons taking that leave without full wage \n     replacement--\n       (A) 40 percent cut their leave short;\n       (B) 39 percent put off paying bills;\n       (C) 25 percent borrowed money; and\n       (D) 9 percent obtained public assistance;\n       (6) taking family or medical leave often drives employees \n     earning low wages into poverty, and 21 percent of such low-\n     wage employees who take family or medical leave without full \n     wage replacement resort to public assistance;\n       (7) studies document shortages in the supply of infant \n     care, and that the shortages are expected to worsen as \n     welfare reform measures are implemented; and\n       (8) compared to 30 years ago, families have experienced an \n     average decrease of 22 hours per week in time that parents \n     spend with their children.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish a demonstration program that supports the \n     efforts of States and political subdivisions to provide \n     partial or full wage replacement, often referred to as FIRST \n     insurance, to new parents so that the new parents are able to \n     spend time with a new infant or newly adopted child, and to \n     other employees; and\n       (2) to learn about the most effective mechanisms for \n     providing the wage replacement assistance.\n\n     SEC. 4.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     Act $400,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 and such sums as may be \n     necessary for each subsequent fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to join as a cosponsor of \nSenator Dodd's ``Family Income to Respond to Significant Transitions'' \n(FIRST) Insurance Demonstration Project Act. From his work on the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to his countless efforts to \nimprove the quality and accessibility of child care, Senator Dodd has \nbeen a tireless advocate for families and children, and I commend his \nleadership on this important new initiation.\n  Millions of families have benefited from the Family and Medical Leave \nAct, but we must do more to support working families. Nearly two-thirds \nof employees cannot afford to take family or medical leave when a new \nchild is born or a family member becomes ill. According to a survey by \nthe National Partnership for Women and Families, 64 percent of \nAmericans believe that the time pressures on working families are \ngetting worse, not better. Two-thirds of women and men under the age of \n45 believe that they will need to take a family or medical leave in the \nnext 10 years. But, many of these families won't be able to afford it.\n  We should stop paying lip service to family values and find a way to \nhelp families afford family leave when they need it. This bill will \nprovide grants to states and local communities to experiment with \nmethods of wage replacement for workers who take family leave. States \nwill use the grants for demonstration projects implementing wage \nreplacement strategies to allow more employees to spend time with their \nfamilies when family needs require it.\n  Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, businesses with 50 or more \nemployees must provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to employees to \ncare for a newborn or newly-adopted child, or to care for a child, a \nspouse, or a parent who is ill. The Act has helped millions of workers \ncare for their families, but too many obstacles prevent too many\n\n[[Page S8378]]\n\nworkers from taking leave. Forty-one million people, nearly half the \nprivate workforce, are not protected by the law because their company \nis too small to be covered, or because they haven't worked there long \nenough to qualify for the leave.\n  Others are covered and entitled to a leave, but cannot benefit from \nthe Act because they cannot afford to take an unpaid leave of absence. \nAlthough some workers are fortunate enough to receive wage replacement \nduring periods of family or medical leave, most hard-working low-wage \nearners do not receive this benefit. Low-income employees are less \nlikely to receive wage replacement than more highly educated, well-paid \nemployees. Women, minorities, and younger employees are less likely \nthan men, white Americans, and older workers to receive wage \nreplacement benefits when taking family leave.\n  As a result, 40 percent employees without full wage replacement cut \ntheir leaves short, 39 percent put-off paying bills, 25 percent borrow \nmoney, and 9 percent turn to public assistance to cover their loss \nwages. Taking unpaid leave often drives low-wage earners into poverty. \nWorkers who need to care for an ill family member, an elderly parent, \nor a new baby should not be plunged into poverty.\n  Our bill will help families take needed leave by allowing states to \nimplement alternative funding programs. For example, states may choose \nto expand state or private Temporary Disability Insurance plans to \nprovide partial or full replacement of wages for those taking time off \nform work to care for a new child. States may also expand their \nUnemployment Insurance Compensation to make leave from work \neconomically feasible. The FIRST Act is an important step in the right \ndirection. This bill will provide states with $400 million for fiscal \nyear 2000 to fund demonstration programs, assisting states which are \nalready working to establish wage replacement leave programs.\n  I am proud that Massachusetts is moving forward to address this \nproblem. A bill to establish a Family and Employment Security Trust \nFund has already been introduced, providing family leave replacement \nthrough the unemployment insurance system. Thousands of workers in \nMassachusetts will be able to care for their families without falling \ninto poverty--including low-income employees living from paycheck to \npaycheck. Groups in Maryland, Vermont, and Washington are taking the \nlead with similar legislation.\n  We need to put families first and this bill does that. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this needed initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1356. A bill to amend the Marine Protection, Research, and \nSanctuaries Act of 1972 to clarify the limitation on the dumping of \ndredged material in Long Island Sound; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n              the long island sound protection act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwill protect the natural beauty and resources of the Long Island Sound \nfrom current dredging policies that allow large amounts of material to \nbe dumped into the estuary without stringent environmental review. The \nLong Island Sound Protection Act of 1999 would require all large \ndredging projects in the Sound to comply with sediment testing \nprovisions of the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act, \ncommonly known as the Ocean Dumping Act.\n  Under the Ocean Dumping Act, any Long Island Sound dredging project \nthat disposes of more than 25,000 tons of dredged material must undergo \ntoxicity and bioaccumulation tests before it is safe to dump. However, \nsmaller nonfederal projects need only comply with the Clean Water Act, \nwhich does not require testing. In recent years, the Army Corps of \nEngineers has begun an unfortunate practice of avoiding the more \nrigorous requirements of the Ocean Dumping Act by individually \npermitting smaller projects that are clearly a part of larger dredging \noperations. Individually permitted, these projects need only comply \nwith the Clean Water Act, even though they are dumped together in the \nLong Island Sound and have the same cumulative effect as one large \nproject would to the local ecosystem. The Long Island Sound Protection \nAct would end this practice of stacking permits and would ensure that \nat least one environmentally acceptable disposal site is designated by \nthe Environmental Protection Agency within a two-year period.\n  Dredging projects are critical to the people and businesses who rely \nextensively on the Sound to transport goods, services, and people every \nday. However, the health of the Long Island Sound ecosystem is also \nimportant to the 8 million people living within the boundaries of the \nLong Island Sound watershed, with more than $5 billion generated \nannually from boating, commercial and sport fishing, swimming, and \nbeachgoing. The Long Island Sound is also an estuary of national \nsignificance that my State, in cooperation with the Environmental \nProtection Agency, has worked diligently to restore under the 1992 Long \nIsland Sound Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan. This bill \nwould remove one of the barriers to achieving the laudable goals of \nthis Plan.\n  A clean and safe Sound is important to us all. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1356\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A. bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nenhance the portability of retirement benefits, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 the retirement account portability act\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing S. 1357, the \nRetirement Account Portability (RAP) Act. This bill is a close \ncompanion to H.R. 738, the bill introduced by Congressman Earl Pomeroy \nof North Dakota. It was also included as title III of the Pension \nCoverage and Portability Act, S. 741, introduced earlier this year by \nmyself and Senators Graham and Grassley. Generally this bill is \nintended to be a further iteration of the concepts embodied in both of \nthose bills.\n  The RAP Act standardizes the rules in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) \nwhich regulate how portable a worker's retirement savings account is, \nand while it does not make portability of pension benefits perfect, it \ngreatly improves the status quo. No employer will be ``required'' to \naccept rollovers from other plans, however. A rollover will occur when \nthe employee offers, and the employer agrees to accept, a rollover from \nanother plan.\n\n[[Page S8379]]\n\n  Under current law, it is not possible for an individual to move an \naccumulated retirement savings account from a section 401(k) (for-\nprofit) plan to a section 457 (state and local government) deferred \ncompensation plan, to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), then to a \nsection 403(b) (non-profit organization or public school) deferred \nannuity plan and ultimately back into a section 401(k) plan, without \nviolating various restrictions on the movement of their money. The RAP \nAct will make it possible for workers to take their retirement savings \nwith them when they change jobs regardless of the type of employer for \nwhich they work.\n  This bill will also help make IRAs more portable and will improve the \nuse of conduit IRAs. Conduit IRAs are individual retirement accounts to \nwhich certain distributions from a qualified retirement plan or from \nanother individual retirement account have been transferred. RAP \nchanges the rules regulating these IRAs so that workers leaving the \nfor-profit, non-profit or governmental field can use a conduit IRA as a \nparking spot for a pre-retirement distribution. These special accounts \nare needed by many workers until they have another employer-sponsored \nplan in which to rollover their savings.\n  In many instances, this bill will allow an individual to rollover an \nIRA consisting exclusively of tax-deductible contributions into a \nretirement plan at his or her new place of employment, thus helping the \nindividual consolidate retirement savings in a single account. Under \ncertain circumstances, the RAP Act will also allow workers to rollover \nany after-tax contributions made at his or her previous workplace, into \na new retirement plan. Under the provisions of the bill as drafted, \nafter-tax contributions will be rollable from a plan to an IRA and from \nan IRA to an IRA, but not from a IRA to a plan, nor on a direct plan to \nplan basis. I am open to recommendations on how we can improve the \ntreatment of after-tax rollovers and I look forward to hearing from my \ncolleagues and the public on that topic.\n  Current law requires a worker who changes jobs to face a deadline of \n60 days within which to roll over any retirement savings benefits \neither into an Individual Retirement Account, or into the retirement \nplan of his or her new employer. Failure to meet the deadline can \nresult in both income and excise taxes being imposed on the account. We \nbelieve that this deadline should be waived under certain circumstances \nand we have outlined them in the bill. Consistent with the Pomeroy \nbill, in case of a Presidentially-declared natural disaster or military \nservice in a combat zone, the Treasury Department will have the \nauthority to disallow imposition of any tax penalty for the account \nholder. Consistent with the additional changes incorporated by \nCongressman Pomeroy this year, however, we have included a waiver of \ntax penalties in the case of undue hardship, such as a serious personal \ninjury or illness and we have given the Department of the Treasury the \nauthority to waive the deadline.\n\n  The Retirement Account Portability Act will also change two \ncomplicated rules which harm both plan sponsors and plan participants; \none dealing with certain business sales (the so-called ``same desk'' \nrule) and the other dealing with retirement plan distribution options. \nEach of these rules has impeded true portability of pensions and we \nbelieve they ought to be changed.\n  In addition, this bill will extend the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation's (PBGC) Missing Participant program to defined benefit \nmultiemployer pension plans. Under current law, the PBGC has \njurisdiction over both single-employer and multiemployer defined \nbenefit pension plans. A few years ago, the agency initiated a program \nto locate missing participants from terminated, single-employer plans. \nThe program attempts to locate individuals who are due a benefit, but \nwho have not filed for benefits owed to them, or who have attempted to \nfind their former employer but failed to receive their benefits. This \nbill expands the missing participant program to multiemployer pension \nplans.\n  I know of no reason why individuals covered by a multiemployer \npension plans should not have the same protections as participants of \nsingle-employer pension plans and this change will help more former \nemployees receive all the benefits to which they are entitled. This \nbill does not expand the missing participants program to defined \ncontribution plans. Supervision of defined contribution plans is \noutside the statutory jurisdiction of the PBGC and I have not heard \nstrong arguments for including those plans within the jurisdiction of \nthe agency. I would be pleased to hear the recommendations of any of my \ncolleagues on this matter.\n  In a particularly important provision, the Retirement Account \nPortability bill will allow public school teachers and other state and \nlocal employees who move between different states and localities to use \ntheir savings in their section 403(b) plan or section 457 deferred \ncompensation arrangement to purchase ``service credit'' in the defined \nbenefit plan in which they are currently participating, and thus obtain \ngreater pension benefits in the plan in which they conclude their \ncareer.\n  As a final note, this bill, this bill does not reduce the vesting \nschedule from the current five year cliff vesting (or seven year \ngraded) to a three year cliff or six year graded vesting schedule that \nhas been contained in other bills. I support the shorter vesting \nschedules, but I feel that the abbreviated schedule makes a dramatic \nchange to tax law without removing some of the disincentives to \nmaintaining a pension plan that businesses--especially small \nbusinesses--desperately need. More discussion of this matter is needed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1357\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Preserving \nAccess to Care in the Home Act of 1999, also known as the PATCH Act. \nThis important bill has been crafted to protect access to care for \nthose most in need, relieve the cash flow problems faced by agencies, \nand improve the interaction between home health agencies and HCFA. I \nwant to recognize Senator Reed, Senator Enzi, and Senator Leahy. These \ncosponsors have shown tremendous effort and dedication in dealing with \nthe crisis in home health care.\n  Abraham Lincoln said ``The legitimate object of government is to do \nfor a community of people, whatever they need to have done, but cannot \ndo at all, or cannot so well do for themselves, in their separate and \nindividual capacities.'' This is the essence of home health care.\n  Home health care means so much to so many people: it means that \npeople recovering from surgery can go home sooner--it means that \nsomeone recovering from an accident can get physical therapy in their \nhome, it means our seniors can stay at home, and out of nursing homes. \nIt is smart policy from human and financial standpoints.\n  My own State of Vermont is a model for providing high-quality, \ncomprehensive care with a low price tag. For the past eight years, the \naverage Medicare expenditure for home health care in Vermont has been \nthe lowest in the nation. Vermont's home care system was designed to \nefficiently meet the needs of frail and elderly citizens in our largely \nrural State, but the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) \nreimbursement system was not. HCFA's interim payment system (IPS) has \nbeen implemented in a manner that inadequately reimburses agencies for \nthe care that they provide.\n  The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) did a lot of good, providing health \ncare coverage for millions of low income children, providing targeted \ntax relief for families and students, tax incentives to encourage \npensions savings, and extending the life of Medicare. However, as with \nmost things in life, it was not perfect.\n  The BBA failed to recognize how the new home health reimbursement \nwould affect small rural home health care providers. The IPS has caused \nsuch significant cash flow problems, that many agencies are struggling \nto meet their payroll needs. Home health care agencies are now facing \nthe prospect of 15 percent budget cut next year. This budget cut, on \ntop of already stretched budgets, would be disastrous for providers and \npatients alike.\n  The PATCH Act will rectify these problems.\n\n[[Page S8383]]\n\n  First, the PATCH Act eliminates the 15-percent cut scheduled for next \nyear. The actual savings under IPS have exceeded initial expectations, \nso the 15-percent cut is unnecessary to achieve the savings originally \nprojected as needed.\n  Second, the PATCH Act clarifies the definition of ``homebound'' so \nthat coverage decisions are based on the condition of the individual \nand not on an arbitrary number of absences from the home. Many seniors \nhave found themselves virtual prisoners in their homes, threatened with \nloss of coverage if they attend adult day care, weekly religious \nservices, or even visit family members in the hospital. This makes no \nsense because all of these activities are steps on the road to \nsuccessful and healthy recovery. Often, home care professionals want \npatients to get outside a little bit, as part of their care plan. This \nhelps fight off depression. Eligibility for home care should depend on \nthe health of the patient.\n  Third, the PATCH Act creates an ``outlier'' provision so that \nmedically complex patients suffering from multiple ailments are not \nexcluded by the Medicare program. Agencies will receive reimbursements \nfor reasonable costs so that they can continue to provide care for \nthese complex patients without going bankrupt. Home health agencies can \nprovide care to long-term chronic care patients at a lower cost than \nnursing homes, or hospitals.\n  Next, the PATCH Act also matches the rate of review to the rate of \ndenial and provides a reward to agencies for ``good behavior'' and \nincentive to submit ``good claims.'' Conducting high cost, intense \naudits on all agencies, regardless of the past efficiency of the \nagency, is expensive and unproductive. Many agencies are finding \nthemselves swamped by pre-payment reviews for claims that they submit. \nThese reviews require that health professionals spend a substantial \namount of their time filling out forms instead of providing urgently \nneeded care to the elderly. Matching the rate of review to the rate of \ndenial adds to the efficiency of home health agencies, and the \nefficiency of the regulatory. If the finalized denial rate of claims \nfor a home health agency is less than 5 percent then (a) there will be \nno prepayment reviews, and (b) the post-payment review shall not exceed \n10 percent of the claims.\n  Finally, the bill restores the periodic interim payment system (PIP) \nand provides guidelines to HCFA on the development of a prospective \npayment system (PPS) that will be fair to Vermont's low-cost, rural \nproviders.\n  The sooner you can return patients to their homes, the sooner they \ncan recover. The familiar environment of the home, family, and friends \nis more nurturing to recovering patients than the often stressful and \nunfamiliar surroundings of a hospital. Home health allows them to \nreceive treatment for their medical conditions while being integrated \nback into independence. Home health is also a great avenue for \neducation. It empowers families to assist in the care of their loved \nones. This, too, results in lower costs because family members, in \naddition to health professionals, provide some of the care. Access to \ncare in the home must be saved.\n  I look forward to turning this legislation into law. The women and \nmen who provide home care are on the front line every day and deserve \nnothing but our best efforts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 1359. A bill to amend chapter 51 of title 49, United States Code, \nto extend the coverage of the rules governing the transportation of \nhazardous materials, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n       POSTAL HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to insure the \nsafe transportation of hazardous materials (hazmat) via the United \nStates Postal Service and its contract carriers.\n  The Hazardous Materials Transportation Safety Improvement Act of \n1990, P.L. 103-311, specifically exempted the U.S. Postal Service from \nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) hazmat enforcement. Although they \nare exempt from DOT hazmat enforcement, the U.S. Postal Service self-\ngoverns hazardous materials transportation through internal regulations \nand inspections.\n  The National Transportation Safety Board has made numerous \nrecommendations over the years to subject the U.S. Postal Service to \nDOT inspections and increased enforcement efforts. In addition, they \nhave also recommended that the Postal Service be subject to enforcement \nobligations similar to those observed by other package and express mail \noperations. Due to the fact that only a small percentage of mail is \ntransported exclusively by the U.S. Postal Service and most of it is \ncontracted out to other carriers, it makes sense that all mail and \npackage transporters be subject to the same DOT regulations and \ninspections.\n  We all remember the horrifying crash of ValuJet Airlines, flight 592, \ninto the Everglades in May of 1996. Although the cause of the ValuJet \naccident was not attributed to the U.S. Postal Service, the situation \nin which it occurred demonstrated the importance of accurate labeling \nin the transportation of hazardous materials. Following the ValuJet \naccident, the NTSB made multiple recommendations to the U.S. Postal \nService about increased safety in the transport of hazmat. However, in \nthe year following the ValuJet incident there were thirteen additional \nhazardous materials incidents that occurred when U.S. mail was \ntransported via air. There should be a better safety net for the public \nand the employees who are charged with the safe transport of the \npackages, mail and express items.\n  Similarly, the frightening success of the Unabomber throughout the \n1980's and 1990's underscores the need for tougher controls over \nhazardous materials sent via the U.S. Postal Service. Ted Kaczynski \nrepeatedly sent explosive devices in packages through the mail system \nresulting in three deaths and 29 injuries. These packages, which \nweighed on average between five and ten pounds, were never inspected \nfor hazardous contents. Largely in response to the Unabomber, the U.S. \nPostal Service implemented new requirements addressing package mail, \nhowever if a hazmat package is not identified at the source, it is \nimportant that the Department of Transportation hazmat inspectors have \nthe authority to inspect packages carried by surface and air carriers.\n  These accidents clearly demonstrate that the shipment of undeclared \nhazardous materials is a serious problem that needs more attention. \nWhile the U.S. Postal Service has worked hard to train its employees to \nrecognize hazmat shipments, much of the transportation of postal \nmaterial is done via contract carriers who are not U.S. Postal Service \nemployees. Efforts to address this issue have been hindered by the \nexclusion of DOT inspectors from regulating hazardous materials shipped \nvia the U.S. Postal Service.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the U.S. Postal Service and the DOT \nhazmat inspectors are faced with an enormous task--keeping our mail and \nour transportation systems safe. My bill would provide for increased \nauthority in hazmat inspections by authorizing DOT inspectors to work \nin tandem with U.S. Postal Inspectors. The safety of our transportation \nsystem is dependent on the safety of the cargo it is carrying--all \nhazmat packages should be adequately inspected and if found unsafe, \nthey should be treated appropriately, expeditiously and equally.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1359\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Postal Hazardous Materials \n     Safety Enhancement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. APPLICATION OF HAZMAT REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 5102(9)(B) of title 49, United \n     States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(B) for purposes of sections 5123 and 5124 of this title, \n     does not include a department, agency, or instrumentality of \n     the Government.''\n       (b) Coordination.--In carrying out the provisions of \n     chapter 51 of title 49, United States Code, the Secretary of \n     Transportation shall consult with the Postmaster General in \n     order to coordinate, to the greatest extent feasible, the \n     enforcement of that chapter.\n\n[[Page S8384]]\n\n     SEC. 3 TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS VIA THE UNITED \n                   STATES MAIL.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 5102 of title 49, United States \n     Code, is amended by--\n       (1) redesignating paragraph (13) as paragraph (14); and\n       (2) inserting after paragraph (12) the following:\n       ``(13) `transportation of hazardous material in commerce' \n     and `transporting hazardous material in commerce' include the \n     transportation of hazardous material in the United States \n     mail.''.\n       (b) Repeal of Exception.--Section 5126(b) of such title is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(b) Nonapplication.--This chapter does not apply to a \n     pipeline subject to regulation under chapter 601 of this \n     title.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 1360. A bill to preserve the effectiveness of Secret Service \nprotection by establishing a protective function privilege, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            SECRET SERVICE PROTECTION PRIVILEGE ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Secret \nService Protective Privilege Act of 1999. This legislation is intended \nto ensure the ability of the United States Secret Service to fulfill \nits vital mission of protecting the life and safety of the President \nand other important persons.\n\n  Almost five months have passed since the impeachment proceedings \nagainst President Clinton were concluded, and the time has come for \nCongress to repair some of the damage that was done during that \ndivisive episode. I refer to the misguided efforts of Independent \nCounsel Kenneth Starr to compel Secret Service agents to answer \nquestions about what may have observed or overheard while protecting \nthe life of the President.\n  Few national interests are more compelling than protecting the life \nof the President of the United States. The Supreme Court has said that \nthe nation has ``an overwhelming interest in protecting the safety of \nits Chief Executive and in allowing him to perform his duties without \ninterference from threats of physical violence.'' [Watts v. United \nStates, 394 U.S. 705, 707 (1969).] What's at stake is not merely the \nsafety of one person. What's at stake is the ability of the Executive \nBranch to function in an effective and orderly fashion, and the \ncapacity of the United States to respond to threats and crises. Think \nof the shock waves that rocked the world in November 1963 when \nPresident Kennedy was assassinated. The assassination of a President \nhas international repercussions and threatens the security and future \nof the entire nation.\n  The threat to our national security and to our democracy extends \nbeyond the life of the President to those in direct line of the Office \nof the President--the Vice President, the President-elect, and the Vice \nPresident elect. By Act of Congress, these officials are required to \naccept the protection of the Secret Service--they may not turn it down. \nThis statutory mandate reflects the critical importance that Congress \nhas attached to the physical safety of these officials.\n  Congress has also charged the Secret Service with responsibility for \nprotecting visiting heads of foreign states and foreign governments. \nThe assassination of a foreign head of state on American soil could be \ncatastrophic from a foreign relations standpoint and could seriously \nthreaten national security.\n  The Secret Service Protective Privilege Act of 1999 would enhance the \nSecret Service's ability to protect these officials, and the nation, \nfrom the risk of assassination. It would do this by facilitating the \nrelationship of trust between these officials and their Secret Service \nprotectors that is essential to the Service's protective strategy.\n  The Service uses a ``protective envelope'' method of protection. \nAgents and officers surround the protectee with an all-encompassing \nzone of protection on a 24-hour-a-day basis. In the face of danger, \nthey will shield the protectee's body with their own bodies and move \nhim to a secure location.\n  That is how the Secret Service averted a national tragedy on March \n30, 1981, when John Hinckley attempted to assassinate President Reagan. \nWithin seconds of the first shot being fired, Secret Service personnel \nhad shielded the President's body and maneuvered him into the waiting \nlimousine. One agent in particular, Agent Tim McCarthy, positioned his \nbody to intercept a bullet intended for the President. If Agent \nMcCarthy had been even a few feet farther from the President, history \nmight have gone very differently.\n  For the Secret Service to maintain this sort of close, unremitting \nproximity to the President and other protectees, it must have their \ncomplete, unhesitating trust and confidence. Secret Service personnel \nmust be able to remain at the President's side even during confidential \nand sensitive conversations, when they may overhear military secrets, \ndiplomatic exchanges, and family and private matters. If our Presidents \ndo not have complete trust in the Secret Service personnel who protect \nthem, they could try to push away the Service's ``protective envelope'' \nor undermine it to the point where it could no longer be fully \neffective.\n  This is more than a theoretical possibility. Consider what former \nPresident Bush wrote last April, after hearing of the independent \ncounsel's efforts to compel Secret Service testimony:\n\n       The bottom line is I hope that [Secret Service] agents will \n     be exempted from testifying before the Grand Jury. What's at \n     stake here it the protection of the life of the President and \n     his family and the confidence and trust that a President must \n     have in the [Secret Service].\n       If a President feels that Secret Service agents can be \n     called to testify about what they might have seen or heard \n     then it is likely that the President will be uncomfortable \n     having the agents near by.\n       I allowed the agents to have proximity first because they \n     had my full confidence and secondly because I knew them to be \n     totally discreet and honorable. . . .\n       . . . I can assure you that had I felt they would be \n     compelled to testify as to what they had seen or heard, no \n     matter what the subject, I would not have felt comfortable \n     having them close in\n       . . . I feel very strongly that the [Secret Service] agents \n     should not be made to appear in court to discuss that which \n     they might or might not have seen or heard.\n       What's at stake here is the confidence of the President in \n     the discretion of the [Secret Service]. If that confidence \n     evaporates the agents, denied proximity, cannot properly \n     protect the President.\n\n  As President Bush's letter makes plain, requiring Secret Service \nagents to betray the confidence of the people whose lives they protect \ncould seriously jeopardize the ability of the Service to perform its \ncrucial national security function.\n  The possibility that Secret Service personnel might be compelled to \ntestify about their protectees could have a particularly devastating \naffect on the Service's ability to protect foreign dignitaries. The \nmere fact that this issue has surfaced is likely to make foreign \ngovernments less willing to accommodate Secret Service both with \nrespect to the protection of the President and Vice President on \nforeign trips, and the protection of foreign heads of state traveling \nin the United States.\n  The recent court decisions, which refused to recognize a protective \nfunction privilege, could have a devastating impact upon the Secret \nService's ability to provide effective protection. The courts ignored \nthe voices of experience--former Presidents, Secret Service Directors, \nand others--who warned of the potentially deadly consequences. The \ncourts disregarded the lessons of history. We cannot afford to be so \ncavalier; the stakes are just too high.\n  The security of our chief executive officers and visiting foreign \nheads of state is a matter that transcends all partisan politics. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation and ask unanimous \nconsent that the bill and a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1360\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Secret Service Protective \n     Privilege Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The physical safety of the Nation's top elected \n     officials is a public good of transcendent importance.\n       (2) By virtue of the critical importance of the Office of \n     the President, the President and those in direct line of the \n     Presidency are subject to unique and mortal jeopardy--\n     jeopardy that in turn threatens profound disruption to our \n     system of representative government and to the security and \n     future of the Nation.\n\n[[Page S8385]]\n\n       (3) The physical safety of visiting heads of foreign states \n     and foreign governments is also a matter of paramount \n     importance. The assassination of such a person while on \n     American soil could have calamitous consequences for our \n     foreign relations and national security.\n       (4) Given these grave concerns, Congress has provided for \n     the Secret Service to protect the President and those in \n     direct line of the Presidency, and has directed that these \n     officials may not waive such protection. Congress has also \n     provided for the Secret Service to protect visiting heads of \n     foreign states and foreign governments.\n       (5) The protective strategy of the Secret Service depends \n     critically on the ability of its personnel to maintain close \n     and unremitting physical proximity to the protectee.\n       (6) Secret Service personnel must remain at the side of the \n     protectee on occasions of confidential conversations and, as \n     a result, may overhear top secret discussions, diplomatic \n     exchanges, sensitive conversations, and matters of personal \n     privacy.\n       (7) The necessary level of proximity can be maintained only \n     in an atmosphere of complete trust and confidence between the \n     protectee and his or her protectors.\n       (8) If a protectee has reason to doubt the confidentiality \n     of actions or conversations taken in sight or hearing of \n     Secret Service personnel, the protectee may seek to push the \n     protective envelope away or undermine it to the point at \n     which it could no longer be fully effective.\n       (9) The possibility that Secret Service personnel might be \n     compelled to testify against their protectees could induce \n     foreign nations to refuse Secret Service protection in future \n     state visits, making it impossible for the Secret Service to \n     fulfill its important statutory mission of protecting the \n     life and safety of foreign dignitaries.\n       (10) A privilege protecting information acquired by Secret \n     Service personnel while performing their protective function \n     in physical proximity to a protectee will preserve the \n     security of the protectee by lessening the incentive of the \n     protectee to distance Secret Service personnel in situations \n     in which there is some risk to the safety of the protectee.\n       (11) Recognition of a protective function privilege for the \n     President and those in direct line of the Presidency, and for \n     visiting heads of foreign states and foreign governments, \n     will promote sufficiently important interests to outweigh the \n     need for probative evidence.\n       (12) Because Secret Service personnel retain law \n     enforcement responsibility even while engaged in their \n     protective function, the privilege must be subject to a \n     crime/treason exception.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to facilitate the relationship of trust and confidence \n     between Secret Service personnel and certain protected \n     officials that is essential to the ability of the Secret \n     Service to protect these officials, and the Nation, from the \n     risk of assassination; and\n       (2) to ensure that Secret Service personnel are not \n     precluded from testifying in a criminal investigation or \n     prosecution about unlawful activity committed within their \n     view or hearing.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The \nprivilege operates only with respect to the President, the Vice \nPresident (or other officer next in the order of succession to the \nOffice of President), the President-elect, the Vice President-elect, \nand visiting heads of foreign states or foreign governments.\n  Subsection (c) creates a crime-fraud exception to the privilege, \nwhich applies with respect to information that, at the time it was \nacquired by Secret Service personnel, was sufficient to provide \nreasonable grounds to believe that a crime had been, was being, or \nwould be committed. This subsection also provides that the privilege \nmay be waived by a protectee or by his or her legal representative.\n  Subsection (d) provides that the proximity of Secret Service \npersonnel to a protectee shall not, by itself, defeat an otherwise \nvalid claim of privilege. This addresses the situation in which Secret \nService personnel overhear confidential communications between the \nprotectee and, say, the protectee's spouse or attorney.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, (Mr. Inouye, Mr. Lott, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 1361. A bill to amend the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 \nto provide for an expanded Federal program of hazard mitigation, \nrelief, and insurance against the risk of catastrophic natural \ndisasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n         natural disaster protection and insurance act of 1999\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Natural \nDisaster Protection and Insurance Act of 1999. This bill will provide \nthe Nation with a way of dealing with major national disasters. As many \nof my colleagues are aware I have maintained an interest in this area \nfor some time. Over the last decade we have witnessed natural disasters \nand the devastating effect that they can have on our property, economy \nand quality of life.\n  Damages from Hurricane Andrew resulted in the insolvency of insurance \ncompanies and a lack of confidence within the industry to deal with \nsimilar catastrophes in the future. Major hurricane risk is increasing. \nSome scientists predict that the next decade will bring more favorable \nconditions for a major hurricane hitting the U.S. than existed in the \nperiod leading up the Hurricane Andrew.\n  Over half of the population of the United States resides within the \ncoastal zone (approximately 300 km centered at the coastline). \nInfrastructure and population along our coast is growing rapidly and so \nour vulnerability to hurricanes is increasing dramatically.\n  My Home State of Alaska has had at least nine major earthquakes of \n7.4 magnitude or more on the Richter scale. Alaska's 1964 Good Friday \nEarthquake was one of the world's most powerful, registering, a \nmagnitude of 9.2 on the Richter scale.\n  The Alaska quake of 1964 destroyed the economic basis of entire \ncommunities. Whole fishing fleets, harbors,\n\n[[Page S8386]]\n\nand canneries were lost. The shaking caused tidal waves. Petroleum \nstorage tanks ruptured and the contents caught fire. Burning oil ran \ninto the bay and was carried to the waterfront by large waves. These \nwaves of fire destroyed docks, piers, and small-boat harbors. Total \nproperty damage was $311 million in 1964 dollars. Experts predict that \na quake this size in the lower 48 would kill thousands and cost up to \n$200 billion.\n  According to Michael J. Armstrong, associate director, mitigation \ndirectorate of the Federal Emergency Management Agency:\n\n       Earthquakes represent the largest single potential for \n     casualties and damage from a natural hazard facing this \n     country. They represent a national threat, as all but seven \n     States in the U.S. are at some level of risk.\n       In our most recent earthquake disaster, Northridge, (CA), a \n     moderate earthquake centered on the fringe of a major \n     metropolitan area caused an estimated $40 billion in damage. \n     A large magnitude earthquake located under one of several \n     urban regions in the United States could cause thousands of \n     casualties and losses approaching $200 billion.\n       Accordingly, reducing earthquake losses is a matter of \n     national concern--recent findings show a significantly \n     increased potential for damaging earthquake in southern \n     California, and in northern California on the Hayward Fault. \n     Studies also show higher potential earthquakes for the \n     Pacific Northwest and Coastal South Carolina. This is in \n     addition to areas of earthquake risk that have already been \n     identified, such as the New Madrid Fault Zone in the Central \n     U.S. and Wasatch Front in Utah.\n\n  Before 1989, the United States had never experienced a disaster \ncosting more than $1 billion in insured losses. Since then, we have had \nnine disasters that have cost more than $1 billion.\n  Today, Senators Inouye, Lott, Bob Graham, Feinstein, Akaka, and I \nintroduce this bill to reduce the cost to the Federal Government of \nearthquakes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters.\n  First, the bill will reduce Federal costs by expanding the use and \navailability of private insurance.\n  Second, the bill will provide incentives to improve State disaster \nstrategic planning.\n  And, third, the bill will create a national, privately funded \ncatastrophic insurance pool to shoulder the risk of very large \ndisasters.\n  Mr. President, the more private insurance individuals buy, the less \ndisaster relief Federal taxpayers must pay. For instance, if this bill \nhad been in place before Hurricane Andrew and California's Northridge \nEarthquake, I am advised that it could have reduced Federal costs by at \nleast $5 billion.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and the cosponsors in supporting this \nbill. Because major natural catastrophes are increasingly common and \ncostly for U.S. citizens, we must be willing to make a commitment now \nto prepare for these future events in advance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to join the distinguished chairman \nand Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Committee in \nintroducing legislation that creates a federal complement to efforts of \nstate governments, local communities, and the private sector to make \nfuture disasters cost less.\n  Mr. President, I am a life-long Floridian. When children grow up in \nFlorida they learn, usually from first hand experience, to expect \ndevastating storm activity in their communities. Hurricane Season is an \nannual event. Florida suffers from often violent summer storms, \ntornadoes, and wildfires. With all of this natural disaster activity in \nmy state alone, you can image that the costs of paying for the damages \nincurred by these events is quite staggering. These costs require the \nimmediate action of Congress.\n  In August of 1992, Hurricane Andrew roared ashore in the middle of \nthe night and devastated much of South Florida. The total costs of \ncleanup and rebuilding from Hurricane Andrew was $36 billion. This \nincludes nearly $16 billion in total insured loses, of which $12 \nbillion were homeowner policies. After Andrew 10 private insurance \ncompanies in the State of Florida were rendered insolvent and had to \nleave the state. Nearly 960,000 insurance policies were canceled or not \nrenewed.\n  There may be more Hurricane Andrew's in our future. The National \nWeather Service has predicted 1999 will be an extremely active \nhurricane season. They have estimated that up to 14 named storms will \ndevelop in the Atlantic Ocean, 10 of those are expected to become \nhurricanes.\n  The rising costs associated with events such as Hurricane Andrew have \nalso demonstrated that insurers face the risk of insolvency if they are \noverly concentrated in vulnerable regions of our country. Since 1992, \ninsurers have widely avoided writing policies in disaster prone areas \nof Florida. A congressional report on this subject revealed that the \ntotal supply of available reinsurance is approximately $7 billion. This \nis only 10 percent of the potential loss which might occur from a worst \ncase natural disaster scenario.\n  Companies that provide insurance of last resort have entered \ndisaster-vulnerable insurance markets and filled this vacuum. \nGenerally, these products of last resort provide less coverage than a \ncommercial property insurance policy, but at much greater price. In \nFlorida, such a policy averages in excess of 500 percent as compared to \na commercial policy.\n  State Insurance Commissions and state legislatures have literally \ncreated rainy day funds in an attempt to prevent an insurance \navailability crisis. This includes: Florida Catastrophe Reinsurance \nFund, the California Earthquake Authority, and the Hawaii Hurricane \nRelief Fund. In my State of Florida, we have also created programs to \nprovide insurance for those who cannot purchase insurance from any \nprivate source because of the risk involved including the Florida Joint \nUnderwriters Associations, and the expansion of the Florida Windstorm \nUnderwriters Association.\n  Our recent experience tells us that it is time for Congress to help \nreverse the rising costs of natural disasters. The Natural Disaster \nProtection and Insurance Act of 1999 is a step in the right direction. \nThis legislation directs the Secretary of the Treasury to carry out a \nprogram to make reinsurance available for purchase by eligible state \nprograms, private insurers and reinsurers by way of auctions. It \nprovides a backstop for state-operated insurance programs, and \ncomplements existing insurance industry efforts without encroaching \nupon the private sector.\n  This initiative appropriately allows state and industry leaders to \nassist in addressing local needs. Specifically,\n  Contractural coverage would include residential property losses \nresulting from disasters.\n  The Treasury Department would be prohibited from offering any \ncoverage that competes with or replaces private insurers.\n  A portion of the premiums would go to a mitigation fund to support \nstate level emergency preparedness.\n  This initiative is a bipartisan and bicameral effort. My Florida \ncolleague, Congressman Bill McCollum, has joined Representative Lazio \nto lead this effort in the House of Representatives. We have been \nworking closely with the Administration, affected state and local level \norganizations, and private realtors and insurers. We all agree that the \ninsurance industry cannot endure the ravage of large scale natural \ndisasters alone. Action at the federal level is needed to continue \ninsuring individual homeowners and business in areas vulnerable to \ncatastrophe.\n  Mr. President, we have an opportunity today to continue the working \npartnership between the federal government, states, local communities \nand the private sector. The consequences of insurance shortages and \nexposure to known hazards must be addressed immediately. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this initiative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url":

Mr. President, I rise to commend John Sexton, \nDean of New York University Law School, for his many years of hard work \nand dedication to the Law School, the residents of New York State, and \nto the improvement of legal education for all Americans. Since 1988, \nwhen Sexton became Dean, NYU Law School has become one of America's \nfinest law schools. Dean Sexton should be recognized for his efforts. I \nask that the text of ``John Sexton Seizing the Mile'' by Stephen \nEnglund be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  The text follows:\n\n                   [From Lifestyles, Pre-Spring 1999]\n\n                      John Sexton Seizing the Mile\n\n                          (By Stephen Englund)\n\n       In the late spring of 1997, veteran reporter James Traub \n     asked, in a headline to a New York Times Magazine feature \n     article, ``Is NYU's law school challenging Harvard's as the \n     nation's best?'' It was a fair question. NYU Law had come a \n     long way in a short time. A law school that had been little \n     more than a commuter school at the end of World War II was, \n     by 1997, considered by anyone familiar with current \n     developments in legal education to be, as one professor said, \n     ``one of the five or six law schools that could plausibly \n     claim to be among the top three in the country.'' \n     Distinguished academics like Harvard's Laurence Tribe and \n     Arthur Miller had placed NYU (with their own school and with \n     Yale, Stanford and Chicago) in that group. As Tribe put it: \n     ``The array of faculty that has moved to NYU over the last \n     decade or so has created a level of scholarship and \n     intellectual distinction and range that is extremely \n     impressive.''\n       In 1997, the notion that NYU's School of Law might be the \n     best was certainly provocative. But 18 months later, after an \n     astonishing (indeed unprecedented) day-long forum at the \n     school titled ``Strengthening Democracy in the Global \n     Economy''--a meeting that brought to Washington Square \n     President Clinton, Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, \n     Italy's President Romano Prodi and Bulgaria's President Peter \n     Stoyanov, as well as First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and a \n     supporting cast of respected intellectuals and other \n     leaders--many people are answering Traub's question with a \n     resounding ``Yes!''\n       Indeed, the rise of NYU over the past few years has been \n     one of the most noted advances on the academic scene--with a \n     growing number of those both in the academy and at the bar \n     offering the view that NYU has become the nation's premier \n     site for legal education. For instance, Michael Ryan, senior \n     partner at New York's oldest law firm, Cadwalader, \n     Wickersham, and Taft--himself a Harvard Law School graduate--\n     told me: ``NYU is a more exciting and innovative place that \n     any other law school. The place combines the energy, vitality \n     and diversity like that of the Lexington Avenue subway with \n     the cohesiveness and spirit. The school's innovative global \n     initiative is alone worth the price of admission. If I were a \n     student, I'd choose it over any other school.'' Chief Judge \n     Harry Edwards of the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia Circuit, viewed by many as the nation's \n     second most important court, said virtually the same thing: \n     NYU is absolutely the place to be these days. I hear more \n     comments about the quality, excitement, and originality of \n     what's going on there than I do about any other law school.'' \n     As did Pasquale Pasquino, one of Europe's foremost political \n     theorists, who is teaching at the law school this year'' \n     ``NYU surely has the most prominent, the most productive and \n     the most interesting faculty. Its programs raise some of \n     the most interesting questions raised in any law school.'' \n     And when I spoke with Dwight Opperman, who for decades was \n     the leader of West Publishing, the world's largest \n     publisher of law books, he volunteered: ``NYU surpasses \n     Harvard in many areas.''\n       Frankly, when I first read Traub's article, and even more \n     when I began to hear views like those of Ryan, Edwards, \n     Pasquino and Opperman, I was more than a little bit \n     surprised. How was it that NYU had come to be seen as \n     seriously challenging--or even surpassing--``name brand'' \n     schools like Harvard, Yale, Chicago and Stanford? And how had \n     it happened so quickly? As a former academic, I know that the \n     academy is one of the least variable theaters on the world \n     stage. Far more than in other realms, reputations of \n     colleges, universities and professional schools are improved, \n     if at all at a glacial creep, though they may decline \n     precipitously. Little wonder, then, that NYU's rise to the \n     top of legal education continues to be the topic of so much \n     discussion.\n       What does explain NYU's ascendancy? Well, one key element \n     is surely the astonishing migration of academic stars from \n     other leading law schools to Washington Square. In academe, \n     it is big news when an established professor at a leading \n     school makes a ``lateral move'' to a peer institution--even \n     more so when the professor leaves a distinguished chaired \n     professorship in making the move. In legal education, such \n     moves have been relatively rare, in part because law \n     faculties are small (the largest in the country has only 70 \n     to 80 members). Yet over the last 10 years, there has been an \n     unprecedented migration to NYU from schools like Chicago, \n     Harvard, Michigan Pennsylvania, Stanford, Virginia, and Yale, \n     and NYU can now boast the most distinguished set or \n     ``laterals'' of any law school.\n       Another element is its student body. For decades, NYU has \n     drawn strong students, but today the school attracts many of \n     the very best in the country. Today, by any objective \n     criteria-grade point averages, LSAT scores, the number of \n     graduate academic degrees earned, the languages spoken-NYU's \n     student body is among the three of four most selective in the \n     nation.\n       And then, too, there is NYU's remarkable record in \n     providing those students, as they graduate, with the most \n     coveted legal jobs. NYU's graduates long have dominated the \n     public service bar, but the dramatic development of the past \n     decade is that NYU has edged ahead of Harvard in providing \n     the greatest number of hires by the American Lawyer's 50 \n     leading law firms.\n       The school's arrival at the top has been ratified in \n     perhaps the most brutal arena of them all: fund-raising. In \n     December 1998, NYU Law completed an extraordinary successful \n     five-year fund-raising campaign. Under the leadership of \n     Martin Payson ('61), the campaign's chairman; Board Chair \n     Martin Lipton ('55); and Vice-Chair Lester Pollack ('57), the \n     campaign has generated 45 gifts in excess of $1 million. \n     Eight have been in excess of $5 million, including gifts from \n     Alfred ('65) and Gail Engelberg, Jay ('71) and Gail Furman, \n     Rita ('59) and Gustave Hauser, LL.M. ('57), Jerome Kern ('60) \n     Dwight Opperman, Ingeborg and Ira Rennert, and the Wachtell, \n     Lipton, Rosen & Katz law firm. It took NYU just three years \n     to reach its original five-year goal of $125 million, and it \n     easily surpassed its revised goal of $175 million. Only Yale \n     and Harvard law schools join NYU at this level.\n       Once I discovered these facts, the startling idea that NYU \n     Law School may be the best in the country--perhaps in the \n     world--began to grow on me. And I also realized that this \n     transformation was a riveting tale of ``from there to \n     here''--one of the most remarkable in education history. Here \n     it is in a nutshell.\n\n[[Page S8397]]\n\n                        A Historical Perspective\n\n       Fade in. Scene One. It is 1942. Arthur T. Vanderbilt \n     becomes dean of NYU Law School. Though already more than a \n     century old (it was founded in 1835) and boasting graduates \n     like Samuel J. Tilden, Elihu Root and Jacob Javits, NYU is \n     not an impressive place. Its facilities are limited to two \n     floor of an antiquated factory building in Greenwich Village. \n     It is a ``commuter school,'' drawing its students from the \n     New York metropolitan area. Justice Felix Frankfurter, in his \n     biography, described it as one of the worst schools in the \n     country.\n       But the visionary Vanderbilt sees the potential oak lurking \n     within the acorn. He sees NYU as a national and international \n     ``center of the law.'' Many in the upper reaches of the \n     university see his dream as ``Vanderbilt's folly,'' but the \n     determined Vanderbilt, dedicated to the dream, presses on.\n       First, he begins to exploit the school's unique asset: its \n     Greenwich Village location in the legal, financial, cultural \n     and intellectual hub of the world, New York City. \n     Methodically, he plans for an expansion of the school's \n     physical plant. Soon he opens an attractive new classroom \n     building that the law school can call its own, and he follows \n     three years later, in 1955, with the school's first residence \n     hall.\n       Along the way, seeking to raise much-needed cash, the \n     dean's natural financial savvy intersects with luck, when he \n     purchases the C.F. Mueller Macaroni Company for the law \n     school. The company generates profits each year and gives the \n     school lasting security, for when the Mueller Company is sold \n     in 1977, it is worth more than 20 times the school's original \n     investment. Even after providing $40 million to the then-\n     financially pressed university, the law school realizes a \n     gain of nearly $80 million. And, in return for having shared \n     its profits with the university, the law school is granted a \n     degree of autonomy unprecedented in education. It will \n     henceforth do its own planning, and its decisions will be a \n     product of its dean, its faculty and its own independent \n     Board of Trustees.\n       Vanderbilt officially resigns in 1947 to become Chief \n     Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court, but he continues to \n     play Pygmalion with the school until his death in 1957. He \n     adds significant new programs designed to give the school a \n     national reputation, he deploys a merit scholarship program \n     to attract the best students and he begins the process of \n     building a strong faculty. Still, though NYU Law School now \n     is a very good school, Vanderbilt's dream is not nearly \n     realized. Fade out.\n       Fade in Scene Two. It is the opening of the 1990 academic \n     year. We are seated in a hall at the law school, listening to \n     a distinguished leader of the faculty explain ``How NYU \n     became a Major Law School.'' The words spoken by Prof. Norman \n     Dorsen are appealing--for their modesty as well as for their \n     insight and depth. Dorsen, an eminent scholar and defender of \n     civil rights, has just retired as president of the American \n     Civil Liberties Union. Reading between the lines of his talk, \n     it is clear he is also a painfully honest man. It's not \n     difficult to sense that he is not entirely convinced that his \n     law school is altogether as eminent a place as some have \n     claimed it to be. Indeed, he tells his audience that recent \n     years have been a time of ``deceleration'' in NYU's ``steady \n     drive to the summit of American legal education, which seemed \n     inexorable a few years before.''\n       What does Dorsen mean? After all, in the quarter century \n     since Vanderbilt, the law school has added eight new \n     buildings, including two splendid residence halls and a \n     magnificent underground library--all state of the art. Its \n     student body has become more selective and much more diverse, \n     boasting students from a dozen countries. Its faculty now has \n     a core of highly regarded scholars and clinicians. Still, in \n     the previous five years, NYU has made only one addition to \n     its tenure track faculty, and two junior leading lights have \n     defected to Columbia (one of whom, David Leebron, would later \n     become Columbia's dean). There was the discomfiting prospect \n     that Columbia-- and other schools would persuade more faculty \n     members to move. This is not good, Dorsen says. It should \n     be NYU that is doing the luring and hiring. In his view, \n     the mood of contentment reigning at the law school, though \n     understandable, is potentially destructive.\n       On the positive side, Dorsen says, the school does have a \n     dynamic new dean, John Sexton. However, Sexton has been dean \n     only two years now, and it is too soon to assay his \n     potential. If Sexton succeeds in reigniting the law school's \n     ``steady drive'' to the top, says Dorsen, it will be because \n     he has managed to replenish the school's slipping endowment, \n     to stanch the incipient hemorrhage of top scholars to other \n     law schools and galvanize NYU Law with a sense of mission. \n     Dorsen allows as how ``there is ample ground to hope'' this \n     all might happen, so that ``within a few years NYU will be \n     firmly established in fact and in the consciousness of the \n     profession and the public as being among the best in the \n     nation.'' Fade out.\n       Fade in. Scene Three. It is 1994. Richard Stewart, formerly \n     a chaired professor and associate dean at Harvard Law School \n     and recently assistant attorney general for the environment, \n     is sitting in John Sexton's office at NYU. Stewart is a \n     towering figure in law, widely recognized as the nation's \n     leading scholar in environmental and administrative law. \n     Harvard wants him back. Columbia, where Stewart's former \n     Harvard colleague and co-author is dean, has launched a major \n     effort to attract him. But Sexton thinks Stewart should come \n     to Washington Square--that he should become part of what he \n     calls ``the Enterprise,'' the group of NYU faculty who are \n     devoted to making the school the world's leading center of \n     the study of law.\n       The Enterprise is committed to several principles, Sexton \n     tells Stewart. It rejects the notion, prevalent in elite \n     schools, that faculty members are ``independent contractors'' \n     teaching what they want to teach when they want to teach it, \n     and available to colleagues and students as much or as little \n     as they please. Instead, faculty in the Enterprise undertake \n     a reciprocal obligation to each other and to their students--\n     they pledge to be engaged with each other in a learning \n     community, reading drafts and being present for one another \n     in an ongoing conversation about law.\n       Sexton continues: ``The Enterprise rejects contentment in \n     favor of constant improvement and aspiration. The school \n     always should be asking: How can we become better? Members of \n     the Enterprise are willing, occasionally at least, to \n     subordinate personal interests to those of the collective. \n     They delight in having colleagues who challenge their ideas; \n     they are not afraid to be around people who are smarter than \n     they are.''\n       In making his case to Stewart, Sexton reaches back to a \n     phrase he first heard from the Jesuits: ``Most of all, the \n     Enterprise is committed to thinking constantly about the \n     ratio studiorum of the school: why do we do things the way we \n     do?'' The Enterprise, Sexton tells Stewart, is open to \n     everyone who wishes to join. It is the center of gravity of \n     NYU's faculty, and NYU's unique attraction.\n       ``Count me in, Stewart says. Fade out.\n       Fade in. Scene four. It is 1998. We are seated in another \n     auditorium on the Washington Square campus of NYU, this time \n     listening to Dr. L. Jay Oliva expatiate to NYU alumni and \n     friends about his aspirations for the university he has \n     presided over since he succeeded John Brademas in 1992. Some \n     college presidents, he observes, especially those in the \n     Midwest, strive to make their institutions as good as their \n     football team. Others want it to be as fine as the music \n     conservatory or the medical school. Here at NYU, Oliva says \n     with a smile, ``I will be satisfied when I leave office if \n     the university matches the quality and the renown of its law \n     school.'' Fade out.\n\n\n                              The New Dean\n\n       NYU Law's ascent unquestionably has been the product of \n     many factors. No. 1, just as Vanderbilt foresaw, is its \n     unique location. By the dawn of the '90's, as Professor \n     Richard Revesz notes, New York City itself was ``no longer a \n     minus'' in hiring faculty. The city had solved many of its \n     worst problems and was becoming attractive again, especially \n     to academics in two-career families (Revesz's wife, Vicki \n     Been, for instance is also professor at the law school). And \n     Greenwich Village is a particularly attractive part of the \n     city. However, to invoke ``other factors'' in accounting for \n     NYU's rise to the top of legal education while downplaying \n     the role of Dean John Sexton would be like trying to discuss \n     the right of judicial review without highlighting John \n     Marshall; it's talking ``Scopes'' while soft-pedaling Darrow. \n     It's To Kill A Mockingbird without Atticus Finch. When Norman \n     Redlich retired in 1988 and John Sexton, a member of the \n     Enterprise, was selected as his successor, the law school got \n     more than it expected. The dean calls himself ``a catalyst, \n     not the cause'' of the law school's arrival at the top, but \n     any measure and by all accounts, he is a catalyst nonpareil.\n       We owe to the ancient Greek poet Archilochus the familiar \n     observation that ``the fox knows many things, but the \n     hedgehog knows one great thing.'' John Sexton, with his round \n     cheeks, his bright eyes, and bushy hair, resembles as well as \n     personifies the hedgehog. There is about Sexton a deep \n     intelligence and a grand sense of humor, but the one ``great \n     thing'' that he knows, and knows well, is single-minded \n     devotion to a team or institution.\n       Sexton came to teach at NYU in 1981, immediately following \n     a clerkship with Chief Justice Warren Burger, and was granted \n     tenure a mere three years later. He has run NYU Law School \n     for a decade now, and recently, happily signed on for another \n     term of five years. This alone is rare. Law schools these \n     days are desperate for deans because deans are desperate to \n     leave their posts. The average tenure of an American law dean \n     is fewer than four years. In the words of Chief Judge Harry \n     Edwards: ``John is a truly visionary dean, and if that \n     statement sounds like an oxymoron, it's because no one these \n     days thinks of law deans as visionary. They aren't thought to \n     hold a job that allows them to be visionary. Even if some \n     deans might want to do something special, the drudgery of \n     running a law school, especially of holding its factions \n     together, doesn't permit it. That's why deans turn over so \n     quickly.''\n       Sexton's personality is haimish-warm and embracing, your \n     quintessential ``good guy.'' John (as he urges everyone, \n     including his students, to call him) is disarmingly self-\n     effacing, gracious, ready and eager to brag about others, to \n     share credit even for things he has largely accomplished on \n     his own. He is above all eager to elicit people's counsel and \n     ideas, to involve them in his grand project of building up \n     the law school. Despite his Harvard J.D. and his Fordham \n     Ph.D. (in religion), he is profoundly non-elitist. A\n\n[[Page S8398]]\n\n     Brooklynite who has kept (indeed cultivated) the accent, he \n     is absolutely comfortable with himself. Being around the \n     super-wealthy, the super-powerful, or the super-brilliant \n     neither fazes nor inhibits him in the least. And he's no \n     clothes-horse, either. There's often a slightly rumpled or \n     professorial air about him.\n       In short, this man is, in style and appearance, closer to a \n     New York ward heeler than, say, the cosmopolitan director of \n     the Metropolitan Museum. From his nasal Brooklynese to the \n     show-and-tell hands, from the wide-open, explosive laugh and \n     the rapid-fire banter to the sharing of jokes and stories, \n     Sexton is more like a New York mayor in the Ed Koch mold than \n     he is a white-shoe lawyer or John Houseman's Professor \n     Kingsfield in The Paper Chase. He can out--Rudin the Rudin \n     Brothers at boostering New York--he follows and knows the \n     Yankees, Knicks, Jets and Giants as few who aren't sports \n     journalists do, and he can (and will) tell you where to \n     find the best bagel in the five boroughs.\n       Among his skills is the ability to take the edge off \n     irritability or anger, to foster a sense of camaraderie among \n     the disparate group of people. And if he is no expert on \n     culture (and doesn't pretend to be), Sexton is yet \n     reminiscent of that mesmerizing czar of New York's not-for-\n     profit theater, the late Joseph Papp. For, like the founder \n     of the New York Shakespeare Festival, Sexton is a salesman, \n     par excellence, of his ``idea'' and institution. He knows \n     he's got the greatest thing in the world, and he's gonna \n     buttonhole, assault, cajole, and wear you down until you know \n     it too. And if at first you don't agree with him, that's \n     okay, he just hasn't done a good enough job of persuading \n     you--yet.\n       With his students and faculty, Sexton can be--everyone says \n     so--like a parish priest. As confidant and counselor, he is \n     peerless, inclined, as he himself puts it, to ``hear \n     confessions'' and impart advice, including no small amount of \n     moral exhortation, with a helpfulness and zeal that are both \n     legendary and unusual in the secular academy. ``John gets \n     this quizzical, almost surprised, look on his face while he's \n     listening to you,'' a student in his civil procedure course \n     said recently ``as if he's not sure he grasps all of what you \n     are saying--only he does. He seems bemused, but he isn't. \n     When he speaks, he talks quickly and a lot, but he's \n     helpful.'' A faculty colleague of Sexton's notes, ``John is \n     more expansive and discursive than articulate and concise, \n     but he can also be dead-on cogent when he needs to be. He'll \n     present all aspects of a subject, he'll summarize his \n     opponents' viewpoints with a fairness they cannot reproach, \n     but then, after all the praise and prefatory remarks and \n     analysis, he'll bear in for the kill. When he gets to his \n     point, watch out. It's not for nothing he was a national \n     debating champ and coach when he was younger.''\n       Though it is unusual for a law school dean to have a heavy \n     teaching load (many do no teaching), Sexton teaches--and \n     teaches. Indeed, he teaches more than many faculty who have \n     no administrative responsibilities. This fall he is teaching \n     three courses. ``I draw energy from the students,'' Sexton \n     says. ``Being with them reminds me why we do everything else. \n     They keep my eye on the ultimate goal. The students incarnate \n     our possibilities.'' Even outside of class, Sexton spends a \n     huge amount of time with students. His students congregate \n     for casual hours in his office on Monday evenings--and the \n     sessions often run past midnight. Students may raise any \n     topic they like, except the day's lecture. Asked how he can \n     spare so many hours for students and the classroom, Sexton \n     replies, ``I don't do the usual flag carrying, the external \n     things. If you go back over my eleven years as dean, you \n     could count on the fingers of one hand the number of black-\n     tie dinners and dais-sittings I've done. I avoid events where \n     I am introduced as a `comma person' __ you know, John Sexton, \n     comma, dean of __.' '' In short, if it isn't students, or \n     meetings, or intellectual events, Dean Sexton is at home with \n     his family.\n       Sexton at home differs little from Sexton in public. He is \n     a paterfamilias who readily assumes tasks and \n     responsibilities, from helping his daughter, Katie, 10, with \n     her homework, to working out a solution to his aging mother-\n     in-law's care needs. You wouldn't describe John as \n     ``uxorious'' where his wife, Lisa Goldberg, is concerned \n     (she, like her husband, is a Harvard-trained lawyer, and the \n     executive vice president of the Charles H. Revson \n     Foundation), but his devotion to her is such that the word \n     passes through your mind. Home and hearth mean a great deal \n     to John, and if ``family'' certainly starts with Lisa, Katie \n     and grown son Jed, an actor, and Jed's wife, Danielle, it \n     also includes others, for John and Lisa readily invite \n     additions to the mishpocha. He enjoys contributing--he almost \n     needs to contribute--to the sense of fulfillment and well-\n     being of those around him.\n       A hedgehog in his devotion to one great idea, Sexton also \n     is a hedgehog in the way he pursues it. The NYU Law dean \n     hasn't the chameleon's morphing talent, and only some of the \n     fox's canniness, but he is the exemplar of the persistent \n     sell. Unlike any other leading law dean, Sexton, in service \n     to his ideal, is not afraid to give himself away, to look \n     ridiculous, to give everyone he talks to his or her full \n     due--and maybe a little (actually, a lot) more--often at his \n     own expense. Sexton readily refers to himself as ``the P.T. \n     Barnum of legal education,'' and if the listener actually \n     goes away thinking ``that is truly what this guy is,'' that's \n     okay, as long as he or she has come to understand Sexton's \n     ``great idea'' and agreed to serve it in some fashion.\n       In short, Sexton's is a personality that couldn't work for \n     a standard academic mandarin, someone with a brittle ego or \n     ticklish vanity. ``Being John Sexton'' requires too much \n     self-confidence and idealism--above all too much ease with \n     himself--for that. For only a man who knows who he is and who \n     believes in his ideal will so willingly run the risk of being \n     labeled ``Crusader Babbitt,'' as a critic of Sexton recently \n     described him.\n       Nowhere is Sexton's personality more, let's-say-it, \n     profitable to NYU than in his job as fund-raiser. Like it or \n     not--and no dean likes to admit it--fund-raising is the basis \n     of the top job. It is necessary, if not sufficient; in legal \n     terminology, it's dispositive--and it has been for decades.\n       Deans of professional schools hold a major trump card in \n     raising money: they represent the school that graduated (read \n     that, credentialed) the people to whom they are appealing. \n     The appeal to alumni turns first and last on self-interest: \n     helping us is helping yourself. This often works, but its \n     success speaks less to the talents of the fund-seeker than it \n     does to the motives of the potential donor.\n       John Sexton has raised a huge amount of money from NYU Law \n     School's graduates, but he has raised still more from other \n     sources. And he has done both less by appealing to self-\n     interest than by stimulating interest in and commitment to \n     ideas, and evoking collaboration in common causes and \n     projects.\n       Chief Judge Edwards, a graduate of Harvard says, ``John \n     adds value to his appeal because he is able to convince \n     people that they are an integral part of NYU's educational \n     enterprise. He shows them how the law school will be a better \n     place, better able to do its job, if they are a part of it, \n     in this or that specific way or program. He's the first dean \n     most people have met who has made a thought-out overture to \n     them for their personalities, their ideas, their ongoing \n     involvement, not just their money.''\n       West Publishing's Dwight Opperman is a graduate of Drake \n     University Law School, yet he has given millions of dollars \n     to NYU. As he puts it: `` I am approached all the time by \n     people with their hands out. There are so many worthy causes \n     and bright people to choose from. What John Sexton does \n     better than anybody else I've ever met is to show me how I \n     can be part of something original and interesting.'' \n     Recently, for example, Opperman gave several hundred thousand \n     dollars so that NYU could host the forum with President \n     Clinton, Tony Blair and the other leaders.\n       Then, too, Sexton knows how to give even when he's not \n     getting. A few months ago, the Las Vegas entrepreneur James \n     Rogers was profiled in the New York Times for his record-\n     setting gift of $115 million to his alma mater, the \n     University of Arizona Law School. In the quest to make the \n     best use of this generosity, Rogers and Arizona's law school \n     dean, Joel Seligman, toured the country seeking advice from \n     leaders at the nation's top law schools. In the end, Rogers \n     asked Sexton to help them shape their plans. Why Sexton? \n     Rogers says that he was impressed by NYU Law's ``incredibly \n     swift'' rise in prominence: ``It already has bested Harvard \n     in some areas. It has great potential to get out in front and \n     stay in front.'' And he was no less emphatic about ``the \n     spirit of the place.'' ``The NYU people have high IQs and \n     strong opinions, but they're united in their focus on \n     being the best. They're a team.''\n       On short notice, Sexton recently flew to Tucson for a \n     weekend. In a series of intense discussions with Rogers, \n     Seligman and the Arizona faculty, they discussed options for \n     the University of Arizona Law School Foundation. (Sexton will \n     be one of the seven members of the board.) He asked nothing \n     for NYU, nor did he press Arizona to use NYU as a model. When \n     asked, ``What's in it for NYU?'' Sexton responded: ``That's \n     an irrelevant consideration. Generosity like Jim's commands \n     the sweat equity of everyone who cares about legal education \n     and the law.''\n       Rogers hasn't given a nickel to NYU Law school, but he's \n     impressed with its dean. ``John is generous and unself-\n     seeking. He's genuine in his feelings. You know he means what \n     he says. He isn't hidebound like a lot of academics can be. \n     Some of the deans are caught up in their traditions and \n     styles. But John is unfettered, in his imagination as much as \n     his personality. They're all smart, of course, but John's \n     inspiring, a true visionary. In his persuasiveness and energy \n     level, he's above everyone else. You're ready to go out and \n     conquer the world after a meeting with him.''\n       When pressed, Sexton had little to say about his role as \n     consigliere for Arizona, stressing only the generosity of \n     Rogers' gift and the care that has gone into allocating it. \n     As Judge Edwards puts it: ``One of John's best traits is how \n     self-effacing he is. He has no desire to come between someone \n     else and the credit they deserve, or don't deserve. But he \n     himself has big ideas that benefit people, and people know \n     it. He has galvanized them in their self-interest and made \n     them care.''\n\n                Making NYU Law School The Best It Can Be\n\n       When Sexton took over as dean in the fall of 1988, the NYU \n     law faculty already boasted more than a handful of men and \n     women of great talent and considerable achievement. A few, \n     such as Anthony Amsterdam, the criminal law scholar and \n     renowned death\n\n[[Page S8399]]\n\n     penalty opponent, had national reputations. NYU's strengths \n     as a law school were quadri-polar: traditional meat and \n     potatoes (``booklarnin' '') curricula, clinical (practical) \n     education, a developing cadre devoted to an interdisciplinary \n     approach and a tradition of supplying legal talent to the \n     public sector. In all these areas, the past decade has seen \n     the law school advance both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n       The biggest advance has been the growth of its faculty. \n     From the beginning of his tenure, Sexton told all who would \n     listen that the key to making NYU the finest law school it \n     could be would be using the faculty already at the school and \n     the special notion of professional education articulated by \n     the Enterprise to attract ever more outstanding scholar-\n     teachers.\n       Since then, NYU's ability to attract brilliant lateral \n     appointments has become legendary. In the last decade, the \n     school snapped up nearly a score of celebrated scholars--\n     names like Barry Adler (formerly of Virginia); Stephen Holmes \n     (formerly of Chicago); Benedict Kingsbury (formerly of Duke); \n     Larry Kramer (formerly of Michigan); Geoffrey Miller \n     (formerly of Chicago); Daniel Shaviro (formerly of Chicago) \n     Michael Schill (formerly of Pennsylvania); and Richard \n     Stewart (formerly of Harvard). Moreover, NYU has made a \n     conscious decision not to use outsized salaries to attract \n     these top scholars--in other words, not to enter into the \n     academic equivalent of what the sports world calls free \n     agency. Instead, as Sexton puts it: ``We seek to make \n     ourselves irresistibly attractive to the people for whom we \n     are right. If you want the benefits of the kind of reciprocal \n     community the Enterprise has created, and if you are willing \n     to undertake the obligations associated with that community, \n     we want you, and we can offer you exactly what you want.''\n       And let there be no doubt that the degree and kind of \n     intellectual heat and light generated at NYU is doubtless a \n     draw to faculty and students alike. A weekly bulletin informs \n     the reader of an astonishing number of events, lectures, and \n     meetings, usually animated by a vast array of eminent guests. \n     Supreme Court Justices are regular visitors to NYU, as are \n     their equivalents from foreign lands. So are leading \n     corporate, labor, political and cultural leaders from the \n     United States and abroad. As one faculty member put it: \n     ``Each week, there are two or three events here, any one of \n     which would be the major intellectual event at most other \n     schools.''\n       A visiting professor summarized his recent year at NYU this \n     way: ``I've spent time at most of the leading law schools; \n     simply put, none has the level of intellectual activity I \n     found here.'' Another said, ``Before I spent a semester here, \n     I knew that NYU's faculty was among the very best in the \n     country. What I didn't know was how much interaction there \n     was among the faculty and students. I certainly didn't \n     anticipate the steady flow of the leading thinkers and \n     players in the law. It seems that everybody who is anybody in \n     law either is at NYU, is about to be at NYU, or has just been \n     at NYU.''\n       Part of the extraordinary intellectual vitality of NYU can \n     be captured in a word unfamiliar to an outsider--\n     ``colloquia.'' A colloquium is a specific and rigorous \n     ``meta-seminar'' designed to engage faculty and students in \n     demanding discourse at the most advanced level. Typically, a \n     student's formal classroom time in one of the ten colloquia \n     is divided between a session of several hours devoted to \n     grilling a leader in the field (the ``guest'' participant) \n     and an independent seminar session devoted to student work \n     related to the week's topic. The distinction between teacher \n     and student often dissolves in the colloquia, replaced by a \n     joint pursuit of advanced study not only of the law but--more \n     usually--of other disciplines as well. There are ten \n     colloquia ranging from traditional topics such as ``Legal \n     History,'' ``Constitutional Theory,'' and ``Tax Policy,'' to \n     the less expected ``Law and Society'' and Law, Philosophy and \n     Political Theory.'' In short, interdisciplinary work is not \n     only a priority, it is central--in no small part because the \n     law school has an unusual number of world-class scholars from \n     disciplines other than law--in fields ranging from economics, \n     to politics, to philosophy, to psychology, to sociology. In \n     fact, NYU Law School boasts one of the finest philosophy \n     ``departments'' in the world, with Ronald Dworkin, Jurgen \n     Habermas, Liam Murphy, Thomas Nagel, David Richards and \n     Lawrence Sager all in residence. And Jerome Bruner, viewed by \n     many as the father of cognitive psychology, is also at the \n     law school.\n       The fact that Bruner is at NYU is itself a testament to \n     creative thinking. Over the psychologist's protests that he \n     ``knew no law,'' the faculty brought him to NYU in 1992 to \n     help the faculty and students analyze and understand legal \n     cognition more profoundly. The a priori questions he studies, \n     and which now valuably inform the general awareness of \n     faculty and students not only at NYU but at other schools as \n     well, include: ``What does law presuppose about the function \n     of the mind? How does the human penchant for categorization \n     affect legal thinking? How do lawyers listen? Does stare \n     decisis (the strength of precedent) apply to all human \n     decision-making, not just legal?'' This type of ``meta'' \n     question is routine at NYU Law.\n\n\n                    The Global Law School Initiative\n\n       There is another factor in the remarkable story of NYU's \n     growth--a factor that has both helped to attract faculty and \n     generated an unparalleled intellectual activity: the \n     willingness to take risks. A common, if often rued, \n     characteristic of most elite schools is that they tend to be \n     conservative, risk-averse. As one dean candidly put it, ``We \n     change as slowly as an aircraft carrier turns.'' Such an \n     approach is not the approach of NYU Law School. As Sexton \n     puts it: ``We embrace the positive doctrine of original \n     sin. If we are not to be perfect in this life, we should \n     seize our imperfection as an opportunity always to \n     improve--to follow Martin Luther's advice to `sin boldly.' \n     '' This led the National Law Journal to say about NYU in \n     1995: ``NYU, already a powerhouse, has become the leader \n     in innovation among elite law schools.''\n       The best example of all is NYU's boldest gamble to date--\n     what will turn out, incontrovertibly, to be the most \n     extraordinary innovation of Sexton's tenure at the law \n     school--NYU's Global Law School Initiative.\n       In proposing the initiative six years ago, Sexton and \n     Norman Dorsen, the faculty member he calls the ``father'' of \n     this venture, precipitated a revolution in legal education. \n     Hailed today by many as the most significant step since \n     Langdell developed the case method, the initiative is \n     predicated on an inevitability of the next century, that the \n     world will become smaller and increasingly interdependent. \n     The importance of the rule of law as the basis of economic \n     interdependence and the foundation of national and \n     international human rights will become self-evident. As \n     governments adopt legal systems based on the rule of law, \n     more and more people will experience political and economic \n     justice for the first time.\n       Taking globalization seriously means understanding that \n     there are no significant legal or social problems today that \n     are purely domestic--from labor standards and NAFTA to \n     intellectual property and trade, to the impact of foreign \n     creditors on domestic monetary policy.\n       NYU's faculty has long been interested in international \n     issues, and its curriculum has reflected this. Its student \n     body, composed of a high proportion of foreign students, have \n     always been able to choose from array of traditional, \n     clinical, and interdisciplinary courses offered by scholars \n     in public and private international law, comparative law, \n     international taxation and jurisprudence. But the Global Law \n     School initiative is something different--subtler, grander, \n     more challenging. It is not a program for the study of \n     international or comparative law, it is about bringing a \n     global perspective to every aspect of the study of law, \n     leading to a new way of seeing and understanding not only \n     law, but the world. Its central premise is that there is \n     value in viewing and reviewing law and society from new \n     vantage points; the more you widen the cultural-conceptual \n     circle of discussants, the more the discussion widens, and \n     the more likely it is that the overall fund of good ideas \n     will grow.\n       Of the four major components of the Global Law School, the \n     most important is the Global Law Faculty, a score of leading \n     legal scholars and practitioners from around the world, who, \n     though they retain their ``day jobs,'' agree to come to \n     Washington Square for a minimum of two months a year. The \n     Global Faculty, which supplements and complements NYU's \n     extraordinary American Faculty, represents six continents and \n     eighteen nations and boasts the names of many of the planet's \n     leading scholars: Sir John Baker, the eminent Cambridge \n     University law historian and dean of Cambridge's law faculty; \n     Uprendra Baxi, vice chancellor of New Delhi University; \n     Menachem Elon, retired deputy president of the Supreme Court \n     of Israel; and Hisashi Owada, permanent representative of \n     Japan to the United Nations, are just a few. These men and \n     women are not ``visiting professors'' in the usual sense. \n     They come in far greater numbers, are in residence longer, \n     and they maintain a continuing relationship with NYU after \n     they have returned to their home countries. Most return for \n     second and third teaching and research stints at NYU. In \n     Dorsen's words, ``They are part of us, and we of them.''\n       Fifty years ago, Arthur T. Vanderbilt saw the value of \n     attracting students from abroad to the school, and he \n     instituted a special program to bring experienced foreign \n     lawyers to the school for a year of study. The Global Law \n     School initiative takes Vanderbilt's notion to a new level. \n     Stimulated in part by a $5 million gift from Rita and Gustave \n     Hauser, NYU established what is now the world's premier legal \n     scholarship program for foreign students, the Hauser Scholars \n     Program. (Sir Robert Jennings, immediate past president of \n     the World Court, has called it ``the Rhodes Scholarship of \n     Law.'') Each year, a committee chaired by the president of \n     the World Court chooses the finest young lawyers in the world \n     and brings them to NYU. This has led others to come as well, \n     and the result has been the creation of the most diverse \n     student body anywhere: This academic year, there are more \n     than 300 full-time students studying at the law school who \n     are citizens of foreign countries; they come from almost \n     three dozen countries and six continents.\n       Not surprisingly, the curriculum that flows from the Global \n     Law School initiative goes well beyond supplementing a \n     traditional American legal education with doses of \n     comparative and international law. Mere supplementation would \n     only reinforce the notion that foreign law is something \n     peripheral, lurking on the outskirts of what a ``good \n     American lawyer'' needs to know to\n\n[[Page S8400]]\n\n     ply his trade. Instead, NYU has forged a pedagogy and \n     curriculum that give every student a deeper understanding of \n     the global dimension of the life of a modern lawyer. Members \n     of the Global Faculty teach a wide array of courses, \n     including ``basic'' courses like dispute resolution, property \n     or tax law, bringing new and critical thinking to fields that \n     have long needed them.\n       The foreign students, too, bring different and important \n     perspectives. As one American professor told me: ``I was \n     teaching Roe v. Wade (the abortion case) as usual when a \n     female Chinese student asked me to use Justice Blackmun's \n     decision to assess her government's policy which had required \n     her to have an abortion. An American student never would have \n     asked that wonderful question.''\n       The Global School initiative has led NYU to create a broad \n     range of inter-university agreements, institutes and centers \n     designed to advance the global perspective. And the school's \n     success with the program has generated conferences, forums \n     and special events that have brought the world to NYU--and \n     NYU to the world's attention. So, for example, a conference \n     on the enforcement ability in domestic courts of judgments \n     rendered by the array of new international tribunals brought \n     three U.S. Supreme Court justices to NYU, where they spent \n     three days in conversation with counterparts from around the \n     world--using a set of papers prepared and presented by \n     students as springboards for discussion. A conference on \n     constitutional adjudication attracted U.S. Supreme Court \n     Justices to Washington Square for four days of talks with \n     twelve justices from the Constitutional Courts of Germany, \n     Italy, and Russia.\n       And then there was last fall's day-long forum, \n     ``Strengthening Democracy in the Global Economy: An Opening \n     Dialogue.'' There never had been an event like it at any \n     university. The cast of participants was overwhelming. In a \n     room packed with NYU's faculty and students, and before a \n     world wide television and media audience (Ten networks were \n     present and 350 journalists were credentialed), leaders \n     grappled in genuine conversation with the need for new \n     political and economic answers in a globalized world. When \n     the capstone panel of the day (a two-hour reflection on the \n     earlier discussions moderated by Dean Sexton and featuring \n     the four heads of state) concluded with a look forward to the \n     continuation of the dialogue under the auspices of the law \n     school, it was clear that NYU Law had become the venue for a \n     global conversation about law.\n       Successfully incorporating what Dorsen calls ``the \n     inevitable but only faintly understood globalization of law'' \n     is obviously a long-term proposition. So also is effecting \n     the transformation of perspective that will change legal \n     education. And everyone at NYU acknowledges that the Global \n     Law School initiative faces challenges that will not be met \n     easily--for instance, the difficulty of truly integrating \n     foreign and American law students and faculty, day to day. \n     Still, as First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton put it, it is \n     now clear that ``NYU Law School has arrived at a place \n     where the rest of legal education will strive to be five \n     or ten years from now.''\n\n\n                      A Community With Heart . . .\n\n       When you ask Dorsen what he believes ``excellence'' in \n     legal education is all about, the Stokes professor is quick \n     to explain that, for him, it goes well beyond intellectual \n     quality and attainment. The two additional factors Dorsen \n     deems necessary--``and which have epitomized NYU Law School \n     for me''--are ``variety and heart.'' ``Variety'' of course \n     refers to NYU's diversity, not only in gender and the social, \n     ethnic, racial, and national backgrounds of its students and \n     teachers, but also in the teaching styles and scholarly \n     traditions, educational activities, programs, institutes, and \n     opportunities; and, far from least, the array of legal and \n     public vocations elected by graduates, far from all of whom \n     go into corporate law.\n       As to ``heart,'' this is ``not a simple concept,'' Dorsen \n     concedes, for all that it is absolutely pivotal. ``Heart'' is \n     what it all rests on and serves--reputation, quality, \n     prestige, success. It refers to judgement, morality, higher \n     goals, and to the sense of community that comes with being \n     united in a common pursuit. ``Heart'' is a fragile thing, \n     ``constantly at risk'' in a world where ``intense \n     preoccupation'' with individual pursuits easily drives out \n     concern for public welfare and community values.\n       If you press members of the NYU Law School on this topic, \n     ``heart'' (or some similar word or phrase) is what they \n     answer to the questions of why they love the place and why it \n     has fared so well. The challenge, beyond attracting faculty \n     stars, the best students and terrific administrators, is to \n     create an environment that is not only intellectually \n     fulfilling but also socially congenial and inspiring to \n     everyone. This is perhaps Sexton's most important \n     contribution to NYU. With him as its catalytic stimulus, the \n     law school has moved from the ``independent contractor'' \n     model of an academic institution--with its competition and \n     factionalism--to being what the dean, with his Jesuit \n     education, loves to call ``a communitas'' of mutual \n     collaboration and commitment.\n       As I looked at NYU Law 18 months after the publication of \n     his profile of its dean, I again asked James Traub the \n     question the New York Times had asked in the headline to his \n     piece: ``Is NYU's law school challenging Harvard's as the \n     nation's best?'' He replied: ``Where NYU might beat even \n     Harvard or Yale is as a place to be. NYU is ahead of \n     everybody as a happy place. Law professors are notoriously \n     critical and skeptical. They have trouble feeling part of any \n     institution. You can feel the unease and the disarray at many \n     of the best law schools in the country, but not at NYU.''\n       As Richard Revesz, one of NYU's brightest young stars, \n     says: ``The possibilities in this place come together \n     remarkably, combining individual freedom with the dean's \n     sense of community. We have a pluralistic, not a homogeneous, \n     community at NYU.'' His colleague, Stephen Holmes, a leading \n     political theorist, formerly of the University of Chicago, \n     puts it a little differently: ``There is a poisonousness in \n     academic life, and a degree of backbiting and professorial \n     whining that are absent here. John's genius is creating \n     opportunities for the faculty that take the edge of this \n     tendency. He can take energies that can easily turn into \n     mutual recrimination, energies that have done so in other \n     places, and manage to make them productive. NYU is the least \n     bitter institution I've worked at. There's a mutuality and \n     purposiveness here. The administration makes it possible for \n     each of us to do his or her best work without obsessing over \n     our neighbor's advantage. No one seems to get a stomachache \n     here because someone else is doing well.''\n       When asked if that is due to a sense of community, Holmes \n     says he doesn't especially like that word, but he affirms \n     that ``discussion at the law school mainly goes on, as in the \n     colloquia, in a public setting. This is a very public-minded \n     institution. It isn't dominated by the corridor setting and \n     the gossip that that setting usually creates.''\n\n\n                       . . . And A Dean With Soul\n\n       At the drop of a very small pin, Sexton will expand warmly \n     upon his current plans for the law school: to bring the \n     global initiative to full fruition, to develop a curriculum \n     for the 21st century that ``addresses a broader range of the \n     cognitive talents we in the law use in working with the \n     law,'' to build the finest center in the world for research \n     and teaching about law in order to ensure that law and \n     lawyers are used to make our world better.\n       And--another bold idea--to make NYU tuition free. This last \n     dream, especially close to his heart these days, would be \n     funded partly by building the law school's endowment so that \n     it generates more income and partly by a structured plan that \n     will see NYU graduates who go into corporate law contributing \n     back to the law school the tuition they never had to pay when \n     they were law students. As president of the Association of \n     American Law Schools--legal education's oldest and most \n     distinguished collectivity--Sexton was remorseless in \n     advocating his idea that practicing lawyers should contribute \n     1% of their income over $50,000 to the law school from which \n     they graduated. ``It is imperative,'' Sexton says, ``to \n     reduce the enormous debt our graduates incur to pay for their \n     education.'' (It is not unusual for a student to graduate \n     with $120,000 in law-school-related debt.) He continues: ``If \n     we do not reduce their debt, they will be forced to choose \n     income over service.''\n       Where did all these ideas come from? When asked, Sexton \n     will remind you of Arthur Vanderbilt's hopes, of the dreams \n     of ``the Enterprise,'' and of Dorsen's expansive notion of \n     ``heart.'' But, too, he speaks of ``the Tocquevillian ideal \n     of the law,'' infusing that ideal with his own insights, as \n     he did in a recent ``President's column'' in the newsletter \n     of the Association of American Law Schools:\n       ``From the beginning America has been a society based on \n     law and forged by lawyers; for us, the law has been the great \n     arbiter and the principal means by which we have been able to \n     knit one nation out of a people whose dominant characteristic \n     always has been our diversity. Just as the law has been the \n     means for founding, defining, preserving, reforming and \n     democratizing a united America, America's lawyers have been \n     charged with setting the nation's values. Unlike other \n     countries, America has no unifying religion or ethnicity; our \n     principle of unification is law.''\n       Lest this be heard as after-dinner boiler plate, or, worse, \n     an attempt to promote self-satisfaction in his audience, \n     Sexton is quick to point to the historical irony that the \n     American Constitution is becoming a model for nations that \n     have never known the rule of law, precisely at a time ``when \n     we in America are becoming more humble about how much we \n     don't know, how much we haven't managed to get right.''\n       Sexton's high-minded idealism, some have noted, is suffused \n     and informed by an Irish-Catholic religiousness lurking just \n     below the surface of his energy, as between the words of all \n     his speeches. It often leads him to enunciate strange \n     definitions in the tin ears of a secular age. ``Legal \n     research,'' in the Sextonian reading, becomes ``serious \n     thinking about the `ought' of the law, not the parody evoked \n     by the phrase `yet another law review article.' '' Where most \n     are content to speak of law as a profession, Sexton lovingly \n     dubs it ``a vocation, a deep calling, that governs or ought \n     to govern our professional lives.''\n       It is in this elucidation of ideals and the moral \n     exhortation with which they are pressed home that Sexton is \n     most himself. The single-mindedness of his dedication to his \n     cause permits him more leeway than others allow themselves. \n     As Chief Judge Harry Edwards puts it, ``People with true \n     values and beliefs have a big head start in any \n     conversation.'' The school's former Board chair,\n\n[[Page S8401]]\n\n     Martin Lipton, who recently became chair of the university's \n     Board, adds, ``Anyone who knows or works with John soon \n     realizes that he is a man not only of vision but of \n     complexity, a man whose drive toward meaning is not \n     encompassed or summed up by the standard references of the \n     academic marketplace: prestige, rankings, or VIPs.''\n       A friend of the Sexton family, the writer and literary \n     scholar Peter Pitzele, recalling John's original vocation as \n     a professor of religion, puts it another way: ``I would set \n     John in the historic context of Americans who have worked to \n     create an institution--a corporate body--that in some strange \n     way is, or seeks to be, sanctified. I think it is this drive \n     to sacralize that really animates what John is doing.'' He \n     adds, ``Though genius and genial are etymologically related, \n     in life they rarely are. It seems to me that--rare though the \n     combination is--John is both.''\n       Another friend of Sexton's, and his colleague to boot, \n     Richard Revesz recalls one of the biggest bestsellers of the \n     early 1980s, a novel written by a professor of his at \n     Princeton.

Hart, a committed public servant and devoted wife, \nmother and grandmother, who bravely battled cancer in the last several \nmonths of her life.\n  Lillian has made it easy for us to remember her--she has left behind \nan impressive list of accomplishments that most people only hope to \nachieve in their lifetime. Lillian was a leader in the community and a \nrole model for many women. She was a pioneer, exploring occupations and \ncivic positions women had never held before.\n  Lillian was the first woman to be the state executive director of the \nAgricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service in Kentucky, her \nmost recent public position. Lillian served Kentucky in this capacity \nfrom 1981 to 1989, and received a national award in 1987, for her work \non behalf of farmers and all Kentuckians.\n  Before Lillian became state executive director, she was also the \nfirst woman to be appointed a district director of the Agricultural \nStabilization and Conservation Service. She served 19 Northern Kentucky \ncounties as district director for 12 years, including in her home \ncounty of Pendleton.\n  Lillian was active in her community, once serving as president of the \nPendleton County Republican Women's Club and being chosen as a delegate \nto the Republican National Convention. She also founded a chapter of \nHabitat for Humanity in Pendleton County, and was a member of the \nKincaid Regional Theatre board of directors.\n  I am certain that the legacy of excellence that Lillian Hart has left \nwill continue on, and will encourage and inspire others. Hopefully it \nwill be a comfort to the family and friends she leaves behind to know \nthat her efforts to better the community will be felt for years to \ncome. On behalf of myself and my colleagues, we offer our deepest \ncondolences to Lillian's loved ones, and express our gratitude for all \nshe contributed to Pendleton County, the State of Kentucky, and to our \ngreat Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/13/senate-section/article/S8401-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MEG GREENFIELD\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on the \npassing of a truly remarkable woman: Washington Post Editorial Page \nEditor Meg Greenfield. A tough, tenacious and trailblazing woman, Ms. \nGreenfield had a sharp intellect, a vibrant sense of humor, and a keen \npolitical instinct.\n  Meg Greenfield was at the center of many of Washington's \nintellectual, cultural and political developments in the past three \ndecades. Her fiercely independent eye for news gave her the ability to \ncultivate relationships with individuals from every political, cultural \nand economic background. Her insightful portraits of life in our \nnation's capital were profound and memorable.\n  Ms. Greenfield forever changed the access and acceptance women have \nin the field of journalism. She astutely examined tough issues such as \nglobal disarmament and international affairs which were traditionally \nseen as ``male'' issues. She commanded respect and demanded fairness \nand impartiality from her staff.\n  In 1978, Ms. Greenfield moved the world with her commentary on issues \nof international affairs, civil rights and the press. For her efforts \nshe claimed the much coveted Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing. One \nyear later, she moved into the post of Editor for the Washington Post \neditorial page. A responsibility she undertook with dignity, grace, a \nkeen wit and what she would call ``the sensibility of 1950s liberals--\nconservative on foreign policy and national defense, but liberal on \nsocial issues'' for over 20 years.\n  For these and many other reasons I admired Meg Greenfield and her \nvastly important work. She also played a critical role in my own \ncareer. When I ran for the United States Senate, I met with the \nWashington Post editorial board, and I had heard about the tough, no-\nnonsense Meg Greenfield. I was very impressed with her, and she \nbelieved in me and my ideas for Maryland.\n  The endorsement I received from the Washington Post in the 1986 \nDemocratic primary was a turning point in the campaign. I was running \nagainst two very good friends of mine: the terrific Congressman from \nMontgomery County, Mike Barnes, and Maryland's Governor Harry Hughes. \nThe confidence and support I received from Meg Greenfield and the Post \neditorial board gave me pride and momentum, and helped lead me to \nvictory.\n  Meg Greenfield's colleagues at the editorial page wrote the day after \nher death, ``The anonymity typical of editorial pages could not \ndisguise the hand of Meg Greenfield. As a writer her work was often \ninstantly recognizable . . . for its felicity and stateliness and not \nleast for its wry and mischievous humor. As an editor she imprinted her \nspecial blend of a wise skepticism and a reach for the public good on a \nlong generation of Post editorials.'' In this tribute, they describe \nnot only her as the consummate professional, but as the wonderful and \ncaring woman that she was.\n  Meg Greenfield will be dearly missed in the many circles of \nWashington life. Her spirit and legacy will inspire us for years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/13/senate-section/article/S8401-3", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8401-S8402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FREEMEN PROSECUTION AWARD\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor to \nhonor a Department of Justice team that is receiving the top \nprosecution award today at Constitution Hall. This team of 12 \nprosecutors and investigators was faced with the challenging task of \nbringing LeRoy Schweitzer, Richard Clark, Daniel Petersen, Rodney \nSkurdal, Dale Jacobi, Russell Landers, and others, known as the \n``Freemen,'' to justice.\n  As you may remember, the Montana Freemen were a group of individuals \nwho refused to recognize any authority by U.S. officials. Instead, they \ncreated their own ``republic'' and court system. After warrants were \nprepared for multiple counts of fraud, armed robbery, and firearms \nviolations, they holed up on their ranch for 81 days in a tense \nstandoff. The team recognized today were critical in preparing the \nwarrants, negotiating the peaceful resolution of the standoff, and \nconvicting twenty-one members of the group. In addition, this team \nworked with many other prosecution teams to prepare and present related \ncases in over thirty federal districts.\n  It makes me especially proud that there were seven Montanans among \nthe group being recognized. They are Assistant U.S. Attorney James \nSeykora, Paralegal Specialist Deborah Boyle, IRS Special Agents Michael \nMayott and Loretta Rodriquez, FBI Senior Resident Agent Daniel \nVierthaler, FBI Special Agent Randall Jackson, and Montana Department \nof Justice Agent Bryan Costigan. I also appreciate the contribution of \nRobertson Park, George Toscas, David Kris, Tommie Canady, and Timothy \nHealy as award winners contributing from agencies outside of the state. \nI also think it's only appropriate to recognize the investigation and \nprosecution leader, Montana U.S. Attorney Sherry Matteucci. Although \nthis entire prosecution effort fell under her responsibility, as a \npolitical appointee, she is not eligible for this award.\n  The Attorney General's Award for Exceptional Service is given once \neach year, with the decision based upon the following: performance of a \nspecial\n\n[[Page S8402]]\n\nservice in the public interest that is over and above the normal \nrequirements and of an outstanding and distinctive character in terms \nof improved operations, public understanding of the department's \nmission, or accomplishment of one of the major goals of the department, \nexceptionally outstanding contributions to the Department of Justice or \nexceptionally outstanding leadership in the administration of major \nprograms that resulted in highly successful accomplishments to meet \nunique or emergency situations, or extraordinary courage and voluntary \nrisk of life in performing an act resulting in direct benefits to the \ndepartment or nation. From where I sit, this team has met or exceeded \nall of these high standards during the course of the investigation. Few \nother prosecutions have received the external scrutiny in the press, \nJustice management, and the public eye as did the Freemen prosecution. \nA terrific amount of juggling priorities and concerns was necessary to \npull off a peaceful resolution of this crisis. Their conviction record \non this case was solid, and will likely be the model from any similar \nsituations in the future.\n  So, it gives me great pleasure to bring our attention to this team's \nsuccess, and I add my thanks for a job well done. We wish them nothing \nbut continued success as they move on to other jobs within their home \nagencies. Again, congratulations on this great, well-deserved \nhonor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/13/senate-section/article/S8402-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BEATRIZ RIVAS ROGALSKI\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to salute my Deputy Chief of \nStaff, Beatriz (Bea) Rivas Rogalski, on the occasion of her upcoming \nretirement after 25 years of distinguished service to the people of the \nUnited States. As director of casework in my House and Senate offices \nfor more than 16 years, she has helped literally thousands of \nCalifornians get the timely assistance they need from their federal \ngovernment. As Deputy Chief of Staff, she is beloved by staff members \nand constituents alike.\n  Bea began her public service as I did, in the office of then-\nCongressman John Burton. In 1974, Bea Rivas was a recent immigrant from \nEl Salvador. While working at Macy's department store in San Francisco, \nshe took a second part-time job to help support her mother.\n  Bea went to work in John Burton's campaign office on a temporary \nbasis as a key-punch operator. Given a six-month project, Bea completed \nit in two months. Following the election, she went to work as a staff \nassistant in Congressman Burton's district office, answering phones and \ntracking bills. Her diligence and demeanor quickly impressed her \nsupervisors, who promoted her to case worker.\n  It was a perfect fit. She quickly learned the most arcane workings of \ngovernment and did her utmost to help constituents negotiate the shoals \nof bureaucracy.\n  Bea has what it takes to help people get their due from their \ngovernment. She is kind, considerate, generous, and above all patient. \nI cannot overstate how she always listens carefully, always acts \ndiligently, always goes the extra mile to take care of constituents' \nneeds. She is incomparable and irrepressible. She will also be \nirreplaceable.\n  Mr. President, by serving the people of California so well, Beatriz \nRogalski has brought honor on this institution and the United States \nGovernment. I hope you will join me in thanking her and sending best \nwishes to her, her husband Hans Rogalski, and their son Hans, \nJr.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/13/senate-section/article/S8402-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO HITCHINER MANUFACTURING COMPANY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President I rise today to pay \ntribute to Hitchiner Manufacturing Co., Inc. for receiving Business NH \nMagazine's 1999 Business of the Year Award.\n  Since the company moved to Milford, New Hampshire in 1951, Hitchiner \nhas been extremely active within the community. Hitchiner supports the \ncommunity through contributions to the arts, education, and community \nwelfare. Specifically, they offer much-needed dollars to local and \nstate nonprofits and they make time available for their employees to \nparticipate in community affairs. Hitchiner President/CEO, John Morison \nIII, believes when employees work in the community their experiences \nwill translate into a positive experience for the company as a whole.\n  In addition to being involved in community affairs, Hitchiner \nManufacturing is a leader in technology. The company is an \ninternational player for investment castings for customers such as \nGeneral Motors, BMW and General Electric. Hitchiner will soon acquire \ntheir tenth patent, thereby establishing themselves as the leader in \nmetallurgical advances.\n  Hitchiner's profit sharing philosophy has helped create a spirit of \nteam work among its employees. President Morison believes that by \nsharing the profits and risks, of working as a team, the company will \nbe better equipped to stay on the cutting edge of technology--this is \nthe key to future success.\n  Mr. President, I salute Hitchiner Manufacturing Company, Inc. and \ncommend their president, John Morison, for his innovative ideas and \nspirit of community.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize South \nCarolina's peach farmers for their hard work and their delicious \npeaches.\n  My staff has been delivering South Carolina peaches to offices \nthroughout the Senate and the U.S. Capitol all day. Thanks to South \nCarolina peach farmers, those of us here in Washington will be able to \ncool off from the summer heat with delicious South Carolina peaches.\n  For a relatively small state, South Carolina is second in the nation \nin peach production. In fact, this year farmers across South Carolina \nplanted more than 16,000 acres of peaches. As my colleagues can attest, \nthese are some of the finest peaches produced anywhere in the United \nStates.\n  As we savor the taste of these South Carolina peaches, we should \nremember the work and labor that goes into producing such a delicious \nfruit. While Americans enjoy peaches for appetizers, entrees, and \ndesserts, most do not stop to consider where they come from. Farmers \nwill be laboring all summer in the heat and humidity to bring us what \nwe call the ``perfect candy.'' What else curbs a sweet tooth--is \ndelicious, nutritious, and satisfying, but not fattening? The truth is, \nMr. President, that our farmers are too often the forgotten workers in \nour country. Through their dedication and commitment, our nation is \nable to enjoy a wonderful selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, and \nother foods. In fact, our agricultural system, at times, is the envy of \nthe world.\n  Mr. President, as Senators and their staff feast on these delicious \npeaches, I hope they will remember the people in South Carolina who \nmade this endeavor possible: David Winkles and the entire South \nCarolina Farm Bureau; and the South Carolina Peach Council. They have \nall worked extremely hard to ensure that the Senate gets a taste of \nSouth Carolina.\n  I hope everyone in our Nation's Capitol will be smiling as they enjoy \nthe pleasure of South Carolina peaches.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/13/senate-section/article/S8402-4", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8402-S8403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO TOM RECHTIN, SR.\n\n Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, when our Founding Fathers began \ntheir fight for our Nation's independence, they had a vision of what \nAmerica would be like. They saw a free and self-reliant people, ruled \nby State and local governments, who took responsibility for their own \nwelfare and progress, and cared for themselves and for others in their \nown communities.\n  When Alexis de Tocqueville came to America almost a century later, \nthat is what he saw. He later wrote that, In America, when a citizen \nsaw a problem that needed solving, he would cross the street and \ndiscuss it with a neighbor, together the neighbors would form a \ncommittee, and before long the problem would be solved. ``You may not \nbelieve this,'' he said, ``but not a single bureaucrat would ever have \nbeen involved.''\n  While today our citizens are increasingly ruled, not by local \ngovernments, but by Washington, the essence of what it means to be an \nAmerican has not changed: We are a people willing to lend a hand, lift \na spirit, and work together to make our land a better place.\n  For 50 years, the All-America City Awards have designated--from among \nall the cities in America--10 communities that have carried on this \ntime-honored tradition and kept the spirit of America alive. And I'm \nproud to say that among this year's winners is Tri-Cities, TN-VA, a \nplace our founding fathers would recognize as a fulfillment of their \nvision of what a free people, living and working together, can \naccomplish.\n  Among the criteria by which all participants were judged were citizen \ninvolvement, effective government performance, philanthropic and \nvolunteer resources, a strong capacity for cooperation, and community \nvision and pride. And, Tri-Cities--the first-ever region to be so \nhonored by this award--possesses those qualities in spades.\n  Included in the presentation which tipped the judges' decision in \ntheir favor were their efforts to involve youth in the decision-making \nprocess; improve health care in isolated communities and create an \ninterest in rural medicine among future physicians; and celebrate and \npreserve the Appalachian region's oral and musical traditions. And they \ndid it all without government handouts or mandates from Washington. \nTheir message, set to the sound of bluegrass music: we are willing to \nwork; we are willing to lead.\n  I think the song, written by a local storyteller and sung by all the \nTri-Cities delegates, says it all:\n\n     If you call, we will answer;\n     If you need us, we will come.\n     We'll lend a hand--there's strength in numbers;\n     If we work together, we can get it done.\n\n  Mr. President, on behalf of all the people of Tennessee, and all \nAmericans everywhere, I congratulate the citizens of Tri-Cities, \nTennessee-Virginia for their accomplishment. Not only they, but all of \nus, are winners because of their efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/13/senate-section/article/S8403-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8403-S8404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CLEVELAND SCHOLARSHIP AND TUTORING PROGRAM\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the \nachievements of the Cleveland Scholarship and Tutoring Program. Now in \nits third school year, this program, which is one of only two school \nchoice experiments in the country, continues to offer hope and promise \nto nearly 3,700 inner city children and their parents by making private \nschools, including religious schools, affordable. I have been a \nlongtime supporter of the Scholarship Program, as well as the school \nchoice concept in general. Believing that competition fosters \nimprovement, I made the implementation of this pilot school scholarship \nplan one of my education reform priorities by signing a 2-year budget \npackage that included $5 million for the introduction of the program in \n1995.\n  The Cleveland Scholarship Program is the first of its kind in the \ncountry that offers state-funded scholarships for use at both secular \nand religious private schools, giving low-income students access to an \notherwise unattainable private school education in Cleveland, where \nschools graduate a mere 36 percent of its high school seniors. In \nSeptember of 1996, during it's first school year, the program provided \nscholarships to approximately 1,855 students for the public, private, \nor religious school of their choice. Recent growth of the program's \nbudget enabled the parents of nearly 3,700 students to use vouchers to \nenroll in 59 participating area schools during the 1998-1999 school \nyear.\n  Two separate studies by Harvard University on the Cleveland \nScholarship Program found parents of voucher recipients were more \nsatisfied with many aspects of their school than were parents of \nstudents in Cleveland public schools. That satisfaction included the \nschool's academic program, school safety, school discipline, teacher \nskills, the teaching of moral values, and class size. A separate study \nfound that test\n\n[[Page S8404]]\n\nscore results in mathematics and reading show substantial gains for \nCleveland Scholarship Program students attending the Hope schools, two \nnon-sectarian schools which were created in response to the \nestablishment of the program. Additionally, parents of voucher \nrecipients reported lower levels of disruption in their child's \nschool--including fighting, racial conflict, and vandalism.\n  The results of these studies further underscore the success of this \nprogram. Time and again, data and surveys from the state have confirmed \nthe Cleveland Scholarship Program meets the one true test of any \ntaxpayer-supported program--it works. Although the program is not \nwithout its critics, I believe the best way to put these criticisms to \nrest is to continue demonstrating the program's effectiveness in \nCleveland as we continue to look beyond the conventional and pursue \ncreative and imaginative approaches to education.\n  I applaud the achievements of the Cleveland Scholarship Program and \nits contributions to the education of our children, and am proud to say \nthat my hometown serves as a model for the rest of the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/13/senate-section/article/S8404-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO CHRISTOPHER R.

Mr. President, I recognize and honor Rear Admiral \nLeonard Vincent, U.S. Navy as he retires upon completion of 32 years of \nservice to the Navy, The Department of Defense and the Nation.\n  Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a graduate of McAlester High School, \nOklahoma he enlisted in the Navy Reserve in 1961. He graduated from \nSoutheastern State College, Durant, Oklahoma, in 1965 and received his \ncommission as a Ensign in the Navy Supply Corps that same year. In 1976 \nhe receive his Masters in Business Administration from George \nWashington University.\n  A distinguished professional, Admiral Vincent currently commands the \nDefense Systems Management College (DSMC). As the Commandant of DSMC, \nhe has been a leader of change agents for acquisition reform. And he \nhas brought a wealth of acquisition, logistics, and contract management \nexperience to the vital task of training our nation's Department of \nDefense Acquisition Workforce.\n  Afloat he has served as the Supply Officer of an amphibious ship, the \nUSS Pensacola (LSD 38) and the Supply Officer of a submarine tender, \nthe USS Dixon (AS 37).\n  Ashore his assignments have included duty as Supply Officer with \nNaval Special Warfare Group and with Naval Inshore Warfare Command, \nAtlantic, both in Little Creek, Virginia.\n  His varied acquisition assignments include Director of Contracts, \nNaval Supply Center, Puget Sound; Contracting Officer for the \nSupervisor, Shipbuilding and Repair, Bath, Maine; Director of the \nCombat Systems department and Director of the Contracts department at \nthe Navy's inventory control point, Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania; \nAssistant Commander for Contracts, Naval Air Systems Command; Deputy \nDirector for Acquisition for the Defense Logistics Agency; and prior to \nhis current assignment, RADM Vincent was the Deputy Chief of Staff for \nLogistics, Fleet Supply and Ordnance, Pacific Fleet.\n  In addition to his current assignment, his command tours have \nincluded Commander, Defense Contract Administration Services Region, \nLos Angeles, California; Commander, Defense Contract Management Command \nInternational, Dayton, Ohio; and Commander, Contract Management \nCommand, Washington, D.C.\n  Throughout his career Admiral Vincent has displayed exemplary \nperformance of duty, extraordinary initiative and leadership, keen \njudgment, and dedication to the highest principles of devotion to his \ncountry. He leaves the military and the acquisition community better by \nhaving served them. His contributions will have lasting consequence.\n  Mr. President, Leonard Vincent, his wife Shirley and their three \nchildren, Lori, Tiffany and Stephen have made many sacrifices during \nhis 32 year Navy career. A man of his leadership, enthusiasm and \nintegrity is rare and while his honorable service will be genuinely \nmissed, it gives me great pleasure today to recognize him before my \ncolleagues and wish to him ``Fair Winds and Following Seas'' as he \nbrings to a close a long and distinguished career in the United States \nNaval Service.\n  I ask that an article and narrative on Rear Admiral Vincent be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article and narrative follows:\n\n Rear Admiral Leonard Vincent--Commandant, Defense Systems Management \n                                College\n\n       Rear Admiral Leonard ``Lenn'' Vincent became the Commandant \n     Defense Systems Management College (DSMC), Fort Belvoir, \n     Virginia, in January 1998. The College is a graduate-level \n     institution that promotes sound systems-management principles \n     by the acquisition workforce through education, research, \n     consulting, and information dissemination.\n       Admiral Vincent entered the Naval Reserve program as a sea-\n     man recruit in October 1961. Upon graduation from \n     Southeastern State Teachers College in Oklahoma, he received \n     a commission in July 1965 from the Officers Candidate School, \n     Newport, Rhode Island, as an ensign in the Supply Corps, U.S. \n     Navy.\n       Since returning to the Navy in 1970, RADM Vincent's wide \n     variety of afloat and shore-based assignments have provided \n     him extensive contracting, contract management, and logistics \n     experience.\n       Afloat he has served as the Supply Officer of an amphibious \n     ship, the USS PENSACOLA (LSD 38) and the Supply Officer of a \n     submarine tender, the USS DIXON (AS 37).\n       Ashore his assignments have included duty as Supply Officer \n     with Naval Special Warfare Group and with Naval Inshore \n     Warfare Command, Atlantic, both in Little Creek, Virginia. He \n     attended the Armed Forces Staff College, Norfolk, Virginia; \n     and then in Washington, D.C., he earned a Masters in Business \n     Administration from George Washington University.\n       His varied acquisition assignments include Director of \n     Contracts, Naval Supply Center, Puget Sound; Contracting \n     Officer for the Supervisor, Shipbuilding and Repair, Bath, \n     Maine; Director of the Combat Systems department and Director \n     of the Contracts department at the Navy's inventory control \n     point, Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania; Assistant Commander for \n     Contracts, Naval Air Systems Command; Deputy Director for \n     Acquisition for the Defense Logistics Agency; and prior to \n     his current assignment, RADM Vincent was the Deputy Chief of \n     Staff for Logistics, Fleet Supply and Ordnance, Pacific \n     Fleet.\n       In addition to his current assignment as Commandant, DSMC, \n     his command tours have included Commander, Defense Contract \n     Administration Services Region, Los Angeles, Contract \n     Administration Services Region, Los Angeles, California; \n     Commander, Defense Contract Management Command International, \n     Dayton, Ohio; and Commander, Contract Management Command, \n     Washington, D.C.\n       His military decorations include the Defense Superior \n     Service Medal with gold star, Legion of Merit with gold star, \n     Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal \n     with three gold stars, Navy Commendation Medal, and Navy \n     Achievement Medal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Narrative\n\n       Rear Admiral Vincent distinguished himself by exceptionally \n     outstanding achievement throughout thirty two years of \n     service culminating in his distinguished performance as \n     Commandant of the Defense Systems Management College (DSMC) \n     from 30 December 1997 to 31 July 1999.\n       Admiral Vincent exhibited extensive knowledge, technical \n     competence, tireless energy, imagination, and superb \n     leadership.\n\n[[Page S8405]]\n\n     As Commandant, he focused the College on improvements \n     essential for the entire Department of Defense Acquisition \n     Workforce (AWF), and dramatically improved the quality and \n     greatly expanded the scope of their education and training. \n     During his tenure, student throughput increased by nearly \n     five percent, greatly helping the military departments to \n     meet the formal acquisition education requirements that \n     public law imposed on all major system program managers. \n     These achievements are all the more remarkable because they \n     were accomplished during a period when DSMC funding decreased \n     by over seven percent, and personnel by over 11 percent.\n       Admiral Vincent also successfully focused the exceptional \n     capabilities of the College's staff and faculty on meeting \n     the rapidly changing needs of the acquisition workforce. Upon \n     assuming command of DSMC, he led the College's senior \n     leadership through the development of a corporate plan that \n     set the course into the new millennium for the education and \n     training of acquisition professionals. This dynamic plan \n     provided the foundation for DSMC operations and outlined a \n     series of strategic goals, objectives, and metrics that \n     guided the College through the efficient accomplishment of \n     its four-pronged mission of providing education and training, \n     research, consulting, and information dissemination. He \n     successfully challenged the College to achieve these \n     improvements, while maintaining the highest quality of \n     support available to the acquisition workforce.\n       Anticipating the need to achieve a cultural transformation \n     within the acquisition community, Admiral Vincent encouraged \n     the students, staff, and faculty at DSMC to become change \n     agents and instilled in them a sense of urgency to keep up \n     the momentum of Acquisition Reform. He directed the \n     assessment and revision of over thirty DSMC-sponsored courses \n     to reflect the latest changes, ensuring that Acquisition \n     Reform initiatives are seamlessly threaded throughout the 12 \n     functional areas. To further enrich the learning environment, \n     he spearheaded the effort to recruit students from industry, \n     bringing a commercial business perspective into every \n     classroom--he served as the catalyst to stimulate partnering \n     with industry and effective teaming within program offices. \n     Beginning with the students, staff, and faculty at DSMC, he \n     successfully developed a cultural mindset that would \n     revolutionize the way DoD approaches its business affairs--\n     embracing best practices, empowering the workforce, and \n     achieving optimal solutions at the lowest costs.\n       In a push to constantly improve the quality of integrated \n     courses, Admiral Vincent created the Acquisition Management \n     Curriculum Enhancement Program (AMCEP) to \n     seamlessly integrate the Acquisition Management Functional \n     Board requirements with the Defense Acquisition University \n     (DAU) course development and delivery processes. The \n     result was a continuous evolutionary process that \n     facilitated and improved the current integrated \n     acquisition management curriculum. The enhancement effort \n     created a learning environment characterized by a problem-\n     based learning curriculum which replicated to the highest \n     possible fidelity actual problems the graduates would \n     likely encounter in their subsequent assignments.\n       Additionally, to further improve the efficiency at DSMC, \n     Admiral Vincent consolidated all information/automation \n     systems enhancement efforts at the College under the Chief \n     Information/Knowledge Officer. By concentrating the \n     information technology activities under one person, Admiral \n     Vincent effectively orchestrated the consolidation of \n     automated systems requirements, significantly reducing costs \n     and making educational information widely available to \n     internal and external customers. Under Admiral Vincent's \n     guidance, the College underwent the process of standardizing \n     the automation equipment in each classroom and upgrading the \n     server infrastructure, along with video tele-conference \n     capability, to better support distance learning conversion \n     efforts of DSMC courses. This initiative, while minimizing \n     costs to infuse information technology capability, not only \n     improved the students' learning environment, but also made \n     acquisition education and training more accessible to the \n     workforce.\n       Admiral Vincent also provided the thrust behind the \n     development of the Integrated Curriculum Environment (ICE) \n     database, an automated, centralized management system for \n     DSMC courseware and supporting documentation. This \n     standardized curriculum management tool will significantly \n     simplify the course revision process, and eventually, will \n     make course materials available electronically to all \n     students and accessible by all graduates. Through his active \n     leadership and visionary foresight of the information \n     revolution, Admiral Vincent launched DSMC--and acquisition \n     education and training--into the 21st Century, guiding the \n     College through the transformation process of becoming the \n     acquisition workforce's Center for Continuous Learning.\n       Admiral Vincent further improved the stature of DSMC as the \n     Department of Defense world-class center for international \n     acquisition education excellence. Under his leadership, DSMC \n     co-sponsored the 10th Annual International Defense \n     Educational Arrangement (IDEA) seminar with France and hosted \n     the 11th IDEA seminar in the United States--a fifteen-nation \n     symposium on Intra-European and Transatlantic armaments \n     cooperation. Additionally, Admiral Vincent initiated the \n     first IDEA Pacific seminar with the Australian Defense Force \n     Academy, providing eight nations of the Pacific Rim with a \n     forum for exchange of acquisition best practices. With the \n     growing emphasis on international cooperation, the College \n     also hosted biannual international acquisition forums for \n     DUSD (International Programs) and the Services international \n     program offices. As the principal U.S. representative to \n     IDEA, Admiral Vincent provided the leadership and facilitated \n     international cooperation, significantly advancing the \n     understanding and effectiveness of international cooperative \n     acquisition issues among participating nations.\n       His distinguished career included additional command tours \n     as Commander, Defense Contract Administration Services \n     Region, Los Angeles; Commander, Defense Contract Management \n     Command International; Deputy Director for Acquisition \n     Management and Commander, Defense Contract Management \n     Command, Defense Logistics Agency.\n       Throughout the period of his assignment as Commandant, \n     DSMC, and his thirty-two-year career, Admiral Vincent \n     displayed exemplary performance of duty, extraordinary \n     initiative and leadership, keen judgment, and dedication to \n     the highest principles of devotion to his country. He leaves \n     the Defense Systems Management College and the acquisition \n     community better by having served them. His personal \n     dedication has been solely responsible for numerous \n     contributions of lasting consequence, which will enhance the \n     ability of each Service to accomplish its mission better, now \n     and in the future. His exceptional performance in extremely \n     important and challenging positions has been in keeping with \n     the highest traditions of the Service and reflects great \n     credit upon himself, the United States Navy, and the \n     Department of Defense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/13/senate-section/article/S8405-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8405-S8421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n  The text of S. 1282, passed by the Senate on July 1, 1999, follows:\n\n                                S. 1282\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     following sums are appropriated, out of any money in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the Treasury \n     Department, the United States Postal Service, the Executive \n     Office of the President, and certain Independent Agencies, \n     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000, and for other \n     purposes, namely:\n\n                  TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\n\n                          Departmental Offices\n\n\n                         Salaries and Expenses\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Departmental Offices \n     including operation and maintenance of the Treasury Building \n     and Annex;

The cost of any such services provided by a \n     Federal agency to a Federal child care facility on behalf of \n     another Federal agency shall be reimbursed by the receiving \n     agency.\n       ``(3) This subsection does not apply to residential child \n     care programs.''.\n       (e) Pilot Projects.--Section 616 of such Act (40 U.S.C. \n     490b) is further amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(f)(1) Upon approval of the agency head, a Federal agency \n     may conduct a pilot project not otherwise authorized by law \n     for no more than 2 years to test innovative approaches to \n     providing alternative forms of quality child care assistance \n     for Federal employees. A Federal agency head may extend a \n     pilot project for an additional 2-year period. Before any \n     pilot project may be implemented, a determination shall be \n     made by the agency head that initiating the pilot project \n     would be more cost-effective than establishing a new Federal \n     child care facility. Costs of any pilot project shall be paid \n     solely by the agency conducting the pilot project.\n       ``(2) The Administrator of General Services shall serve as \n     an information clearinghouse for pilot projects initiated by \n     other Federal agencies to disseminate information concerning \n     the pilot projects to the other Federal agencies.\n       ``(3) Within 6 months after completion of the initial 2-\n     year pilot project period, a Federal agency conducting a \n     pilot project under this subsection shall provide for an \n     evaluation of the impact of the project on the delivery of \n     child care services to Federal employees, and shall submit \n     the results of the evaluation to the Administrator of General \n     Services. The Administrator shall share the results with \n     other Federal agencies.''.\n       (f) Background Check.--Section 616 of such Act (40 U.S.C. \n     490b) is further amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(g) Each Federal child care center located in a Federal \n     space shall ensure that each employee of the center \n     (including any employee whose employment began before the \n     date of enactment of this subsection) shall undergo a \n     criminal history background check consistent with section 231 \n     of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 13041).''.\n       (g) Definitions.--Section 616 of such Act (40 U.S.C. 490b) \n     is further amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h) In this section:\n       ``(1) The term `Federal agency' has the meaning given the \n     term `Executive agency' in section 702 of the Federal \n     Employees Child Care Act.\n       ``(2) The terms `Federal building' and `Federal space' have \n     the meanings given the term `executive facility' in such \n     section 702.\n       ``(3) The term `Federal child care center' means a child \n     care center in an executive facility, as defined in such \n     section 702.\n       ``(4) The terms `Federal contractor' and `Federal employee' \n     mean a contractor and an employee, respectively, of an \n     Executive agency, as defined in such section 702.''.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Treasury and General \n     Government Appropriations Act, 2000''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/13/senate-section/article/S8421-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REGISTRATION OF MASS MAILINGS\n\n  The filing date for 1999 second quarter mass mailings is July 26, \n1999.
