Mr. President, I wanted to speak a little earlier, but I \ndidn't have the opportunity. The minority is very happy that we are \ngoing to move forward on some judicial nominations. One of the \nnominations holds a record. It is a record that Judge Paez has. He has \nbeen waiting more than 4 years to have the Senate decide whether or not \nhe can be elevated to the Ninth Circuit. We feel Judge Paez is \neminently qualified. I think we will find that a majority of the \nmajority will also feel that way.\n  Here is a man whose record is unsurpassed. He is a person who has \nbeen said to be--these are different quotes--``a well-respected, \nexperienced judge.''\n\n[[Page S1194]]\n\n ``Judge Paez has bipartisan support.'' ``Judge Paez is not an \n`activist', nor is he `anti-business.' '' Judge Paez has outstanding \njudicial temperament and is not `antireligion.''' Judge Paez has not \nacted ``unethically.'' ``Judge Paez has committed to follow the law on \nthe death penalty,'' and to follow the law generally.\n  I hope when we look at this man and his qualifications, he will \nreceive an overwhelming vote. He is qualified for the Ninth Circuit.\n  Judge Paez is a graduate of Brigham Young University and he received \nhis law degree from the University of California at Berkeley in 1972. \nHe has received the highest rating given by the American Bar \nAssociation to Federal judicial nominees, which is well qualified.\n  It is important to note his nomination swept through here earlier \nwhen he was confirmed to the trial court on the Federal judicial level. \nHe served with distinction after we, the Senate, approved his \nnomination. He has done that for 5 years, where he has served, as I \nhave indicated, as a U.S. District Judge for the Central District of \nCalifornia. He has presided over numerous trials. Prior to being a \nFederal district court judge, he had a distinguished career as a State \ncourt judge. He served as a California State judge for 13 years. He is \nsomebody who has been active in charitable and community affairs. He is \na family man. His mother and father and 10 brothers and sisters live in \nanother Western State, the State of Utah.\n  As I have indicated, Judge Paez has bipartisan support from, for \nexample, James Rogan, a Republican Congressman from California, and a \nformer judge himself; he supports Judge Paez. He has support from Los \nAngeles district attorney, Gil Garcetti; Los Angeles County Sheriff, \nSherman Block; Los Angeles Police Protective League; National \nAssociation of Police Organizations; former California judge and \npresident of the Los Angeles Bar Association, Sheldon Sloan; \nAssociation for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, President Pete Brodie; Los \nAngeles County Police Chiefs' Association. It goes on and on. It is a \nshame we have not worked and gotten this nomination approved earlier. I \nhope, as I have indicated, this will not become related to some \nextraneous issue. It should be decided on its merits.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that my friend from Alaska, the chairman \nof the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is going to speak on the \nNinth Circuit. I have some familiarity with it because the chief judge \nin the Ninth Circuit is from Nevada, Procter Hug. We are proud of the \nfact that he is the chief judge of the Ninth Circuit. He also has rave \nreviews. He is a graduate of Stanford University School of Law. He has \nadministered the Ninth Circuit very well. I hope those who feel there \nshould be something done about the Ninth Circuit would look at what we \nhave already done. This has become an issue. As a result of that, there \nwas a commission appointed, led by former Supreme Court Justice Byron \n``Whizzer'' White. They made a decision on what should be done with the \nNinth Circuit, and that it should be kept intact and be administered \ndifferently.\n  So I hope the committee of jurisdiction which will review the Ninth \nCircuit matters will take into consideration what has already been \ndone, and that there will be hearings held as to what should be done, \nif anything, with the Ninth Circuit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1194-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXPORT ADMINISTRATION ACT\n\n  Mr. REID.

We are \ntalking about being friendly in the Senate to the high-tech industry. \nThere is nothing we could do that would be more friendly to the high-\ntech industry today than passing the Export Administration Act. If we \nare going to continue to be the leader in the high-tech industry in the \nworld, we have to pass this act immediately. If not, we are going to \nhave these businesses move offshore. That is, in effect, what this \nExport Administration Act does.\n  I commend Chairman Gramm of Texas. He indicated he would do what he \ncould to move this forward. He has kept his word. This is being held up \nby just a few of the chairmen of committees. It should not be. This is \nnot a partisan issue.

Mr. President, I came back from North Dakota on a late \nflight last evening on Northwest Airlines, flying North Dakota to \nWashington, DC. When one is traveling all day and up late, one gets up \nin the morning and it takes a while to adjust to find a good mood. My \nmorning wasn't enhanced when I saw USA Today and saw the headline, once \nagain, that Mr. Greenspan digs in his heels on rate hikes.\n  Mr. Greenspan goes to Congress and decides he will tell the American \npeople they should brace themselves, he will increase their taxes in \nthe form of higher interest rates. That did not exactly make my day \nthis morning.\n  I will make a couple of comments about what Mr. Greenspan and the \nFederal Reserve Board are doing.\n  March 7, Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The U.S. work force was much more efficient in the fourth \n     quarter than initially thought, push labor costs sharply \n     lower.\n       Nonfarm productivity grew at a 6.4% rate in the last three \n     months of 1999, the fastest pace in seven years and well \n     above the government's initial estimate of 5%, the Labor \n     Department said Tuesday. The increase caused the biggest \n     decline in unit labor costs in seven years--a drop of 2.5% \n     that was more than double the 1% reduction the government \n     estimated.\n       The surge in productivity, which was in line with \n     expectations, generally would suggest that the risk of \n     inflation remains low despite feverish economic \n     growth. Because workers are producing more goods and \n     services per hour, employers can afford to pay higher \n     wages without having to pass on additional costs to \n     consumers.\n\n  I wonder if Mr. Greenspan has seen this information, or does he just \ndisregard it. It does not matter what the facts are. They are intent on \nincreasing interest rates at the Federal Reserve Board.\n  How about this. Mr. Greenspan says he fears demand is still too \nstrong, even after reports last week that job growth has slowed in \nFebruary, unemployment rose, and sales for new homes dropped sharply at \nthe beginning of the year. He says our country is growing too fast and \ntoo many people are working, and so he has decided he wants, once \nagain, to increase interest rates.\n  What does increasing interest rates mean? I will tell you what it \nmeans. If he, as some expect, increases interest rates another full 1 \npercent, which will double it from where rates were about a year ago, \nit means that every North Dakota farm family will pay about $1,500 more \nper year in interest costs. Typical nonfarm households in North Dakota \nwill pay about $700 more a year in added costs.\n\n[[Page S1195]]\n\n  There will be no debate in this Chamber about this issue. This is the \nFederal Reserve Board saying: We are going to tax the American people \nwith higher interest rates. Why? Because we decide we are going to do \nit.\n  Who are they? I do this as a public service. These are the members of \nthe Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the regional Federal Reserve \nBank presidents. This is a chart showing who they are and from where \nthey come. They all wear gray suits. They all come from the same area. \nThey all think the same. I even put their salaries on the chart. I do \nthis so we can put some faces to this public policy because they want \nto close their doors, make decisions about interest rates, and impose \nhigher interest rates on every American at a time when it is \nunjustified.\n  My children used to go through a book called ``Where's Waldo?'' At \nnight they would lay on the bed and search through those large pages \ntrying to find Waldo. My son especially always claimed to find Waldo \neven when he had not sighted Waldo. I think my son knows something that \nMr. Greenspan knows. Mr. Greenspan has been searching for inflation \nforever, even as inflation has gone down, way down, and he continues to \nincrease interest rates with no justification at all.\n  Where is Waldo? Where is inflation, I say to Mr. Greenspan? Where is \nthe justification for deciding that family farmers in desperate trouble \nalready should pay about $750 a year more in interest charges under \nyour current interest rate increases that have already been put into \neffect by you, and $1,500 a year total in additional interest charges \nif you do as many analysts expect and increase interest rates another 1 \npercent over the coming year?\n  Mr. Greenspan is a public servant. I admire him for his public \nservice, but I profoundly disagree with that monetary policy. Perhaps \nhe will discover what most Americans know: Productivity has increased \ndramatically, inflation is down, and this economy can least afford, in \nmy judgment, the increased interest rates that Mr. Greenspan is now \nproposing.\n  I had asked for time this morning to speak on another subject. I \nthought if I was coming to the floor, I should at least make a comment \nabout what Mr. Greenspan is talking.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak on another subject under a separate \nheading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1195-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1195-S1196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ARMS CONTROL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the issue of arms \ncontrol this morning. There are many issues that we consider in this \ncountry. We have the deafening sounds of Democracy as the American \npeople and politicians discuss, debate, and describe many, many issues. \nBoth candidates and crowds these days are generously discussing issues \nranging from abortion to economic growth to defense policy, and so on. \nBut there is dead silence on the subject of the spread of nuclear \nweapons and the threat it poses to every single person on this Earth \nand especially the threat it imposes to our children.\n  Let me describe where we are with nuclear weapons. In 1985, the \nSoviet Union had 11,500 nuclear warheads on long range missiles. \nDefense analysts predicted that would go up to 18,000 or 20,000 nuclear \nwarheads by the mid-1990s. These numbers do not even mean much. What is \na thousand nuclear warheads? Each Soviet warhead had about 20 or 30 \ntimes the power of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.\n  Instead of the 20,000 warheads many predicted, Russia has only about \n5,000 warheads today. Why do they have 5,000 warheads? Because they \nhave gotten rid of about 6,000 of the nuclear warheads they used to \nhave. The Soviet stockpile, now the Russian stockpile, has been cut by \nthe equivalent of 175,000 Hiroshima bombs. How did that happen? Because \nof arms control agreements. We agreed to reduce our nuclear weapons and \nthey agreed to reduce theirs.\n  I will describe what has happened. We have something called the Nunn-\nLugar program, named after our colleagues, former Senator Nunn and \nSenator Lugar. They said a good way to reduce the threat is by helping \na potential adversary destroy his weapons while we reduce our own \nweapons. As a result the Nunn-Lugar program has reduced the threat to \nthe United States by eliminating 4,900 Russian nuclear warheads, 471 \nintercontinental ballistic missiles, 12 ballistic missile submarines, \nand 354 ICBM silos.\n  For example, this is a picture of a Typhoon submarine owned by the \nRussians. It carries 20 missiles with 10 warheads on each missile. That \nis 200 nuclear weapons that can be fired from this Typhoon-class \nsubmarine. This submarine is twice the length of a football field and a \nthird larger than the Trident submarine, the largest U.S. submarine.\n  What is going to happen to this submarine? It is going to be \ndismantled, and we are going to help pay for the dismantling of this \nsubmarine under the Nunn-Lugar program. We are going to reduce the \nthreat by taking a Typhoon-class submarine and destroying it. This is a \npicture of what it looks like today. This is what it will look like \nlater this year. You can see what once was a submarine carrying 200 \nnuclear warheads aimed at U.S. targets is now a shell being taken apart \nand turned into scrap metal.\n  This picture shows the elimination of intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles. They pull them from the ground and take off the warhead, and \nthen cut the missile to pieces.\n  This is a picture of an ICBM silo, the last piece of metal being \nremoved. The dirt is then piled over and sunflowers are planted. This \nis in the Ukraine. Is that progress? You bet your life it is progress. \nA silo in which a missile once rested aimed at the United States of \nAmerica with multiple warheads with nuclear explosive power is now \neliminated. The Ukraine is free of nuclear weapons because of the Nunn-\nLugar program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to show this piece of a wing \nstrut from a Soviet bomber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How did I get this? Did we shoot the bomber down? No. \nThis bomber was sawed up. The wings were sawed off as a result of an \narms control agreement that we have with the Russians by which we \nreduced our delivery systems and nuclear weapons and they reduced \ntheirs. Their submarines are dismantled, their intercontinental \nballistic missiles are dismantled, and their bombers have had the wings \nsawed off.\n\n  This is a picture of the heavy bomber elimination, TU-95.\n  That is what is happening with arms control. It is, in my judgment, \nexciting and breathtaking.\n  What is expected to happen in the future? Under START III, we are \nexpected to go to 2,500 nuclear weapons. Think of that--2,500 nuclear \nweapons. What is one nuclear weapon? In most cases, the yield of a \nnuclear weapon is many times the yield of the one used in Hiroshima. \nMr. President, 2,500 weapons on each side if we get to that--we are not \nthere.\n  What has the Senate done with respect to arms control treaties? The \nU.S. Senate over the years has done a great deal. We passed START I, \nSTART II, the 1988 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty--a whole \nseries of arms control initiatives. We have funded the Nuclear Cities \nProgram to employ scientists in Russia who know how to make nuclear \nbombs so they are not hired by the Iranians, the North Koreans, and \nothers. We funded the Nunn-Lugar program. We have done a lot of things.\n  The fact is, there is no discussion anymore about arms control in \nthis Senate. In fact, all the discussion is about deploying a national \nmissile defense system, abrogating the ABM Treaty, and making a full \nretreat on issues on which we were making significant progress. We need \nto change that.\n  In addition to that, last year, after languishing for 2 years without \neven a hearing, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty was defeated \nby the Senate. The President just asked General Shalikashvili to head a \ntask force to see if everybody can work together toward a common goal \nand resolve the concerns many Senators have about the treaty.\n  Does anybody really believe it is in our interest or anybody's \ninterest to begin testing once again nuclear weapons? What a huge step \nbackwards. My\n\n[[Page S1196]]\n\nhope is we can, once again, on the Presidential campaign trail and in \nthe Senate and in this country, as a matter of discussion among \nAmerican citizens, talk about what we want for our future and our \nchildren's future.\n  Do we want a future with 2,000 or 5,000 or 10,000 nuclear weapons? Do \nwe want a future, by the way, in which more and more and more countries \nhave access to nuclear weapons? Because that is going to happen unless \nthe country provides some leadership.\n  There is no significant leadership in the world at this point to stop \nthe spread of nuclear weapons. It is our responsibility to do that. It \nis our job to do that. Most people do not understand the danger that \nwas posed just a year or so ago when India and Pakistan--countries that \ndo not like each other, countries that have fights on their border--\nboth exploded nuclear weapons, virtually under each other's chin. Most \npeople do not understand the potential consequences of that.\n  But we must, once again, as a Congress, and as a Senate, begin \nworking seriously on the issue of controlling the spread of nuclear \nweapons and reducing the stockpile of nuclear weapons. We must get to \nfull implementation of START II, and get to START III, and continue \ndiscussions, and not abrogate the ABM Treaty, and pass the \nComprehensive Test-Ban Treaty. We must do those things.\n  It seems to me we must not run off and decide: Well, now what we want \nto do is start an arms race once again. Let's deploy a national missile \ndefense system. It does not matter what it costs. It does not matter \nwhat the consequences are. We don't care what the Russians think. We do \nnot care what it does to the Nunn-Lugar program. We do not care that it \nabrogates the ABM Treaty. We just do not care. In my judgment, that \nkind of mindset does not serve this country's long-term interests well \nat all.\n  What will best serve this country's interests is if we decide that a \nsafer world will be a world in which we provide world leadership to \nstop the spread of nuclear weapons. We do not want any additional \ncountries to access nuclear weapons.\n  I know people say: But we have these rogue states. They may shoot an \nintercontinental ballistic missile at the United States. That is \nprobably the least likely threat this country faces. A rogue nation is \nnot very likely to shoot an intercontinental missile. They are much \nmore likely to acquire a cruise missile, for which a national missile \ndefense system would not provide a defense. They are far more likely to \nget a suitcase nuclear bomb and plant it in the trunk of a rusty Yugo, \nplant it on a dock in New York City, and hold the city hostage. That is \na far more likely threat than that some rogue nation would actually \nachieve access to an intercontinental ballistic missile.\n  Even more likely than all of that is the threat of a deadly vial of \nbiological or chemical agents, that is acquired by a rogue nation or \nsome terrorist, planted in a subway system in a major city.\n  Those are the most likely threats. Yet we have people in this Chamber \nwho stand up and say: We demand deployment, immediately, of a national \nmissile defense system. What that threatens to do is pull the legs out \nfrom under every bit of arms control efforts we have had underway for \n15 years in this country.\n  The reason I show this chart is that I want to show that arms control \nhas achieved the reduction of 6,000 nuclear weapons in the Russian \narsenal. Six thousand nuclear weapons are gone. The experts predicted \nit would grow from 11,500 nuclear weapons to 18,000 or 20,000 nuclear \nweapons. They were wrong because arms control agreements with the \nRussians and the old Soviet Union represent a substantial decrease in \nthe number of nuclear weapons they now have in their arsenal. The \nequivalent of 175,000 Hiroshima explosions has been eliminated from the \nRussian arsenal.\n  Will our children and grandchildren live in a world in which \nthousands of nuclear weapons are targeted at their homes, at their \ncities, at their country? I hope not. Will our children live in a world \nin which dozens of additional countries have access to and have \nacquired nuclear weapons and can and may use them to hold others \nhostage? Will our children live in a world in which terrorists will \nhave access to nuclear weapons and hold cities and countries hostage? I \nhope not.\n\n  But the answer to those questions depends on the will and the \naggressiveness here in this country of a President and the Congress to \nstand up and say: Arms control works. The United States of America will \nlead in this world to achieve new arms control agreements, dramatically \nreduce numbers of nuclear weapons, and reduce vehicles to deliver those \nnuclear weapons, with a substantial regime of inspection and monitoring \nand a Senate that will pass the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty. The \nAmerican people should expect us to do that.\n  Let me conclude where I started.\n  There is a deafening noise in this country about a lot of issues--\nsome important, some not. That is the noise of democracy. It is the \nsounds of democracy. But there is a dead silence on the subject of arms \ncontrol.\n  When Members of the Senate walked out of this Chamber last year, \nafter having voted in the majority against the Comprehensive Nuclear \nTest-Ban Treaty, most must surely have felt some dissatisfaction about \nthat. That treaty was signed by over 150 countries, sent to this \nChamber, and not one hearing was held in 2 years. Most must surely have \nleft this Chamber with a feeling of dissatisfaction.\n  I hope that dissatisfaction can persuade those of us who care about \ncontrolling the spread of nuclear weapons and reducing the arsenal of \nnuclear weapons to come together and work together. There is nothing \nRepublican or Democrat about the issue of nuclear weapons.\n  I say today, I hope the Presidential campaign can be about these \nissues. I hope the debate in Congress can be about these issues \nbecause, in my judgment, there is no issue more important to our future \nand our children's future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Minnesota is recognized for up to 45 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1196-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1196-S1201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PERSONAL SECURITY AND WEALTH IN RETIREMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take time this morning to talk \nabout one of the most important issues I think is facing American \nsociety today; that is, the future of the retirement system in this \ncountry--not only for those who are on Social Security today or for \nthose who are going to be on Social Security very soon, but basically \nto look down the road to our children and our grandchildren at what \nkind of Social Security or a retirement system we are going to leave \nthe next generation. I think that is very important.\n  I am very pleased this morning that President Clinton has finally \naccepted the Republican Social Security lockbox which would lock in \nevery penny of the Social Security surplus, not for tax relief and not \nfor Government spending but for the retirement program of millions of \nAmericans.\n  However, what most concerns me is that the President appears to be \nabandoning his ``Save Social Security First'' pledge. It was one thing \nto lock in Social Security surpluses last year and in the future and to \nfurther attempt to devote interest savings on a lower public debt to \nSocial Security, but that alone will not save Social Security because \nwe have spent too many years of the Social Security surplus prior to \nthe year 2000.\n  The President's budget does not address the future solvency of Social \nSecurity to ensure retirement benefits will be there for the baby \nboomers and also future generations. All he has proposed is to credit \nSocial Security with more IOUs that do nothing but increase taxes on \nfuture generations.\n  So my point is, the President's Social Security proposal does not \npush back the date that Social Security will run a deficit by a single \nyear, and the transfer from the general fund to Social Security does \nnot cover a fraction of the shortfall the system is going to face.\n  Without reform, the unfunded liability of Social Security will crowd \nout all discretionary spending. It will create financial hardship for \nmillions of baby boomers. It will impose a heavy burden for our future \ngenerations in the form of higher taxes. We must address this very \nvitally important issue and do it as quickly as we can.\n\n[[Page S1197]]\n\n  Just another note. Recently, a Social Security advisory panel found \nthat the Social Security economic and demographic assumptions the \nGovernment uses to project the program's future economic status \nunderestimate the unfunded liability. What that means is, if the \npanel's recommendations were adopted, Social Security projections would \nshow a financial imbalance in the system that is much greater than \ncurrently forecast. In other words, the system is more likely to be in \nworse shape today financially than previously even thought. This means \nSocial Security could go broke much sooner than we actually expect \ntoday.\n  What I want to do is to look at the system itself and then look at a \nplan I have introduced called the Personal Security and Wealth in \nRetirement Act, which is personal retirement accounts, which I believe \nis the direction in which we should go in order to save Social Security \nand to have a safe, sound, and good retirement system for the future.\n  In doing this, I have been across the State of Minnesota, holding \nmany town meetings, talking to hundreds and thousands of Minnesotans, \ntrying to explain to them what the problems are.  I think everybody \nagrees there are some problems in Social Security. In fact, more young \npeople today believe Elvis Presley is still alive or believe in aliens \nthan they believe that Social Security is going to be there for them. \nSo there is a problem of perception.\n\n  What Americans are looking for--and I found this out traveling across \nMinnesota--what they want is some information on what is happening and \nwhat are some of the options we are going to have in order to address \nthis problem. That is why I have traveled across the State of Minnesota \ndoing a number of town meetings, talking to Minnesotans about this.\n  When we look at Social Security over the last 65 years, Social \nSecurity has basically done what we have asked the program to do; that \nis, to provide retirement benefits for millions of Americans over 65 \nyears. It has done the job. In some cases, if one looks at their Social \nSecurity check today, they will say it is not very good because it is \nonly $700 a month, $600 a month, $800 a month. That is not the kind of \nretirement we want to leave to our children.\n  If we look ahead to the next 30 years, the system is facing some real \nproblems. We are going to strain the system to the point it will not be \nable to meet the benefits that have been promised. In fact, if we look \nout about 30 years, without any changes in Social Security, we will see \na reduction in the benefits of about one-third. We might have to raise \ntaxes; that is another option. We might have to raise the retirement \nage.\n  If those are the options on the table, I don't think they are what we \nwant to leave our children, that they are going to have a retirement \nsystem that is going to cost them more, going to give them less in \nbenefits, and they are going to have to be older to retire. Is that \nwhat we are promising or hoping for our kids? I don't think it is. That \nis why I have gone across Minnesota holding town meetings and talking \nabout this issue.\n  When Franklin Roosevelt created the Social Security program over six \ndecades ago, he wanted it also to feature a private sector component to \nbuild retirement income. In other words, he did not think only Social \nSecurity alone should do that. Social Security was supposed to be one \nleg of a three-legged stool: Social Security, pensions, and savings \naccounts.\n  But Franklin Roosevelt did have some concerns. In fact, there was a \nSenator--I think from Missouri--who had passed on the floor of the \nSenate a proposal to include private retirement accounts as well as the \npublic. When it got into conference, it was stripped out. They promised \nhim they would bring it back on the floor again the next year, but they \nsaid: We have to pass this bill now. We are right at the height of the \nDepression, with all the problems the country is facing. They promised \nhim they would bring this aspect back the next year. They never did. I \nalways say that is one of the first big lies dealing with Social \nSecurity.\n  Social Security is a system that is stretched to its limits. We have \n78 million baby boomers who are going to begin retiring by the year \n2008. The average is going to be around 2011 or 2012, but 80-plus \npercent of Americans retire at the age of 62, not at the age of 65. So \nwe can push back when it is going to hit that limit by a couple of \nyears to 2008. Social  Security spending will begin to exceed tax \nrevenues by the year 2014.\n\n  We have all heard about the Social Security surplus and why we are \nbringing in these surpluses every year. In 1983, a blue-ribbon panel, \nchaired by Alan Greenspan, decided the way to extend the life of Social \nSecurity was to begin overcharging for the FICA taxes. That excess \novercharge would be put into a trust fund or a savings account, and we \nwould then draw on that after the surpluses evaporated so we could meet \nthe shortfall from the savings account which would extend the life of \nthe program to the year 2032.\n  We hear everybody in debates saying: Social Security will be here \nuntil the year 2032. Well, it will be here, but it won't be paying \nbenefits to the max after the year 2014 unless we raise taxes somehow \nto retire some of the debt.\n  To give a quick example: It is as if we were paying out $100 in \nbenefits today. By the way, our Social Security system is a pay-as-you-\ngo system. In other words, the money brought in at the first of \nFebruary went out at the end of February. There is not one account with \nyour name on it with $1 in it in Washington for your retirement. You \nhave been paying in all these dollars, but you do not have an account \nin Washington that has $1 for benefits for your retirement. All you can \nrely on or hope for is that there are people working when you retire so \nthey can pay that benefit at the first of the month that you will \ncollect at the end of the month. That is the way this system works. It \nis a pay-as-you-go system--no investments, no compound interest, no \nassets, only the hope that there are going to be enough workers paying \ninto the system when you want to retire.\n  So if we are paying out $100 in benefits, we are bringing in $110 \ntoday. We put that $10 in the savings account. But by the year 2014, we \nwill bring in $100 and pay $100. So we are going to be even. By the \nyear 2015, estimates are we are going to bring in $98; we are going to \nhave to pay out the $100. That is when we were going to go to the \nsavings account or the trust fund to draw out $2 to make sure those \nbenefits are paid.\n  Then by the year 2020, for instance, we will only be bringing in $90 \nand we will pay out $100. We will have to borrow $10. Between 2014 and \n2032, we would have evaporated that savings account. Then we will be \nfacing the problem we were hoping to deal with at that time.\n  The problem is, all that is in the trust fund today are IOUs. In \nother words, every time $1 has been collected from you to go into the \ntrust fund, Washington has borrowed that money, put it into the general \nfund and spent it for other Government programs. They have spent your \nfuture retirement dollars. They have put in notes, IOUs, that say they \nwill pay back. It would be similar to going to your kid's piggy bank, \ntaking out 10 bucks and putting in an IOU. You are going to have to \nhave future revenues to pay back that IOU. So the money you have \nalready put in is gone. To replace it, we will have to go to current \ntaxpayers and raise more taxes to pay it off. All the money has been \nused to increase Government spending. It hasn't gone for your \nretirement security at all.\n  The Social Security trust fund goes broke in the year 2033. That is \nwhen all the IOUs will be gone. I always like to say, if you think \nthese IOUs are good, go put a million-dollar IOU into your checking \naccount and find out how many checks your banker allows you to write \nagainst that IOU. None. You are going to have to find additional \nrevenues. I have $1 million in my checking account. It looks good on \npaper, but in reality there is nothing there to back it up but the good \nword and faith of the Federal Government to some day go back and \ncollect more taxes to pay off this debt. So by 2014, we are going to \nhave to begin raising taxes or cut spending in other areas to pay off \nan IOU. If we need $1 billion in the year 2014 and it is not in the \nbudget, where do we go to get it? We are going to have to go out and \nget it from the taxpayers. So we are going to have to have a tax \nincrease beginning as early as 2014 to pay the benefits being promised.\n\n[[Page S1198]]\n\n  Why is the system now being stretched to the limit? Back in about \n1940, there were 100 workers for every retiree. Today, there are about \n2\\1/2\\ workers for every retiree. In 25 years, there are going to be \nless than two for every retiree. Why does this put a strain on the \nsystem? Say if you were going to have a $1,000-benefit in 1940. One \nhundred workers would only have to put $10 a month into the system to \nmake sure it was solvent. Today, we are asking that you put nearly $500 \na month into the system in order to maintain the benefits for this \nretiree. In 2025, our grandchildren will have to pay more than $500 \napiece in order to maintain those benefits. So $10 compared to over \n$500 shows the strain that will be put on the Social Security system if \nwe do nothing to improve it.\n  Where are we today with the system? The numbers say the system is \nprobably more in debt than we expected it to be. If we look at this \nchart, on this line is zero; this line shows the continuing surpluses \nwe will be bringing in until about the years 2012 to 2014. But after \nthat, we see the red line as it goes down. This is the debt the system \nis going to incur, and it is over $20 trillion of unfunded liabilities. \nIn other words, this is after we have already collected Social Security \ntaxes from your paychecks. This is what we are going to run short if we \nare to pay the benefits the Government promises. So if we are going to \ncontinue paying just today's level of benefits--adjusting this for \ninflation, of course--in today's dollars, we are going to be $20 \ntrillion short over the next 70 years.\n  Again, others would say: Well, if we can't do that, we will lessen \nthe retirement age, and that will lessen the debt; cut benefits by a \nthird. That will lessen the debt even more, or we are going to raise \ntaxes, which could eliminate it. But that is the plan they have \nproposed.\n  The biggest risk to our Social Security system today is to do \nnothing. There are a lot of people who say we can't really touch it, or \nmaybe we should raise taxes a little bit. Right now, proposals are \nfloating around to raise your FICA taxes by another 2.2 percent in \norder to maintain these benefits. That is like putting a Band-Aid over \ncancer; you can wait 5 years, but when you pull that Band-Aid off, the \ncancer is probably going to be much worse than it is today. So that is \nno cure.\n  In fact, to support Social Security we have raised taxes 52 or 53 \ndifferent times. People like to say they want to ``tinker'' with Social \nSecurity. If you get out the Washington dictionary and you open it up \nto ``tinker,'' it means a tax increase. They say, if we can only raise \nit 2.2 percent more, we can solve this problem. Well, if you believe \nthat, why have they done it 52 or 53 times? This would be 54.\n  How many more tax increases would have to be imposed in order to do \nthat? To keep promising Social Security benefits, the payroll tax would \nhave to be increased, some say, a minimum of 50 percent--a minimum of \n50 percent--not the 2.2, but a minimum of about 6.5 percent. Others say \nthat could be more than double in order to maintain it.\n  In fact, here are the payroll taxes on this chart. This is where we \nstarted in 1950. It was under 3 percent at that time. It started out, \nby the way, at 1 percent of the first $1,000 of earned income. It has \ngrown now. So it is 12.4 percent on $70,200, or somewhere in that \nneighborhood.\n  You can see how taxes have continued to increase to where we are \ntoday. But this red line shows the intermediate projections. These are \nthe best-guess estimates of what could happen. By 2030, our children \ncould be paying about 23.5 percent just for Social Security--not \nMedicare, just Social Security. You can add Medicare and then you are \nat about 28 or 30 percent. Then add in Federal taxes and it is 56 \npercent because that averages 28 percent. Then add in local taxes, \nsales taxes, property taxes, excise taxes, and everything else, and in \n30 years our children are going to be looking at tax rates as high as \n70 percent or maybe even higher because high-cost projections show that \nthis amount probably would not be 25 but it could actually be somewhere \ncloser to 28 or 29 percent. That would put our children well over the \n70-percent mark.\n  Is that what we want for our children, where, for every $100 they \nmake, they will take $30 or $35 home and the Federal Government gets \nthe remainder of it? I don't know how many children will vote in the \nyear 2030 for a politician who will keep a system such as this.\n  The diminishing return of Social Security: If you retired in 1960 or \n1955, you probably got back everything you had put into Social Security \nwithin the first year. It was a good investment for that generation. \nBut today, the average return on Social Security is less than 2 \npercent. If you are a young person today, by the time you retire, there \nis actually going to be a negative return. In other words, they would \nbe better off to put their retirement money in a tin can and bury it in \nthe backyard, and they would have more buying power in retirement than \nif they invested it in Social Security.\n\n  For many of the minority groups today, they are already in a negative \ncash-flow for Social Security because of age expectancy. So already it \nis beginning to hurt that portion of our population. To compare it, \nwhat if we invested it in the markets? The markets traditionally, over \nthe last 80 years, including the crash of 1929 and all the ups and \ndowns of the markets over the last 80 years, averaged a little over 7 \npercent in real rate of return. That is after inflation and all of the \nadjustments. It averaged over 7 percent in real rate of return. I don't \nknow how many people would line up at the window to invest in an \naccount that said: We are going to pay you less than 1 percent; in \nfact, it may be a negative percent. Right now, that is the only option \nyou have. You have no choice as to where your money is going.\n  What have we done in Washington? Everybody now agrees--the President, \nDemocrats and Republicans, the Senate and the House--that we need to \nlock it away to make sure all money collected for Social Security goes \nto pay for Social Security. We have introduced the lockbox. That means \nall the additional surpluses now are going to be set aside for Social \nSecurity retirement. That is very important. We need to continue to do \nthat.\n  Stop raiding the trust fund. The Social Security Protection Act, \nwhich I introduced, would automatically reduce nonentitlement spending \nof Social Security dollars. Our spending and revenues now are based on \nthe best estimates we can put together. The question is, Are we really \nserious about making sure we don't spend Social Security surplus money, \neven by accident?\n  We should have a protective mechanism in place. So if we estimate we \nare going to spend $1.8 trillion and we bring in a billion dollars less \nthan that, right now, the only option is to go to the trust funds to \nmake up the difference in spending. My bill would say we don't do that. \nWe would reduce spending across the board evenly by that amount to make \nsure we did not take any money from the Social Security trust fund.\n  Again, if that is our promise, if we are serious about doing that, we \nshould not say ``except to'' or make an exception. If we made an \nexception for $1 billion, you know there would be exceptions for $50 \nbillion. So we have to be honest in what we are doing. It might only be \n.0003 percent; it might be .01 percent. If instead of getting $100 we \nwould get $99, if that is what we need to do to protect Social Security \nfunds, I think we should do that. If that is our top priority, we \nshould live up to that priority.\n  When I was putting together the six principles of saving Social \nSecurity, I asked, what do we need to do if we are going to at \nreforming our securing retirement benefits for the future? First and \nforemost, we have to protect current and future beneficiaries. That \nmeans if you are on Social Security today, or plan to retire in the \nnear future, you should be assured that the Government is not going to \nreduce the promises it has made. In other words, you can retire at the \nsame age the Government says now, and your benefits will be there and \nprotected, and we are not going to raid your taxes between now and then \nin order to do this.\n  You basically made a contract with the Government when you started \nworking and you said, all right, I am going to put money into the \nsystem, and I expect to get the benefits when I retire. It is a \ncontract. You said you were going to do this, and the Government said \nyou are going to have the\n\n[[Page S1199]]\n\nbenefits. Late in the game, when you sit down and plan for retirement, \nin Washington they say: We don't have enough money in the budget \nanymore. We are going to have to make changes here and raise your \nretirement age, or cut your benefits, or maybe we need to raise your \ntaxes a little more. That is not the fair way to do that.\n\n  Allow freedom of choice. If you want to stay with the current system \nof Social Security, you have the option to do that. But also if you \nwant to move into a personal retirement account, be in control of your \nretirement and your investments and maximize those dollars, you should \nhave the freedom of choice to do that. Today, the Government gives you \nno choice. Washington knows better. Washington tells you what you have \nto do with your retirement. Somehow Washington doesn't believe you are \nsmart enough to plan for retirement. You might be smart enough to make \nthe money but not smart enough to put it away for yourself.\n  Preserve the safety net. That means you have to have a net there for \ndisability and survivor's benefits. Let's make Americans better off, \nnot worse off. So when you retire, you are going to have at least the \nbenefits promised, but even better if we can. My plan does that.\n  Create a fully funded system. We have proposed personal retirement \naccounts in the Private Security and Wealth in Retirement Act. Bottom \nline: No tax increases in order to do this. The easiest way is always \nto raise taxes. The hardest way is to make real reforms. The Personal \nSecurity and Wealth in Retirement Act provides for personal retirement \naccounts. I introduced it in the 105th Congress and last May 24. It is \nS. 1103; the Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act allows for \npersonal retirement accounts.\n  The plan provides for retirement security. I think it offers better \noptions for you. In other words, right now you have no options. The \nGovernment tells you what you are going to do. They tell you what you \nare going to pay in from your check. They tell you what your benefits \nare going to be when you retire.\n  You don't have an option on that. They also tell you at what age you \ncan retire. They give you more options.\n  Workers under my plan would pay 10 percent of their income. Right now \nthey are paying 12.4. That goes to Social Security. My plan would take \n10 percent of your income and put it into personal retirement accounts. \nThe other 2.4 percent we still have to collect.\n  That is part of the funding mechanism for those who wish to remain on \nSocial Security. That 2.4 percent, plus other means of financing, is \ngoing to have to go into the current Social Security Administration in \norder to fund that. We are going to talk about taking 10 percent of \nyour money and putting it into a retirement account, or a PRA, that \nwill be managed by a government-approved private investment company.\n  Firms will set up these retirement accounts--whether it is U.S. \nbanks, whether it is Citibank, Travelers, whether it is Lutheran \nBrotherhood, whether it is Norwest Bank, or whatever. They would set up \nthese retirement accounts based on safety and soundness--such as the \nFDIC account in which you put your savings accounts in a bank.\n  There would be very rigid safety and soundness measures to make sure \nthe money put into this account is going to be there when you retire. \nSo safety and soundness is first and utmost.\n  A couple of examples: On $30,000 of income, you are putting $3,720 a \nyear in to support Social Security. Under my plan you would put $3,000 \nof that into your personal retirement account, and the rest of it would \nthen go to the Government.\n  Just to show you the difference on this, they would be taking $3,720 \nand putting it into Social Security and then being allowed to take \n$3,000 and put it into a personal retirement account based on the \nmarket and what you could then hope to receive at retirement.\n  Under this example, this is what you would do. If you made $30,000 a \nyear for a lifetime and went to draw your benefits from Social \nSecurity, you would get about $10,668 a month. But if you could take \nthat $3,000 and put it into a personal retirement account and get the \naverage market return, you would have about $54,500 per year in \nbenefits. Compare 10.6 to 54.5. That is a big difference in what \nretirement accounts invested in the market could do compared to pay as \nyou go.\n  Let's take a couple of other income examples. This would be for an \naverage income family which has $42,000 or $43,000 a year in average \nincome. This is one spouse earning the average income in a household, \none spouse not employed outside the home, a one-worker family. If you \npaid in a lifetime the average earnings into Social Security, you could \nexpect to get about $29,000 a year in benefits. If you would have \ninvested these same dollars from the personal retirement account into a \nprivate mixed stock and bond market--in other words, more \nconservatively and maybe not the highest returns but more conservative \ninvestments--you would get at least $66,000 in return. If you had \ninvested in the market, you would have a return of nearly $140,000 per \nyear compared to $30,000 a year in return.\n  Let's take the same for a two-income, low-income family with both \nspouses working with an average low income over their lifetime. They \nwould get about $18,400 in benefits. But if they could put the dollars \ninto the personal retirement account and invest it in, say, the market, \nthey could get over $100,000 a year in benefits, or about $45,000--if \nthey put it into a mixed type and more conservative investment account. \nBut, either way, they are still much better off.\n\n  The reason Albert Einstein was labeled as ``the man of the century'' \nby Time magazine was because Albert Einstein at one time said the most \npowerful force on Earth is compounded interest.\n  That is what we are trying to show, because if you are working and \ndoing a pay-as-you-go system, you are getting $18,500. But if you use \nthis most powerful force on Earth--compounding interest--you can see \nhow it would compound. So your benefits would increase fivefold over \nyour lifetime in order to draw better Social Security benefits.\n  Is this a pipe dream or is this just speculation or whatever? No. \nThis is actual. Galveston County, TX, has a personal retirement \naccount, as does the entire country of Chile, as does about 120 other \ncountries in the world. Thirty other countries are doing this.\n  If you had a little history on our Social Security system, it is all \nbased or duplicated off of one that was started in Germany in 1880. \nBismarck at that time designed the system we have adopted as the model \nthat Chile had, and many other countries. In fact, in 1880, Bismarck \nset the retirement age at 65 years. The average worker in Germany in \n1880 was 49.5 years. When we adopted the Social Security system in this \ncountry, we set the retirement age at 65. The average life of a worker \nin this country was 59.5 years.\n  You can see what happened because as we have extended the life line, \nas people now enjoy 20-plus years of healthy retirement. The system was \nnever designed to do that. That is why so many limits are being placed \non it.\n  Let's look at Galveston County, TX, and how the employees there are \nreaping the benefits of a private retirement account instead of Social \nSecurity.\n  In about 1980, one of the administrators in Galveston County saw the \nloophole in the law. At that time, if you were a public employee and \nyou already had a retirement system, you did not have to join Social \nSecurity. You could remain with your own private retirement account.\n  By the way, the President's plan to reform Social Security is to make \nsure that all those accounts are closed, and everybody would be drawing \nfrom Social Security.\n  But in Galveston County, they saw this loophole and opted out of \nSocial Security, although the Government quickly closed that door so \nnobody else could. But that is what happened in Galveston County over \nthe last 20 years.\n  According to today's schedules, under Social Security a death benefit \nis $253.\n  My father died at the age of 61. For all of the money he paid in over \nhis lifetime, when he passed away his heirs received $253. That was \nall. In Galveston County the minimum death benefit is $75,000.\n  Disability benefits per month, if you are disabled under Social \nSecurity,\n\n[[Page S1200]]\n\ntotal about $1,280. In Galveston County, the disability benefits are \n$2,750 a month.\n  Retirement benefits per month: Social Security--again, currently we \nare basing this on average income--$1,280 a month would be about the \nbest you could get out of Social Security. In Galveston County, you are \nat nearly $4,800 a month--nearly four times greater in benefits in \nGalveston County than if you are on Social Security today.\n\n  There was a young woman who wrote an editorial to the Wall Street \nJournal about 2 years ago. Her husband passed away suddenly of a heart \nattack at 44. She was 42. They had three children. She received the \ndeath benefit, plus the benefits she receives from Social Security and \nfrom her private retirement account, which allows her to maintain her \nhome. If she had been on Social Security, her family would have been in \npoverty with the payments she would have gotten. Today, she can \nmaintain the home as she did before. In the article, all she could say \nwas: Thank God for Galveston County and the system they have.\n  What about moving to this new retirement account? If we move to the \npersonal retirement account, somebody 45 years old would say: I have \nworked now for 40 years. What happened to all that money I paid into \nSocial Security? What am I going to do? I can't afford to lose that--\nalthough you hear some people say: You can keep everything I have paid \nin; let me out of the system.\n  We have said those are dollars the Government has collected with the \npromise of paying you benefits. We know exactly how much we have \ncollected in Washington from you for Social Security. If it is $20,000, \nwe would give you a $20,000 recognition bond. That would be deposited \ninto your private account. Adjusted for inflation and interest over the \nyears, you could then cash this bond when you are 65, because that is \nthe way everything is based right now. If it is $30,000, you get a \n$30,000 bond. If it is $44,220, we would give you that as a recognition \nbond. But it would be one of your options to say: I am going to have \nthis credited to my account, and then I am going to begin my personal \nretirement system.\n  Again, taking care of today's Social Security recipients means that \nif an individual chooses to remain within the current system, the \nGovernment should and will guarantee the benefits--no age increase, no \nreduction in benefits, no tax increase, no ifs, ands, or buts. If one \ndecides to stay within the current system, this is what to expect your \ngovernment to do at the minimum, to guarantee your benefits, and not \nhear 5 or 20 years from now: I am sorry, we don't have the funds; we \nwill have to reduce your benefits.\n\n  We need to rely on this in order to make sure the system is well.\n  Preserving the safety net is my plan. The Personal Security and \nWealth in Retirement Act preserves the safety net for disadvantaged \nAmericans, so that no covered person is forced to live in poverty. \nToday, poverty is recognized at about $8,240. My plan says workers \ncannot retire with less than 150 percent of poverty. They have to have \nincome of at least $12,400--that is what workers receive in retirement.\n  We don't want anybody retiring in poverty. In fact, today about 18 to \n20 percent of Americans who retire--mostly women--retire into poverty. \nWe think we should have at least a safety net. Retirees have to have at \nleast 150 percent in order to retire so they don't go into poverty.\n  Funds that manage PRAs are required to buy life and disability \ninsurance to cover those minimum benefits. As with Social Security \ntoday, they are the safety nets for survivor and disability benefits, \nas I showed earlier with Galveston benefits. The Federal Government \nwill make up the difference for those who fall short of the minimum \nbenefits.\n  Perhaps someone has been in and out of the workforce or doesn't have \nenough money in that account, or they have had a minimum-wage job all \ntheir life and they cannot come up with the money to buy an annuity to \npay the $12,400 a year. For those individuals, which we believe is a \nvery small percentage, the Government will, in the only part that is \nany kind of entitlement or involvement by the Government at all, fill \nthat glass full so benefits are paid.\n  Perhaps a worker only had the dollars to buy an $11,000 benefit plan. \nThe Government would put in the additional dollars to make sure when \nthey retire their minimum benefit would be $12,400 a year.\n  Providing a safety net and soundness: The rules are similar to those \nwho apply to today's IRAs or 401(k)s and would apply to personal \nretirement accounts, as well. As banks operate under very strict rules \nof safety and soundness, the same type of rules are applied to the \npersonal retirement accounts to make sure the money in their account is \ngoing to be there at retirement, don't worry about it.\n  By the way, workers can't invest their money into a gold mine that \nevaporates and then be left with no retirement benefits. Again, this is \nthe safety net, the Government-sponsored plan, to guarantee retirement \nbenefits so you are not a ward of the State, you have the wherewithal \nto pay your way in retirement.\n  Now, workers can still have other IRAs, other savings accounts, they \ncan still have a stock portfolio. Only this narrow area will have the \nsafety net or the Government set-aside to make sure individuals have a \nretirement.\n  Investment companies that manage PRAs are required to have an \ninsurance plan to ensure at least a minimum of a 2\\1/2\\ percent return \non each account. That is not much, but compare that to today's less \nthan 2 percent and a growing number of less than zero in 20 or 30 \nyears. This maintains at least a floor for the return on your \ninvestment. That also would be written into the law.\n\n  Workers decide when to retire and when to withdraw their retirement. \nAs I said earlier, today workers don't have the choice or the options; \nthey have to do what the Federal Government says. They cannot retire \nuntil they reach a certain age. Benefits are determined by the Federal \nGovernment. The Government says what each person is going to receive as \na benefit. They have decided over the years what your contributions to \nthis package has been.\n  With our retirement plan, when one can buy an annuity to provide \nincome of 150 percent of poverty, anyone can retire anytime once that \nobligation is met. Once you have met the obligation to be able to buy \nan annuity that pays at least 150 percent of poverty, anyone can \nretire, or stop paying into the system and use that 10 percent of \nincome to do what you want, use it for other investments, or spend it. \nOnce an individual has met the threshold, they do not become a ward of \na State. Anyone can arrange regular, periodic withdrawals of money in \nthe account.\n  An individual 21 today making an average income--about $42,000 a year \ntoday--their whole life, tucking away those dollars, would have about \n$1.5 million in a bank account when they decided to retire. Annuities \ncost about $100,000 per $1,000 a month of annuity. If one buys an \nannuity to pay $1,300, one needs $130,000 in order to buy that annuity \ntoday. That leaves $1.27 million left in the bank account, in the \nsavings account. You can do whatever you want with that. You can take \nout periodic withdrawals; you can take a trip to Europe, and write a \ncheck to do it. This is your money, not the Government's money.\n  An individual can withdraw the portion of the PRA that is above the \nminimum retirement benefits, free of income taxes and earning tests. \nAll of these dollars placed into the retirement accounts are taxed \nbefore we put them in, as they are today.\n  I don't know if many realize this, but the Government taxes everyone \non the Social Security moneys that taxpayers put into the Social \nSecurity system today. It is taxed before the Government takes it out \nof their check. We do the same. The Government today, when an \nindividual withdraws Social Security, much of that is exposed to \nadditional Federal taxes, and it could be exposed to even more taxes as \npart of an estate. We are saying, once you have it in the account, it \nis your money tax free.\n  More choices for families with PRAs. In divorce cases, they are \ntreated as community property. Upon death, PRA benefits go to the \nheirs, without estate taxes. There are no taxes. If you pass away with \n$1.2 million in your account, that goes to your heirs when you die, not \nlike when my father passed away.\n\n[[Page S1201]]\n\n There was nothing after a lifetime of investment into Social Security \nexcept a $253 death benefit.\n  Under this plan, all the money remaining in the account goes to \nheirs--your children, your spouse, your church, wherever desired. That \nis what happens: Build up an estate that can be passed on to the next \ngeneration.\n  Workers may arrange PRAs for nonworking children, with workers able \nto put up to 20 percent of their income. We say now a minimum of 10 \npercent, with an option of up to 20 percent can be put into their own \naccount.\n  If one wants to retire at 55, put more money in to make sure you have \nenough to buy this minimum retirement benefit. Do it quicker and retire \nearlier. Do what you want, or put it into the account for nonworking \nchildren. A parent with five children could put 10 percent aside for \nhimself and 2 percent in each child's account. This gives your children \na headstart on retirement benefits.\n  To demonstrate how this money mounts up, by placing $1,000 into an \naverage account when a child is born, by the time that child reaches \n65, that $1,000 would be worth nearly $250,000 with just that one \ninvestment into the retirement account. For grandparents, that is a \ngood gift for grandchildren. That shows how it can grow. Additional \naccounts for children give a real leg up on their retirement benefits \nin the future.\n  No new taxes. Bottom line, we say we do not want to raise taxes. \nThere are things we need to do to finance this transition. As I said, \nthere is $20 trillion in unfunded liabilities out there. Somebody has \nto pay that. We have made the commitment to them. The question is, How \ndo we do that over the next 70 years so we do not put a tremendous \nstrain on any one generation? As I said, in the next 25 or 30 years \nalone, we could put a strain on our children or grandchildren of up to \na 70-percent tax rate in order to support the system if we don't make \nsome changes now.\n  Again, what this all means, the bottom line, is retirement income \nwill be there for all, whether one decides to stay within the current \nSocial Security system--that is a choice, if that is what you want to \ndo--or whether one chooses to build a personal retirement account. \nAgain, there is a choice. Individuals don't have to do what Washington \nsays; you can have a choice in what you want to do. Citizens can decide \nwhich retirement options work for them.\n  How do you want to do this? When the dollars are taken from your \ncheck, as they are today, deducted from Social Security, when the \ndollars are taken from you, you dedicate where you want the dollars to \nbe sent, which retirement fund is going to handle your dollars--whether \nit be Citibank, Lutheran Brotherhood, Norwest, or whatever it might be. \nYou decide where the dollars go. It goes into your account.\n  Also, you can tell that account holder: I want 65 percent in the \nmarket; I want 35 percent in Government bonds and securities. You can \ndo that. Each individual has control over how the investments are \nhandled.\n  Any person visiting the country of Chile, just ride in a taxicab and \nask the cabdriver: How much do you have in your retirement account? He \nwill pull out a retirement account passbook and state to the penny how \nmuch he has in the retirement account. That is his money.\n  They do not have their hands on it anymore. This takes Social \nSecurity out of the control of Washington and it puts it into the \npeople's control. They make the decisions of what to do and how to \nbuild their retirement.\n  Everybody is different. Families are different. Everybody's hopes and \nexpectations are different. Right now, Washington gives us that cookie-\ncutter, one system, and that is it. Our plan gives all the options so \nthe American people can provide and create a retirement system they \nwant.\n  With a PRA, an average Minnesotan could receive at least three times \ntheir current projected Social Security income, at least, and some of \nthe projections go as high as 5, 6, maybe even 10 percent.\n  The bottom line is, the system is under tremendous strain and we are \ngoing to have to do something to protect retirement benefits in this \ncountry. The question is, What type of retirement system do we want to \nleave our children and our grandchildren?\n  Again, there are going to be those out there and some on the campaign \ntrail today for President who are going to be talking about maintaining \nthe status quo. In other words, let's put a Band-Aid over this cancer, \nlet's raise taxes a little bit, and we will get by for a while. When \nthat Band-Aid is pulled off, that cancer is going to be even worse than \nit is today.\n  We have an opportunity today to make a decision that is going to be \nbetter for retirement; in other words, it is going to cost less and \nthere will be less pain in the transition. The longer we wait, it is \ngoing to be harder and more costly to make any kind of decision. We \nneed to do this soon.\n  Are we going to get it done this year? No, there is not enough time \nthis year to do it. It should be on the front burner when we come back \nin the 107th Congress in 2001, with a new President and the next \nCongress. It should be one of the first items we should look at: How \nare we going to save and support future retirement for our kids and \ngrandchildren in the future.\n\n  I am 52 years old today, but I have very few options. I might be \nstuck with the plan we have today because by the time we implement it, \nI will be 55, 56 years old. At that time, will I have the option to \nmove into personal retirement accounts? Maybe not.\n  We have to give our children and grandchildren at least the option to \nprovide a better retirement for themselves than what we have today. For \nmany people on retirement, if they are getting $800 a month and they \nthink that is great, maybe that is what they want their grandchildren \nto have. But if they have retirement benefits three or four times that, \nI think that is an option to give our children and grandchildren.\n  I hope to talk about this again in the near future.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Kansas is recognized to \nspeak for up to 30 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1201-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1201-S1203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ELIMINATE THE MARRIAGE PENALTY\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to address a couple of \nitems that are going to be coming before this body and the importance \nof our addressing them. One is the marriage tax that is so embedded in \nour Tax Code, and the other is lifting the Social Security earnings \nlimit. Both of these issues need to be taken care of this Congress. It \nis in the power of this Congress, particularly this body, the Senate, \nto deal with both of these items, and it is time we do it. I am going \nto be speaking out often about this until we get these measures passed. \nThey make sense. It is time we do it. The American people want us to do \nit. The House has passed both of these bills, and it is time we do so \nas well.\n  Our Tax Code is riddled with provisions that penalize America's \nfamilies. If that is not clear to date, it should be, and it will \nbecome increasingly clear as we discuss both of these issues, the \nmarriage penalty and the Social Security earnings limit. In fact, our \nTax Code regarding marriage penalizes marriage in over 60 different \nways, according to the American Association of Certified Public \nAccountants. That is a body of which the Presiding Officer has been a \npart in the past.\n  This is unacceptable. As my colleagues already know, one of the most \negregious marriage penalties occurs in the marginal tax rate bracket \nand in the standard deduction. I want to go through this because \neverybody hears about the marriage penalty tax, and it occurs in over \n60 places. The bill that passed the House and is currently being \nconsidered in the Finance Committee addresses it in several places, but \nnot all 60, but they are in several of the most important places.\n  I want to particularly talk about the marginal tax rate bracket and \nthe\n\n[[Page S1202]]\n\nstandard deduction. In fact, last year 43 percent of married taxpayers, \nroughly 22 million couples, paid an average of $1,489 more in Federal \nincome taxes than they would have paid had they remained single. The \nGovernment should not use the coercive power of the Tax Code to erode \nthe foundation of our society--the family. We must quit subsidizing and \nencouraging people not to get married and penalizing marriage.\n\n  The House passed a bill to provide marriage tax penalty relief for \nAmerica's families in the 15-percent marginal rate bracket and to \neliminate the marriage penalty in the standard deduction. The House-\npassed bill provides a good starting point for our discussions on \nmarriage penalty deduction and elimination. It does not do everything, \nbut it is a good starting point and key area with which to go.\n  Doubling the standard deduction, increasing the width of the 15-\npercent bracket, and fixing the earned-income tax credit will eliminate \nor reduce the marriage penalty for all filers.\n  According to the National Center for Policy Analysis, the highest \nproportion of marriage penalties occurred when the higher-earning \nspouse made between $20,000 and $75,000 per year. Clearly, we need to \nmake the marriage penalty elimination a priority for all families, not \njust a few. We must continually work to make our Tax Code better, to \nmake it fairer for America's families. I am hopeful we will be able to \ncorrect this gross inequity in our Tax Code this year.\n  I want to go through some examples of people in Kansas who have \nwritten to my office about the impact of the marriage penalty. People \nknow it is there, and they do not like it.\n  First, we can pass this bill in this body this year and get it to the \nPresident. We have to have an agreement between the Republicans and the \nDemocrats as to whether or not we are going to agree to pass this bill. \nI am calling on my Democratic colleagues to agree with us and pass \nsensible marriage penalty relief. They have it in their power to block \nus from doing this as well, but I hope they will come forward and say: \nWe do not want this pernicious tax to be on our married families. We \nare all for family values, and the central unit of that family is the \nmarried couple. We do not want to see placed on America's families this \naverage of $1,480 per family, on 22 million working couples who are \nmaking between the $20,000 and $75,000 limit. We do not want to see \nthat tax placed on them. We do not want people saying: I cannot afford \nto get married because of the Federal Tax Code. People are saying just \nthat now.\n  I want my colleagues to listen as I share some letters I have \nreceived from Kansas constituents about this very issue.\n  When I go home every weekend and talk with people, the marriage \npenalty tax comes up regularly.\n  Listen to this letter:\n\n       Dear Senator Brownback: My husband, a mechanic, and I are \n     working hard to raise our two daughters as well as we can on \n     his income. It is tight sometimes, but we get by.\n       After our littlest one, Emma, starts school I will be \n     returning to work at least part-time or \\3/4\\ time. Mitch and \n     I were looking forward to the extra income so we could pay \n     off our car, start saving for our girls' college education \n     and most of all, quit living month to month if something goes \n     wrong.\n       After doing our taxes this year we fiddled with the numbers \n     to see where a supplementary income would put us. We \n     discovered that my working much more than part time would put \n     us in a higher tax bracket and almost negate my income. In \n     short, my husband is punished for working nights and extra \n     overtime and I am punished for wanting to send my daughters \n     to college.\n       The best tax strategy that we could find would be to \n     divorce, let Mitch deduct the mortgage interest and I file as \n     the head of household with the girls. In short, the present \n     tax code has a significant incentive for shacking up instead \n     of marrying.\n\n  These are my constituent's words--rather blunt, but they do make the \npoint. She goes on to write:\n\n       Some people say that this tax cut is bad because it would \n     benefit the wealthy and the richest Americans. If they think \n     a mechanic and a secretary are the richest Americans, and are \n     opposed to the Richest Americans, then who are they for? \n     Obviously not mechanics and secretaries.\n       Please vote to remove the marriage penalty so our hard work \n     will mean something more than higher taxes.\n\n  Here is another letter. This one is from David:\n\n       Dear Senator Brownback: I am a college student at Washburn \n     University. My girlfriend and I have been thinking about \n     getting married for several months.\n       As part of the planning we went through our finances.\n\n  It sounds like a good idea to me.\n\n     I checked our taxes and found that if we were married this \n     year, we would have paid $200 extra in Federal taxes.\n       Granted that may not sound like much, but at $9 and change \n     an hour, $200 is a lot of money.\n       I calculated how much we could be making in a few years and \n     found that we will pay $600 more for being married than just \n     shacking up.\n\n  Again, a rather blunt statement, but put forward clearly.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Basically, we have to pay $600 for the privilege of being \n     married.\n       I always thought the government tried to reward \n     constructive, positive behavior through the tax code, but it \n     is punishing one of the most socially stabilizing behaviors, \n     marriage.\n       We don't think we or anybody else should be punished for \n     being married and hope you can do something about it.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       Dear Senator Brownback: I am writing to express my support \n     for The Marriage Tax Elimination Act recently passed in the \n     House of Representatives and to urge you to vote in support \n     of this measure when it comes to the Senate.\n       This legislation would address a serious inequity in \n     current tax law by eliminating the disparity that exists with \n     respect to the total ``standard deduction'' allowed two \n     married taxpayers versus the total ``standard deduction'' \n     allowed two single taxpayers. Tax policy should not \n     discriminate either in favor of or against two individuals \n     with respect to their decision to be married (or not be \n     married). Rather, the same total itemized deduction amount \n     should be allowed married taxpayers who choose to file \n     jointly as two individuals who file separately.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n\n  Is that just basic common sense, that if you are going to be married \nor if it is two singles, you should be taxed at the same level instead \nof having an increased tax for being married? It is pretty hard to \nexplain that policy to that constituent.\n  Here is another letter from a constituent:\n\n       Senator Brownback: We were notified that a Marriage Tax \n     Relief Act was pending in the Congress. We want to go on \n     record as supporting any measure that will roll back the \n     ``Marriage Penalty'' on America's families, including ours! \n     We trust that you are willing to vote YES on this bill.\n       Thank you, and God bless.\n\n  Here is another letter:\n\n       Dear Senator Brownback: I would like to thank you for \n     expressing your ideas and opinions on the marriage penalty \n     tax to the senate on behalf of the Kansas taxpayers.\n       Doubling the standard deduction for married couples, and \n     doing so as quickly as possible, lessens the blow with which \n     nearly 21 million couples are hit every year. I have seen \n     many people struggle with their taxes each year and I am \n     writing on behalf these people to recognize you for your \n     tremendous effort to make their lives easier. Thank you \n     again.\n\n  Here is another letter. This is from Salina, KS:\n\n       Dear Senator Brownback: I am writing to you about the \n     reduction of the ``marriage penalty''. I want to urge your \n     support to correct it. It is a misconception to regard it as \n     a tax cut. It is in fact a tax penalty that must be \n     corrected.\n       Two single people that choose to get married must not pay \n     more tax than two people that choose not to do so. That is a \n     penalty for getting married. Correcting this problem is not \n     ``cutting taxes''. It is merely restoring them back to the \n     way they were before the couple joined in marriage. Thus it \n     is not a tax cut. It is the correction of the penalty for \n     getting married. Please do the right thing.\n       Ask yourself what would a couple do with the extra money? \n     It will get spent. All those millions of dollars flow right \n     back into the economy and get taxed again. It really won't \n     hurt, it will help!\n\n  I like his positive attitude on that.\n  We get a lot of letters and comments from people about this being a \ntax, a penalty: Why do you say you are all for family values, yet you \nare willing to tax marriage, the central unit of the family? It just \ndoes not make sense to folks.\n  We are talking about a pretty substantial amount of money per married \ncouple--around $1,445 a year--for an average family. With that money:\n  They could pay the electric bill, which, if it averages $153 per \nmonth, they can do that over a period of 9 months.\n  They could pay for a week-long vacation at Disneyland. That would be \ngood for a family.\n\n[[Page S1203]]\n\n  They could make four payments on the minivan. Car payments for an \nAmerican minivan average between $300 and $350. They could make four \npayments.\n  They could have a nice $40 dinner 36 times. I do not know which \npeople would do that. Most working families go to McDonald's, and it \ndoes not cost $40. But if you want to spend $40, you can go out to \ndinner 36 times.\n  Working families could buy 1,094 gallons of gas at $1.32 per gallon. \nThat example is a little old. We could talk about energy policy if you \nwould like.\n  They could buy 1,268 loaves of bread at the rate of $1.13 per loaf.\n  I think you get the picture. But many families could do a lot with \nthat money.\n  I want to reiterate, we have the bill now to do that. It has passed \nthe House. It is in the Finance Committee. It is going to be here. It \nwill be up to this body to determine, are we going to let it on through \nor not?\n  The opposition has the right to stall this, to stop this bill from \nclearing on through. But this is not right for us to do as a matter of \ntax policy.\n  I am going to continue, and a number of us are going to continue, to \npush aggressively to get this tax relief through, get this penalty off.\n  Marriage in America has enough difficulties without being penalized \nby the Federal Government, as one of my constituents wrote. According \nto a recent Rutgers University study, marriage is already in a state of \ndecline in America. From 1960 to 1996, the annual number of marriages \nper 1,000 adult women declined by almost 43 percent. Someone might say: \nLet's tax it some more; maybe it will go down some more.\n  At the same time that fewer adults are getting married, far more \nyoung adults are cohabiting. In fact, between 1960 and 1998, the number \nof unwed couples cohabiting increased by 1,000 percent.\n  When marriage, as an institution, breaks down, children do suffer. \nThe past few decades have seen a huge increase in the out-of-wedlock-\nbirth and divorce rates, the combination of which has substantially \nundermined the well-being of children in virtually all areas of life. \nThat is according to many studies we have. It has adversely affected \nchildren physically and psychologically, their socialization and \nacademic achievement, and even increased the likelihood of suffering \nphysical abuse.\n  That is not to say all children in those circumstances are going to \nbe having those difficulties. They are not. Many single people struggle \nheroically to do a good job raising their children. Still, the total \naggregate result is that, over all, if you have this type of situation \nincreasing, you are going to negatively impact the physical and \npsychological health, socialization, and academic achievement of that \nchild, and even increase the likelihood of physical abuse. Do we want \nto encourage that more by continuing this pernicious tax? This is a tax \non children, a penalty on children. Study after study has shown that \nchildren do best when they grow up in a stable home, raised by two \nparents who are committed to each other through marriage. I guess we \nshouldn't need a study to tell us that, but we have them. Newlyweds \nface enough challenges without paying punitive damages in the form of \nthe marriage tax. The last thing the Federal Government should do is \npenalize the institution that is the foundation of a civil society. I \nbelieve we can and must start now to rid the American people of this \nmarriage penalty. I look forward to working with the chairman of the \nFinance Committee as well as my other colleagues to make sure we get \nthis job done.\n\n  I will continue to come to the floor day in and day out to push that. \nWe now have a bill to eliminate this major portion of the marriage \npenalty tax. It is going to be the choice of the Democrat Party whether \nor not we will pass it through this body. I hope they will come forward \nand say, yes, it is time to end the marriage penalty in America. Yes, \nit is time to end this tax on our Nation's children. Yes, it is time to \nend this penalty on 43 percent of the married couples in America. This \nisn't a tax cut for the wealthy. This is a tax cut for the family. It \nis not even a tax cut, it is just leveling the playing field and \nremoving the tax penalty. Clearly, we should do this.\n  One other issue of importance that will also be coming before the \nbody is the Social Security Earnings Test Elimination Act. That, too, \nhas passed the House of Representatives. Thank God for the work the \nHouse is doing in getting these bills through and over to the Senate. \nThis bill passed the House 422-0.\n  This is a bad law that has been on the books since the Depression \nera. You would have thought somebody would have stood up and said: I \nthought that was a good law all this time. Nobody did.\n  We should not use the coercive power of the Federal Government to \nprevent seniors who want to work from working. They have spent a \nlifetime paying into the Social Security trust fund. It is simply not \nfair to deprive them of their Social Security benefits simply because \nthey choose to stay in the workforce longer or choose to begin working \nagain after retirement.\n  I was talking with a constituent in Kingman, KS, who works at a small \nfactory in Kingman. He lost his farm during the decade of the 1980s, \nduring the farm depression. He is approaching retirement age and will \nbe there shortly.\n  He said: You really need to remove this thing for me and for a number \nof people. I lost my farm in the 1980s. That was my savings account. I \nhave to continue to work to earn enough money to support the family. I \ncan't afford to be penalized for working.\n  The very thing we need to be encouraging people to do, we are \npenalizing. Here is a man who has worked hard all his life. He is \napproaching retirement age, will continue to work, and needs to \ncontinue to work.\n  He said: Don't penalize me. Don't pull this away. I wish I hadn't \nloss the farm in the 1980s, but I did. That was my savings account. I \ndon't have one now. I need to work. Let me work and don't penalize me.\n  Without a growing on-budget surplus, it is possible to remove this \npenalty for America's working seniors. It is imperative that the Senate \npass this important bill so we can rid the Social Security system of \nits disincentive to work. Americans should be free to work if they \nchoose. Passage of this bill will help elderly Americans stay in the \nworkforce longer. It should be their choice and not ours. This bill \nallows people older than 65 and younger than 70 to earn income without \nlosing the Social Security benefits they have paid in their entire \nlife. It is an important bipartisan measure that passed overwhelmingly \nin the House. I expect it will pass in the Senate as well.\n  Chairman Greenspan even noted its important positive impact on the \neconomy to increase the potential in the labor force that would be \navailable.\n  This is another important measure that has passed the House. I call \non my colleagues: We must pass this legislation. Let's pass the \nMarriage Penalty Elimination Act. Let's pass this elimination of the \nSocial Security earnings test so we can allow people to work, so we can \nallow married families to be able to save up some money and not be \npenalized for the simple act of being married. It is in our power to \ndetermine whether or not we will do this. I call on my colleagues to do \nthat.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1203-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1203-S1204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  AFFORDABILITY OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this morning, I come to the floor to talk \nyet again about the issue of prescription drugs. I want to focus on an \nissue that Senator Daschle has, I think, been so correct in identifying \nas a priority, which is the issue of going forward with prescription \ndrugs as part of a program that offers universal coverage.\n  Of course, when Medicare began in 1965, the Congress made the \njudgment that there would be a program available to all eligible \nseniors, that coverage would be universal for eligible seniors and for \ndisabled folks. I think\n\n[[Page S1204]]\n\nit has been one of the unifying aspects of social policy in this \ncountry that all older people were covered. I think it is absolutely \nkey that as we tackle this issue of prescription drug coverage, and do \nit in a bipartisan way, we remember how important the principle of \ncovering all seniors is.\n  Now, I know there are colleagues on the other side of the aisle who \nfeel strongly about this issue as well. I am very pleased in having \nteamed up with Senator Snowe for more than a year. She and I are on a \nbill together, a bipartisan bill, which offers universal coverage. I \nalso appreciate my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, for being \nsupportive of this effort.\n  There are a number of reasons why universal coverage is so important, \nand Senator Daschle has identified it as a priority for Senators on \nthis side of the aisle. I want to talk for a moment about why I think \nit is so key in terms of designing a benefit properly. First, it is \nabsolutely essential to ensure that seniors have as much bargaining \npower in the marketplace as possible. We have all been hearing from our \nconstituents that many of them cannot afford the cost of prescription \nmedicine. I have been coming to the floor of the Senate and reading \nfrom letters where older people, after they are done paying \nprescription drug bills, only have a couple hundred dollars for the \nrest of the month to live on.\n  We are seeing all across this country that many older people simply \ncan't afford their medicine. If we are going to give them real \nbargaining power in the marketplace--and right now, to belong to an \nHMO, you have plenty of bargaining power--they can negotiate a good \nprice for you. But if you are an individual senior walking into a \npharmacy, you don't have a whole lot of bargaining power. In fact, you \nare subsidizing those big plans. If we design a prescription drug \nbenefit so as to offer universal coverage, this gives us the largest \navailable group of older people, the largest ``pool of individuals''--\nto use the language of the insurance industry--for purposes of making \nsure those older folks really do have bargaining power in the \nmarketplace.\n  As we address this issue of bargaining power, I happen to think it is \nimportant that we do it in a way that doesn't bring about a lot of cost \nshifting onto other population groups. That is why the Snowe-Wyden \nlegislation uses the model that Federal employees use for the purposes \nof their health coverage. As we talk about how to design this \nprescription drug program, I am hopeful we see universal coverage \nincluded. Beyond the fact it is what Medicare has been all about since \nthe program began in 1965, it is absolutely key to make sure older \npeople have the maximum amount of genuine bargaining power in the \nmarketplace.\n  Second, I think if we were to do, as some have suggested--\nparticularly those in the House--which is essentially to not have a \nprogram with universal coverage, but hand off a big pot of money to the \nStates, and they could perhaps design a program for low-income people, \nwe will have missed a lot of vulnerable seniors altogether. Their \nproposal--those who would hand off the money to the States to design a \nprogram for low-income people--as far as I can tell, would leave behind \naltogether seniors, say, with an income of $21,000 or $22,000, \nessentially a low- to middle-income senior. In most parts of the \ncountry, by any calculus, my view is that sum of money is awfully \nmodest altogether. I see these proposals that hand a sum over to the \nStates for low-income people as leaving a lot of seniors with $22,000, \n$25,000, or $28,000 incomes behind altogether.\n  If those individuals are taking medicine, say, for a chronic health \nproblem--they might have a chronic health problem due to a heart \nailment or something of that nature--they could be spending somewhere \nin the vicinity of $2,500 per year out of pocket on their prescription \nmedicine. One out of four older people who have chronic illnesses such \nas the heart ailment are spending $2,500 a year out of pocket on their \nmedicine. As far as I can tell, if they were in that lower- or middle-\nincome bracket, they would simply be left behind altogether under these \nproposals that would just hand over a pot of money to the States and \nuse this money for low-income people.\n  Many of the elderly people I described in income brackets of $22,000 \nor $28,000 and paying for chronic illnesses are the people we are \nhearing from now saying: If I get another increase in my insurance \npremium, I am going to simply have to leave my prescription at the \npharmacist. My doctor phones it in, and I am not going to be able to \nafford to go and pick it up.\n  I think it is extremely important that the design of this program be \nbuilt on the principle of universal coverage. That is what Medicare has \nbeen all about since the program began in 1965. It is what is going to \nensure that the seniors have the maximum amount of bargaining power. We \ncan debate issues within that concept of universal coverage so as to be \nmore sensitive to those who have the least ability to pay. I have long \nbelieved Lee Iacocca shouldn't pay the same Medicare premium as a widow \nwith an income of $14,000. I think we can deal with those issues as we \ngo forward, if we decide early on that the centerpiece of an effective \nprescription drug benefit ought to be universal coverage.\n  There are other important issues we are going to have to discuss. I \nthink there is now growing support for making sure this program is \nvoluntary. When it is voluntary, you avoid some of the problems we are \nseeing with catastrophic care and ultimately you empower the consumer. \nIt is going to be the consumer's choice in most communities to choose \nwhether they want to go forward participating in this prescription drug \nprogram, or perhaps just stay with the coverage they may have. We \nestimate that perhaps a third of the older people in this country have \ncoverage with which they are reasonably satisfied. If they are, under \nthe kind of approach for which I think we are starting to see support \nin the Senate, those are folks who would not see their benefits \ntouched; they could simply stay with the existing prescription drug \ncoverage they have today.\n  Let's go forward. I think Senator Daschle in particular deserves \ncredit for trying to bring the Senate together and for trying to \nreconcile the various bills.\n  Let's make sure we don't lose sight of the importance of universal \ncoverage. It is key to giving older people real bargaining power in the \nmarketplace--not through a government program but through marketplace \nforces, the way HMOs and insurance plans do. Focus on keeping the \nprogram voluntary.\n  I know there are colleagues on the other side of the aisle who share \nsimilar sentiments as the ones I voiced today. I particularly want to \ncommend my colleagues, Senators Snowe and Smith. They have teamed up \nwith me for more than a year now on a proposal that I think can win \nbipartisan support. In fact, we already have evidence of bipartisan \nsupport from the other side of the aisle because we got 54 votes on the \nfloor of the Senate about a year ago for a plan to fund this program.\n  I intend to keep coming back to the floor of the Senate. Today, I \nthought it was important to express what Senator Daschle spoke on \nrecently, which is universal coverage. I intend to keep coming back to \nthe floor of this body again and again in an effort to build bipartisan \nsupport for making sure vulnerable seniors can get prescription drug \ncoverage under Medicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1204-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

That being the case, Senator Leahy having approved this, we \nhave no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of \nfederal district Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Judge Paez was first nominated for this judgeship during the second \nsession of the 104th Congress--a time when all nominees to the Ninth \nCircuit got bound up with the difficulties we were having in deciding \nwhether to divide the Circuit. Once we established a Commission to \nstudy the matter, we were able to begin processing nominees to that \ncourt.\n  Judge Paez was renominated at the beginning of the 105th Congress, \nbut due to questions surrounding his record on the bench and comments \nhe made about two California initiatives, his nomination elicited \nheightened scrutiny.\n  Some have attributed this delay in Judge Paez's consideration by the \nfull Senate to sinister or prejudicial motives. And I can only respond \nby stating what those very critics already know in their hearts and \nminds to be true: such aspersions are utterly devoid of truth, and are \ngrounded in nothing more than sinister, crass politics.\n  As we all know, before any judge can be confirmed, the Senate must \nexercise its duty to provide assurance that those confirmed will uphold \nthe Constitution and abide by the rule of law. Sometimes it takes what \nseems to be an inordinate amount of time to gain these assurances, but \nmoving to a vote without them would compromise the integrity of the \nrole the Senate plays in the confirmation process.\n  And so, it has taken a considerable amount of time to bring Judge \nPaez's nomination up for a vote. Indeed, it was not before a thorough \nand exhaustive review of Judge Paez's record that I have become \nconvinced that questions regarding Judge Paez's record have, by and \nlarge, been answered.\n  Because such questions have been answered does not, in all instances, \nmean they have been answered to my complete satisfaction. But on the \nwhole, I am persuaded that Judge Paez will be a credit to the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. In so concluding, I do not want to diminish \nthe seriousness of the concerns raised about certain aspects of Judge \nPaez's record.\n  I was troubled by comments Judge Paez made about two California \ninitiatives on April 6, 1995, while sitting as a U.S. District Court \nJudge. At that time, Judge Paez gave a speech at his alma mater, Boalt \nHall School of Law, criticizing the passage of Proposition 187 and \ncriticizing the ballot measure that would later be known as Proposition \n209. He described Prop 209 as ``the proposed anti-civil rights \ninitiative'' and said it would ``inflame the issues all over again, \nwithout contributing to any serious discussion of our differences and \nsimilarities or ways to ensure equal opportunity for all.'' Judge Paez \nwent on to opine that a ``much more diverse bench'' was essential in \npart because how ``Californians perceive the justice system is every \nbit as important as how courts resolve disputes.''\n  When questioned at his hearing about these and other comments \ncontained in the speech, Judge Paez stated that he was referring only \nto the potential divisive effect Prop 209 would have on California. He \nacknowledged that the Ninth Circuit had in fact upheld the \nconstitutionality of Prop 209 and that this ruling resolved any \nquestion as to the legitimacy of the initiative. He also stated that he \ndisagreed with the use of proportionality statistics in Title VII or \nemployment litigation. And, perhaps most telling of his judicial \nphilosophy, Judge Paez stated that federal judges must ``proceed with \ncaution, and respect that the vote of the people is presumed \nconstitutional.''\n\n  Legitimate questions have been raised concerning whether his comments \nwere consistent with the Judicial Canon governing judges' extra-\njudicial activities, and Judge Paez maintains that his remarks fit \nwithin the exception set out in that Canon that permits a judge to make \na scholarly presentation for purposes of legal education.\n  I also raised concerns about a decision of Judge Paez's that would \nallow liability to be imposed on a U.S. company for human rights abuses \ncommitted by a foreign government with which the U.S. company had \nengaged in a joint venture. But it is a single moment in a lengthy \ncatalog of cases in which Judge Paez appears to have handed down solid, \nlegally-supported, precedent-respecting decisions.\n  Moreover, Judge Paez has earned a good deal of bipartisan support \nwithin his home state of California and his native state of Utah, and \nhas given me his word that he will abide by the rule of law and not \nengage in judicial activism.\n  For these reasons, I am not willing to stand in the way of this \nnominee's confirmation. It was during the Committee's thorough review \nof his record that I became aware of Judge Paez's credentials and \ncareer of public service. He is a Salt Lake City native who graduated \nfrom Brigham Young University and he received his law degree from Boalt \nHall.\n  Before becoming a Judge on the Los Angeles Municipal Court, he served \nas an attorney for California Rural Legal Assistance, the Western \nCenter on Law and Poverty, and the Legal Aid Foundation of Los \nAngeles--and during that time provided legal representation to a Korean \nWar veteran in danger of losing his home to foreclosure, victims of \nintentional racial discrimination, and others. In 1994, President \nClinton nominated, and the Senate confirmed, Judge Paez to sit on the \ndistrict court bench in the Central District of California.\n  Although I share many of my colleagues' concerns regarding the \nstability of the Ninth Circuit, none of us can in good conscience foist \nthose concerns upon Judge Paez--an entirely innocent party with regard \nto that Circuit's dubious record of reversal by the Supreme Court--and \nforce him into the role of Atlas in carrying problems not of his own \nmaking.\n  Indeed, that Circuit's problems--many of which appear to me to be \nstructural in dimension--call for an altogether different solution than \nthat which this body would seek to impose through its advice and \nconsent powers. And to that end, I have just [this morning] introduced \nlegislation with Senator Murkowski that is being held at the desk so as \nto enable immediate action by the full Senate--that would divide the \n28-judge behemoth of a circuit into two manageable circuits.\n  To return to the different subject of Judge Paez, I must concede that \nI have had concerns about his nomination. But on balance I do not \nbelieve that Judge Paez will contribute to the roguery that appears to \nhave infiltrated this circuit. I would not, as Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, vote for the confirmation of any nominee who I \nbelieved would abdicate his or her duty to interpret and enforce, \nrather than make, the laws of this Nation.\n  For these reasons, I will cast a vote in favor of the nomination of \nJudge Paez to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I hope a \nmajority of my colleagues will do likewise.\n  Mr. President, I also rise to speak on behalf of the nomination of \nMarsha S. Berzon for a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Ninth Circuit. Based upon Ms. Berzon's qualifications as a lawyer, \nI support her nomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n\n[[Page S1206]]\n\n  It cannot be disputed that Ms. Berzon's training and experience \nqualify her for a life of public service as a federal appellate judge. \nIndeed, Ms. Berzon's qualifications are unimpeachable, and her \ncompetence is beyond question. Ms. Berzon completed her undergraduate \nstudies at Harvard/Radcliffe College, and then was graduated from the \nBoalt Hall Law School at the University of California. After law \nschool, Ms. Berzon served as a judicial clerk--first for Judge James R. \nBrowning of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, \nand then for Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. of the United States \nSupreme Court.\n  For the last 25 years, Ms. Berzon has built a national reputation as \nan appellate litigator at a private law firm in San Francisco. She has \nargued four cases and filed dozens of briefs before the United States \nSupreme Court, and has argued numerous cases before State and federal \ntrial and appeals courts. In addition to representing private clients, \nMs. Berzon also has represented the States of California and Hawaii, \nand the City of Oakland, California. Ms. Berzon is uniformly described \nas honest, intelligent and fair-minded. Attorney J. Dennis McQuaid, \nwhom she opposed in a case, later stated that ``unlike some advocates, \nshe enjoys a reputation that she is devoid of any remotely partisan \nagenda and that her service on the court will be marked by decisions \ndemonstrating great legal acumen, fairness and equanimity.'' Another \nopposing counsel, Carter G. Phillips, said that in a case involving \ndelicate federalism issues, Ms. Berzon\n\n       . . . did an extraordinary job of presenting her clients' \n     position aggressively without overreaching. She presented \n     solid limiting principles that would allow the lawsuit to go \n     forward without placing too much of a burden on the State. I \n     thought her submissions, both written and oral, demonstrated \n     a significant effort to balance the respective interests \n     implicated by the legal issue. . . . Her advocacy \n     demonstrated skill, integrity and sound judgment. These are \n     precisely the traits I would want in a federal appellate \n     judge.\n\n  Simply put, Ms. Berzon appears to have the intellect, integrity and \nimpartiality to serve as a federal judge.\n  The fact that many of Ms. Berzon's clients have been unions should \nnot disqualify her from being confirmed. That Ms. Berzon has advocated \non behalf of unions--and, by all accounts, advocated well--cannot, I \nthink, be determinative of her qualifications. In her testimony before \nthe Judiciary Committee, Ms. Berzon testified that she is committed to \nfollowing the Supreme Court's Beck decision, which sets forth the \nstatutory rights of employees who object to their union dues being used \nfor political activities. Moreover, Ms. Berzon testified that, if \nconfirmed, she will make decisions based upon the law and the facts of \nthe particular case before her. No one has shown me evidence why I \nshould not take Ms. Berzon at her word.\n  In addition to having excellent legal training and experience as a \nlawyer, Ms. Berzon also has experience in legal academia. She has \ntaught law students as a practitioner-in-residence at Cornell \nUniversity Law School and at Indiana University Law School, and has \npublished articles on various legal topics. In my view, she will bring \nto the Ninth Circuit a significant measure of intelligence, experience \nand legal scholarship.\n  In conclusion, Ms. Berzon is well-qualified to assume a seat on the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. She enjoys a \nreputation among colleagues and opposing counsel for being a fair-\nminded, well-prepared, and principled advocate. I therefore will cast \nmy vote in favor of Ms. Berzon's confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1206-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1206-S1209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 761\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to appoint the \nconferees to S. 761, the Millennium Digital Commerce Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, has the \nleader cleared this with someone on this side of the aisle?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to the distinguished \nDemocratic whip, this is for conferees on this Millennium Digital \nCommerce Act. We have tried, over the past couple of weeks, to get \nclearance to appoint conferees.\n  The recommendation was that we have, I believe, 11 from the Commerce \nCommittee, 3 from Banking--6 and 5 and 2 and 1. For some reason, there \nhave been objections to that. There continue to be objections, but this \nis a bill that has broad support in the industry and on both sides of \nthe aisle. So I am confused and perplexed about why we can't get these \nconferees appointed and move forward to this conference. So it has not \nbeen signed off on, as I understand it. But since I talked to the \nDemocratic leader last week twice, I thought perhaps we had reached a \npoint where this could be done.\n  Mr. REID. I am confident we can work it out. But at this stage, I \nwill have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could be heard on this issue at this \ntime.\n  I don't understand, again, what the objection is to this procedural \nmotion. The House appointed conferees to this bill 2 weeks ago, and \nthey have been calling over saying, ``What is the deal?'' I understand \nthat perhaps there are other Senators who would like to be conferees \nfrom other committees. There is some indication that maybe the problem \nis they don't like the fact there are some Banking conferees. The House \nbill has several provisions that are clearly in the Banking \njurisdiction, and that is why we have recommended having three from \nBanking--two and one--so we can get this into conference and get it \nworked out.\n  There are a lot of us who realize there are Silicon Valley interests \nin this. We also have the Dulles corridor high-tech industry in \nNorthern Virginia that really wants this legislation completed. I don't \nthink it would be a long conference. So I want to highlight the fact \nthat we are anxious to get to conference.\n  I have addressed concerns as best I could. I don't think we can take \nBanking members off the conference. Maybe there is another way to solve \nthis problem. But since I was getting questions both from the high-tech \nindustry and from the House as to why we weren't going on to \nconference, I had to point out or emphasize what the problem was.\n  I would be glad to yield to the Senator from Michigan, the author of \nthis legislation. He probably knows more about it than any other \nSenator.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. If the majority leader will yield briefly, I thank him \nfor making another attempt to appoint conferees on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I share the majority leader's frustration over our \ninability to really move anywhere with this bill. This bill, the \nMillennium Digital Commerce Act, is a bipartisan bill. This legislation \npassed the Senate by unanimous consent. We worked together here to try \nto craft the legislation in a bipartisan fashion. The House companion \nlegislation passed by an overwhelming margin.\n  I understand--and the majority leader has just indicated it again--\nthere may be some Members who have concerns with the bill. But, \nobviously, going to conference is the usual procedure for moving \nlegislation. As I understand the request that has been put forward, \nthere would be six Democratic Senators on the conference committee, \nwhich is about 15 percent of the entire Senate Democratic caucus who \nwould then be able to participate in the proposal.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield on that point, I also note at \nthis time that I think the House only has perhaps five conferees. I \ndon't believe I have ever been to a conference where the House has one-\nthird as many conferees as the Senate. So we have already tried to \ninclude as many Senators as we possibly could.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I do think that is a sufficient number to guarantee the \nviews reflected by each side. They would be adequately represented in \nthe conference.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me ask the Senator something, if I may. This is a \nsophisticated title, the Millennium Digital Commerce Act. What does \nthis bill do?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Essentially, the legislation is designed to address a \nproblem we have now with respect to the\n\n[[Page S1207]]\n\nenforceability of contracts that are entered into electronically. A \nnumber of States have attempted to deal with this. This would be where \nparties, over the Internet, engage in some form of contractual \nactivity. A number of States have passed legislation--in fact, about 45 \nStates have done so. The problem is that each of these State laws is \ndifferent from the other. As a result of that, it has created a serious \npotential impediment to the expansion of electronic commerce because if \nthe laws of two different jurisdictions are different, somebody can \nhide behind that difference to argue that they did not have to fulfill \nthe terms of the contract.\n  Fortunately, the States are trying to work toward a solution, as they \nhave done in other areas of commercial activity. We have a Uniform \nCommercial Code, and the States are trying to work together to address \nthese kinds of interstate contracts. That will take time. Even after \nthey come to final agreement on a specific format or formula for the \nlegislation, it is going to take probably years for all the States to \nadopt it. So this would guarantee the enforceability of contracts \nentered into electronically in the interim. That is the approach we \nhave taken, and we hope it will therefore allow continuing growth in \nthe area of electronic commerce, which is, as you well know, becoming \none of the key sectors and key activities in our economy today.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to clarify a point.\n  As author of this legislation and as a member of the Commerce \nCommittee where this legislation originated--I am a member of that \ncommittee--does the Senator object to having banking representation as \na part of this conference?\n  I note that the House bill has several provisions that are clearly \nbanking-type provisions. Does the Senator see a problem with that?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I don't, for the very simple reason that in the House, \nthe House-passed legislation went beyond the scope of what we passed in \nthe Senate to include legislation, or to expand the use of this \nlegislation to transactions that involved securities and other \ntransactions which would fall under our Banking Committee's \njurisdiction. Had those been in the initial legislation we introduced \nhere, then the jurisdiction of this bill in the Senate might have been \naltered or in some way divided.\n  For that reason, I think there is a very valid argument for the \nBanking Committee, because of the broader nature of the legislation \nthat came to the House, to participate in the conference.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, which of the two Senators has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would be glad to yield to Senator Leahy, \nand I will come back to Senator Abraham, if he desires to have some \nadditional time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I wish to ask a question. Were we referring to the \nAbraham-Leahy substitute as it passed the Senate on digital signature? \nIs that what we are referring to? I ask that question of either \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering nominations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished majority leader for yielding. I \nask the question of either the Senator from Michigan or the Senator \nfrom Mississippi: Are we referring to the Abraham-Leahy substitute that \npassed the Senate on digital signature?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could try to respond, is the Senator a \ncosponsor of the legislation?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I believe so, with the substitute that I authored along \nwith the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LOTT. As is our tradition around here, it could be the Abraham-\nLeahy bill, or the Lott-Daschle bill, or something other bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is what I am asking.\n  Mr. LOTT. I assume the Senator has been interested and involved in \nthis.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask the question of the Senator from Michigan: Am I \ncorrect that the House only appointed members of the Commerce \nCommittee, as opposed to the Banking Committee?\n  Mr. LOTT. They appointed only five.\n  Mr. LEAHY. They did not appoint anyone from the Banking Committee?\n  Mr. LOTT. They did not appoint anybody from the Banking Committee, as \nI understand it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator.\n  Obviously, as one of the authors of this legislation, along with the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, I would like to see the law in its \npresent form. I just wanted to make sure, having spent enormous amounts \nof time with the Senator from Michigan and others to work out a \ncompromise that allowed it to pass unanimously from this body. Had we \nnot done otherwise, we would be in a position of having to make sure \nimprovements made in this body were preserved within the legislation.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I think that clearly would be the intent of our conferees. \nTherefore, I assume Senator Leahy would support getting conferees \nappointed and going to conference. Is that correct?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would be supportive of the Leahy-Abraham compromise.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Michigan. Senator Daschle is on \nthe floor. He may want to get involved in this.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, point of clarification: In the process of \nthe appointment of conferees, obviously each Chamber has to appoint \nthem based on the respective jurisdictions of the parts of this bill \nthat are before us; that is, the House bill as it finished the House \nand the Senate bill as it finished the Senate. Although I don't have an \nintricate knowledge of the jurisdictions of various areas in the House, \nit is my understanding that matters that pertain to the SEC and \nsecurities-related issues in the House fall under the Commerce \nCommittee's jurisdiction, whereas in the Senate they fall under the \nBanking Committee's jurisdiction.\n  I think that may explain the problem a little bit because in the \nHouse it is perfectly reasonable and appropriate that the Commerce \nCommittee alone be represented. They have jurisdiction over those \nprovisions that are securities-related as well as those that are \nrelated to the technology side of this. In the Senate, that is not the \ncase. Our Banking Committee, not the Commerce Committee, has \nresponsibility for those areas. I think that is part of the problem.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would be glad to yield to Senator Daschle \nor yield the floor, if he wants to speak on his own time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the leader yielding to me.\n  As we go through our daily schedules and responsibilities, I bet I do \na lot of things which are a source of concern for the majority leader. \nI am sure he is not surprised that the way this matter has been handled \nis a source of concern to me. We talk daily. Sometimes we talk hourly. \nSometimes I am sure we talk more than he would like. But, nonetheless, \nwe talk. To say we were surprised and disappointed that a unanimous \nconsent request could be propounded without any notification is an \nunderstatement. It is disappointing.\n  I hope we can avoid surprising one another. But, of course, we do it. \nThat is understandable. Certainly, the majority leader has every right \nto proceed in any way he sees most appropriate. I think it is a \nviolation of the trust and communication that we try to maintain. And I \nam very disappointed he sought to come to the floor without any \nnotification of the issue.\n  Let me say three things.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I apologize to \nSenator Daschle for what led him to make his comments.\n  First of all, the Senator will recall that last week we discussed on \na couple of occasions how we could work through getting the conferees' \nnames agreed to and through the body. This morning--I don't remember \nthe exact hour--we decided to have a colloquy on this issue. I assumed \nhe had been notified and that all of you were aware we were going to \ntry to get the conferees appointed and have a colloquy. I first \nrealized it had not been done when I saw the expression on one of our \nstaff members' face when I stood up and made the unanimous consent \nrequest. I assumed he had been notified, as he is when we do this sort \nof thing. I don't shift the blame to staff; I accept the \nresponsibility. I apologize to Senator Daschle because he should have \nbeen notified. I assure him we have done a lot of things already this \nyear together and I always notify him. We should have done that.\n\n[[Page S1208]]\n\n  Nevertheless, it doesn't diminish the need to get an agreement on \nconferees. I will be glad to work with him to get this done because \nthis is a bill that really is important to a large segment of our \nsociety.\n  My own son is also harassing me about how he wants to do e-commerce. \nHe is concerned about what he can do. He is doing business in Kentucky. \nWe are not only hearing from House Democrats and Republicans, asking, \nWhere are your conferees? This is also something my son is harassing me \nabout.\n  We have to get this worked out some way and real quick.\n  I think the Senator is entitled to an apology because of the way this \nwas handled. I would expect him to be notified.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader's \ngraciousness and accept the apology.\n  As I say, we have had a great working relationship this year already \non a lot of different issues. I appreciate very much the manner in \nwhich he has expressed himself on this particular situation.\n  Let me say to the issue, as he noted, we have attempted to resolve \nthis in the past. I give Senator Lott great credit for trying to find \nas many innovative ways in which to address what has been an \nirresolvable conflict.\n  We have indicated a willingness to go to conference so long as it \ninvolves the committee that was responsible for passing this \nlegislation. The Commerce Committee held hearings. They marked up the \nbill. They passed it. We are now at a point where the conference \nincludes conferees from the Commerce Committee in the House, and we are \nprepared as we move to conference to accept conferees from the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  The problem is, the chairman of the Banking Committee wants to be \npart\nof the conference, and, frankly, the Banking Committee didn't have \njurisdiction.\n  The Banking Committee is not represented on the House side. There is \nno reason that we can understand why the Banking Committee, in and of \nitself, ought to be involved in the conference when they didn't have \njurisdiction.\n  Certainly, the chairman ought to be heard and he ought to be \nrecognized as one who certainly has every right to express himself to \nthe conferees, as other Members. Let him go to the conference and \nexpress himself. Let him offer suggestions on the Senate floor.\n  But to make him a conferee when we have already agreed that the \nCommerce Committee could move forward, could accomplish what I think is \nunanimous support for the legislation--I am sure we could achieve that \nat some point, and it would be the fastest and most meaningful way with \nwhich to get it done.\n  I am hopeful we can do that. There is no reason for this legislation \nto be delayed anymore. Let's have the conferees work their will. Let's \nget this legislation passed. Like Senator Lott, I think there are a lot \nof people out there, including his son, who ought to see the Senate \nact. I desire that no less than he. Hopefully, we can do it soon.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I note the House bill includes an entire \ntitle pertaining to the use of electronic signatures in securities \ntransactions. That language falls under the jurisdiction of the House \nCommerce Committee, but in the Senate, the jurisdiction is in the \nBanking Committee. Clearly, there is Banking Committee jurisdiction in \nthis legislation in the House bill.\n  Also, let me get specific about what and whom we are talking about. \nWe are talking about three very thoughtful Members of the Senate who \nhave a real interest in these electronic signatures and securities \ntransactions. They are: Senator Gramm, the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee from Texas; Senator Bennett from Utah, who had been very much \ninvolved in our efforts to pass the Y2K legislation last year and in a \nnumber of areas, including cyberterrorism--he is very knowledgeable in \nthis whole area--and Senator Sarbanes, the ranking member on the \nBanking Committee.\n  These are not three Senators who would be anything but instructive in \nsharing information in an area in which they have a greater knowledge \nthan the Members of the Commerce Committee.\n  Did the Senator from Michigan wish to comment further?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I think the majority leader has outlined the \njurisdictional situation well.\n  I reiterate, had the bill that the House passed been the bill that \nwas introduced here, clearly the jurisdiction on the Senate side would \nhave been differently arranged in some fashion. I don't know if it is \ncalled sequential jurisdiction or what, but provisions would have \nfallen under the Banking Committee's domain.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me conclude by saying again to Senator Daschle, we \ntalked last week and we both tried a couple of innovative ideas as to \nhow to work this out. I will continue to do that because I think we \nneed to get the conferees appointed. I don't recall any situation quite \nlike this, in the last year or two anyway. We ought to be able to find \na way to get the conferees appointed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I share the desire expressed by the majority leader to \nget this done. I want to publicly, again, commend Senator Leahy for all \nof his leadership and effort to get the Senate to this point. He spoke \nearlier and I appreciate very much his willingness to stay committed \nand his persistence in getting the Senate to a point where we actually \ncould see this become law.\n  Maybe there is a way, if we go beyond Commerce jurisdiction, to \ninclude the leadership of the Judiciary Committee and the leadership of \nthe Banking Committee and maybe expand it to include a lot more Members \nthan just Commerce Committee members.\n  As Senator Lott noted, we can perhaps try to find another innovative \nmix of participants. Certainly if this happens, the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont ought to be a part of the conference. I am sure we \ncan work it out at some point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Before we conclude, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted letters from a number of organizations that have called on the \nSenate to move to appoint conferees.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             American Electronics Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 2000.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Senate Democratic Leader, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: On behalf of the American Electronics \n     Association (AEA), I urge you to appoint conferees on S. 761, \n     the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act \n     (``E-Sign''), which was passed by the Senate by unanimous \n     consent on November 19, 1999. As you know, the House passed \n     its version of E-Sign by a margin of 356-66 on November 9, \n     1999.\n       AEA is the largest high-technology trade association in \n     America, representing over 3,000 companies who develop and \n     manufacture software, electronics and high-technology \n     products. Our member companies range from industry leaders \n     such as Intel, Motorola, Compaq, Microsoft and America \n     Online, to small and medium sized high-technology start up \n     ventures.\n       Passage of the E-Sign bill is one of AEA's top legislative \n     priorities for this session of Congress. As you know, our \n     members conduct a tremendous amount of business online. In \n     order to continue the growth of online commerce, companies \n     need to know that they are operating in an atmosphere of \n     legal certainty. The E-Sign bill would establish certainty in \n     online contracting and promote e-commerce by recognizing the \n     validity and enforceability of electronic signatures and \n     records.\n       It is now time to move forward with this legislation. The \n     Senate Democratic leadership needs to appoint conferees and \n     move the process along. If there are any legitimate consumer \n     concerns they can be ably addressed in conference.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on this most important \n     matter. Please feel free to contact me if I may be of any \n     assistance to you and I look forward to working with you on \n     this and other issues of concern to the high-technology \n     community.\n           Very Truly Yours,\n     William T. Archey.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Business Software Alliance,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 1, 2000.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I am writing to you on behalf of the \n     Business Software Alliance* to urge prompt action by the \n     Senate on S. 761, the Millennium Digital Commerce Act. This \n     bill was passed by the Senate last November, and a similar \n     bill, H.R. 1714, The Electronic Signatures in Global and \n     National Commerce Act, was approved by the House. It is our \n     understanding that further action on these bills is now \n     awaiting\n\n[[Page S1209]]\n\n     the appointment of conferees by the Senate so that \n     reconciliation of the two bills can proceed. We urge you to \n     act quickly.\n       Electronic commerce is now a reality. Using electronic \n     networks to purchase goods and services, as well as conduct \n     financial transaction, has rapidly gained tremendous consumer \n     acceptance. A number of legal elements are needed to ensure \n     the continued development of the electronic marketplace. Key \n     among these is ensuring that digital signatures, and other \n     forms of digital authentication, receive substantially the \n     same legal treatment as their pen and ink counterparts. \n     Likewise, the authorization of electronic disclosures in e-\n     commerce transactions would be an important step forward. It \n     is critically important to clarify and update the law in \n     these areas, which would deliver a boost to e-commerce and \n     the economy.\n       S. 761 is one of the top legislative priorities for \n     software and computer companies for this Congress, and we \n     urge you to appoint conferees at the earliest possible date.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Robert W. Holleyman II,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Securities Industry Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 2000.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: On behalf of the Securities Industry \n     Association (SIA) and our member firms I am writing to urge \n     your prompt action on the conference committee to reconcile \n     pending electronic authentication legislation (H.R. 1714 and \n     S. 761). The House has appointed their conference committee \n     members and SIA encourages the Senate to do the same. We ask \n     that you do all within your power to appoint the committee \n     members as soon as possible.\n       After many delays this very important legislation is once \n     again being detained. Electronic authentication legislation \n     will play a vital role in expanding electronic commerce. It \n     will not only allow the business community to continue to \n     compete nationally and globally but it will also provide the \n     consumer with choices he did not have before.\n       Electronic authentication legislation, when completed and \n     signed into law, will be historic in the effects it will have \n     on the marketplace. But, quick action is needed and with each \n     delay another missed opportunity passes by. SIA thanks you \n     for your leadership and attention to this important issue and \n     encourages you to name conference committee members quickly.\n           Sincerely,\n     Steve Judge.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Coalition for E-Authentication,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 2000.\n\n     Subject: Conference on Electronic Signature Legislation (S. \n         761/H.R. 1714)\n\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate.\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Whip, U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Minority Leader Daschle and Minority Whip Reid: The \n     Coalition on Electronic Authentication (CEA), which includes \n     many of the Nation's leading electronic commerce companies, \n     is writing to urge you to take all steps necessary to \n     expeditiously begin the conference on the Electronic \n     Signature legislation passed by both Houses last Fall.\n       Now, with a tight legislative calendar, it is imperative \n     that the conference begins as soon as possible so Congress \n     can complete work on its most important high-tech legislative \n     initiative this year. The House has appointed conferees, as \n     have the Senate Republicans. Now it is time to complete \n     conferee selection so the conference can move forward.\n       When enacted, Electronic Signature legislation will be a \n     truly historic step. It will have an immediate and dramatic \n     impact on the growth of electronic commerce and the Internet \n     because it will create, for the first time, the legal \n     certainty required to permit electronic signatures to become \n     widely used nationally by both consumers and businesses. \n     Electronic Signature legislation is essential to help \n     businesses of all kinds expand their use of electronic \n     commerce and meet their customers' growing expectations on \n     how business should be transacted over the Internet. Most \n     importantly, consumers will benefit from the increased \n     security, convenience, and lower costs associated with online \n     business transactions. In addition, with this legislation, \n     businesses will be able to greatly expand their use of \n     business-to-business electronic commerce in ways that will \n     significantly lower their costs.\n       Therefore, we respectfully urge you to do everything \n     possible to appoint conferees expeditiously, so the \n     conference can meet and conclude its work as soon as \n     possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Coalition for Electronic\n                                                   Authentication.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1209-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1209-S1223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NOMINATIONS OF RICHARD A. PAEZ AND MARSHA L. BERZON--Continued\n\n  Mr. REID. I rise to speak on the comments and statements made by \nSenator Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  First, Senator Hatch and I don't always agree on substantive issues. \nI think the country is well served with the leadership of the Judiciary \nCommittee, the Senator from Utah, and the Senator from Vermont. These \ntwo men worked tireless hours to try to clear one of the busiest \ncommittees we have. I personally wish there were more nominations \ncleared. I have the greatest respect for Senator Hatch, and, of course, \nmy dear friend, the Senator from Vermont.\n  However, this Ninth Circuit issue is something that should be \napproached cautiously. We have done that. I say to my friend from Utah \nand the Senator from Alaska, who introduced legislation, as I said \nearlier today, we need to take a look at what the White commission said \nshould be done with the Ninth Circuit. They spent a year's period of \ntime listening to witnesses and using their experience and his \nexperience as a member of the U.S. Supreme Court as to what should \nhappen to the Ninth Circuit. They came up with the decision after they \nreviewed all the alternatives, and the decision was not to split the \nNinth Circuit but to change the way it was administered. I think that \nis something at which we need to take a close look.\n  Senator Lott, the majority leader, talked about his son being \ninvolved in the last issue before the body. I say candidly I have had \ntwo sons, one of whom was the administrative assistant for the chief \njudge of the Ninth Circuit, my son Leif; and my son Key, who is \npresently a clerk for the chief judge of the Ninth Circuit, Procter \nHug. I have a keen interest there not only because my two sons have \nworked for the chief judge of the Ninth Circuit, but, in fact, the \nchief judge of the Ninth Circuit is a Nevadan, a graduate of the \nUniversity of Nevada at Reno and Stanford School of Law, and has \nrendered great credit to this country, the Ninth Circuit, and the State \nof Nevada.\n  In short, let's not beat up on the Ninth Circuit because there are a \nlot of people in the circuit. Let's take a look at what should be done \nwith the Ninth Circuit. I think the starting point should be what \nJustice White's commission said. If there were a few hearings held in \nthe Judiciary Committee, I think we could move on to resolve this \nproblem.\n  I am happy we are moving forward on these two nominations. It is \nsomething that should have happened some time ago. We are moving \nforward on them. Based upon the statements made by Senator Hatch, there \nshould be bipartisan support for both of these nominees. I hope \ntomorrow, or whenever it is decided by the leadership that we will vote \non them, that there are overwhelming votes in support for Judge Paez \nand Judge Berzon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my friend from \nNevada. I also want to commend the distinguished senior Senator from \nUtah for his support of Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon.\n  Today, we are going to take up the long delayed nomination of Judge \nJulio Fuentes for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. It \nis long delayed; Judge Fuentes was nominated 365 days ago. We tried for \na whole year to get his nomination moving. He was finally included in a \nconfirmation hearing on February 22, then on to the Judiciary Committee \n2 days later, then reported without a single objection.\n  Now, I understand it came on the calendar yesterday and the \ndistinguished majority leader scheduled it immediately for a vote. I \nthank him for doing that. No need to linger, especially after waiting a \nyear to get his hearing and a vote.\n  Moving at once from the hearing, quickly to a committee agenda and to \ncommittee consideration and on to the floor is how we used to proceed. \nIn the days before 1994, nominees were favorably reported by the \nJudiciary Committee, then routinely considered by the Senate within a \nday or so thereafter. That was before the unfortunate practice that has \ndeveloped in the last 6 years, where oft times extremely well-qualified \nnominees are held for long times--weeks, months, sometimes years.\n  I am glad in this case, at least, while he had to wait almost a year \nfor a hearing, once we got the hearing, the\n\n[[Page S1210]]\n\nnomination is being moved very quickly.\n  I look forward to Julio Fuentes' confirmation. I congratulate the two \nSenators from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg and Mr. Torricelli, for their \nlongstanding support.\n  Having said that, we should look at where we are. We have 76 current \nvacancies on the Federal judiciary and 9 more on the horizon. Last \nmonth, the Judicial Conference renewed its request for an additional 59 \njudgeships and taking 10 of the existing temporary ones and making them \npermanent. There are only 22 weeks left in session this year. We should \nget moving if we are going to fulfill our constitutional responsibility \nand help the President fill these vacancies.\n  In the first 2 months of this year, the Senate has only confirmed \nfour judicial nominations--two a month. Incidentally, having waited for \nsome time to even have their hearings and have their vote, they were \nvoted overwhelmingly. Two of them were confirmed by votes of 98-0, \nwhich makes one wonder why in Heaven's name they were held up so long. \nThe other two did have opposition. They had two votes against them: 96 \nfor them, 2 against them. Again, one wonders what held them up so long. \nIn fact, they had all been reported favorably last year, or, as someone \npointed out, last century, and voted on favorably this century. There \nare still three very important nominees reported last year to be taken \nup.\n  The distinguished majority leader and the distinguished minority \nleader had a colloquy last November 10 talking about them. I fully \nexpect them to be voted up or down. The three are Richard Paez, Marsha \nBerzon, and Timothy Dyk. Each has waited more than 23 months for Senate \naction. The Los Angeles Times calls Judge Paez the Cal Ripken of \njudicial nominations. This distinguished Hispanic, a man with one of \nthe highest ratings ever to come before the Senate, one of the most \nsterling backgrounds of any nominee by either Republicans or Democrats, \nthis distinguished jurist has waited more than 4 years. That is \nunforgivable. We should do our constitutional duty and vote up or vote \ndown, not vote maybe.\n  I am glad the majority leader has agreed to bring them to a Senate \nvote before the Ides of March. The nominees deserve to be treated with \ndignity and dispatch, not delayed for years.\n  Judge Paez has been pending for over 4 years. He has the strong \nsupport of his home State Senators and of local law enforcement. He has \nhad a distinguished judicial career in which he has served as a State \nand Federal judge for I believe 19 years. His is a wonderful American \nstory of hard work, fairness, and public service. He and his family \nhave much of which they can be proud. Hispanic organizations from \nCalifornia and around the country have urged the Senate to act \nfavorably and soon.\n  I hope we do the right thing when we are called upon to vote. As I \nrecall, when Judge Sonia Sotomayor, another outstanding district court \njudge, was nominated to the Second Circuit and her nomination was \ndelayed by this Senate, apparently she was so extremely well qualified, \nsome feared if we confirmed her too quickly, she might possibly be \nconsidered as a Supreme Court nominee, and that is why she was held up \nthrough all kinds of secret holds. It was not the Senate's finest \nmoment. In fact, after all the delay in Judge Sonia Sotomayor's case, \nit was interesting that not a single Senator who voted against her \nconfirmation and not a single Senator who delayed her confirmation \nuttered a single word against her.\n  Any Senator can vote as he or she sees fit, but I hope in the case of \nJudge Richard Paez, where his nomination has been delayed for over 4 \nyears--the longest period in the history of the Senate--that those who \nhave opposed him will show him the courtesy of using this time to \ndiscuss with us any concerns they may have and explain the basis for \nthe negative vote against a person so well qualified for this position.\n  I believe we should come to a vote on Timothy Dyk. We should have \ndone so long before now. He was first nominated to a Federal vacancy in \nApril of 1998. After having a hearing and being reported favorably, the \nSenate in September 1998 left without action. The President had to \nresubmit the name. He was renominated in January 1999, favorably \nreported again in October 1999.\n\n  Again, he is a man with a tremendous background. He is the only \nperson I can remember clerking for three Supreme Court Justices. He is \nsupported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of \nManufacturers, and others. I hope we will get on with this nomination.\n  I look forward to the Senate finally approving the nomination of \nMarsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. One-quarter of the \nactive judgeships authorized for that court have been kept vacant for \nseveral years. The Judicial Conference recently requested that Ninth \nCircuit judgeships be increased, in light of its workload, by an \nadditional five judges. That means that while Ms. Berzon and several \nother nominees have been waiting for confirmation, the court actually \nhas been doing its work with 10 fewer judges than it needs.\n  Marsha Berzon is an outstanding nominee. She is an exceptional lawyer \nwith extensive appellate practice, including a number of cases heard by \nthe Supreme Court. She has the highest rating from the American Bar \nAssociation and the support of both the Senators from California.\n  It may well be coincidence, as someone suggests, that if you are a \nwoman or a minority, you take a lot longer getting through the Senate. \nThat is the way it has been the last 5 years.\n  The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court said:\n\n       Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time \n     for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. \n     . . . The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any \n     particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry, \n     it should vote him up or vote him down.\n\n  Which is exactly what I would like.\n  We had one minority nominee, an extremely well-qualified individual, \nJorge Rangel. He became tired of waiting. He got into this block of, if \nyou are a minority or a woman, one seems to take longer. He said to the \nPresident:\n\n       Our judicial system depends on men and women of good will \n     who agree to serve when asked to do so. But public service \n     asks too much when those of us who answer the call to service \n     are subjected to a confirmation process dominated by \n     interminable delays and inaction. Patience has its virtue, \n     but it also has its limits.\n\n  Jorge Rangel withdrew.\n  All three of the nominees reported last year and before have been \nextremely patient. Each remains among the 10 longest pending judicial \nnominations before the Senate, and one has waited the longest of \nanybody in the Senate's history.\n  Some say, if it is a Presidential election year, we have to slow \nthings down--the so-called Thurmond rule. Sure, if we are within a \ncouple months of a Presidential election, we might slow things down. \nBut before people justify the fact we have only moved four judges this \nyear, I remind my colleagues of what happened in Presidential election \nyears past.\n  Let's take a few of the Presidential election years since I have been \nhere: 1980 was a Presidential election year. We confirmed 64 judges \nthat year; 1984 was a Presidential election year, and we confirmed 44 \njudges that year.\n  Let me take 1988, when President Reagan was at the end of his second \nterm, as much of a lame duck as one could possibly be. There was a \nDemocratic majority in the Senate. We could have done the same thing to \nPresident Reagan that the Republicans have been doing for years to \nPresident Clinton, but instead we confirmed 42 of his nominees.\n  A better example: In 1992, under President Bush, when he was about to \nbecome a lame duck President, during a Presidential election year, \nwhere Democrats were in the majority, we confirmed 66 judges, as \ncompared to the 4 who have been confirmed this year. At the end of \nPresident Bush's term, with Democrats in the majority, we confirmed 66.\n  My friend from New York may be interested in knowing that in 1996, \nagain at the end of the first term of President Clinton, where \nRepublicans were in the majority--do you know how many were confirmed? \nSeventeen. Democrats confirmed 66 of a Republican President's nominees; \nRepublicans confirmed 17 of a Democrat President's nominees.\n  What happens is qualified nominees, such as Richard Paez or Marsha \nBerzon\n\n[[Page S1211]]\n\nor Tim Dyk, instead of being treated with dignity and dispatch, are \ndelayed for years--or those like Jorge Rangel, they say: We cannot put \nup with the delay anymore. We withdraw our name.\n  Then we have to understand what this does to people who have offered \nthemselves for this public service. But we have to also ask: What does \nit do to the independence of our Federal judiciary, the independence \nthat is praised worldwide?\n  So if Judge Fuentes is confirmed this afternoon, as I fully expect he \nwill, I congratulate him because he will be the first judicial \nnomination both reported by the Judiciary Committee and confirmed by \nthe Senate this year.\n  I would hope that would give some indication that we might move \nforward with the nominations of Richard Paez, Marsha Berzon and Tim Dyk \nfrom years past, as well.\n  I am glad we are finally going to have the opportunity on this \nextremely well-qualified nominee to move forward to the Third Circuit. \nWe will move forward on Judge Julio Fuentes, as I say, an outstanding \nHispanic nominee, an outstanding American, to the Federal judiciary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from New \nHampshire for allowing me to speak for a brief period of time before \nhim. I saw those books piled up on his desk and realized if I did not \nget my words in now, I might not ever get them in.\n  I very much appreciate his graciousness.\n  I also thank my colleague from Vermont for, as usual, his intelligent \nand considerate words. I also thank the chairman of our Judiciary \nCommittee for bringing this nomination forward and for, just as \nimportantly, announcing he will support the nomination of Judge Paez.\n  Mr. President, first, I rise in support of the nomination of Judges \nPaez, Berzon, Fuentes, and Dyk. But, more importantly, I rise to talk \nabout the process very briefly. For instance, we do not have any \nproblem with the Senator from New Hampshire debating, to the end, \nwhether Judge Paez should be a judge. We have a problem that he had to \nwait 4\\1/2\\ years to do it.\n  The basic issue of holding up judgeships is the issue before us, not \nthe qualifications of judges, which we can always debate. The problem \nis it takes so long for us to debate those qualifications. It is an \nexample of Government not fulfilling its constitutional mandate because \nthe President nominates, and we are charged with voting on the \nnominees.\n  The Constitution does not say if the Congress is controlled by a \ndifferent party than the President there shall be no judges chosen. But \nthat is sometimes how the majority has functioned.\n  Second, by not filling vacancies, we hamper the judiciary's ability \nto fulfill its own constitutional duties.\n  Our courts--my own in New York State--have large backlogs. We have \nthree vacancies in New York: One in the eastern district; two in the \nsouthern district. We had four, and I thank the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee for approving George Daniels last week. But we \nstill have vacancies.\n  I also plead with my colleagues to move judges with alacrity--vote \nthem up or down. But this delay makes a mockery of the Constitution, \nmakes a mockery of the fact that we are here working, and makes a \nmockery of the lives of very sincere people who have put themselves \nforward to be judges and then they hang out there in limbo.\n  Judge Paez, Judge Berzon, Judge Dyk, and Judge Fuentes are extremely \nqualified. I urge all of my colleagues, at long last, to vote for their \nconfirmation.\n  Again, I very much appreciate the Senator from New Hampshire for \nallowing me to speak for this brief moment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I was very much intrigued \nby the remarks of my colleagues from New York and Vermont a few moments \nago, talking about how we should move on in the process and that there \ndoes not seem to be much of a history of blocking nominees and that it \nis not good for the constitutional process.\n  I think the constitutional process is very clear that the Senate has \nthe right and the responsibility, under the Constitution, to advise and \nconsent. That is exactly what I intend to do in my role as a Senator as \nit pertains to these two nominees before us.\n  Let me summarize where I think we are on the issue of judicial \nnominees in general.\n  It is no secret that I am opposed to Judge Berzon and Judge Paez, as \nmany of my colleagues on this side of the aisle are, I hope. At least \nthat is what I am told.\n  The issue, though, is whether it is OK to block judicial nominees. We \nhave heard from a couple of my colleagues in the last few moments that \nit isn't OK to block judicial nominees, as if there was something \nunconstitutional about it. There is thinking among some that we should \nnot start down this path of blocking a judicial nominee whom we do not \nthink is a good nominee for the court because it may come back to haunt \nus at some point when and if a Republican should be elected to the \nPresidency.\n  Let me say, with all due respect to my colleagues, I am not starting \ndown any new path. The tradition of the Senate is one of blocking \njudicial nominees in the final year of an administration. I am going to \nbe very specific and prove exactly my point that we are not starting \ndown any new path. The path is well worn. We are following a path; we \nare not starting down any new path.\n  I am going to go back to 1992, since that is the most relevant year \nfor this discussion, the final year of the Bush administration.\n  How did the Senate treat judicial nominees? Facts are sometimes \npretty devilish things. They do point out the truth. They are pretty \nhard to discredit. Let's look at the facts.\n\n  There was only one controversial judicial nominee considered the \nentire year in 1992--in fact, only one rollcall vote, period, on \njudicial nominees. Why is that? That is no big deal. They voted the \nonly one that came up. That is the point. Why didn't they come up? With \nall due respect to my colleagues from Vermont and New York, it is \ncalled blocking the nomination. It is called bottling them up in \ncommittee. It is called not bringing them to the floor. Let's be \nspecific.\n  In 1992, we had a nominee by the name of Edward Carnes. He was \nnominated to the Eleventh Circuit. There were no fewer than three full \nvotes in the Senate on one nominee: A motion to proceed, followed by a \nfilibuster, a 66-30 cloture vote, and finally, on September 9, 1992, \napproval--a long process for this one judge. But other than that one \nnominee who was, in fact, filibustered, there was nothing--no action, \nno debate, no nothing--on the floor of the Senate. All other \ncontroversial nominees were filibustered in committee under the \nDemocrat leadership in the Senate.\n  Sure, the Senate approved nominees here or there. I admit that. But \nif we define ``controversial'' as having at least a rollcall vote, \nthere weren't any.\n  What about the controversial ones? Let's take a look at a few. Let me \nstick with the appeals court since that is what we are dealing with \ntoday with Judges Berzon and Paez. In April of 1990, President George \nBush nominated Kenneth J. Ryskamp to the Eleventh Circuit. Mr. Ryskamp \nwas opposed by none other than civil rights activists, and the \nJudiciary Committee bottled up the nomination of Mr. Ryskamp for an \nentire year. At the end of the year, they sent the nomination back to \nPresident Bush, and Mr. Ryskamp was resubmitted but never made it.\n  Don't come here on the floor and tell me that if I want to block \nJudge Paez or Judge Berzon, somehow I am going down some new path. I am \nnot going down any new path. I am following the tradition and precedent \nof this Senate. Those who did that in 1992 had every right to do it \nunder Senate rules and under the Constitution, as I do today and as I \nintend to do on these nominations.\n  In September of 1991, President Bush nominated Franklin S. Van \nAntwerpen of Pennsylvania to the Third Circuit. The nomination was \nblocked in committee for the entire final year of the Bush Presidency. \nIt never saw the light of day. In November of 1991, President Bush \nnominated Lillian R. BeVier, a conservative from Virginia who had \ntestified for Robert Bork. That was her first mistake. Lord help us, \nshe was a conservative, No. 1, in the Democrat\n\n[[Page S1212]]\n\nyears here. No. 2, she testified on behalf of Robert Bork. She was \nnominated to the Fourth Circuit. Guess what happened to her. Her \nnomination languished for a whole year. Finally, the committee deep-\nsixed her at the end of the Bush Presidency--gone, didn't see the light \nof day. I guess that was unconstitutional. If it is unconstitutional \nnow, surely it was unconstitutional then.\n  Of course, it is not unconstitutional. You have that right. On the \nsame day, President Bush nominated Terrence W. Boyle to the Fourth \nCircuit. Again, the chairman put a hold on the nomination for an entire \nyear. It languished in the darkness of Judiciary and never saw the \nlight of day.\n  Here is an article from 1992. It says: ``North Carolina Judge One of \n50 Bush Court Nominations that Won't be Approved.'' It talks about the \nintentional strategy of Chairman Biden to delay and kill Bush nominees \nbecause of the likely Clinton victory. That speaks for itself.\n\n  Here are a few lines from the news service, September 28, 1992:\n\n       Men and women named by President Bush to 50 vacant \n     judgeships will not be confirmed by the Senate this year, \n     leaving Republicans and Democrats pointing fingers of blame \n     at each other. The nominees who must be approved by the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee include Terrence W. Boyle, 46, a \n     U.S. District Court Judge in Elizabeth City who was proposed \n     for a seat on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Last week, \n     Senator Joe Biden, Democrat of Delaware, who chairs the \n     panel, said no additional hearings on nominations will take \n     place this year. With Congress expected to adjourn for the \n     year next Monday and Democratic presidential candidate Bill \n     Clinton ahead in the polls, many Republicans fear the \n     nominees will never be approved and charged Biden with \n     intentionally delaying the process.\n       South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond, highest ranking \n     Republican on the panel, said he had asked Biden earlier this \n     year to increase the number of hearings and the number of \n     nominees considered at each hearing. This was not done and we \n     are now out of time, he said. ``It's got partisan written all \n     over it,'' said Andy Wright, political director of the North \n     Carolina Republican Party. Biden, Wright said, is ``taking \n     advantage of an opportunity. He knows what power he has.'' \n     But a Judiciary Committee aide rejected charges that the \n     panel has initially stalled progress on the nominees, saying \n     the committee had approved ``a record number of nominees in a \n     presidential election year when the Senate and White House \n     were controlled by different parties.''\n\n  Well, they are controlled by different parties. The thing is \nreversed.\n  They go on to explain that ``the Senate had approved 59 Bush \nnominees,'' so forth and so on.\n  The point is, this is not new ground; this is old ground we are \nwalking.\n  In November of 1991, George Bush nominated Frank Keating of Oklahoma \nto the Tenth Circuit. It was blocked for the entire year. It died 2 \nyears later at the end of the Bush Presidency.\n  Let me read an article from the Philadelphia Tribune entitled \n``Shelving of Keating Nomination Pleases Rights Groups.'' The \nnomination wasn't defeated by the Senate. It was shelved by the \ncommittee. A group of liberal organizations opposed him, and the \ncommittee buried the nomination.\n\n       National civil rights groups like the NAACP Legal Defense \n     Fund, National Fair Housing Alliance, Children's Legal \n     Defense Fund, are still smiling as a result of the U.S. \n     Senate Judiciary Committee's decision not to vote on the \n     nomination of Francis Keating for a judgeship on the Tenth \n     U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       This means that Keating's nomination and the fate of 50 \n     other judicial nominees still under consideration by the \n     committee will have to wait until January when the Senate is \n     scheduled to come back into session.\n\n  It goes on to discuss this nomination--again, a nomination killed in \ncommittee by the other party. Controversial, never saw the light of \nday. New ground? I don't think so.\n  In January of 1992, President George Bush nominated Sidney Fitzwater \nto the Fifth Circuit. Same old story: Nomination languishes, a whole \nyear goes by and the nomination dies.\n\n  Here is a story from the Texas Lawyer entitled ``Judiciary Panel \nKills Texans' Nominations.'' This is American Lawyer Newspapers Group, \nOctober 1992:\n\n       Surprised? Hardly. ``It's an every four-year occurrence,'' \n     said U.S. District Judge Lucius D. Bunton, III of Midland, \n     Texas, chief of Texas' Western District.\n       As spring turns to summer in presidential election years, \n     the party out of power at the White House traditionally \n     throws up roadblocks to slow a process that in normal times \n     confirms most candidates automatically. In addition to the \n     expected slowdown, those close to the process from both \n     parties say Governor Bill Clinton's lead in the polls has \n     prompted Democrats to delay judicial confirmations in hopes \n     of preserving the vacancies of the presidential candidate.\n\n  Again, they have the right to do that. They did do it, and they did \nit effectively. So when we come out here to do it now because of two \nvery liberal activist judges, why should we be criticized for \nexercising our rights under the process? If you disagree with us on the \nbasis of why we are objecting, fine. But don't pontificate on the floor \nof the Senate and tell me that somehow I am violating the Constitution \nof the United States of America by blocking a judge or filibustering a \njudge that I don't think deserves to be on the circuit court because I \nam going to continue to do it at every opportunity I believe a judge \nshould not be on that court. That is my responsibility. That is my \nadvise and consent role, and I intend to exercise it. I don't \nappreciate being told that somehow I am violating the Constitution of \nthe United States. I swore to uphold that Constitution, and I am doing \nit now by standing up and saying what I am saying.\n  The same day in 1992, Bush nominated John G. Roberts of Maryland to \nthe D.C. circuit. That was filed in the same old black hole with the \nrest of them. Congress adjourned; the nomination was blocked, end of \nstory. Another nomination in January of 1992 was blocked in committee \nand killed at the end of the Presidency. Justin Wilson, nominated in \nMay of 1992, was killed by committee. Here is an article, September of \n1992: ``Outlook grim for Wilson nomination,'' from the Gannett News \nService.\n  Byline by Lacrisha Butler, this article says:\n\n       Nashville lawyer Justin Wilson's nomination to fill a \n     vacancy on the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court, which has been \n     pending in the Senate committee for 6 months, is among more \n     than 100 Federal judge nominations still awaiting action \n     before Congress adjourns in early October.\n       And it appears unlikely that Wilson's nomination will see \n     action before the session ends, because of snags in his \n     background check and what is being called an attempt by \n     Democrats to hold up nominations in anticipation of a change \n     in administration.\n\n  Again, this is not new ground. This is a role the Senate has played \nfor years, decades. It is an appropriate role if we believe a \nnomination, or the other side believes a nomination might be too far to \nthe left or right--depending on which side you are.\n\n  Mr. President, this is just one year of the Presidency I am talking \nabout. I have only dealt with 1992 when circuit court nominees were \nblocked in committee. I could have gone back further into the Bush \nPresidency. I could have gone back into other Presidencies. I didn't do \nthat, but these are filibusters. When you don't allow a nomination to \nget to the Senate floor--it may not be under the technical term \n``filibuster,'' but when you block it, that is a filibuster. You are \nnot getting it here and you can't talk about it if it isn't up here. If \nit is languishing in committee, then we are not going to be able to \ndebate it, approve it, or reject it. No matter how you shake it, they \nwere filibusters led by committee chairmen rather than the majority \nleader on the floor.\n  If you want precedent for floor filibusters--I have heard it said \nthere is no history of filibusters on the Senate floor. OK, they have \nbeen in committee; we stopped them in committee. All right. Well, let \nme read this:\n\n       On July 2, 1999, Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member \n     Patrick Leahy issued a statement claiming, ``I cannot recall \n     a judicial nomination being filibustered ever.''\n\n  OK. Mr. President, I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 volumes of the \nCongressional Record, Senate proceedings, and not every word is of the \nfilibuster, but in each volume is a filibuster of 4 judicial \nnominations, both political parties, since 1968--4 out of 13. So out of \n13 judges who have been filibustered on the floor of this Senate since \n1968, these volumes here, 8 volumes, represents only 4 of the 13. Yet \nthe ranking member of the Judiciary Committee says he can't ever recall \na filibuster being offered.\n  As a challenge to my friend from Vermont, if he comes down and says \nit again, I am going to read every word of these filibusters on the \nfloor of the Senate and filibuster these nominations by doing it. If he \ndoesn't come\n\n[[Page S1213]]\n\ndown or retract that statement, I won't. If he comes down and says he \ncan't ever remember a filibuster taking place on the floor of this \nSenate, I am going to read every word of just these four. If he \ncontinues to aggravate me, I might read all 13 of them, if I can dig \nout the information.\n  Let's get real and understand what is happening. The names are Abe \nFortas in 1968; William Rehnquist, who sat in that chair and was \npraised by all during the impeachment trial, was filibustered by \nSenator Birch Bayh. There are volumes and volumes, hundreds of pages \nhere of that filibuster. I am prepared to read every word of it if he \nwants to say there have been no filibusters.\n  Stephen Breyer was filibustered; J. Harvie Wilkinson, Sidney \nFitzwater, Daniel Manion in 1985, Edward Carnes, Rosemary Barkett, H. \nLee Sarokin--there are 13 of them.\n  So don't tell me we haven't filibustered judges and that we don't \nhave the right to filibuster judges on the floor of the Senate. Of \ncourse we do. That is our constitutional role. Some like it. And I have \nbeen on the other side. Listen, I wasn't in the Senate when it \ndisapproved Robert Bork, but we lost one heck of a good judge. Clarence \nThomas wasn't filibustered, but he sure was debated. I didn't like that \neither. But it is our right as Senators to do that. So don't criticize \nour right to do these things and don't say things didn't happen that \ndid happen.\n  Now, let me move to the question at hand, which is the Ninth Circuit, \nwhere we have the nominations of Judges Paez and Berzon for the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. We need to understand this circuit is a very \ncontroversial circuit. Not only is it a controversial circuit, it is a \nrenegade circuit. It basically is out of the mainstream of American \njurisprudence. It is interesting that this circuit has been reversed by \nthe Supreme Court--get this--in nearly 90 percent of the cases decided \nin the past 6 years. Let that sink in for a moment. Ninety percent of \nthe decisions made by the circuit court in this Ninth Circuit have been \nreversed by the U.S. Supreme Court, the next highest court. What does \nthat tell you about the judges on that court?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from New Hampshire yield for a brief time?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to have a colloquy between the \ntwo of us based on some statements made to this point. If I could say \nto my friend--and there is nobody in the Senate I have more respect for \nthan the Senator from New Hampshire. We have served together on the \nMIA/POW Committee, and for many years, until he became a full committee \nchairman, we served as the two leaders of our parties with the Ethics \nCommittee. I have the greatest respect for the Senator. I say, of \ncourse, he has a right to filibuster if that is what he chooses. Since \nthe time I have been in the Senate, there have been a number of \noccasions when there has been, if not a filibuster, at least a delaying \nof judicial nominees. That is part of the tradition of the Senate. I \nhave no problem with that.\n  I say, though, to my friend that the year the Senator has talked \nabout in some detail--1992--holds the record for confirming more judges \nthan during any other presidential election year. Sixty-six judges were \nconfirmed at that time. That is when we had a Democratic Senate and a \nRepublican President. So that year, 1992, should stand out as an \nexample of how you can move these nominees, in spite of the fact that \nyou have a majority of one party in the Senate, and the other party is \nrepresented in the Presidency. I will not take a lot of time, but I \nwant the record to reflect that in 1996 we only had 17 confirmations.\n  So I think what we have been able to do in 1988 and 1992 when we got \n42 nominees and 66, which is an all-time record--there is no question \nbecause I was there then. Toward the end of the session, there were a \nlot of nominees who didn't come forward. There was a line drawn and \nthey said no more. Some were submitted too late.\n  What I am saying to my friend is that in addition to what I have just \nsaid, we now have 30 nominations pending. Once they get out of \ncommittee, let's bring them here and vote up or down on them. I don't \nknow Richard Paez. I talked to him on the phone. I have talked to his \nmother. I think anybody who has to wait 4 years deserves an up-or-down \nvote.\n  I say to my friend that if there is something wrong with Judge Paez \nor Ms. Berzon, come out here and vote them down. But I think we need to \nmove forward with these nominations as quickly as we can.\n  I can only say to my dear friend from New Hampshire that the State of \nNevada for 14 years has been the fastest growing State in the Union. We \nhave tremendous problems with the administration of justice. At this \ntime, when the Senator and I are speaking, we are short four judges. It \nis not Senator Leahy's fault, it is not Senator Hatch's fault, that \nthese are not being voted on now. They are in the pipeline, so to \nspeak. But we are desperate for judges. That is the way it is in other \nparts of the country.\n  We really need to move forward. I understand the Senator's feelings \non the Ninth Circuit. I have heard them expressed several times today: \nIt is too big. It is unwieldy. They have been reversed too much. That \nis a problem. I think we need to do something about it.\n  I would be happy to join with my friend. A number of Senators were \nreally upset about this a number of years ago. The commission was \nappointed led by Justice White. He made recommendations. I think that \nis a starting point as to how we resolve it.\n  I close by saying, yes, there were people in 1992 who were not given \nthe chance to vote. Keep in mind that the record for the Senate in \n1992--when we had a Republican President and a Democratic Senate--is \nthat we approved 66 nominees. There were 17 in 1996 when there was a \nDemocratic President and a Republican Senate.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague \nthat I don't disagree with what he just said as far as the numbers are \nconcerned. I point out that I am really referring here to controversial \nnominees. When a nominee has some controversy about him or her, if it \ngets to the floor, there are normally quite a few discussions; i.e., a \nfilibuster. There were no votes. There was only one vote in the year \n1992 on a controversial judge. That was filibustered. It eventually \npassed the nomination under the Bush Presidency. But it was \nfilibustered and substantially debated.\n  That is the point I was making. Most of the nominees I listed and \nreferred to languished for a whole year in the committee. I am not \ncriticizing the Senator and his party for what they did then. They have \na right to do that. I might not agree because I perhaps would have \nsupported the judges. But I think you have the right to do it. I think \nwe have a responsibility to the President of the United States duly \nelected by the American people. I think in our advice and consent role, \nwe have an obligation to confirm some of those judges, especially those \nwho are not controversial. But I think on those controversial judges, \nwe should have the right to be able to air the concerns.\n  I don't want to speak at great length on this because I know one of \nmy colleagues--perhaps Senator Sessions--wishes to do that.\n  But in the case of Paez, for example, I don't know that the American \npeople are aware he has been involved in two decisions pertaining \ndirectly to the Clinton scandals. Why don't you get both of those \ndecisions, the Marya Hsia case, for one, and the John Huang case? In \nboth of those cases, the sentencing was lenient--perhaps as lenient as \nit could be.\n  I think those questions ought to be answered. I think we should know \nthe answers to those questions about what happened before we put this \nperson on the circuit court.\n  I tend to agree that to simply hold somebody up forever and never let \nthem know how it is going to be resolved is very unfortunate for the \nindividual. I tend to agree. But these are serious questions. When I \nsay ``filibuster,'' I use the term in the sense of right now because \nthe rule is pretty fairly restrictive. We have 48 hours after the \nmotion is filed for cloture and, at the most, 30 hours after that. So \nwe are not talking forever. But we are talking about just venting and \nairing concerns. That is what I am doing with both the Ninth Circuit as \nwell as two individuals to which I will speak more directly in detail \non Thursday.\n\n[[Page S1214]]\n\n  It is not pleasant to stand here and criticize and air concerns you \nhave about people who are wanting to move up to another level on the \ncourt. But I think we have an obligation to air our concerns. \nCertainly, concerns are aired about us when we run for our respective \noffices.\n  I think it is fair that as to judges who are appointed forever, who \nwill be making decisions long after we are out of here, probably when \nour children are coming into voting age, or our grandchildren, whatever \nthe case may be--these judges may still be here long after the \nPresident leaves--we have a responsibility to look very carefully at \nthem. If they are active as judges and are making decisions that are \nbeing overturned almost 90 percent of the time in the case of the \ncurrent court--I am not saying that would necessarily be the case of \nthe two nominees, but the court itself has a very undistinguished \nrecord, in my view.\n\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield with his right to have the floor, \nI agree. If there is a Senator who believes there is a problem with any \njudge, whether it is the one we are going to vote on at 5 o'clock or \nthe two we are going to vote on tomorrow, or Thursday, they have every \nright to come to talk at whatever length they want. But with Judge \nPaez, it has been 4 years. There has been ample opportunity to talk \nabout this man. He has bipartisan support. I have no problem with \npeople talking about the decisions he has rendered. He has been a judge \nfor about 18 years in State and Federal courts. I think there has been \nan exhaustive review of those.\n  If the Senator from Alabama, who has a fine legal mind and is former \nattorney general of Alabama, and the Senator from New Hampshire, who \nhas had wide-ranging experience in government and in the Senate and \nHouse of Representatives, want to talk, more power to them. My only \npoint is, 4 years is too long.\n  I also repeat some of the things the ranking member of the committee \nhas said. It is a myth that judges are not traditionally confirmed in \nPresidential election years. It is simply not true. Recall that in \n1980, a Presidential election year, 64 judges were confirmed; in 1984, \n44; in 1988--we talked about that when we had a Democrat Senate and \nRepublican President--42 were confirmed; in 1992, we had 66. That is \nthe record. I think that really says a lot.\n  When we had President Bush and a Democratic majority, and a \nsignificant majority, we could have stalled things. We approved 66 \nnominees--I repeat that for the Record--whereas, in President Clinton's \nlast year of his first term, 17 were approved. That is really not fair.\n  My point is that we need to move these along. I think as part of the \nlegacy of the Republican leadership of this Congress, you can't hold \nyour heads high when you have up to this point confirmed three or four \nnominees. You need to move up and have 40, 50, or 60. Otherwise, I \nthink you are not fulfilling the need the country has to take care of \nthe tremendous backlog of 30 pending judges and probably 35 or 40 more \nin the pipeline as we speak.\n  I hope Senator Sessions and Senator Smith of New Hampshire, who are \nboth very fine legislators, will say all they want to say negative or \npositive about the nominees. But let us move forward and vote on them.\n  I again repeat, I don't think it is a good legacy for the Republican \nleadership of the Senate to break a record that you certainly don't \nwant to break; that is, in the country that is rapidly growing with all \nkinds of Federal crimes being committed, we have fewer judges to do the \njob. It is very desperate.\n  In the State of Nevada, a fine judge in the prime of his judicial \nlife and a senior judge took senior status. It was the only way we \ncould get another judge. It is that way all over the country.\n  I have no problem, I repeat, with what the Senator is doing. I think \nit is commendable.\n  I also think when we talk about the Ninth Circuit, which I have \ndefended, I have, as I have stated, I guess some could say, a conflict \nof interest because one of my two sons was administrative assistant to \nthe chief judge and my other boy is presently working there. It is a \ncircuit in which I live and practice law. Let Members not denigrate \nthat circuit.\n\n  Of course, they have so many cases; and it is true, their reversal \nrate is high. They decided almost 5,000 cases in a year. Out of \napproximately 5,000 cases, they have had about 12 or 14 reversals. That \nis not so bad. The cases that are taken up are ripe for the Supreme \nCourt because they are in conflict with other circuits.\n  That reversal rate has improved. The numbers, as indicated by Senator \nMurkowski earlier today, are from another year.\n  I think criticism of the Ninth Circuit is certainly in order. Go \nahead and criticize the Ninth Circuit. As far as the Senator doing \nanything unconstitutional, it isn't even close. The Senator has every \nright to do what he is doing.\n  I appreciate very much the courtesy of the Senator. He did not have \nto allow me to speak out of order. I know the Senator has a lot to say.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I appreciate my colleague's remarks and \nwill yield to him at any time.\n  I will respond briefly to my colleague because I think he is correct \non the numbers. I think the numbers speak for themselves. I believe \nthere were some 66 nominations brought through during the Bush years. \nThis is not about the number of people. I think it is a fairly \nreasonable assessment to say if those nominations came through in 1992 \nor from 1989 through the end of the term in 1993, it is likely they \nwere not very controversial. There was no debate, really. They were \npretty much unanimously agreed to.\n  We are talking about two issues: One is the controversial nature of \nthe judges involved; two, the controversial nature of the Ninth \nCircuit. Both the Ninth Circuit and the judges are in and of themselves \ncontroversial. In the case of the one vote the Democrats in 1992 \nbrought forth, although it did win, it was a controversial nomination. \nI think Judge Paez, with all due respect, and Judge Berzon, are \ncontroversial nominations. Clearly, the Ninth Circuit is controversial.\n  I have agreed with the majority leader; if he chooses to accept, I \nhave indicated I am willing to limit the debate on Thursday to about 5 \nhours total time on our side to discuss these nominations. I am not \nblocking for the sake of blocking. I am trying to make some points that \nI hope will result in the rejection of these nominees.\n  I will discuss this Ninth Circuit and the reversals. As I said, from \n1994 to 2000, 85 of 99 decisions--86 percent--by the Ninth Circuit were \nreversed by the Supreme Court.\n  What kind of a record is that? What kind of knowledge of the law does \nthis indicate when the Supreme Court could overturn 86 percent of the \ncases in the last 6 years and, as I said, 90 percent of the cases \noverall?\n  To be specific, in 1999 to 2000, 7 of 7--100 percent of the cases set \ndown by this court--were overturned by the Supreme Court. There are \nfour more pending now that are being challenged. I will not go into the \ndetails of each case, but U.S. v. Locke, Rice v. Cavetano, Roe v. \nFlores-Warden, U.S. v. Martinez-Salazar, Smith v. Robbins, Gutierrez v. \nAda, Los Angeles Police Department v. United Recording Publication--all \nof those were overturned, all 7 of 7.\n  From 1998 to 1999, during that year, 13 of 18 of the decisions of \nthis court, 72 percent, were overturned by the Supreme Court--reversed.\n\n  From 1997 to 1998, 14 of 17 were overturned by the Supreme Court, 82 \npercent of the cases.\n  From 1996 to 1997, 27 of 28 cases were overturned, 96 percent of the \ncases overturned.\n  From 1995 to 1996, 10 of 12, 83 percent, were overturned.\n  And on and on and on.\n  I have the documentations of these cases.\n  The bottom line is the Ninth Circuit is notorious for its antilaw \nenforcement record, its frequent creation of new rights for criminals \nand defendants, often in the face of clearly established law.\n  These two judges we now are debating, I believe based on their own \nrecords and comments and paper trail, are going to be act the same. \nThey will be making the same kinds of decisions.\n  It is an embarrassment to have 90 percent of the cases overturned. In \nmy view, it shows, frankly, an ignorance of\n\n[[Page S1215]]\n\nthe law, or certainly a disrespect for the Constitution in some way to \nget that many cases overturned by the Supreme Court.\n  The Ninth Circuit, as I said before, is a renegade circuit. It is out \nof the mainstream of American jurisprudence. It has been reversed by \nthe Supreme Court 90 percent of the time, 84 of 98 cases. That is \nterrible.\n  It routinely issues activist opinions. While the Supreme Court has \nbeen able to correct some of the worst abuses, the record is replete \nwith antidemocratic, antibusiness, procriminal decisions which distort \nthe legitimate concerns and democratic participation of the residents \nof the Ninth Circuit.\n  To give a couple of examples of the more outrageous decisions: \nStriking down the NEA decency standard, creating a right to die, \nblocking abortion parental consent law, and a slew of obstructionist \ndeath penalty decisions.\n  The Senate, and particularly Republican Senators from the Ninth \nCircuit, are on record in favor of a split of the circuit they are so \nupset with this. In 1997, all Republicans voted against an amendment to \nstrike a provision to split the circuit. That is how outrageous these \ndecisions have been. Even the independent White commission recommended \na substantial overhaul of the circuit's procedures; it still has not \nbeen implemented. We are adding two liberal, very activist judges to \nthis circuit, without any of the reforms that have been called for by \nmany.\n  The Ninth Circuit covers 38 percent of this country, more than twice \nas much as any other circuit. It covers 50 million people. President \nClinton has already appointed 10 judges to this circuit. Democrat \nappointees comprise 15 of the 22 slots currently occupied.\n  I say to the American people who may be listening right now, judges \nimpact our lives big time in the decisions they make. Citizens complain \nabout the violence and the criminals getting out. We hear all the \nstories about somebody serving 5 years for murder and going out and \nkilling somebody else; or somebody stalking, serving a little time, and \nstalking and killing the woman he stalked before because he didn't \nspend enough time in jail, over and over again.\n  This is not by accident. These are bad judges making bad decisions \nthat cost Americans their liberties, cost them their lives sometimes. \nThat is wrong.\n  We have an obligation in the Senate to take a good, hard look at a \nlifetime appointment to the circuit. The members are there forever, \neven when they get real old. It is pretty hard to get rid of them. This \nis a lifetime appointment.\n  We have a responsibility to make darn sure these judges are going to \nrepresent the views of the majority of the American people in terms of \nthe law. I intend to do that as long as I can stand here to do it.\n  Let me briefly hit two points on the two judges in question and then \nmake a couple of other points and wrap up. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nis officially opposed to the nomination of Paez. In Berzon's case, the \nnomination was described by the National Right to Work Committee as the \nworst judicial nomination President Clinton has ever made.\n  I am going to go into more detail on Thursday on the Ninth Circuit \nand its anti-law enforcement record, for its frequent creation of new \nrights for criminals and defendants, often in the face of clearly \nestablished law. For that reason alone, we should look very carefully \nand very cautiously at whom we put on that court.\n  For instance, in Morales v. California, 1996, the Ninth Circuit \nstruck down the California State law governing when defendants could \npresent claims during habeas corpus appeals which had not been made \nduring the appeals in the State courts. According to the California-\nbased Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, this holding ``opened the door \nto a flood of claims that would be barred anywhere else in the \ncountry.''\n  In United States v. Watts in 1996, the Supreme Court issued summary \nreversals in two cases without even hearing arguments after the Ninth \nCircuit allowed past acquittals to be considered during sentencing.\n  This is just silliness in terms of the obvious intent of the law and \nthe Constitution.\n  I will conclude, I say to my colleagues who may be prepared to speak, \non this point. These judges are activist judges who are going to \npromote an agenda on the Ninth Circuit that has already been rejected \n90 percent of the time by the U.S. Supreme Court. Let's not add insult \nto injury by putting two judges on this court, essentially fulfilling \nthat promise of continuing that bad judicial policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to make an observation. We have heard \na lot about the reversal rate of the Ninth Circuit. There has been a \nlot of talk that the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate in 1996 was some 90 \npercent, but that was less than five other circuits' reversal rates of \n100 percent.\n  In the 1997-1998 term, the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 76 \npercent, equivalent to that of the First Circuit and less than other \ncircuits because those circuits continued to have a 100-percent \nreversal rate.\n  In the 1998-1999 term, the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 78 \npercent, which was far less than several other circuits.\n  The point I am making is the Ninth Circuit decides thousands of \ncases, and they acknowledge, we acknowledge, everyone acknowledges, \nthat 12 to 14 cases are reversed. That is not bad. Remember, the \nSupreme Court picks cases they believe will make good law, and that is \nwhy all these other circuits have a huge reversal rate. That is the way \nit is. That is the job of the U.S. Supreme Court, to look at these \ncircuits and find cases it believes deserve to be interpreted one way \nor the other.\n  I hope my friends do not continue harping on the 90-percent reversal \nrate. It is lower than other circuits.\n  Also, Judges Paez and Berzon are qualified to sit on the court. I \nwent over at some length earlier today the qualifications of Judge \nPaez, with whom I have spoken on the telephone, and I have talked with \nhis mother. I do not have that same familiarity with Judge Berzon.\n  These are nominations that should go forward. These are good people \nwho deserve the attention of the Senate. Certainly, Paez, after 4 \nyears, deserves an up-or-down vote. I hope we can get to that at the \nearliest possible date. Judge Paez is not going to go away. He is a \ngood man who is well educated and has been a judge for 18 years, 13 \nyears in State court, some 5 years as a Federal district court judge. \nEveryone speaks highly of him, not the least of whom is a member of the \nHouse Judiciary Committee, a former State judge in California, a devout \nRepublican, James Rogan, who supports Paez. He has bipartisan support. \nI hope we can move forward on these as quickly as possible.\n  Also, to illustrate what I said earlier, my friend from New Hampshire \ntalked about the fact that in 1992 certain judges were not approved. \nMore judges were approved in 1992 than in the entire history of the \ncountry, and we had a Democratic Senate and a Republican President.\n  In Presidential election years, we had a large number of judges \napproved.\n  Look what happened the last year of President Clinton's first term: \n17 judges. And this year we are starting out worse than that.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, this is not a \nlegacy of which one should be proud. My colleagues need to move these \nnominations. If there are some nominees whom they do not like, vote \nthem down or do not bring them forward, but let's get these numbers up \nthis year into the fifties or sixties. We need that badly. States all \nover this country are in desperate need of judges, especially at the \ntrial level.\n  Let's not be so hard on the Ninth Circuit. There are those of us who \nhave practiced law in the Ninth Circuit. We are willing to move forward \nand do something to improve it. The Presiding Officer is a person who \nhas argued before the Supreme Court--I do not think there is any doubt \nabout this--far more times than anybody else in this body. I could be \nwrong, but I doubt it. He certainly understands the appellate process \nvery well.\n  The Ninth Circuit needs some changes. Justice White, the leader of a \nstudy commission, sat down and decided what needed to be done. Let's \nstart from there and see if we can do\n\n[[Page S1216]]\n\nsomething constructive rather than berate this appellate division that \nhas 51 million people in it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, you have practiced in the Ninth Circuit. \nSo has the distinguished assistant minority leader. There is no doubt \nthat over a period of years, the Ninth Circuit has been reversed more \nthan any other circuit. Their record of having 27 out of 28 reversed in \n1 year is absolutely unprecedented. It has never been approached by any \nother circuit.\n  As a Federal prosecutor who spent 15 years full time in Federal \ncourt, I can assure my colleagues there is no circuit in America that \nis looked on with less respect on questions of law enforcement than the \nNinth Circuit. It is the furthest left Circuit in the American \njudiciary, and there is no doubt about it. There are some great people \nthere. They are wonderful. I would not mind having them over to my home \ndiscussing great legal issues, but they have been outside the \nmainstream of American law.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, maybe the Senator was busy with his staff, \nbut in the 1996-1997 court term, the Ninth Circuit reversal rate was 90 \npercent. Five other circuits--the Fifth, Second, Seventh, D.C., and \nFederal Circuit--had a 100-percent reversal rate.\n  The only point I am trying to make----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The D.C. Circuit had one case and Federal Circuit had \none case reviewed by the Supreme Court, whereas the Ninth Circuit had \n27 out of 28 reversed.\n  Mr. REID. The point, I say to my friend from Alabama, recognizing the \ndifferent workloads the courts had, the appellate division with 51 \nmillion people has thousands of cases every year.\n  Also, the Senator has every right to feel the way he does about the \nNinth Circuit, but I do not want the Senator's statement to go \nuncontested that reversal rates of other circuits pale in comparison to \nthe Ninth Circuit because it is simply not factual.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I do admit, in 1996, it looks as if the D.C. Circuit \nand the First Circuit had one case considered by the Supreme Court and \nit was reversed. D.C. Circuit had one, and it was reversed. And the \nFederal appeals court had one, and it was reversed.\n  Let me show you an article from the New York Times.\n  Mr. REID. One more thing, and then I promise to leave.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. All right.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has not mentioned the Fifth, Second, and \nSeventh Circuits which also were 100 percent reversed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Seventh had three cases, and those were reversed. \nOver the 3 years--I have done the numbers--the Ninth Circuit remains \nNo. 1 in the number of cases reversed.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The New York Times had an article some time ago, saying \nthis:\n\n       The Ninth Circuit, which sits in San Francisco, remains the \n     country's most liberal appeals court, and there is some \n     evidence that the Supreme Court's conservative majority--\n\n  I would say it is a moderate to conservative majority--\n\n     views it as something of a rogue circuit, especially on \n     questions of criminal law and even more particularly on the \n     death penalty.\n\n  That is from the New York Times, which certainly is not a \nconservative organ, particularly on legal matters. I think they are \nmisunderstanding the importance of a lot of legal matters, frankly, but \nthat is a comment they made, their observation.\n  That is why the Ninth Circuit has been reversed so regularly. As a \nmatter of fact, I will mention a little later in my remarks--I believe \nin 1996-1997--there were 17 reversals in that year of the Ninth Circuit \nby a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court. In other words, the liberal and \nconservative members of the Supreme Court, in 17 out of 27 cases \nreversed, unanimously agreed the Ninth Circuit was wrong. I think that \nis a matter that we ought to think about.\n  I may go into that more because it is important to my analysis of how \nwe ought to vote on these nominees.\n  There are two purposes for my remarks today. I would like to enter \ninto the Record the results of the research I have done on two \nnominees--Mrs. Berzon and Judge Paez--for the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. My research forms the basis for my opposition to their \nnominations.\n  I would like my colleagues who do not sit on the Judiciary Committee, \nas I do, and who were not part of the initial evaluation process of \nthese nominees to have the benefit of the full record and my \nobservations on it.\n  Secondly, I would like to take this opportunity to ask my colleagues \nto consider the points I am raising and to join me in opposition to \nthese nominees.\n  First, I would like to mention, I believe it is 330 or 340 nominees \nthat have been brought forward by the President. Only one of those 300-\nplus nominees has been voted down on this floor.\n  We now have two nominees that have been held up for some time because \nthey have been particularly controversial, and they are nominees to a \nparticularly controversial circuit. That is what the Senate ought to \ndo. We are not a potted plant. We are not a rubber stamp. We have given \nfair and just consideration to nominee after nominee after nominee of \nthis President. We have confirmed his nominees overwhelmingly; 300-\nsomething to 1 have been confirmed to this date.\n  In terms of vacancies, nearly half of the vacancies that now exist in \nthe Federal courts in this country are because the President has not \nsubmitted a nomination yet. This Senate cannot vote on a nomination \nwhen we do not have a nominee. The President is required to nominate. \nHe ought to be careful. He ought not to rush in and pick the first name \nthat comes out of a hat. But I am just saying that we are close to what \nexperts have declared to be a full employment Federal judiciary.\n  I do not think that we have a crisis in failing to move nominees. We \nare going to continue to move them. We are going to have other votes on \nnominees this year; some which I will support and others who I will \noppose.\n\n  I do not believe we ought to take these decisions about how to vote \non a judicial nominee lightly. Having had to undergo, myself, an \nunsuccessful confirmation process for a Federal judgeship, I know \nbetter than most the thoughts and feelings these nominees have. That is \nwhy I always make sure I treat them in a respectful manner. I do not \nbelieve they are people who are unworthy in a lot of ways. What I \nbelieve is that their deeply held personal views are such that even \nthough I might respect them as a person for those views, I do not \nbelieve that at this point in time, for this circuit, these nominees \nought to be approved. I believe that very deeply. That is why I am here \nand share these comments.\n  I have done my best to ensure that the concerns I have raised about a \nnominee have been fair and objective over the 3 years I have been in \nthis body. I try to ask questions that are appropriate and make sure \nthat we are treating people fairly.\n  For a variety of reasons, I regrettably have concluded that Berzon \nand Paez should not be confirmed.\n  Let me talk about the Ninth Circuit in a fashion that I think is fair \nand gives an overall perspective.\n  First, we need to look at the problems that are in existence now in \nthis circuit. It is the largest circuit, covering Alaska, Hawaii, the \nState of Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, and \nMontana, as well as Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. This amounts \nto roughly 38 percent of the country's area, approximately 50 million \npeople.\n  In recent years, this circuit has been singled out to be the subject \nof increased scrutiny by the Supreme Court because of its tendency to \nengage in judicial activism.\n  In other words, roughly 20 percent of the American population lives \nin this circuit in which the rule of law is regularly being challenged \nby the issuance of activist opinions by ideologically driven Federal \njudges.\n  But do not just take my word for it. We have the article in the New \nYork Times describing this circuit that I just quoted. The court's \nconservative majority--five members of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates constitutes a majority; they are all not conservatives, a lot of \nthem are more\n\n[[Page S1217]]\n\nmoderate judges--they view it as something of a rogue circuit. That is \nstrong language, I submit. If you look at the reversal figures for the \nNinth Circuit, I believe you will tend to agree with the assessment \nmade in that article.\n  In my experience as a Federal prosecutor, I found that a reliable \nindex of a court's performance is the history of the circuit's \nreversals.\n  For the benefit of individuals who may be watching this debate at \nhome and are not familiar with the workings of the Federal judicial \nsystem, a reversal rate is simply the measurement of the number of \ntimes a decision entered by that circuit is being reversed by the U.S. \nSupreme Court--changed or reversed because the lower court's decision \nwas incorrect.\n  These figures illustrate the instances in which a judge, or in this \ncase, a circuit is acting incorrectly. Reversal rates are a warning \nsystem of judicial activism and judicial error.\n  What do the statistics say? Do they lend validity to the New York \nTimes charge I just cited? As a matter of fact, a fair reading of the \nreversal figures for this circuit does reveal that year after year, the \nNinth Circuit leads the Nation in the number of times it is reversed in \ntotal numbers. It is the highest in percentage.\n  By way of illustration, allow me to present the reversal figures for \nthe last three terms for which I have the data. In the 1996-1997 term, \n28 cases were reviewed; that is, the Supreme Court agreed to hear 28 \ncases that arose out of the Ninth Circuit. Many times the Supreme Court \ndoes not hear a case unless it is important for them to hear it. They \nhear a case because a circuit rendered an opinion that they believe is \nplainly wrong. They hear a case if a circuit has rendered an opinion \nthat is contrary to the other 11 circuit courts of appeals. They think \nthere ought to be a uniform answer. So the Supreme Court renders the \nanswer and, once it does, every circuit is bound by that answer. But in \nterms of the cases that are being heard by the Eleventh Circuit, \nhundreds, thousands of cases go through that on an annual basis. And \nmost of those, even if wrong, will never be reviewed by the Supreme \nCourt. The Supreme Court cannot and will not review every wrong case in \nAmerica. It picks those that are most important, that will likely \nperpetuate an error, and tries to correct it and create a uniform \nsystem of law in the country.\n\n  Again, there were 27 out of 28 cases in 1996. That, in my view, is a \nstunning figure. It is a figure unmatched at any time by any circuit \nanywhere. In the 1997-98 term, the court reviewed 17 opinions and \nreversed 13 of those in the Ninth Circuit. In 1998-99, they reviewed 18 \nopinions and reversed 14. And this year, they have only heard, to date, \nsix opinions from the Ninth Circuit, and they reversed all six of them.\n  This is from an article that appeared in the University of Oregon Law \nReview in 1998. The title of the article was ``Reversed, Vacated and \nSplit: The Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit, and the Congress.'' The \nauthor, realizing this is an important, newsworthy item, wrote a law \nreview on it and said:\n\n       Another interesting phenomenon is that the Supreme Court \n     unanimously agreed--across the political spectrum--that the \n     Ninth Circuit was wrong seventeen times during the [1996-97] \n     term. This is a fairly remarkable record, considering that \n     the rest of the Circuits combined logged in with only twenty \n     unanimous votes, seven of which were affirmances.\n\n  Only 13 unanimous reversals throughout the whole United States, 17 in \nthe Ninth Circuit. This circuit is out of step, in my view. In other \nwords, over the 3-year span from 1996 through 1999, the Ninth Circuit \nhas reversed 54 of 63 cases examined by the U.S. Supreme Court. That \nmeans that of the cases the Supreme Court has reviewed, the Ninth \nCircuit has been wrong a staggering 86 percent of the time. No other \ncircuit in my analysis approaches these kind of numbers.\n  If this number were not bad enough on its own, it becomes truly \nappalling when it is compared to the number of reversals in the other \ncircuits. Over the same 3-year period in which the Ninth Circuit was \nreversed 54 times, the next highest total number of reversals in any \ncircuit was 14 out of 24 cases reviewed occurring in the Eighth Circuit \nand 14 reversals out of 22 cases in the Fifth Circuit.\n  In fact, the Ninth Circuit is so substantially wrong so much of the \ntime that it even leads in the number of instances in which the U.S. \nSupreme Court is unanimous. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has a \nlimited docket and gets the opportunity to only review a relative \nhandful of cases which any of the circuits or the Ninth Circuit \nadjudicates. So while the reversal rates are very revealing on their \nown, they fail in one troubling regard. They are unable to accurately \nquantify the number of activist or just plain wrong decisions that get \nthrough and become established law in the circuit because they cannot \nbe reviewed by the Supreme Court. This is a sobering thought, and it is \nwhy we need to insist that we will only confirm judges to the Ninth \nCircuit who will move that court into the mainstream of American legal \nthought and not confirm judges who will continue the Ninth Circuit's \nleftward drift. That is the plain duty and responsibility of all of us \nin this body.\n  Many of these are just not trivial errors. If it is heard by the U.S. \nSupreme Court, it is a significant error. These reversal figures are \nnot being inflated by mere inadvertence. Instead, they are the products \nof a seeming desire by the circuit to make law when the opportunity \narises. In fact, I will describe one of the cases the Supreme Court has \nreversed in which the Ninth Circuit, without restraints, twisted the \nConstitution to further what appears to me to be their political goals.\n  In the case of Washington v. Glucksburg, the Ninth Circuit struck \ndown the State of Washington's ban on assisted suicide by reading a \nconstitutionally protected ``right to die'' into the 14th amendment. \nThe 14th Amendment doesn't say anything about a right to die. I revere \nthe text of the Constitution, and I assure my colleagues that there is \nnothing in that amendment that says anything about a right to die. Just \nlook it up.\n  Despite the clear language of the 14th amendment, the Ninth Circuit \njudges chose to read into it the social policy outcome the circuit \ndesired, overturning the will of the people of Washington who had voted \nfor this law. That is what we are talking about. We have elected \nrepresentatives in the State of Washington, elected by the democratic \nprocess, a free vote, held accountable. If they vote wrongly, they can \nbe voted out of office. But what about Federal judges who are \nappointed. The only review they ever get is in this Senate. If we \nfail--and we do too often--they just go right on the bench and serve \nfor life. No matter how wrong their opinions are, they get to stay in \nthere. Who ought to set policy in America if we have a republic? I \nbelieve this a responsibility of the elected branch, not the lifetime-\nappointed branch.\n  The reason these issues are important is that it goes to the question \nof fundamental rights of the people to set the standards in America. \nThe Ninth Circuit threw out the law that was passed by the legislature \nbecause the Ninth Circuit judges chose to read into it the social \npolicy they desired even though it meant overturning the will of the \npeople. This is what we classically call judicial activism. In an \nironic twist, the Ninth Circuit employed their apparent belief in a \nliving Constitution, which is what liberal people say the Constitution \nis, a living document. It is a piece of paper; it is not living. It is \na contract with the American people entered into by our ancestors. The \nNinth Circuit evidently said it is a living document, and, ironically, \nthey read into this living document a right to die.\n  Upon review, the U.S. Supreme Court corrected the Ninth Circuit and \nrestored the validity of Washington State's ban on assisted suicide. In \nblunt language, the U.S. Supreme Court reminded the Ninth Circuit that:\n\n       * * * in almost every State--indeed, in almost every \n     Western democracy--it is a crime to assist suicide. The \n     States' assisted suicide bans are not innovations. Rather \n     they are longstanding expressions of the States' commitment \n     to protection and preservation of human life. * * *\n\n  I submit to you, the Supreme Court was directing that language to \nthem directly. The judges on that circuit knew that was a rebuke, in my \nopinion. In fact, the Supreme Court further used the Glucksburg case to \nillustrate just how far out of the mainstream the Ninth Circuit is. The \nSupreme Court wrote further:\n\n       Here * * * we are confronted with a consistent and almost \n     universal tradition that\n\n[[Page S1218]]\n\n     has long rejected the asserted right, and continues to \n     explicitly reject it today, even for terminally ill, mentally \n     competent adults. To hold for the respondents [the way the \n     Ninth Circuit did] we would have to reverse centuries of \n     legal doctrine and practice, and strike down the considered \n     policy choice of almost every state.\n\n  But these unelected judges, with lifetime appointments, in no way \naccountable to the American people, just blithely go in there and wipe \nout the right, the statute of the State of Washington, and claim that \nthe 14th amendment to the Constitution of the United States directed \nthem to do so. And that is bogus because there is nothing in the 14th \namendment that says anything of the kind. They got busted by the U.S. \nSupreme Court for it. That is just one of the cases. This is a recent \none, and that is the reason I quoted it.\n\n  Glucksburg does not stand by itself on this dishonorable list of \nactivist Ninth Circuit opinions that have been struck down, of course, \nbut it is a perfect illustration of judicial arrogance that seems to \npermeate many judges, particularly in this circuit, and it helps frame \nthe point that many of us who care about maintaining the rule of law in \nthis country constantly make. We have a responsibility as Senators to \nensure that the judicial branch is composed of individuals who will \nfaithfully interpret the Constitution and the laws of this country. If \nwe have doubts about a nominee's ability to do that, then we have a \nresponsibility, a constitutional duty, if you will, under our advise \nand consent power to reject the nominee.\n  The President has the power to nominate, but we are given the power \nto advise and consent, which means in effect, in the words of the \nConstitution, we have a right to reject a nominee if we do not consent.\n  While statistics and written opinions are useful in looking at this \ntroubled circuit, they do not get to the heart of the matter in that \nthey don't answer the fundamental question as to why this circuit \nbehaves in such an aberrational manner. I have looked at these issues \nand what legal analysts have said, and I want to share findings with \nyou. Essentially, my findings strongly support an argument that one of \nthe core problems with the Ninth Circuit is its composition of judges.\n  The Oregon State Bar Bulletin, in 1997, identified the current \ncomposition of judges on the Ninth Circuit as a primary cause of the \ncircuit's extraordinarily high reversal rate. In fact, the author \nfound:\n\n       There is probably an element of truth to the claim that the \n     Ninth Circuit has a relatively higher proportion of liberal \n     judges than other circuits. . . .\n\n  Furthermore, the analysis concluded:\n\n       The effect of the Carter appointments is that, relative to \n     other circuits, there is a greater likelihood that a Ninth \n     Circuit panel will be comprised mostly of liberals. This may \n     result in decisions in some substantive areas that are out of \n     step with the current thinking of the Supreme Court and other \n     circuits.\n\n  In other words, when you have a substantial number on there, and a \npanel is randomly selected of three judges to hear a case, that is the \nway they do it. Three of the 20-some other judges will be selected to \nbe on the panel. All three of them could be activist selectees. So the \nopinion may not even really speak for the Ninth Circuit. That points \nout again how important it is that we have a balance on the circuit to \navoid panels routinely coming up that are out of step with mainstream \nlegal thinking of the Supreme Court and other circuits throughout the \nUnited States.\n  One of the big reasons for this is, there was a major expansion of \nthe size of the Ninth Circuit during President Carter's administration. \nIt allowed him to make a number of appointments--an incredibly large \nnumber of appointments--and now we see that President Clinton has \nsimilarly successfully appointed a large number. Of the 23 judges that \nare active on the circuit, Democratic Presidents have appointed 15 of \nthem. In fact, President Clinton has already appointed 10 and confirmed \nthem to this circuit, and he has 5 additional nominees, including Paez \nand Berzon, awaiting Senate action, giving him the opportunity to have \npersonally, himself, appointed 15 of the 28 judges.\n  So it is easy to see why activists and liberals are interested and \nchomping at the bit to push these nominations through, so it will \nsolidify the stranglehold that Democrats and liberal activists have on \nthis court. In fact, this is the impetus that drives me to believe we \nneed to and are justified in reviewing more carefully nominees to this \ncircuit. It is all right for there to be Democrats and for people to be \nliberal; every judicial nominee who has come up here since the Clinton \nAdministration took office has been a Democrat and liberal. But the \nquestion for these nominees is: Will they remain disciplined and honor \nthe law? Do they have a history and a tendency to impose their will \nunder the guise of interpreting law? This is the fundamental question \nwe have to answer.\n\n  I voted against Raymond Fisher to the circuit last year as I believed \nhe was an activist nominee who would perpetuate this circuit's leftward \ndrift, and I was joined by 28 colleagues in opposition to that \nnomination. I was able to support the nomination of Ronald Gould to the \ncircuit after reviewing his record and hearing him in the Judiciary \nCommittee. I believed him to be someone who was likely to serve as a \nmoderating force to temper the activism of this circuit, and I believed \nhis nomination was proof that my efforts, which I communicated to the \nWhite House, to begin sending moderate nominees forward was beginning \nto pay off. Regrettably, however, neither Judge Paez nor Mrs. Berzon \nmeets that standard. I do not believe they will restore balance. As a \nmatter of fact, I believe their nominations represent a further move to \nthe left.\n  Let's talk about Judge Paez. I don't have anything against him \npersonally. He is a fine man, and he has a fine family. But it should \nbe noted that both of these nominees, Berzon and Paez, were \ncontroversial even in the Judiciary Committee. Both came out of the \ncommittee with only a 10-8 vote--pretty unusual--which is the highest \nlevel of opposition any judicial nomination faced in the committee. \nThis vote reflected serious concerns committee members have with regard \nto the records these two nominees have compiled over their careers. In \nmy opinion, the record of each indicates that confirming them to this \ncircuit would be like adding fuel to the fire.\n  I want to begin this discussion by focusing first on Judge Paez. \nFirst, he is, in fact, a self-proclaimed activist. This is remarkable. \nIf there is one thing the Ninth Circuit does not need, it is a nominee \nwho will maintain activist traditions. However, his own words show that \nhe is just that. First, he called himself a person with ``liberal \npolitical views.'' While this is hardly incriminating in itself, these \nstatements do indicate some of the tendencies he might have. In his own \nwords, he described his judicial philosophy as including an \nappreciation for--I will read this to you and ask you to think about \nthese words carefully. This is from the Los Angeles daily Journal:\n\n       The need of the courts to act when they must, when the \n     issue has been generated as a result of the failure of the \n     political process to resolve a certain political question. . \n     . .\n\n  So as a failure, in his view, of the political process to resolve a \ncertain political question, the courts can act, and they must act.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n     because in such an instance [Paez explained] ``there's no \n     choice but for the courts to resolve the question that \n     perhaps ideally and preferably should be resolved through the \n     legislative process.''\n\n  Now, that is a statement by an already sitting judge that a judge has \nthe power, when a legislative body fails to act, to do what that judge \nbelieves he must to solve the policy problem before him. I submit to \nyou, that is the very definition of what activism by the judiciary is.\n  Think about this. When a legislative body fails to act, it has made a \ndecision just as certainly as if it had decided to act. A decision not \nto act is a decision. It is a decision made by elected representatives, \nand if the people who send them to Washington or to the State \nlegislature don't agree, they can remove them from office. But can you \nremove a Federal judge who declares he has a right to act when the \nlegislature does not? Can you remove that person? No, you cannot, under \nthe Constitution, because he has a lifetime appointment with no ability \nto be reviewed whatsoever. That is one of the most thunderous powers \never given by our Founding Fathers, I have to say. In many ways, it \nworks well. Judges are free, for the most part--Federal judges\n\n[[Page S1219]]\n\nwho I have practiced before for 15 years during the majority of my \ncareer as a professional lawyer in Federal court, almost entirely. I \nrespect Federal judges. But when you have a Federal judge who has an \nactivist mentality, who believes that he or she has the power to solve \npolitical questions when the legislature does not act, you have the \nmakings of a rogue jurist, and you cannot contain that person. It costs \nlitigants thousands and thousands of dollars to appeal their rulings. \nThey cannot always get to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is too \nbusy. Even if they have a bad ruling, they can't always get there to \nget it reversed. Sometimes they are just stuck by these rulings no \nmatter what they do.\n\n  That is wrong. That is a philosophy of adjudication that is false. It \nis precisely what Americans are concerned about. It should not be \naffirmed by this body in approving this judge to a circuit that is \nalready out of control, in my opinion.\n  The record indicates that the judge is hostile to law enforcement. We \nhave to be careful about that. I prosecuted many years, as I said. A \njudge can rule against a prosecutor, and he cannot appeal. If he rules \nagainst a defendant, the defendant can appeal.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question on \nthis very point?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Very well.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend.\n  Is the Senator aware that Judge Paez has been endorsed by the \nNational Association of Police Organizations, Executive Director Robert \nSkully, the Los Angeles Police Protective League Board president, the \nLos Angeles County Police Chief Association, the Los Angeles \nAssociation of Deputy Sheriffs, the commissioner of the California \nDepartment of Highway Patrol, and a whole host of Republicans and \nDemocrats alike in law enforcement and on the bench?\n  I am surprised that my friend would make the statement that the judge \nis hostile to law enforcement when, in fact, he has tremendous support \nfrom law enforcement.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was going to mention a few reasons for \nthat.\n  I believe his record would indicate that he is not going to provide \nthe kind of balanced adjudication that would be required in law \nenforcement matters.\n  For example, shortly after the judge was nominated, Los Angeles \nnewspapers--I know the Senator supported his nomination, or was \nresponsible perhaps for it--were filled with quotes made by his \nsupporters. One supporter happened to be Ramona Ripston, the executive \ndirector of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. \nNow, I would like to state for the Record that I doubt that the ACLU \nshares my concerns about the Ninth Circuit's activist bent. In any \nevent, Ms. Ripston welcomed Paez' nomination to the Federal Bench \ndescribing Judge Paez as: ``A welcome break after all the pro-law \nenforcement people we've seen appointed to the state and federal \ncourts''.\n\n  From the ACLU's position, Ms. Ripston's support for Judge Paez \nappears to be well-justified, as Judge Paez soon began to issue anti-\nlaw enforcement opinions. One case in point involved the case of Los \nAngeles Alliance for Survival v. City of Los Angeles, in which Judge \nPaez granted an injunction sought by the ACLU which prohibited the \ncity's ordinance prohibiting aggressive panhandling from taking effect.\n  The city had an ordinance against aggressive panhandling passed by \nthe people of Los Angeles. And a judge just up and threw it out, and \nsaid it was unconstitutional; no matter what you pass, I am the judge; \nno good, out.\n  The ordinance, incidentally, was passed following the stabbing death \nof an individual who would not give a panhandler 25 cents. In his \ndecision, Judge Paez viewed the Los Angeles ordinance as ``facially \ninvalid'' under the ``Liberty of Speech Clause''--I don't know exactly \nwhat that is. But the ``Liberty of Speech Clause'' is found in the \nCalifornia's State Constitution.\n  Listen to how one legal commentator described the judge's ruling:\n\n       Judge Paez struck down the law as an unconstitutional \n     restriction on ``speech'' and issued a preliminary injunction \n     against its enforcement. He found that the ordinance \n     constituted ``content based discrimination'' because it \n     applied only to people soliciting money. Just hope Judge Paez \n     doesn't get his hands on any laws against extortion, bribery \n     or robbery. ``Stick 'em up'' could become Constitutionally \n     protected speech in certain parts of California . . . The \n     identical law has been upheld in other parts of California by \n     other federal judges, but thanks to Judge Paez, the ordinance \n     lawfully enacted over two years ago has yet to be enforced in \n     Los Angeles.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for the opponents of the nomination \nhas expired. The time between now and 5 o'clock belongs to the \nproponents.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would ask unanimous for one minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, and, of course, I shall \nnot object, we would like one minute on our side as well. Senator \nKennedy and I will divide the time.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I point out in that case the Ninth \nCircuit asked the California Supreme Court for an advisory opinion. The \nCalifornia Supreme Court reversed Judge Paez' opinion, finding it to be \nerroneous, and condemned Judge Paez's ruling in exceptional strident \nterms stating:\n\n       As noted above, the regulation of solicitation long has \n     been recognized as being within the government's police \n     power. . . . If, as plaintiffs suggest, lawmakers cannot \n     distinguish properly between solicitation for immediate \n     exchange of money and other kinds of speech, then it may be \n     impossible to tailor legislation in this area in a manner \n     that avoids rendering that legislation impermissibly \n     overinclusive. In our view, a court [Judge Paez] should avoid \n     a constitutional interpretation that so severely would \n     constrain the legitimate exercise of government authority in \n     an area in which such regulation long has been acknowledged \n     as appropriate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will you let me know when I have used \nseven minutes? The rest of the time will be yielded to Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here.\n  Finally, we are debating the nominations of Richard Paez and Marsha \nBerzon, two eminently qualified people for the Ninth Circuit. We have \nheard a lot of complaining about the Ninth Circuit. I think it is \nimportant to note that many of the opinions cited on the other side of \nthe aisle as being overturned were written by Reagan appointees.\n  This isn't about politics. This is about allowing a court to function \nfor the justices, whether they are appointed by Ronald Reagan, or \nGeorge Bush, or Bill Clinton, to give it their best judgment. We have \nnominated two people who would add a tremendous amount to the Ninth \nCircuit.\n  Instead of the negativity we have heard today, I want to put a human \nface on these two nominees who have waited so long for this day.\n  The first one I want to talk about is Marsha Berzon. I have a photo. \nHere is Marsha with her husband and children.\n  There is a reason I have done this. I think it is important when we \nhear about the candidates; they have kind of become statistics. People \ntalk about how many years it has taken.\n  Here is Marsha. Here is her family. I want to talk a little bit about \nthis eminently qualified woman. She is an outstanding woman. She has \ndisplayed in her career a strong sense of integrity, dedication, and \ncompassion, the very characteristics we should expect any Federal judge \nto have.\n  She has built a distinguished career as an attorney, and beyond that \nshe has shown through her activities in the community a real caring and \nconcern. She is an impassioned teacher and a published author. She is a \nwife and mom. She is an extraordinary person who deserves confirmation.\n  I am not going to go through all of her incredible accolades through \ncollege and law school because I have a feeling we will be talking \nabout these nominees at length at another time.\n  I will talk a little bit about her experience with Federal court \nissues. She specializes in U.S. Supreme Court representation. She has \nargued four cases before the Supreme Court and has submitted over 100 \nbriefs to the Court on behalf of a broad spectrum of cases. In the past \n5 years, she has acted as chief counsel on five Supreme Court cases, as \nwell as cocounsel before the Court on numerous other occasions.\n\n[[Page S1220]]\n\n  This is the kind of support that Marsha Berzon has. Let me read what \nSenator Hatch wrote in her favor.\n\n       I am impressed by Miss Berzon's intellect, accomplishments \n     and the respect she has earned from labor lawyers \n     representing both management and the unions.\n\n  I do appreciate Senator Hatch's kind words and his decisive action in \nbehalf of Marsha Berzon.\n  Former Republican Senator James McClure of Idaho, in support of \nMarsha, stated:\n\n       What becomes clear is that Miss Berzon's intellect, \n     experience, and unquestioned integrity have led to strong and \n     bipartisan support for her appointment.\n\n  Mr. President, the gentleman who ran against me the first time I ran \nfor Congress in 1982, Dennis McQuaid, a Republican attorney, said:\n\n       Unlike some advocates, Ms. Berzon enjoys a representation \n     devoid of any remotely partisan agenda.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Frankly, her presence will enhance the reputation of the \n     ninth circuit.\n\n  We can go on and on with quotes from her opposing counsel. She has \nsupport from the Los Angeles County Professional Peace Officers \nAssociation. They wrote that she is analytical, fair and thorough.\n  When it comes to Marsha Berzon, I hope we will have a tremendous vote \nfor her. She deserves that vote. She has waited 2 years. I hope she \nwill get it.\n  Equally important and equally wonderful in terms of a nomination that \nstands on its own merit is Judge Richard Paez. Look at this man. He has \nbeen on the bench for many years. Behind him are photographs of his \nchildren. He has been married for many years, another wonderful family \nman and a wonderful jurist.\n  This Senate has already confirmed Richard Paez to a seat on the \ndistrict court, and he has shown himself to be an incredible jurist. I \ndon't have time to go through all the accolades. He was the first \nMexican American on that particular bench in Los Angeles. He has won \nthe respect of law enforcement, attorneys practicing in his courtrooms, \nand local scholars.\n  When Members poke holes in Richard's record, we will have time in the \nnext 2 days to respond to every single example because there has been \ntremendous misstatement.\n  In the remaining short time I have, I will quote lawyers who have \nappeared before him. These are anonymous quotations that appeared in a \nreview.\n\n       He is a wonderful judge. He is outstanding. He rates a 12 \n     or 13 on a scale of 10.\n\n  Another:\n\n       He is highly competent, one of the smartest people on the \n     bench; thoughtful and reflective.\n\n  Another:\n\n       I don't know anyone here who hasn't been exceedingly \n     impressed by him. He does a great job.\n\n  Another:\n\n       He is very well represented. He knows more about a case \n     than the lawyers will.\n\n  And another:\n\n       He has a great temperament. He never says or does anything \n     that is off. He has a very good demeanor. He is professional. \n     He doesn't have any quirks. He is very fair. He has a sense \n     of justice.\n\n  It goes on.\n  Mr. President, we have some terrific editorials in behalf of Judge \nPaez that at another time I will have printed in the Record.\n  In closing this particular brief presentation, I thank my colleagues \nfor listening. We have two incredible nominees deserving a yes vote. I \nhope we can all celebrate when this is behind us and as a Senate \nconfirm these two excellent people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  I ask my friend and colleague from California, there was reference \nmade on the Senate floor a few moments ago about a Los Angeles Daily \nJournal article that reviewed a variety of Judge Paez's rulings, which \nI think is fair to point out.\n  I wonder whether the Senator could confirm that in that Daily Journal \nreview, seven cases were selected by the Los Angeles Daily Journal that \nwould most effectively test the ability of Judge Paez to serve on the \nNinth Circuit. The Journal asked 15 experts, including a fair balance \nof liberal and conservative law professors and attorneys, to evaluate \nJudge Paez's legal rulings. The Journal concluded:\n\n       The portrait that emerged is of a thoughtful, unbiased, \n     even-tempered judge, propelled into the political spotlight, \n     only to be trapped into a seemingly never-ending and bitterly \n     polarized nomination process. . . . Of the 15 legal experts \n     who examined Paez's ruling for the Daily Journal, 13 praised \n     them, using descriptions such as ``clear, concise, and \n     straightforward,'' ``clearly written and carefully \n     reasoned,'' and ``scholarly and thorough.''\n\n  This is the import of the Los Angeles Daily Journal, as I understand. \nOne could draw, perhaps, a different conclusion from the earlier \nreferences.\n  Would the Senator agree my characterization was a more accurate \ncharacterization than referenced earlier?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator from Massachusetts is correct. I quote from \nthe headlines in this paper: ``Paez's Opinions Praised as Well-\nReasoned.'' Another says, ``Experts Say His Rulings Will Stand the Test \nof Time.''\n  My friend is right; this is a positive story. I think if every \nSenator read this story, there would be no question he should be \nconfirmed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It was a reference to an objective evaluation. In that \nevaluation, the reviewers came to the same conclusion that the Bar \nAssociation arrived at, which was that the cause of justice in the \nNinth Circuit would be well served and the people highly served with \nhis confirmation.\n  I join with my friend and colleague from California, as well as \nothers, in urging the favorable consideration of Marsha Berzon and \nRichard Paez for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. They are \nexceptional nominees who have waited far too long for action.\n  The delay in reviewing the nominations is a case study in the failure \nof the Senate to deal effectively with judicial nominations. That \nfailure has left the courts with 29 judicial emergencies, and is the \nresult of the Senate's adbication of its constitutional responsibility \nto act on judicial nominees.\n  Marsha Berzon, as the Senator has pointed out, is an outstanding \nattorney. She is a graduate of Harvard/Radcliffe College and the \nUniversity of California Law School. She clerked for the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court--rare commendations for a \nyoung lawyer.\n  Nationally known as an appellate litigator in a highly regarded San \nFrancisco law firm, she has written more than 100 briefs and petitions. \nShe received strong recommendations from a bipartisan list of \nsupporters, from major law enforcement organizations, and from those \nwho have opposed her in court.\n  As our chairman, Senator Hatch, commented last June, Marsha Berzon \n``is one of the best lawyers I've ever seen.''\n  It reflects poorly on the Senate that such a gifted lawyer was denied \na vote on the Senate for so long.\n  The Senate's shabby and insulting treatment of Richard Paez is worse. \nHe has almost two decades of judicial experience and received the \nhighest rating from the American Bar Association. He was first \nnominated more than 4 years ago to serve in the Ninth Circuit. Judge \nPaez graduated from Brigham Young University and Boalt Hall Law School. \nEarly in his career, he represented low-income clients. He later served \nin the Los Angeles Municipal Court, and the Los Angeles Superior Court, \nthe California Court of Appeals, and 5 years ago he was nominated and \nappointed to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of \nCalifornia.\n\n  Clearly, Judge Paez has the experience and the ability to serve with \ngreat distinction on the Ninth Circuit. He has the support of former \nCalifornia state judge and Republican Congressman Jim Rogan, as well as \nthe Sheriff, the District Attorney, and the Police Officers Association \nof Los Angeles.\n  We rarely have two nominees who are as well qualified with the \nbreadth of support these nominees have. We are fortunate to have these \ntwo nominees who are willing to serve in the judiciary. What they have \nbeen put through in terms of the failure of this body to act, I think, \nis indeed unfortunate.\n  Now we do have that opportunity. I join with all of my colleagues to \nurge the approval of both of these nominees. Since his nomination in \nJanuary 1996, 4 years ago, Judge Paez has been approved by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee twice. Surely he deserves an affirmative vote by \nthe full Senate. It is\n\n[[Page S1221]]\n\ntime for the Senate to stop abusing its power.\n  Over 200 years ago, the Framers of the Constitution created a system \nof checks and balances to ensure that excessive power is not \nconcentrated in any branch of government. The President was given the \nauthority to nominate federal judges with the advise and consent the \nSenate. The clear intent was for the Senate to work with the President, \nnot against him, in this process.\n  In recent years, however, by refusing to take timely action on so \nmany of the President's nominees, the Senate has abdicated its \nresponsibility.\n  Both of these nominees are uniquely well qualified. Both have \ndemonstrated outstanding qualities and abilities to serve in the courts \nof this country and serve the cause of justice in this nation. I hope \nboth of them will be speedily approved by the Senate.\n  At long last the Senate is considering the nominations of Marsha \nBerzon and Richard Paez for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. They \nare both exceptional nominees who have waited far too long for action \nby the Senate. Indeed, the delay in reviewing these nominations is a \ncase study in the failure of the Senate to deal effectively with \njudicial nominations. That failure has left the courts with 29 judicial \nemergencies, and is the result of the Senate's abdication of its \nconstitutional responsibility to act on judicial nominees.\n  Marsha Berzon is an outstanding attorney with an impressive record. \nShe is a graduate of Harvard/Radcliffe College and the Boalt Hall Law \nSchool at the University of California, Berkeley. She clerked for both \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  She is currently a nationally known appellate litigator with a highly \nregarded San Francisco law firm. She has written more than 100 briefs \nand petitions in the Supreme Court, and has argued four cases there. \nShe has received strong recommendations from a bipartisan list of \nsupporters, from major law enforcement organizations, and from those \nwho have opposed her in court. She has argued in many U.S. Circuit \nCourts of Appeals, U.S. District Courts, and at all levels of the \nCalifornia state court system. She has represented numerous private \nclients, as well as the governments of the States of California and \nHawaii, and the City of Oakland, California. Senator Hatch commented \nlast June that Marsha Berzon, ``is one of the best lawyers I've ever \nseen.'' She was first nominated by President Clinton on January 27, \n1998--over two years ago--and it reflects poorly on the Senate that \nsuch a gifted lawyer was denied a vote by the full Senate for so long.\n  The Senate's shabby and insulting treatment of Judge Richard Paez is \neven worse. He has almost two decades of judicial experience. He \nreceived the highest rating from the American Bar Association, and was \nfirst nominated more than four years ago--more than four years ago--to \nserve on the Ninth Circuit.\n  Judge Paez is a graduate of Brigham Young University and Boalt Hall \nLaw School. Early in his career, he represented low income clients. He \nlater served on the Los Angeles Municipal Court, the Los Angeles \nSuperior Court, and the California Court of Appeals. Five years ago, \nJudge Paez was appointed to the United States District Court for the \nCentral District of California.\n  Clearly, Judge Paez has the experience and the ability to serve with \ngreat distinction on the Ninth Circuit. He has the support of former \nCalifornia state judge and Republican Congressman Jim Rogan, as well as \nthe Sheriff, the District Attorney, and the Police Chiefs' Association \nof Los Angeles County.\n  Since 1991, Judge Paez has been appointed twice by the chief justice \nof the California Supreme Court to serve as a member of the California \nJudicial Council, the policy-making body for the California judiciary.\n  Last month, the Los Angeles Daily Journal reviewed a variety of Judge \nPaez's rulings, and selected seven cases that would most effectively \ntest his ability to serve on the Ninth Circuit. The Journal then asked \nfifteen experts, including a fair balance of conservative and liberal \nlaw professors and attorneys--to evaluate Judge Paez's legal rulings. \nAs the Journal concluded,\n\n       The portrait that emerged is of a thoughtful, unbiased and \n     even-tempered judge, propelled into the political spotlight, \n     only to be trapped in a seemingly never-ending and bitterly \n     polarized nomination process. . . . Of the 15 legal experts \n     who examined Paez's rulings for the Daily Journal, 13 praised \n     them, using descriptions such as ``clear, concise and \n     straightforward,'' ``clearly written and carefully \n     reasoned,'' and ``scholarly and thorough.''\n  Even the ruling subjected to the greatest scrutiny was complimented \nby other prominent legal experts.\n  In its evaluation of Judge Paez, The Almanac of the Federal Judiciary \nnotes that attorneys have praised him highly in the following terms. \nThey say he is one of the smartest judges on the bench; he rates a 12 \nor 13 on a scale of one to 10; he is highly competent; he's very \nprofessional; and he's always fair. Despite what some contend, he is \nnot anti-business, he is not anti-religion. He is a well-respected and \nright-minded judge.\n  Since his nomination in January 1996--over four years ago--Judge Paez \nhas been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee twice. Surely, he \ndeserves an affirmative vote by the full Senate.\n  It is time for the Senate to stop abusing its power over nominations. \nOver 200 years ago, the Framers of the Constitution created a system of \nchecks and balances to ensure that excessive power was not concentrated \nin any branch of government. The President was given the authority to \nnominate federal judges with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  The clear intent was for the Senate to work with the President--not \nagainst him--in this process. In recent years, however, by refusing to \ntake timely action on so many of the President's nominees, the Senate \nhas abdicated its responsibility. By doing so, the Senate has seriously \nundermined the judicial branch of our government.\n  This kind of partisan stonewalling is irresponsible and unacceptable. \nIt's hurting the courts, and it's hurting the country. Chief Justice \nWilliam Rehnquist felt so strongly about the long delays in acting on \nnominees that he sharply criticized the Senate in his 1997 Year-End \nReport,\n\n       Judicial vacancies can contribute to a backlog of cases, \n     undue delays in civil cases, and stopgap measures to shift \n     judicial personnel where they are most needed. Vacancies \n     cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without \n     eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been \n     associated with the federal judiciary . . . Whatever the size \n     of the federal judiciary, the president should nominate \n     candidates with reasonable promptness, and the Senate should \n     act within a reasonable time to confirm or reject them . . . \n     The Senate is, of course, very much a part of the appointment \n     process for any Article III judge. One nominated by the \n     President is not ``appointed'' until confirmed by the Senate. \n     The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any \n     particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry \n     it should vote him up or vote him down.\n\n  Little has changed since Chief Justice Rehnquist made that statement \nin 1997. For decades, the average time from nomination to a final vote \non a judicial nominee was 91 days. But in 1998, the delay more than \ndoubled--to 232 days. Of the 65 judges confirmed in 1998, only 12 were \nconfirmed in 91 days or fewer.\n  The trend continued in 1999. As of February 24, 2000, the average \ntime between nomination and confirmation in the current Congress is 152 \ndays.\n  In addition, it is women and minorities who have suffered the most \nduring the impasse over judicial nominations. According to one study, \nit took an average of 60 days longer for non-whites than whites and 65 \ndays longer for women than men to be considered by the Senate in the \nlast Congress. Minorities have failed to win confirmation at a 35% \nhigher rate than white candidates. In 1999, six out of the ten nominees \nwho waited the longest were women and minorities.\n  While the Senate plays political games with the judiciary, the \nbacklog of cases continues to pile up in the courts and undermines our \njudicial system. There are currently 76 vacant federal judgeships. \nSeveral more are likely to become vacant in the coming months, as more \nand more judges retire from the federal bench. Of the current \nvacancies, 29 have been classified as ``judicial emergencies'' by the \nJudicial Conference of the United States. That means that they have \nbeen vacant for 18 months or longer. Thirty-\n\n[[Page S1222]]\n\nfour nominees are currently waiting for Senate action. Three nominees \nare pending on the Senate floor, 3 are waiting for a vote in Committee, \nand all the others are waiting for a Judiciary Committee hearing. Only \nfour judges have been confirmed by the Senate so far this year.\n  The effect of Senate inaction is clear. At the circuit court level in \nTexas, the court's workload has increased 65% over the past nine years, \nwith no increase in judges and three vacancies. In California in 1997, \n600 hearings had to be canceled because of the large number of \nvacancies. This slowdown in judicial confirmations is jeopardizing the \nintegrity and viability of our judicial system.\n  The Senate has a constitutional duty to work with the President to \nconfirm judicial nominees--particularly at a time when Congress is \nshifting more responsibility to the courts. Members should not use the \nexcuse of an election year to stall this process. In 1988 the \nDemocratic-controlled Congress confirmed 42 judicial nominees, and in \n1992, they confirmed 66.\n  Opponents of Berzon and Paez argue that the high reversal rates of \nthe 9th Circuit by the Supreme Court are proof that the Ninth Circuit \nis too liberal. This argument is false and a poor excuse for Republican \nstonewalling. In fact, from 1998 to 1999, five circuits had reversal \nrates higher than or equal to the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit \nreversal rate was lower than the combined reversal rate of the state \nappellate courts. And from 1996 to 1997--the year that critics point \nto--the Ninth Circuit had lower reversal rates than the Second, Fifth, \nSeventh, D.C., and Federal Circuits. As Chief Judge of the Ninth \nCircuit, Procter Hug, Jr., has written,\n\n       . . . the reversal rate has little to do with the \n     effectiveness of any circuit court of appeals. For example, \n     the 13, 14, or 20 cases reversed in a term were out of 4,500 \n     cases decided on the merits in the Ninth Circuit. The \n     reversal rate in any circuit should also have little to do \n     with the nomination or confirmation of judges to fill \n     vacancies on a court.\n\n  The Senate has a constitutional obligation to fill the existing \njudicial vacancies. After such long delays, a vote in favor of Marsha \nBerzon and Richard Paez would be a significant step in the right \ndirection. I urge my colleagues to support both of these highly \nqualified nominees.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to announce that I intend \nto vote to confirm Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit. Judge Paez \nhas waited four years for this vote, and I believe that the time has \ncome for the Senate to perform its constitutional duty to advise and \nconsent on this nomination.\n  I have reviewed Judge Paez's record, including some of the issues \nwhich have proven controversial over the last four years, and am \nsatisfied that he has adequately responded to the concerns raised by \nsome in this body about his fitness to serve on the Ninth Circuit.\n  Particularly, Judge Paez has expressed his regret about commenting \npublicly about two California ballot initiatives while he served on the \nfederal bench. Affirmative action and welfare benefits for illegal \nimmigrants are two issues which inspire passion in many people on both \nsides of the political aisle. While I understand, but do not \nnecessarily agree with Judge Paez's comments and concerns about these \ntwo initiatives, I think he also knows that he made a mistake. That \nmistake should not prevent his elevation to the appellate court.\n  I also have reviewed several of Judge Paez's more controversial \nopinions. While I cannot say that I agree with some of his legal \nconclusions, I do believe that he has a well-deserved, bi-partisan \nreputation for fairness, and for being a thoughtful, scholarly jurist. \nHis fifteen years as a municipal and federal district court judge will \nserve him well on the Ninth Circuit.\n  Mr. President, Judge Paez has earned bi-partisan support from a \nvariety of sources. Not only is he universally supported by the \nHispanic community, but he also has received the endorsement of law \nenforcement officials, district attorneys and the business trial bar in \nCalifornia. I believe we have taken enough time to study Judge Paez's \nrecord on and off the bench. Despite the fact that Judge Paez and I \ncome from opposite ideological positions, I am ready to join a majority \nof this body, Democrats and Republicans, in support of his \nconfirmation. Thank you and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate takes up the \nnominations of Ms. Marsha Berzon and also Judge Richard A. Paez. These \nnominations have been pending in the Judiciary Committee for a \nconsiderable period of time. I supported both of those nominees in \nmoving them to the floor from the Judiciary Committee.\n  Ms. Berzon has an outstanding record academically and as a practicing \nlawyer. She received her bachelor's degree from Harvard and Radcliffe \ncolleges in 1966. She received her J.D. degree, doctorate of law, from \nthe University of California, Boalt Hall School of Law in 1973. \nThereafter, she clerked for Ninth Circuit Judge James R. Browning and \nthen for Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan.\n  She has been in the practice of law since 1975 and most recently, \nfrom 1978 to the present time, with the firm of Altshuler, Berzon, \nNussbaum, Berzon & Rubin, where she has had a very active litigation \npractice. She argued four cases before the Supreme Court of the United \nStates, which is a large number of cases for a practicing lawyer to \nhave before the Supreme Court.\n  That kind of appellate practice is a strong indicator of her \npreparation for work as an appellate court judge on the Ninth Circuit \nto which she has been nominated.\n  There have been objections raised to Ms. Berzon on ideological \ngrounds. It is my view that this kind of a challenge ought not to be a \nbasis for defeating a nomination to the Federal court.\n  She has opposed as a personal matter the death penalty, as many \nnominees do on a personal level, but has stated her willingness to \nfollow the law in imposing the death penalty.\n  She has been supported by many police organizations, which I \nordinarily would not mention except that the challenge has been made to \nher qualifications based upon her opposition to the death penalty.\n  I think it appropriate to note that she has been supported by a \nnumber of law enforcement organizations, including the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations, the California Correctional Peace \nOfficers Association, the International Union of Police Associations, \nand the Los Angeles County Professional Police Officers Association.\n  I have attended the hearings on Ms. Berzon, which have been very \ndetailed. I recall one day the hearing was interrupted. We came to the \nfloor to vote and later continued the hearing in one of the \nAppropriations Committee rooms. On the basis of that hearing and her \nfamiliarity with the law and her extensive practice, especially her \nappellate practice, I believe she is qualified to be confirmed for the \nNinth Circuit. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support her.\n  Judge Richard Paez is also on the list for confirmation. Judge Paez \nbrings a distinguished record. He is a graduate of Brigham Young \nUniversity where he received his Bachelor's degree in 1969; a graduate \nfrom Boalt Hall, University of California at Berkeley in 1972; worked \nfor the California Rural Legal Assistance as a staff attorney from 1972 \nto 1974; took on work for the next 2 years for the Western Center on \nLaw and Poverty as a staff attorney; and from 1976 to 1981 was with the \nLegal Aid Foundation.\n  Those are tough jobs, not high-paying jobs. I know from my work as \ndistrict attorney of Philadelphia where I saw public defenders work--\ndid a volunteer stint many years ago in the public defender's office--I \nknow the pay in those positions and I know the nature of the work. It \nis a real contribution.\n  From 1981 to 1994, Richard Paez was a judge on the Los Angeles \nmunicipal court, and from July of 1994 until the present time, he has \nbeen a U.S. District Judge for the Central District of California.\n  A number of objections have been raised to Judge Paez. One, that he \nmade a speech in 1995 where he criticized a couple of initiatives in \nCalifornia: Initiative 187, on benefits to illegal aliens; and a \nsecond, No. 209 on affirmative action.\n  I don't think a judge gives up his right to freedom of speech when he \nis on the bench. It could be said it would be a little more prudent not \nto speak on matters that might come before the court. But if the matter \ndoes come before the court, there are many other\n\n[[Page S1223]]\n\njudges who can undertake the litigation matter on recusal. Even if \nJudge Paez had not spoken up on the matters and had such strongly held \nviews, that probably would have been an appropriate matter for recusal \nin any event. I don't think speaking up on those matters is a burden or \ninappropriate for his judicial duties. Again, it might be better not to \ndo that, but it is not a disqualifier.\n  Objections have been raised on two matters where he refused to \ndismiss a case brought against Unocal involving charges of abuse of \nhuman rights in Bosnia--a pretty tough standard to get a case dismissed \non a preliminary motion. There again, not a weighty matter which would \nwarrant disqualification.\n  An issue was raised at him being a municipal court judge handling a \ncase involving Operation Rescue where there was an issue of whether he \nstormed off the bench or simply called a recess for a cooling off \nperiod, and some issue as to how he treated people in the audience who \nwere waving Bibles, an issue of whether he threatened to take the \nBibles away.\n  Again, I think the aggregate of these three matters are not \nsufficient to rise to the level of disqualification.\n  There is one matter which concerns me and that was a plea bargain \nwhich Judge Paez handled on a case involving John Huang. I have \nreviewed that matter in some substantial detail on the notes of \ntestimony, of the sentencing, and of the Government's brief filed on \nthe downward departure and believe that the Government did not present \nall the evidence, all the materials which should have been presented at \nthe John Huang sentencing. I have discussed the matter with Judge Paez \nby telephone.\n  There has been a pattern on plea bargains where the Department of \nJustice has, in my judgment, not done the vigorous, forceful work that \na prosecutor ought to do in the plea bargain. One of those cases \ninvolves Dr. Peter Lee, where there were serious charges of espionage. \nI went to California and talked to the Chief Judge Hatter out there \nabout that case and found there was insufficient information presented \nto Judge Hatter. I mention that because it is a parallel to the case \ninvolving John Huang with Judge Paez.\n\n  The Judiciary oversight subcommittee, which I chair, is looking into \nthe Huang plea bargain, as we are looking into the Dr. Peter Lee plea \nbargain, as we shall look into other campaign finance matters, \nincluding the probation of Charlie Trie in the campaign finance case, \nand the probation of Johnny Chung in a campaign finance case. However, \nthere were very serious matters which were not presented to Judge Paez. \nThe essence of the complaint filed by the Department of Justice \ninvolved only $7,500 of illegal campaign contributions, and an obtuse, \nobscure reference in the Government's brief to a figure of $156,000 for \nthe period covered by the conspiracy, which lasted from 1992 to 1994.\n  What the Government did not bring forward was information disclosed \nby the Governmental Affairs Committee that John Huang was involved in \nsoliciting $1.6 million which was returned by the Democratic National \nCommittee. In that was a $250,000 contribution from a John H. Lee, a \nSouth Korean businessman, which Huang collected, knowing that Lee was a \nforeign national, and also the Huang solicitation for arranging for Ted \nSioeng, a foreign businessman, with connections I will not describe on \nthe Senate floor, which should have been called to Judge Paez's \nattention.\n  After reviewing the records in the case, the notes of testimony at \nsentencing, and what was made available in the Government's memorandum, \nnone of these matters were called to Judge Paez's attention.\n  I have made a request of Judge Paez, as I made a request of Chief \nJudge Hatter in the Dr. Peter Lee case, to examine the presentence \nreport. That is customarily a confidential matter, but Judge Paez said \non a showing of cause after notification of the parties, that might be \nmade available to the Judiciary subcommittee on oversight.\n  I make these references to Judge Paez on this state of the record, \nand we are continuing to make the inquiries as to what the Government \nput on as to John Huang, but there is nothing on this record which \nsuggests that Judge Paez knew of these other factors, which I think \nwould have warranted a very different and a much more substantial \nsentence, just as I think had Chief Judge Hatter been informed about \nthe details of Dr. Peter Lee, there would have been a different \nsentence in that espionage case.\n  These matters are now ripe for decision by the Senate. There has been \nsome suggestion of a further investigation on this matter, but when \nJudge Paez's nomination has been pending since January of 1996, and all \nof the factors on the record demonstrate it was the Government's \nfailure, the failure of the Department of Justice to bring these \nmatters to the attention of Judge Paez and on the record, he has \nqualifications to be confirmed. I do intend, on this state of the \nrecord, to support his confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1223-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1223-S1225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NOMINATION OF JULIO M. FUENTES, OF NEW JERSEY, TO BE UNITED STATES \n                  CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to read the nomination of \nJulio M. Fuentes, of New Jersey, to be United States Circuit Judge for \nthe Third Circuit.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to start by thanking the \nJudiciary Committee--particularly Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member \nLeahy--for moving the nomination of Judge Julio Fuentes through the \ncommittee process so efficiently.\n  Judge Fuentes clearly is the kind of candidate that we want on the \nfederal bench. In many ways, his life demonstrates the promise of \nAmerica--the idea that anyone committed to getting an education and \nworking hard can build a distinguished career.\n  Judge Fuentes wasn't born to wealth or privilege. He was raised by a \nsingle parent--his mother who worked as a nurse. But he pursued his \neducation diligently, earning a college degree while serving his \ncountry in the Army's Special Forces. Eventually, he earned not only a \nlaw degree but also two Masters degrees.\n  After completing law school, Judge Fuentes began building a \nsuccessful legal practice, honing his skills as an associate with a \nJersey City law firm. He later established his own firm and gained \nexperience handling a wide range of criminal and civil matters.\n  In 1978, he was appointed a judge on the Newark Municipal Court, \nwhere he served until his appointment to the New Jersey Superior Court \nin 1987. As a Superior Court judge, he has presided over criminal cases \nand a wide range of civil disputes, including product liability \nactions, environmental suits, and property claims. He has also ruled on \na number of federal and state constitutional issues.\n  In addition to his professional endeavors, Judge Fuentes has also \nvolunteered his time to help members of the community. He has mentored \nmany Hispanic youths and he has received several awards for his public \nservice.\n  Judge Fuentes' hard work on and off the bench has earned the respect \nof his judicial colleagues, the lawyers who appear before him, and the \npeople of New Jersey. The people who know him well describe him as \n``bright,'' ``dedicated,'' and ``even-tempered.''\n  In short, I feel certain that Judge Fuentes' depth of experience, his \nlegal knowledge, his compassion and his temperament would make him an \nexceptional federal judge.\n  Again, I thank Senators Hatch and Leahy for their hard work on this \nnomination, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote to confirm Judge \nFuentes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to express my \nsupport for the nomination of Julio M. Fuentes to be a judge on the \nThird Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I recently had the opportunity to meet Judge Fuentes when he came \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee for his nomination hearing on \nFebruary 22nd. At that time, I questioned the Judge on his experience \nand credentials for the bench and was persuaded that he will be able to \nmeet the great challenge of serving on the Third Circuit.\n  Judge Fuentes has had a distinguished legal career. He earned his law\n\n[[Page S1224]]\n\ndegree from the State University of New York in Buffalo in 1975. He \nthen entered the practice of law in New Jersey and continued to \npractice for 7 years. While he was practicing, Mr. Fuentes was \nappointed to be a judge on the Newark Municipal Court, where he served \nfrom 1979 to 1987. In 1987, Judge Fuentes was appointed to the New \nJersey Superior Court, where he has served until the present day.\n  His 20-plus years on the state bench have given Judge Fuentes a \nstrong judicial background that will serve him well on the Third \nCircuit. Many of the issues that Judge Fuentes will encounter on the \nfederal bench, from criminal law to torts to contracts, are ones with \nwhich he will be well acquainted from his time on the state bench. \nOther issues before the federal courts, such as antitrust and \nsecurities cases, will be new to Judge Fuentes. But I am confident that \nhis experience has given him the skills and temperament needed to \ntackle these issues.\n  The Third Circuit is a prestigious court with a proud history. It has \na tremendous volume of very high-powered litigation. I wish Judge \nFuentes a long and productive career in this most important position.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise \nto thank my colleagues for their support of the nomination of Judge \nJulio Fuentes to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  There has been much discussion of late of the slow pace at which the \nSenate has moved to confirm judicial nominees in the 106th Congress. It \nis a fact of which no one should be proud. Each judicial seat that we \nleave vacant slows the administration of the courts and access to \njustice for the American people.\n  That being said, I want to publicly thank Senator Hatch who has \nrepeatedly--and admirably--demonstrated his commitment to moving \nnominees through the Judiciary Committee in a timely fashion. I want to \nthank both Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy for their support in \nassuring Judge Fuentes' confirmation.\n  The vote that we took this evening on Judge Fuentes is an important \nstep towards easing the burdens on the courts. It is also evidence that \na qualified candidate with broad support can get a fair vote in this \nSenate and move quickly from a hearing to confirmation. Judge Fuentes' \nnomination was reported out of the Judiciary Committee just last week \nby a unanimous voice vote.\n  George Washington once said, ``The Administration of Justice is the \nfirmest pillar of government.'' As I stand here today I am reminded of \nthat quote because long after we all leave the Senate, those who sit on \nthe Judiciary will continue to impact public policy and the lives of \nother Americans. When I recommended Judge Fuentes, I did so with the \nutmost confidence that he was well-suited to such great responsibility. \nIn fact, I first considered Judge Fuentes for the position of District \nCourt Judge. However, it soon became apparent that his stellar \nqualifications were so impressive that he deserved consideration for \nthe Third Circuit. And I note with considerable pride that Judge \nFuentes will be the first person of Hispanic descent to serve on the \nThird Circuit.\n  His career has been distinguished by a solid record of public \nservice, which began in 1966 when he left college for three years to \nserve in the United States Army, including service in the Airborne \nRangers. From his days in law school to his current tenure on NJ's \nSuperior Court, he has demonstrated that he is an accomplished attorney \nwho has made a commitment to improving the quality of justice in our \nsociety. I have no doubt that he will bring these same qualities to the \nfederal bench.\n  A graduate of SUNY--Buffalo School of Law, Judge Fuentes began his \nlegal career in private practice where he worked for 7 years on both \ncivil and criminal matters. For his last three years in private \npractice, he also served as a part-time Judge on Newark's Municipal \nCourt. Then in 1981, he assumed the bench full-time as a Municipal \nJudge where he remained until 1987 when he was promoted to the New \nJersey Superior Court.\n  In his now 13 years on the Superior Court, he has built a reputation \nas a fair and able jurist. When you speak with those who have had the \nopportunity to work with Judge Fuentes throughout this distinguished \ncareer, they universally praise his integrity as well as the depth and \nbreadth of his knowledge of the law. And those who know him well \ndescribe him as bright, dedicated, and compassionate.\n  I could not be more confident that Judge Fuentes is the right person \nto fill this seat--a view that is shared by those best in a position to \nknow the Judge's qualifications. New Jersey's Governor Christie \nWhitman, the New Jersey State Bar Association, and the Hispanic Bar \nAssociation--both nationally and in New Jersey--have written letters \nenthusiastically supporting the Judge's nomination.\n  I am extremely proud to support Judge Fuentes nomination to the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals. I know he will be a superb addition to the \nbench.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Julio M. Fuentes, of New Jersey, to be \nUnited States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit? On this question, \nthe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), \nthe Senator from Missouri (Mr. Bond), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. \nCoverdell) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), the \nSenator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), the Senator from Nebraska \n(Mr. Kerrey), and the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Wellstone) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMinnesota (Mr. Wellstone) and the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden) \nwould vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Are there any other \nSenators in the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 93, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 34 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--93\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--7\n\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Coverdell\n     Feinstein\n     Kerrey\n     McCain\n     Wellstone\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, circumstances have prevented my \nbeing able to be here for the vote this evening on Julio Fuentes's \nnomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, \nbut I wanted to take this opportunity to make it clear that I am \npleased to support his nomination.\n  Judge Fuentes is eminently qualified for this important position. \nAfter several years in private practice, Judge Fuentes has served the \nNew Jersey community with honor first, as a judge on the Newark \nMunicipal Court, and now, as a judge on the New Jersey Superior Court, \nwhere he has served admirably for well over a decade.\n  Judge Fuentes is an excellent jurist with an unblemished record and a \nman of integrity. He is regarded with great esteem within his community \nand has\n\n[[Page S1225]]\n\nreceived the endorsement of many different organizations. In fact, I \nunderstand that Judge Fuentes was originally recommended for a seat on \nthe District Court in New Jersey, but the White House was so impressed \nafter meeting him that the President nominated him to the Third Circuit \ninstead.\n  I always monitor the nominations made to the Third Circuit with \nspecial interest because my own state of Delaware is part of that \nCircuit. And I can say without reservation that I am confident that \nJudge Fuentes will discharge his new responsibilities with distinction \nand will make a fine addition to that court. I commend the two Senators \nof New Jersey for their support of this nominee and am proud to join \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1225-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NOMINATIONS OF MARSHA L. BERZON AND RICHARD A. PAEZ--Continued\n\n\n                            cloture motions\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand there have been a couple of \nhours of spirited debate on the nominations of Judge Paez and Mrs. \nBerzon, which is certainly the right of the Senate. I am sure we will \nhave some further spirited discussion about these nominees.\n  However, I have given my word that these two nominees should at least \nhave the opportunity for a vote. We did work out an agreement last \nyear, and I made a commitment that these two nominees would have a \nSenate vote on their confirmation. With that in mind, in order to \naccomplish this--while I had hoped it would not be necessary, again, I \nemphasize, as I did last year and earlier this year, I think it is a \nmistake to begin to have cloture votes on judicial nominations on the \nfloor. We had one instance of that last year, and I said to my \nDemocratic friends I thought that was a mistake, and pretty shortly \nthereafter we worked that out and moved that nomination.\n  I don't like to have to file cloture on these nominations either, but \nin order to fulfill the commitments that have been made and have a good \ndebate but some limit on it where we would get a vote, I send a cloture \nmotion to the desk on the nomination of Marsha Berzon to the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Executive \n     Calendar No. 159, the nomination of Marsha L.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding \nrule XXII, these cloture votes occur in the order in which they were \nfiled at 5 p.m. on Wednesday, and that the mandatory quorum under rule \nXXII in each case be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is my understanding that if cloture is \ninvoked in each case, Senator Smith of New Hampshire will require 5 \nhours of total debate on both nominations under his control, and \nfollowing the conclusion of the time, the Senate would be in a position \nto vote in a back-to-back sequence on the confirmations of Berzon and \nPaez. I will not propound that request at this time but will put \nMembers on notice that this is the fashion in which I see the Senate \nconsidering these nominations.\n  I have discussed that with Senator Daschle, and he understands that. \nOf course, there will be a need to have equal debate on both sides, if \nthat is required by Senators.\n  I thank all my colleagues for their cooperation. I look forward to \nfurther debate on these nominees during tomorrow's session prior to the \n5 p.m. back-to-back cloture votes. In light of this agreement, we can \nannounce that there will be no further votes this evening.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know there is another unanimous consent \nto propound.\n  Let me briefly thank the majority leader for keeping his commitment. \nHe and I both hoped we wouldn't have to file cloture. We may yet have \nthe opportunity to vitiate cloture if something can be worked out. I am \nhopeful that we will have an opportunity to have the votes as he has \nanticipated tomorrow at 5 o'clock. This agreement accords everybody \ntheir rights. People will have an opportunity to further discuss this \nmatter. They will be able to respond to whatever statements may be made \non the floor. We will have a good debate about these nominees tomorrow, \neven though we will be taking up other legislation.\n  I think this is a very good agreement. I am grateful to him and to \nall of our colleagues for their cooperation. I appreciate the fact that \nwe have come this far.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad too yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \ncomments of the distinguished Senator from South Dakota. I was \nprivileged to be part of some of the discussions the distinguished \nRepublican leader and the Democratic leader had last fall, along with \nthe distinguished Senator from Mississippi. He has fulfilled the \ncommitment he made to us at that time. I suspect that some aspects \nprobably will not be debated with great ease. I wish to commend them \nfor doing that. As I have said all along, I want to be in the position \nwhere Senators can vote up or down on these two outstanding nominees.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank both Senators for their comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1225-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it will be my intention that following the \nhour of morning business, at 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday the Senate proceed \nto the Export Administration Act. I am not propounding that at this \ntime, but that would be the next legislation on which we have been \nworking. It has broad bipartisan support. It involves a very important \nsegment of our economy. We need to move forward with this legislation \nas soon as possible. We would like to start on that at 11:30 tomorrow. \nBetween that time and the stacked votes at 5 o'clock, we could have \nopening statements and begin to move forward\n\n[[Page S1226]]\n\non this very important Export Administration Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think this is a very good agreement. I \nthink we can have a good discussion about the conference report.\n  I know there are other Senators who may want to enter into a colloquy \nwith the majority leader or others with regard to some of the \nimplications of the FAA bill. This will accommodate any colloquies \nSenators may desire.\n  I also am pleased that we are able to move to the Export \nAdministration Act. As the majority leader noted, this bill is \nimportant. We ought to finish it this week. There is no reason why we \ncan't finish it this week, if we can get agreement. It passed out of \nthe committee unanimously. It is long overdue. It is important for us \nto act on it.\n  I think this would be a good week for us to be able to deal not only \nwith these nominations, not only with the FAA, but also with the Export \nAdministration. We have an opportunity to do some real good work, and \nthis agreement accommodates that.\n  I appreciate Senators' cooperation on both sides.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I indicated that I might object to the \nmotion to proceed to the Export Administration Act. It is not my \nintention to do that. In checking with my other colleagues who have \nbeen concerned with this matter, I have learned they are satisfied, as \nI am, that there have been negotiations in good faith with regard to \nsome of the provisions of the Export Administration Act that cause us \ngreat concern; therefore, I will be content to offer amendments \ntomorrow. But I would like to state for the Record that I do not intend \nimmediately to enter into any time agreement.\n  The chairman of the Banking Committee has indicated that he does not \nintend to ask for any time agreement going in. There will be \namendments. We need thorough discussion of this matter. This is not \nsomething we can hastily go into and dispense with. It is very \ncomplicated. It is very important. It has to do with our export policy \nwith regard to our dual-use items--very sensitive items which some \ncountries are now using to enhance their nuclear and other weapons of \nmass destruction capabilities. There is hardly anything more serious \nthan that.\n  My own view is that we have needed to reauthorize the Export \nAdministration Act for some time. But we need to tighten the rules, not \nloosen the rules. My concern is that this does, indeed, loosen some of \nthe important rules.\n  While I will not object to a motion to proceed, I want it understood \nthat we are going to need a full discussion of the issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have been able to work through an \nagreement on consenting to go to the Export Administration Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent, following an hour of morning business, that \nat 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday the Senate begin debate on the Export \nAdministration Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleagues for their \ncooperation on this.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators \nGrassley, Specter and Torricelli, and others, in cosponsoring the \nCounterintelligence Reform Act of 2000, S. 2089. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on making any improvements and refinements \nto the legislation which may become apparent as we hold hearings. This \nis an important issue with serious implications for the careful balance \nwe have struck between the need to protect our national security and \nour obligation to defend the constitutional rights of American \ncitizens.\n  This legislation was crafted in response to perceived problems in the \ninvestigation of nuclear physicist Wen Ho Lee. Our review of that \nmatter is far from complete and, in view of the pending criminal case, \nmust be put in abeyance to avoid any prejudice to the parties or \nsuggest political influence on the proceedings. Based on the \nSubcommittee's review to date, however, I do not share the views of \nsome of my colleagues who have harshly criticized the Justice \nDepartment's handling of this matter. Notwithstanding my disagreement, \nas explained below, with those criticisms of the Justice Department, I \nsupport this legislation as a constructive step towards improving the \ncoordination and effectiveness of our counterintelligence efforts. \nSenators Grassley, Specter and Torricelli have provided constructive \nleadership in crafting this bill and bringing together Members who may \ndisagree about the conclusions to be drawn from the underlying facts of \nthe Wen Ho Lee investigation.\n  My view of the Justice Department's handling of the Wen Ho Lee \ninvestigation differs in at least three significant respects from those \nof the Department's critics in the Senate.\n  First, the Justice Department's demand in the summer of 1997 for \nadditional investigative work by the FBI has been misconstrued as a \n``rejection'' of a FISA application for electronic surveillance. FBI \nofficials first consulted attorneys at DOJ on June 30, 1997, about \nreceiving authorization to conduct FISA surveillance against Lee. The \nrequest was assigned to a line attorney in the Office of Intelligence \nand Policy Review (OIPR), who, appreciating the seriousness of the \nmatter, drafted an application for the court over the holiday weekend. \nA supervisor\n\n[[Page S1227]]\n\nin the OIPR unit then reviewed the draft and decided that further work \nby the FBI would be needed ``to complete the application and send it \nforward.'' Further discussions then ensued and two additional draft \napplications were prepared.\n  In August 1997, FBI agents met again with OIPR attorneys about the \nFISA request. The OIPR supervisor testified at a Governmental Affairs \nCommittee hearing on June 9, 1999 that ``[f]ollowing that meeting, the \ncase was put back to the Bureau to further the investigation in order \nto flesh out and eliminate some of the inconsistencies, to flesh out \nsome of the things that had not been done.'' He testified that the \nprimary concern with the FBI investigation ``had to do with the fact \nthat the DOE and Bureau had [multiple] suspects, and only two were \ninvestigated. . . . That is the principal flaw which ha[d] \nrepercussions like dominoes throughout all of the other probable \ncause.''\n  This was not a ``rejection.'' The OIPR attorneys expected the FBI to \ndevelop their case against Lee further and to return with additional \ninformation. This is normal, as most prosecutors know. Working with \nagents on investigations is a dynamic process, that regularly involves \nprosecutors pushing agents to get additional information and facts to \nbolster the strength of a case. Yet, nearly a year and a half passed \nbefore the attorneys at OIPR were again contacted by the FBI about Lee.\n  The report issued by the Governmental Affairs Committee on this issue \nconcludes that although the OIPR attorneys did not view their request \nfor additional investigation as a ``denial'' of the FISA request, the \nFBI ``took it as such.'' Notwithstanding or even mentioning these \napparently differing views as to what had transpired, some have \ncriticized the Justice Department for rejecting the FISA application in \n1997. It is far from clear that any rejection took place, and I credit \nthe perspective of the OIPR attorneys that their request to the FBI for \nadditional investigative work was made in an effort to complete--not \nkill--the FISA application.\n  Second, the Justice Department correctly concluded that the FBI's \ninitial FISA application failed to establish probable cause. Indeed, \neven the chief of the FBI's National Security Division, John Lewis, who \nworked on the FISA application, has admitted that he turned in the \napplication earlier than anticipated and without as much supporting \ninformation as he would have liked.\n  Determining whether probable cause exists is always a matter of \njudgment and experience, with important individual rights, public \nsafety and law enforcement interests at stake if a mistake is made. \nFrom the outset, prosecutors making such a determination must keep a \nclose eye on the applicable legal standard.\n  Pursuant to the terms of the FISA statute, intelligence surveillance \nagainst a United States person may only be authorized upon a showing \nthat there is probable cause to believe: (1) that the targeted United \nStates person is an agent of a foreign power; and (2) that each of the \nfacilities or places to be surveilled is being used, or about to be \nused by that target. 50 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1801(b)(2), 1804(a)(4). With \nregard to the first prong, the statute defines several ways in which a \nUnited States person can be shown to be an agent of a foreign power. \nMost relevant here, a United States person is considered an agent of a \nforeign power if the person ``knowingly engages in clandestine \nintelligence gathering activities, for or on behalf of a foreign power, \nwhich activities involve or may involve a violation of the criminal \nstatutes of the United States.'' 50 U.S.C. Sec. 1801(b)(2)(A).\n  Without dissecting all of the allegations against Lee here, there are \nseveral issues that undermined the FBI's evidence that Lee was an \n``agent of a foreign power'' and, in 1997, engaged in ``clandestine \nintelligence gathering activities.'' In the letterhead memorandum by \nwhich the FBI first sought DOJ approval for the FISA warrant, the FBI \nreported that an administrative inquiry conducted by DOE and FBI \ninvestigators had identified Wen Ho Lee as a suspect in the loss of \ninformation relating to the W-88 nuclear warhead. Most critically, \nhowever, the FBI indicated that Lee was one of a group of laboratory \nemployees who: (1) had access to W-88 information; (2) had visited \nChina in the relevant time period; and (3) had contact with \nvisiting Chinese delegations.\n\n  The problem with the FBI's reliance on this administrative inquiry \nand corresponding narrow focus on Lee and his wife as suspects was that \nthe FBI ``did nothing to follow up on the others.'' The Attorney \nGeneral testified at the June 8, 1999 Judiciary Committee hearing that \n``the elimination of other logical suspects, having the same access and \nopportunity, did not occur.'' Similarly, the OIPR supervisor who \ntestified at the GAC hearing confirmed that ``the DOE and Bureau had \n[multiple] suspects, and only two [meaning Lee and his wife] were \ninvestigated.'' According to him, as noted above, ``[t]hat is the \nprincipal flaw which ha[d] repercussions like dominoes throughout all \nof the other probable cause.'' Quite simply, the failure of the FBI to \neliminate, or even investigate, the other potential suspects identified \nby the DOE administrative inquiry undermined their case for probable \ncause.\n  Indeed, this failure to investigate all potential leads identified in \nthe DOE administrative inquiry has prompted the FBI to conduct a \nthorough re-examination, which is currently underway, of the factual \nassumptions and investigative conclusions of that initial inquiry.\n  The other evidence that the FBI had gathered about Lee was stale, \ninconclusive or speculative, at best and certainly did not tie him to \nthe loss of the W-88 nuclear warhead information. For example, the FBI \nproffered evidence pertaining to a fifteen-year-old contact between Lee \nand Taiwanese officials. The FBI's earlier investigation boiled down to \nthis: after the FBI learned in 1983 that Lee had been in contact with a \nscientist at another nuclear laboratory who was under investigation for \nespionage, Lee was questioned. He explained, eventually, that he had \ncontacted this scientist because he had thought the scientist had been \nin trouble for doing similar unclassified consulting work that Lee \nvolunteered that he had been doing for Taiwan. To confirm his veracity, \nthe FBI gave Lee a polygraph examination in January 1984, and he \npassed. This polygraph included questions as to whether he had ever \ngiven classified information to any foreign government. Shortly \nthereafter, the FBI closed its investigation into Lee and this \nincident.\n  Even if viewed as suspicious, Lee's contacts fifteen years earlier \nwith Taiwanese officials did not give rise to probable cause to believe \nthat in 1997 he was currently engaged in intelligence gathering for \nChina.\n  As a further example, the FBI also relied on evidence that during a \ntrip by Lee to Hong Kong in 1992, there was an unexplained charge \nincurred by Lee that the FBI speculated could be consistent with Lee \nhaving taken a side trip to Beijing. As Attorney General Reno testified \nat the hearing, the fact that Lee incurred an unexplained travel charge \nin Hong Kong did not standing alone support an inference that he went \nto Beijing. It therefore did nothing to support the FBI's claim that \nLee was an agent for China.\n  The OIPR attorneys who pushed the FBI for additional investigative \nwork to bolster the FISA application for electronic surveillance of Wen \nHo Lee were right--the evidence of probable cause proffered by the FBI \nwas simply insufficient for the warrant.\n  Third, the Justice Department was right not to forward a flawed and \ninsufficient FISA application to the FISA court. Some have suggested \nthat the Lee FISA application should have been forwarded to the court \neven though the Attorney General (through her attorneys) did not \nbelieve there was probable cause. To have done so would have violated \nthe law.\n  The FISA statute specifically states that ``[e]ach application shall \nrequire the approval of the Attorney General based upon [her] finding \nthat it satisfies the criteria and requirements. . . .'' 50 U.S.C. \nSec. 1804 (a). The Attorney General is statutorily required to find \nthat the various requirements of the FISA statute have been met before \napproving an application and submitting it to the court.\n  As a former prosecutor, I know that this screening function is very \nimportant. Every day we rely on the sound judgement of experienced \nprosecutors.\n\n[[Page S1228]]\n\n They help protect against encroachments on our civil liberties and \nconstitutional rights. Any claim that the Attorney General should \nsubmit a FISA application to the court when in her view the statutory \nrequirements have not been satisfied undermines completely the FISA \nsafeguards deliberately included in the statute in the first place.\n  I appreciate that those who disagree with me that the evidence for \nthe Lee FISA application was insufficient to meet the FISA standard for \nsurveillance against a United States person may urge that this standard \nbe weakened. This would be wrong.\n  The handling of the Wen Ho Lee FISA application does not suggest a \nflaw in the definition of probable cause in the FISA statute. Instead, \nit is an example of how the probable cause standard is applied and \ndemonstrates that effective and complete investigative work is and \nshould be required before extremely invasive surveillance techniques \nwill be authorized against a United States person. The experienced \nJustice Department prosecutors who reviewed the Lee FISA application \nunderstood the law correctly and applied it effectively. They insisted \nthat the FBI do its job of investigating and uncovering evidence \nsufficient to meet the governing legal standard.\n  The Counterintelligence Reform Act of 2000 correctly avoids changing \nthis governing probable cause standard. Instead, the bill simply makes \nclear what is already the case--that a judge can consider evidence of \npast activities if they are relevant to a finding that the target \ncurrently ``engages'' in suspicious behavior. Indeed, the problem in \nthe Lee case was not any failure to consider evidence of past acts. \nRather, it was that the evidence of past acts presented regarding Lee's \nconnections to Taiwan did not persuasively bear on whether Lee, in \n1997, was engaging in clandestine intelligence gathering activities for \nanother country, China.\n  Finally, some reforms are needed. The review of the Lee matter so far \nsuggests that internal procedures within the FBI, and between the FBI \nand the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, to ensure that \nfollow-up investigation is done to develop probable cause do not always \nwork. I share the concern that it took the FBI an inordinately long \ntime to relay the Justice Department's request for further \ninvestigation and to then follow up.\n  The FBI and the OIPR section within DOJ have already taken important \nsteps to ensure better communication, coordination and follow-up \ninvestigation in counterintelligence investigations.\n  The FBI announced on November 11, 1999, that it has reorganized its \nintelligence-related divisions to facilitate the sharing of appropriate \ninformation and to coordinate international activities, the gathering \nof its own intelligence and its work with the counter-espionage \nagencies of other nations.\n  In addition, I understand that OIPR and the FBI are working to \nimplement a policy under which OIPR attorneys will work directly with \nFBI field offices to develop probable cause and will maintain \nrelationships with investigating agents. This should ensure better and \nmore direct communication between the attorneys drafting the FISA \nwarrants and the agents conducting the investigation and avoid \ninformation bottlenecks that apparently can occur when FBI Headquarters \nstands in the way of such direct information flow. I encourage the \ndevelopment of such a policy. It should prevent the type of delay in \ncommunication that occurred within the FBI from happening again. In \naddition, the Attorney General advised us at the June 8, 1999 hearing \nthat she has instituted new procedures within DOJ to ensure that she is \npersonally advised if a FISA application is denied or if there is \ndisagreement with the FBI.\n  Notwithstanding all of these wise changes, the FISA legislation will \nrequire formal coordination between the Attorney General and the \nDirector of the FBI, or other head of agency, in those rare cases where \ndisagreements like those in the Lee case arise. I am confident that the \nDirectors of the FBI and CIA and the Secretaries of Defense and State, \nand the Attorney General, are capable of communicating directly on \nmatters when they so choose, even without legislation. I am concerned \nthat certain of these new requirements will be unduly burdensome on our \nhigh-ranking officials due to the clauses that prevent the delegation \nof certain duties.\n  For instance, the bill requires that upon the written request of the \nDirector of the FBI or other head of agency, the Attorney General \n``shall personally review'' a FISA application. If, upon this review, \nthe Attorney General declines to approve the application, she must \npersonally provide written notice to the head of agency and ``set forth \nthe modifications, if any, of the application that are necessary in \norder for the Attorney General to approve the application.'' The head \nof agency then has the option of adopting the proposed modifications, \nbut should he choose to do so he must ``supervise the making of any \nmodification'' personally.\n  I appreciate that these provisions of this bill are simply designed \nto ensure that our highest ranking officials are involved when disputes \narise over the adequacy of a FISA application. However, we should \nconsider, as we hold hearings on the bill, whether imposing statutory \nrequirements personally on the Attorney General and others is the way \nto go.\n  I also support provisions in this bill that require information \nsharing and consultation between intelligence agencies, so that \ncounterintelligence investigations will be coordinated more effectively \nin the future. In an area of such national importance, it is critical \nthat our law enforcement and intelligence agencies work together as \nefficiently and cooperatively as possible. Certain provisions of this \nbill will facilitate this result.\n  In addition, Section 5 of the bill would require the adoption of \nregulations to govern when and under what circumstances information \nsecured pursuant to FISA authority ``shall be disclosed for law \nenforcement purposes.'' I welcome attention to this important matter, \nsince OIPR attorneys had concerns in April 1999 about the FBI efforts \nto use the FISA secret search and surveillance procedures as a proxy \nfor criminal search authority.\n  Whatever our views about who is responsible for the miscommunications \nand missteps that marred the Wen Ho Lee investigation, S. 2089, the \nCounterintelligence Reform Act of 2000, stands on its own merits and I \ncommend Senators Grassley, Specter, and Torricelli for their leadership \nand hard work in crafting this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1228-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

The conference agreement on S. 376 does eliminate the ``fresh \nlook'' provision that continued to be debated this year. ``Fresh look'' \nis a policy that, if implemented, would allow the federal government to \npermit COMSAT's corporate customers to abrogate their current contracts \nwith COMSAT. The conference agreement rejects ``fresh look'' and \npreserves the ability of the private parties involved to negotiate \ncontracts so that one party cannot simply walk away from its business \nobligations without any attendant liability.\n  This conference agreement does not allow the FCC to take any action \nthat would impair lawful, private contracts or agreements. Both \nchambers in the 106th Congress emphatically rejected ``fresh look'' \nwhen they passed their own versions of international satellite \nprivatization legislation, and the conference agreement reflects this \nconsensus.\n  I commend the conferees for including language in the conference \nagreement that protects private agreements, contracts, and the like. To \nread the relevant section otherwise would be to dismiss the clear \nintent of Congress to preserve existing and binding obligations of \nparties.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1229-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CHILD SAFETY LOCKS\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to applaud this morning's bipartisan \n``firearm summit'' at the White House. A commitment to find an \nagreeable compromise on the Juvenile Justice Bill could not be more \ntimely.\n  A week ago today, Mr. President, a six-year old living in a drug-\ninfested flophouse in Mount Morris Township, Michigan found a gun under \na quilt. The six-year old who found that gun wanted to settle a \nplayground quarrel he had the previous day with his classmate, Kayla \nRolland.\n  He was able to grab the gun from under the quilt because blankets are \nnot trigger locks; they are not a sufficient deterrent to curious \nchildren who find guns lying around unlocked. He took the gun and hid \nit in his pants and brought it to school the next day. No one and \nnothing prevented him from doing so.\n  When he arrived at Buell Elementary School, the boy announced to \nKayla that she was not his friend. He waited for an opportunity to get \nback at her. He later said he wanted to scare her.\n  As his classmates were filing out and heading toward the school \nlibrary, he had his chance. He did not call her names; he did not pull \nher hair; he did not hit her. Instead, he pulled the gun from his pants \nand waved it at two other classmates. He then accurately set his sights \non Kayla, pulled the trigger, and killed her. She was all of six years \nold. He shot her dead in their first grade classroom.\n  He had access to the gun because it was not safely stored, and he was \nable to fire it because the gun did not have a safety lock. Either \nwould have saved Kayla's life.\n  I have heard skeptics say that our child safety lock proposal, which \n78 Senators supported last year, would not have mattered in this case \nbecause this gun was stolen. That is only half-true. Had the legal \nowner of this gun safely locked it with one of the devices mandated \nunder our bill, then the thief might not have stolen it. Had the legal \nowner of this gun safely locked it with one of the devices mandated \nunder our bill, the child's uncle might not have been able to leave it \nloaded within the boy's reach. Had the legal owner of this gun safely \nlocked it with one of the devices mandated under our bill, the first \ngrader could not have picked it up and used it with deadly accuracy.\n  How do we respond to this tragedy? How do we respond to others like \nit? There is no simple answer. But without a doubt, enacting our modest \nlegislation to mandate that a child safety lock be sold with every \nhandgun would be a good first step.\n  The distinguished Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Henry \nHyde, said over the weekend about the stalled gun provisions of the \nJuvenile Justice bill, ``If you can't get dinner, at least get a \nsandwich.'' I agree.\n  Chairman Hyde, who has always been committed to reasonable firearms \ncontrol, would prefer dinner. And I would too: we ought to pass the \nwhole Juvenile Justice bill. We ought to do it soon. Time is of the \nessence because while the Congressional attention span is short, \nchildren die even when Congress isn't watching. We need to do more to \nprotect children from guns and we need to do it now.\n  It is a regrettable truth that progress in the Juvenile Justice \ndebate lurches forward only in reaction to unspeakable tragedy. A year \nago next month, the massacre at Columbine and the shooting in Conyers, \nGeorgia shocked this Senate into passing common sense proposals to get \ntough on thugs and violent juveniles. Some of those very same measures, \nincluding child safety locks, failed to pass the Senate by wide margins \njust the previous year.\n  But the overwhelming approval of the child safety lock proposal \ndemonstrates that the Senate ``gets it:'' kids and guns do not mix. The \nHouse needs to ``get it'' too. The Center for Disease Control estimates \nthat nearly 1.2 million ``latch-key'' children have access to loaded \nand unlocked firearms. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that \nchildren and teenagers cause over 10,000 unintentional shootings each \nyear in which at least 800 people die. In addition, over 1,900 children \nand teenagers attempt suicide with a firearm each year. Tragically, \nover three-fourths of them are successful.\n  If preventable suicides and accidents are not enough to convince you \nthat guns must be kept out of the hands of children, consider the \nfollowing: within the next five years, firearms will overtake motor \nvehicle accidents as the leading cause of death among American \nchildren. The rate of firearm death of children under 15 years old is \n16 times higher in the U.S. than in the 25 other industrialized nations \ncombined. And the firearm injury ``epidemic,'' due largely to handgun \ninjuries, is ten times larger than the polio epidemic of the first half \nof the 20th century.\n  The very same day that young Kayla Rolland was tragically killed in \nMichigan, a 12 year old middle school student in the Milwaukee area \ncarried a loaded gun to school. A disagreement the previous day led him \nto seek revenge by scaring his classmates. Thankfully, he never used \nthe gun and school officials safely confiscated it. This scenario is \nreplicated across the country every day.\n  Requiring child safety locks will drive the number of juvenile gun \ndeaths down--something everyone approves of.\n  Mr. President, we have the opportunity to reduce what will soon be \nthe number one cause of death among American children. How can we sit \nidly by when preventing it is so attainable?\n  We cannot.\n  So we ought to pass the Kohl-Chafee-Hatch Child Safety Lock Act. \nAlone or, better yet, as part of a package, it will help prevent the \ntragic accidents associated with unauthorized, unlocked, unattended \nfirearms. I am pleased that the President called today's summit to try \nto move on these urgent matters. I am distressed that it seems, at \nleast today, unproductive. And I pledge to work with the President and \nthe bipartisan Leadership to act now so that we do not have to mourn \nmore preventable innocent deaths.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1229-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1229-S1230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                RESTORATION OF LITHUANIA'S INDEPENDENCE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on March 18 of this year, at the \nLithuanian Cultural Center, in Southfield, Michigan, Lithuanian \nAmericans will gather to mark the tenth anniversary of the \nreestablishment of Lithuanian independence.\n  Michigan's Lithuanian-American community also will celebrate the \nperseverance and sacrifice of their people, which enabled them to \nachieve the freedom they now enjoy.\n  I have reviewed the bare facts before: On March 11, 1990, the newly \nelected Lithuanian Parliament, fulfilling its electoral mandate from \nthe people of Lithuania, declared the restoration of Lithuania's \nindependence and the establishment of a democratic state. This marked a \ngreat moment for Lithuania\n\n[[Page S1230]]\n\nand for lovers of freedom around the globe.\n  The people of Lithuania endured 51 years of oppressive foreign \noccupation. Operating under cover of the infamous Hitler-Stalin Pact of \n1939, Soviet troops marched into Lithuania, beginning an occupation \ncharacterized by communist dictatorship and cultural genocide.\n  Even in the face of this oppression, the Lithuanian people were not \ndefeated. The resisted their oppressors and kept their culture, their \nfaith and their dream of independence very much alive even during the \nhardest times.\n  The people of Lithuania were even able to mobilize and sustain a non-\nviolent movement for social and political change, a movement which came \nto be known as Sajudis. This people's movement helped guarantee a \npeaceful transition to independence through full participation in \ndemocratic elections on February 24, 1990.\n  Unfortunately, as is so often the case, peace and freedom had to be \npurchased again and again. In January of 1991, ten months after \nrestoration of independence, the people and government of Lithuania \nfaced a bloody assault by foreign troops intent on overthrowing their \ndemocratic institutions. Lithuanians withstood this assault, \nmaintaining their independence and their democracy. Their successful \nuse of non-violent resistance to an oppressive regime is an inspiration \nto all.\n  Lithuania's integration into the international community has been \nswift and sure. On September 17, 1991, the reborn nation became a \nmember of the United Nations and is a signatory to a number of its \norganizations and other international agreements. It also is a member \nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the North \nAtlantic Cooperation Council and the Council of Europe.\n  Lithuania is an associate member of the European Union, has applied \nfor NATO membership and is currently negotiating for membership in the \nWTO, OECD and other Western organizations.\n  The United States established diplomatic relations with Lithuania on \nJuly 28, 1992. But our nation never really broke with the government \nand people of Lithuania. The United States never recognized the \nforcible incorporation of Lithuania into the U.S.S.R., and views the \npresent Government of Lithuania as a legal continuation of the inter-\nwar republic. Indeed, for over fifty years the United States maintained \na bipartisan consensus that our nation would refuse to recognize the \nforcible incorporation of Lithuania into the former Soviet Union.\n  America's relations with Lithuania continue to be strong, friendly \nand mutually beneficial. Lithuania has enjoyed most-favored-nation \n(MFN) treatment with the United States since December, 1991. Through \n1996, the United States has committed over $100 million to Lithuania's \neconomic and political transformation and to address humanitarian \nneeds. In 1994, the United States and Lithuania signed an agreement of \nbilateral trade and intellectual property protection, and in 1997 a \nbilateral investment treaty.\n  In 1998 the United States and Lithuania signed the Baltic Charter \nPartnership. That charter recalls the history of American relations \nwith the area and underscores our ``real, profound, and enduring'' \ninterest in the security and independence of the three Baltic states. \nAs the Charter also notes, our interest in a Europe whole and free will \nnot be ensured until Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are secure.\n  I commend the people of Lithuania for their courage and perseverance \nin using peaceful means to regain their independence. I pledge to work \nwith my colleagues to continue working to secure the freedom and \nindependence of Lithuania and its Baltic neighbors, and I join with the \npeople of Lithuania as they celebrate their independence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1230-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL EYE DONOR MONTH\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I'm pleased to rise today to call \nto the attention of my colleagues and all of our constituents across \nthe nation that March is National Eye Donor Month. For more than 55 \nyears now thousands of Americans have participated in this selfless \nexercise of helping others.\n  The purpose of National Eye Donor Month is not only to honor the past \ndonors who have played a pivotal role in restoring the sight of over \nhalf a million individuals, but also to raise public awareness of the \ncontinuing need for donors. When people decide to become a donor all \nthey need to do is sign a card and announce their intent to their \nfamily.\n  The many recipients of this ``gift of sight'' represent the great \ndiversity of our nation's population. For instance, Judrita Billiot is \na young Houma Indian who lives in a small community about 50 miles from \nNew Orleans, Louisiana. This young girl was born with a condition known \nas congenital opacity, in which the corneas neither transmit nor allow \nthe passage of light. When she was still less than a year old Judrita \nreceived corneal transplants in both of her eyes. I'm happy to say that \ntoday she is a healthy young girl with normal vision thanks not only to \nthe transplant procedure, but also to the donors who were thoughtful \nenough to leave behind this extraordinary gift.\n  The success of Judrita's transplants is not uncommon. The current \nsuccess rate of corneal transplantation is nearly 90% thanks to a \nrigorous screening process and the dedication of our nation's eye \nbanks, working in conjunction with the Eye Bank Association of America.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to highlight National Eye Donor Month \nand I encourage all of my colleagues to work with their local eye banks \nto increase public awareness of corneal transplantation and the \ncontinuous need for donors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1230-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1230-S1231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING KUAKINI HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ON ITS 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the Kuakini \nMedical Health System as it celebrates its 100th anniversary caring for \nHawaii's people. Kuakini began as an ethnic charity hospital founded by \nJapanese immigrants who arrived in Hawaii to labor in the thriving \nsugar cane fields. Plantation wages were low and many newcomers found \nthemselves unable to afford medical care. The Japanese Benevolent \nSociety provided emergency relief to the immigrants, but a fire \ndestroyed their facilities in January, 1900. Undaunted, the Japanese \nBenevolent Society started plans to build a charity hospital. Funds \nwere raised through membership dues and community donations. Half an \nacre of land was purchased in Kapalama and a two-story wooden building \nhousing 38 patient beds was completed by July, 1900. This humble \nbeginning was the start of Kuakini Health System.\n  As the last existing hospital in the United States established by \nJapanese immigrants, Kuakini is unique among health institutions in the \nUnited States and Hawaii. There have been many changes during the past \ncentury, but the commitment of the health professionals and volunteers \nof Kuakini Health System to meet the health care needs of Hawaii's \ncommunity has not waivered. Kuakini Health System has expanded to \nembrace and serve Hawaii's community without regard to ethnicity, \ndisability, age, sex, religious affiliation, or financial status. \nKuakini Health System is in the company of only 5 percent of all U.S. \nhospitals having a heavy Medicare caseload. Sixty-five percent of the \nhospital's admissions are Medicare patients and Kuakini's hospital \ncares for the largest composition of elderly patients among Hawaii's \nhospitals.\n  Kuakini Health System is a teaching facility, training health \nprofessionals in the precepts of compassion and quality in health care. \nGuests from around the world tour Kuakini to learn American health care \nand specific methods for health care. Kuakini includes the community in \nits educational goals with health and wellness fairs, health and \nprevention education classes, an information hotline, Internet access \nto information, Speakers Bureau Program and Open House aimed at giving \nstudents a first hand look at the different departments and professions \nwithin a health care organization. By bringing health awareness to our \ncommunity, Kuakini contributes to the overall health and well-being of \nHawaii's people.\n  Kuakini Health System strives for excellence. Federal funds support \nnationally and internationally recognized medical research and health \nprograms\n\n[[Page S1231]]\n\nsponsored by Kuakini Medical System, such as the Japan-Hawaii Cancer \nStudy, Women's Health Initiatives, and Honolulu Heart Program. Kuakini \nis regarded as a leader in the areas of cancer treatment, cardiac \nservices, geriatric care, pulmonary disease treatment, gastroenterology \nservices, health research, orthopedic surgery, telemedicine and \ncyberhealth. Kuakini Health System performs its health services without \na major endowment or an affiliation with a larger organization for \nfinancial support.\n  The Kuakini Health System has met the health needs and challenges of \nHawaii's community for the past 100 years. As we start a new century \nand a new millennium, I am confident that Kuakini Health System will \ncontinue to make valuable contributions to the health of Hawaii and the \nUnited States through its commitment to benevolence, research, \neducation, and excellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1231-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATING KUAKINI MEDICAL CENTER AUXILIARY ON ITS 111TH \n                              ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I congratulate the Kuakini Medical \nCenter Auxiliary on its 111th anniversary of service to Hawaii's \ncommunity. From a modest beginning in 1889, the Kuakini Medical Center \nAuxiliary has grown to the largest active group of volunteers of a \nhealth care organization in Hawaii. The roots of the Kuakini Medical \nCenter Auxiliary are closely tied to the charitable beginnings of \nKuakini Medical Center. They form an indispensable century old team \ncaring for the health of Hawaii's people.\n  In today's busy world time is at a premium, yet these volunteers \nmanage to provide essential support services to the Kuakini Health \nSystem, such as transporting patients, distributing patient meals, \nerrands, sewing, tagging medical supplies, and collating medical \nresearch. Volunteers furnish comfort and companionship to patients and \nresidents in need. On holidays and special occasions, volunteers create \nfavors for patients' meal trays to brighten the day.\n  In addition to the compassionate services provided, the Kuakini \nMedical Center Auxiliary assists the Kuakini Health System financially. \nProceeds from the Gift Shop and numerous fundraising events are donated \nto Kuakini Foundation. Since 1980, the auxiliary has awarded more than \n$20,000 in scholarships to Kaukini employees to further their \neducation. More than a million dollars has been raised for Kuakini \nHealth System since 1971 by the Kuakini Auxiliary.\n  Currently, the Kuakini Medical Center Auxiliary has over 600 active \nmembers contributing at least 67,000 hours annually. The savings in \nlabor costs are estimated at more than $860,000 annually, but the \nselfless sacrifice and caring contribution that these volunteers \nprovide are priceless gifts to Hawaii's community. I compliment and \nthank the volunteers of the Kaukini Medical Center Auxiliary for the \n111 years of concerned meritorious public service they have rendered to \nHawaii's community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1231-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JEFF CLEVENGER\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to remember Jeff \nClevenger, a dear friend who died on December 21, 1999. The illness \nwhich led to his death came suddenly and Jeff was taken from us all too \nsoon.\n  Jeff Clevenger was a great American in that he gave everything of \nhimself to make his community and this country great. He contributed to \nour economy as Vice President and General Manager of the Wickes Machine \nTool Group, Inc., in Saginaw, Michigan. In 1983 he led a team of \nmanagers in the buyout of the machine tool group from Wickes. The new \ncompany was named SMS Group, Inc. From the formation of this new \ncompany until his death, Jeff served as President, Chairman, and Chief \nExecutive Officer of SMS Group, Inc.\n  Jeff contributed to his community unselfishly. And he was not \nsatisfied to simply be a member of a club or board. In nearly every \norganization he joined, at some point, Jeff served as chairman. These \norganizations include: the Saginaw Chamber of Commerce; the Michigan \nState Chamber of Commerce; the Michigan Manufacturers Association; \nSaginaw Remanufacturing; Junior Achievement; the Government Relations \nCommittee of the Association for Manufacturing Technology; United Way \nof Saginaw County; the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Association. \nIn 1994 he became the founding Chairman of the United Way Alexis de \nToqueville Society in Saginaw County. Jeff also served as a board \nmember for Saginaw Future, Inc., and the Delta College Foundation. He \nalso devoted his time to Saginaw Valley State University.\n  Jeff's dedication to his community did not go unnoticed. He has \nreceived a number of honors. He was given the ``Spirit of Saginaw'' \naward; the ``Entrepreneur of the Year'' award; the Junior Achievement \nHall of Fame Award; the Robert H. Albert Award for Community Service \nfrom the Saginaw Chamber of Commerce; to name a few.\n  The State of Michigan is a better place because we were lucky enough \nto have Jeff Clevenger as part of our community. Even those who did not \nknow Jeff will benefit for many years from his dedication to his \ncommunity. And to those who did know him, myself included, Jeff's life \nwill forever serve as an inspiration.\n  I would like at this time, on behalf of the United States Senate, to \nextend my sympathies to Jeff's family: Nell Clevenger, Lori Himes, \nRobin Vosen, Allana Clevenger, Angela Jennings, and Bradley Weaver. \nYour loss is shared by many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1231-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1231-4", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1231-S1232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-7884.

A bill to amend chapter 3 of title 28, United States Code, \nto divide the ninth judicial circuit of the United States into two \ncircuits, and for other purposes; read the first time.\n\n\n     the ninth circuit court of appeals reorganization act of 2000\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, soon we are going to be debating \njudicial nominations in this body. I want to take this opportunity to \naddress what I consider a grave problem affecting the administration of \njustice in our Nation.\n  I am referring to the unwieldy Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Some \nwill prefer the status quo, and I hope after my presentation this \nmorning they will share in the recognition that the Ninth Circuit \ndemands reform. The Ninth Circuit has grown so large and has drifted so \nfar from prudent legal reasoning, that sweeping change is in order.\n  Congress has already recognized that change is needed. In 1997, we \ncommissioned a report on structural alternatives for the Federal courts \nof appeals. The Commission, chaired by former Supreme Court Justice \nByron White, found numerous faults within the Ninth Circuit. In its \nconclusion, the Commission recommended major reforms and a drastic \nreorganization of the Circuit.\n  For this reason, I, along with my distinguished colleague from \nWashington, Senator Slade Gorton, introduced S. 253, the Federal Ninth \nCircuit Reorganization Act of 1999, which would in effectuate the \nrecommendations of the White commission.\n  The bill would reorganize the Ninth Circuit into three regional \ndivisions, designed as the northern, middle, and southern divisions, \nand a nonregional circuit division. Ideally, a more cohesive judicial \nbody would emerge--one that reflects the community it serves, and holds \na greater master of applicable, but unique, state law and state issues.\n  Some in this body were not too happy with the divisional realignment. \nPerhaps a more direct and simplified solution to the problems of the \nNinth Circuit is in order. For this reason, I, along with my colleague, \nSenator Hatch of Utah, introduced a new bill this morning, the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 2000. We are joined by \nSenator Craig, Senator Crapo, Senator Inhofe, and Senator Smith of \nOregon.\n  This bill will divide the Ninth Circuit into two independent \ncircuits. The new Ninth Circuit would contain Arizona, California, and \nNevada. A new Twelfth Circuit would be composed of Alaska, Hawaii, \nIdaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, Guam, and the Northern Mariana \nIslands. Immediately upon enactment, the concerns of the White \nCommission will be addressed, and a more cohesive, efficient, and \npredictable judiciary will emerge.\n  In this debate, let us not forget why change is in order. The Ninth \nCircuit extends from the Arctic Circle to the Mexican border. It spans \nthe tropics of Hawaii and across the International Dateline to Guam and \nthe Mariana Islands. Encompassing some 14 million square miles, the \nNinth Circuit, by any means of measure, is the largest of all our U.S. \ncourts of appeal. It is larger than the First, Second, Third, Fourth, \nFifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Circuits combined.\n  Let me refer to chart one because I think it makes the point that the \nNinth Circuit serves a population of more than 50 million, almost 60 \npercent more than are served by the next largest circuit court. By the \nyear 2010, the Census Bureau estimates the Ninth Circuit population \nwill be more than 63 million. Mind you, it is now 50 million--63 \nmillion. That is an increase of 26 percent in just 10 years.\n\n[[Page S1234]]\n\n  I wonder how many people this court has to serve before Congress will \nrealize the court is simply overwhelmed by its population. That is a \nfact.\n  I must confess our efforts in this case are not novel. Calls to split \nthe Ninth Circuit Court have been heard since 1891. More to the point, \nCongress has attempted to reorganize the Ninth Circuit since World War \nII!\n  Congressional Members are not alone in advocating a split. In 1973, \nthe Congressional Commission on the Revision of the Federal Court of \nAppellate System recommended that Congress split the Ninth Circuit. \nThat was 1973. Unfortunately, Congress never effectuated the \nrecommendations. Over the years, many legislative efforts have been \nmade to correct the Ninth Circuit problems. Still, no solution. Now, in \na new millennium, the problems of the Ninth Circuit still exist and \nhave even grown worse.\n\n  Mr. President, justice bears the price for Congress' inaction. The \ntime for action is long overdue.\n  Because of the circuit's massive size, there is a natural decrease in \nthe ability of the judges to keep abreast of legal developments within \nthe Ninth Circuit. I encourage my colleagues to contact some of those \njudges--they will be the first to admit they cannot follow the number \nof cases pending before the court. It simply is too great a load. \nInconsistent decisions and improper constitutional interpretations are \nnot unusual.\n  Let's look at the next chart. In the 1996-1997 session alone, an \nastounding 95 percent of the cases reviewed by the Supreme Court were \noverturned. This number should raise more than a few eyebrows. That is \nfrom 1996 and 1997. Again, 95 percent of cases reviewed by the Supreme \nCourt were overturned.\n  Looking at chart 2, over the past 3 years, 33 percent of all cases \nreversed by the U.S. Supreme Court arose from this troubled Ninth \nCircuit. That is three times the number of reversals for the next \nnearest circuit court, and 33 times higher than the reversal rate for \nthe Tenth Circuit.\n  There you have it. Compare the courts, caseloads, and the question of \npromptness in justice.\n  What are these reversal cases? These are people who had their cases \nwrongly decided. They are people who had to incur great expense, wait \nunnecessary lengths of time, and risk adverse legal rulings in order to \nreceive justice. No American should have to receive substandard legal \nattention based, solely on what State they live in.\n  But we cannot fault the judges of the Ninth Circuit alone. We, in \nCongress, have allowed this circuit to grow to staggering proportions. \nIn 1998, there were over 9,450 cases filed. It is this number that \nmakes adjudication of claims unacceptably slow. Consequently justice \nsuffers.\n  Mr. President, we should listen to the voices of the judges who \nattempt to serve this region. Ninth Circuit Judge Diramuid O'Scannlain \ndescribed the problem as follows:\n\n       An appellate court must function as a unified body, and it \n     must speak with a unified voice. It must maintain and shape a \n     coherent body of law. . . . As the number of opinions \n     increase, we judges risk losing the ability to keep track of \n     precedent and the ability to know what our circuit's law is.\n\n  ``The ability to know what our circuit's law is''--that is part of \nthe problem. These judges acknowledge they don't know, and they cannot \npossibly know, because the caseload is too great.\n  He said:\n\n       In short, bigger is not necessarily better.\n\n  He further stated:\n\n       We [the Ninth Circuit] cannot grow without limit. . . . As \n     the number of opinions increase, we judges risk losing the \n     ability to know what our circuit's law is.\n\n  That is the key. It has grown so fast, they don't know what the \ncircuit law is.\n\n       In short, bigger is not necessarily better. The Ninth \n     Circuit will ultimately need to be split. . . .\n\n  Judge O'Scannlain is not alone. The very Supreme Court Justices we \nentrust to guide our Nation's jurisprudence have acknowledged and \nrecommended reform for this troubled court.\n  Justice Kennedy continued that:\n\n       We have very dedicated judges on that circuit, very \n     scholarly judges . . . but I think institutionally, and from \n     the collegial standpoint, that it is too large to have the \n     discipline and control that is necessary for an effective \n     circuit.\n\n  Judge Stevens notes:\n\n       Arguments in favor of dividing the Circuit in either two or \n     three smaller circuits overwhelmingly outweigh the single \n     serious objection to such a change.\n\n  But now, with this new bill we can fix the problem. And in turn, we \ncan ensure that all Americans receive swift and fair adjudication of \ntheir claims. While I may believe even more sweeping changes are in \norder, I strongly urge this body address this crisis in our judiciary \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, it is the 50 million residents of the Ninth Circuit \nwho suffer from our inaction. These Americans wait years before their \ncases are heard. And after these unreasonable delays, justice may not \neven be served in an overstretched and out-of-touch judiciary.\n  Mr. President, Congress has known about the problem in the Ninth \nCircuit for a long time. Justice has been delayed too long. The time \nfor reform has come, and I urge action on this bill.\n  I yield to my friend who has been recognized.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak this morning to discuss \nlegislation that I have introduced with Senator Murkowski that would \ndivide the Ninth Circuit into two manageable circuits.\n  I have been told of a children's song that, with its circular and \nrepetitious melody, is called ``the song without an end.'' And that \nmight be an apt description of our efforts to reach some resolution \nwith the nagging problem of the Ninth Circuit's boundaries.\n  Indeed, I am told that calls to reexamine the boundaries of what is \npresently called the Ninth Circuit were first made more than a century \nago. In more recent history:\n  A congressional commission--the Hruska Commission--recommended a \nsplit of the Ninth Circuit--not just the Fifth Circuit-- in 1973;\n  In 1995 I held a hearing before the Judiciary Committee to examine a \nproposal to split the circuit;\n  In 1997, as part of the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill, \nthe Senate passed a split proposal which was ultimately replaced with a \nprovision creating a commission to report on structural alternatives \nfor the Federal Courts of Appeals--and the Ninth Circuit in particular; \nand\n  Last year, Senator Murkowski, and others, introduced legislation to \nimplement the recommendation of that commission, which would have \nmaintained the circuit's structural boundaries, but partitioned its \nCourt of Appeals into three semi-autonomous divisions.\n  Yet here we stand, like Sisyphus with the boulder at his feet, with \nnothing to show for years of effort.\n  All the while, the problems perceived in the Ninth Circuit itself \nhave not disintegrated with the passage of time.\n  Rather, as we look at that circuit's boundaries, what is immediately \napparent is its gargantuan size. That factor, in itself, by no means \njustifies a remedy in the form of a change in boundaries. But it does \nserve as a necessary starting point from which to explain many of the \ncriticisms that have been lodged against the circuit.\n  Stretching across nine States and two territories, and constituting \nsome 14 million square miles, the Ninth Circuit serves the largest U.S. \npopulation by far--more than 51 million people. The Ninth Circuit is \nauthorized by statute to maintain 28 active Court of Appeals judges. \nThe next largest circuit--the Fifth--has only 17 active judges, and \nmost other circuits have 12 or fewer judges.\n\n  Though the size of the circuit is not in itself a reason to modify \nits boundaries, the problems resulting from the circuit's size are.\n  Most notably, the massive size of the circuit's boundaries has \nconfronted the circuit's judges with a real difficulty in maintaining \nthe coherence of its circuit law. This is because there are enormous \nobstacles both, one, to keeping abreast of the circuit's decisions, \nand, two, to correcting those decisions that stray from the law of the \ncircuit.\n  With regard to the first concern, various conscientious judges on the \nNinth Circuit have stated they are unable to read the number of \npublished decisions being issued by their colleagues, given the sheer \nvolume of such opinions. They have stated that frequently,\n\n[[Page S1235]]\n\nthere is no time to do anything more than review the head notes of such \ndecisions.\n  This is a serious problem from which other problems ensue. Absent the \nability of each active judge on the Ninth Circuit to read each such \npublished decision, there can be no assurance that calls will be made \nfor en banc review of those cases which judges believe merit rehearing \nby a larger component of the court.\n  With regard to the second concern--the ability to correct decisions \nthat stray from the circuit law--the large size of the Ninth Circuit \npresents a tremendous impediment. At present, a special exception has \nbeen made by Congress to better enable the Ninth Circuit to review 3-\njudge decisions en banc, and that process--known as limited en banc--\ninvolves the empaneling of only 11 judges, rather than the circuit's \nfull complement of 28 judges.\n  In my view, this system is being utilized with insufficient \nfrequency. And the result is that the stated aim of Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 35--to secure or maintain uniformity of the court's \ndecisions--is being thwarted.\n  Moreover, the mechanism is imperfect, and simple math proves the \npoint. It is entirely conceivable that a limited en banc decision could \nbe handed down by an 11-to-0 vote, and yet not reflect the views of a \nmajority of the circuit's judges. Nor is it any answer to say that the \nNinth Circuit's rules allow for full en banc hearings with all 28 \njudges, since no such hearing has ever taken place.\n  The problems with the lack of internal decisional consistency within \nthe Ninth Circuit have become all too obvious. Three terms ago, the \nNinth Circuit's reversal rate before the U.S. Supreme Court exceeded 95 \npercent. It is no cause for celebration to note that during the last \ntwo terms, the Ninth Circuit reversal rate averaged 77 percent, and \nthis term I have noted that the Ninth Circuit is not faring \nparticularly well, with a record of 0 to 7 before the Supreme Court. \nWhat is really wrong is there are literally thousands of cases they \nhear that they are probably making the wrong decisions on that will \nnever go to the Supreme Court because the Court doesn't have time to \nlisten to thousands of cases from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nSo we are having all kinds of injustice out there just because of \njudges who are out of control, who are activist judges ignoring the law \nitself.\n\n  I believe these problems will be corrected when we streamline the \ncircuit, leaving two more manageable circuits in place to more \ncarefully and exactingly do the work currently undertaken by one. I \nbelieve the system of error correction and the assurance of coherence \nof circuit law will be a more manageable task in two circuits where the \njudges of each will have one-half as many of their colleagues' opinions \nto read for compliance with and correction of their circuit law.\n  To this end, Senator Murkowski and I have drafted a measure we \nbelieve reflects sound public policy. It would continue to denominate \nas part of the Ninth Circuit the States of California, Nevada, and \nArizona, as well as the island territories currently within the Ninth \nCircuit. The proposal would place Hawaii and the Northwest States \nwithin a new Twelfth Circuit. Such a proposal results in a logical \nsplit. Indeed, the contours of this very proposal were set out as an \nalternative option in the final report of the Commission on Structural \nAlternatives. And it maintains geographic coherence by avoiding the \ntype of gerrymandered circuit that would have resulted from the split \nproposal passed by the Senate in 1997, although I could very easily go \nfor that as well.\n  As a final word, I express for the record my appreciation for the \nvery substantial work performed by the members and staff of the \nCommission on Structural Alternatives. Its final work product is a most \ncapable report, and the Commission's work under Justice White will \ntruly become part of the history of relations in this country before \nthe Congress and the Judiciary.\n  With that thanks, I will close my remarks on this by urging my \ncolleagues to act on this sensible proposal to solve a problem that has \npersisted for far too long. There are some of our colleagues who are \nvery upset at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and its record of \nreversal by the Supreme Court. I just raised the issue that there may \nbe thousands of cases that need to be reversed, but the Supreme Court \ndoesn't have time to do that. I think they would be much more concerned \nabout voting for and passing this split of the Ninth Circuit than they \nwould attacking some of the judges who are up for nominations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2194. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to provide \nassistance in planning and developing a regional heritage center in \nCalais, Maine; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                     st. croix island heritage act\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the St. Croix \nIsland Heritage Act, legislation that will help develop a regional \nheritage center in Calais, ME, in time to commemorate an event of great \nhistorical and international significance: the 400th anniversary of one \nof the earliest settlements in North America, at St. Croix Island. I am \npleased to have my senior colleague from Maine, Ms. Snowe, as a \ncosponsor of my legislation.\n  Planning for the regional heritage center is well underway. The \nresidents of the St. Croix River Valley and organizations such as the \nSt. Croix Economic Alliance and the Sunrise County Economic Council \nhave worked hard to move the project forward. They commissioned a \nconsulting firm to evaluate the market potential of the heritage center \nand to prepare preliminary exhibit and operating plans. They secured \nplanning and seed money from the U.S. Forest Service, the city of \nCalais, local businesses, and others. And they have hired a full-time \nproject coordinator to oversee development of the heritage center. Now \nthey need assistance from the National Park Service, assistance that \nthis bill would provide.\n  The regional center will preserve and chronicle the region's \ncultural, natural, and historical heritage. The Interior Department's \nrole in the planning and development of the heritage center stems from \nthe close proximity of the proposed site to St. Croix Island, the only \ninternational historic site in the National Park System.\n  In 2004, the United States, Canada, and France will celebrate the \n400th anniversary of the first settlement at St. Croix Island. We have \nonly 4 more years to prepare for a celebration of this historic event.\n  I have spoken before on the Senate floor about the historical \nsignificance of the settlement of St. Croix Island. It is a remarkable \nand little-known story that bears retelling. The story dates to the \nsummer of 1604, when a French nobleman, accompanied by a courageous \ngroup of adventurers that included Samuel Champlain, landed on St. \nCroix Island and set about to construct a settlement. They cleared the \nisland, planted crops, dug a well, and built houses, fortifications, \nand public buildings. In the process, they were aided by Native peoples \nwho made temporary camps on the island. At the same time, Samuel \nChamplain undertook a number of reconnaissance missions from the \nisland. On one, he found and named Mount Desert Island, now the home to \nAcadia National Park.\n  By October of 1604, the settlement was ready. But the Maine winter \nwas more than the seventy-nine settlers had bargained for. By winter's \nend, nearly half had died, and many others were seriously ill.\n  The spring brought relief from the harsh weather. The colony was \nrelocated to Port Royal in what is now Nova Scotia and, in 1608, \nChamplain and his fellow explorers founded Quebec.\n  According to the National Park Service, the French settlement on St. \nCroix Island in 1604 and 1605 was the first and ``most ambitious \nattempt of its time to establish an enduring French presence in the \n`New World' '' and ``set a precedent for early French claims in New \nFrance.'' Many view the expedition that settled on St. Croix Island in \n1604 as the beginning of the Acadian culture in North America. This \nrich and diverse culture spread across the continent, from Canada to \nLouisiana, where French-speaking Acadians came to be known as \n``Cajuns.''\n  Mr. President, thousands of people attended the celebration that \nmarked the 300th anniversary of the settlement\n\n[[Page S1236]]\n\nof St. Croix Island. The consul general of France and the famous Civil \nWar hero General Joshua Chamberlain were among those who spoke at the \nevent.\n  In four years, another century will have passed since the last \ncommemoration, and we will celebrate St. Croix Island's 400th \nanniversary. There is much work to be done. In 1996, the U.S. National \nPark Service and Parks Canada agreed to ``conduct joint strategic \nplanning for the international commemoration [of the St. Croix Island], \nwith a special focus on the 400th anniversary of settlement in 2004.'' \nFor its part, Parks Canada constructed an exhibit in New Brunswick \noverlooking St. Croix Island. The exhibit uses Champlain's first-hand \naccounts, period images, updated research, and custom artwork to tell \nthe compelling story of the settlement.\n  The U.S. National Park Service, on the other hand, still has a ways \nto go. In October 1998, the Park Service did complete a general \nmanagement plan for the St. Croix Island International Historic Site.\n  From a variety of alternatives, the Park Service settled on a plan \nthat envisions an interpretive trail and ranger station at Red Beach, \nMaine and exhibits located in the regional heritage center up the road \nin Calais.\n  The bill I introduce today directs the National Park Service to \nfacilitate the development of the regional heritage center in time for \nthe 400th anniversary of the St. Croix Island settlement. It empowers \nthe Secretary of Interior to enter into cooperative agreements with \nState and local agencies and nonprofit organizations to assist in this \neffort and authorizes $2.5 million for this purpose.\n  Mr. President, this bill authorizes and commits the National Park \nService to follow a plan it has already endorsed to help commemorate a \n1604 settlement of enormous historical significance. I believe that the \n400th anniversary celebration and the heritage center in Calais will be \na source of pride to all Americans of French ancestry.\n  I am very pleased to see that the distinguished chairman of the \nEnergy Committee is on the floor. It is to his Committee that this \nlegislation, I believe will be referred. I hope that it will be \nfavorably reported and enacted this year.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I compliment Senator Collins for her \nintroduction of the St. Croix heritage bill. I look forward to \nreceiving that in my Energy Committee, and I will attempt to take it up \nat an early opportunity for a hearing and report it out. I want to \ncommend her and her colleague from Maine, as well.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 2196.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills that \ntemporarily suspend duties on certain imports of goods not produced in \nthe United States and five bills to reliquidate specific entries of \nvanadium and tomato sauce preparations.\n  The first bill will temporarily suspend the duty on imports of silica \nsubstrate. Silica substrates are produced only in Japan and imported \nfor use in the domestic production of semiconductors. Currently, \nsemiconductors enter the United States duty-free while imports of \nsilica substrate are subject to a 4.9 per cent duty. As a result of \nthis tariff inversion, there is a competitive imbalance which favors \nforeign production of semiconductors. My bill would extend the current \nsuspension on duties of silica substrates until 2004.\n  The second bill will temporarily suspend the duty on imports of an \nenvironmentally friendly chemical paint additive. The product safely \nreplaces mercury-based chemicals (which were banned a number of years \nago) used in ``anti-fouling'' boat paint, intended to prevent fouling \nof underwater structures. It is also the only EPA-registered algicide \nfor use in the architectural paint market. There is no known production \nof this chemical in the United States.\n  The third bill reliquidates thirty-seven entries of vanadium carbide \nand vanadium carbonitride. Vanadium is used primarily as a \nstrengthening agent in steel and can only be imported from South \nAfrica. The bill seeks to recover duties paid since July 1, 1998, the \noriginal date of a competitive need limit waiver by USTR, through \nDecember 23, 1999, when the waiver actually took effect.\n  The final four bills seek to reliquidate entries of canned tomatoes, \nused to prepare tomato sauce, by four separate companies. The imports \nwere incorrectly subjected to 100 percent ad valorem retaliatory duties \nbeginning in 1989 due to a Harmonized Tariff Schedule \nmisclassification; the retaliation stemmed from a GATT case against the \nEuropean Union. Treliquidation covers entries not originally included \nin a decision by the Court of International Trade, which ruled the \nproducts had been incorrectly classified and were, therefore, not \nsubject to the retaliatory duties.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 2203. A bill to amend title 26 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1986 \nto allow income averaging for fishermen without negative Alternative \nMinimum Tax treatment, for the creation of risk management accounts for \nfishermen and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              Fair Tax Treatment for Fisherman Act of 2000\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation that will ease the financial hardships that fisherman \nendure because of the uncertainties of their industry. I am very \npleased that Senator Stevens has joined me in co-sponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, in 1986 when Congress rewrote the tax law and cut the \nnumber of tax brackets from 11 to two, one of the provisions of prior \nlaw that was repealed was income averaging. The purpose of income \naveraging was to ameliorate the tax burden on individuals whose incomes \nvaried from year to year. It ensured that an individual whose income \nincreased significantly in one year and then dropped significantly in \nthe next year could average the tax brackets for the two years. With \nonly two brackets, many believed that income averaging was no longer \nneeded.\n  However, in the 14 years since the 1986 tax reform, we have added \nthree additional brackets to the tax code. And with five brackets there \nis a clear need for income averaging, especially for individuals who \nare in occupations where the predictability of income is uncertain. In \n1997, we adopted income averaging for farmers because we recognized \nthat weather conditions can significantly impact what a farming family \nearns in any particular year.\n  In this legislation we are introducing today, we are adding fishermen \nto the category eligible for income averaging. Just as farmers cannot \npredict the weather, fisherman are unable to predict how large or small \ntheir catch will be.\n  Let me give you an example of how the fishermen in Bristol Bay in my \nhome state of Alaska have fared in recent years. Between 1995 and 1998, \nthe fish run dropped from 244 million to barely 58 million last year. \nAt the same time their income has dropped from $188 million to $69 \nmillion.\n\n[[Page S1237]]\n\n  Quite frankly, income averaging is fair for farmers and is equally \njustified for fishermen.\n  In addition, our legislation establishes risk management savings \naccounts which fishermen will be able to draw down when fishing runs \nare low. Under this proposal, fishermen could set aside up to 20 \npercent of their income in special savings accounts. Interest earned in \nthe account would be taxable, but withdrawals would only be taxable in \nthe year of the withdrawal.\n  Mr. President, a recent fishery failure in Alaska resulted in the \nfederal government allocate $50 million to assist the fishermen and \ntheir local communities. With these special risk management accounts, \nfishermen will be less dependent on federal assistance and will be able \nto more easily survive fishing downturns.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that when we consider a tax bill later \nthis year, these modest proposals will be included in that bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2203\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) The changes made by this Act shall apply to taxable \n     years beginning after December 31, 2000.\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nfrom Alaska in introducing this important piece of legislation. As a \nmember of the Senate Finance Committee he is all too aware of the need \nfor equity in our tax system and simplicity in our Tax Code.\n  The first portion of the bill we introduce today would allow \nfishermen to average income and would not penalize that election with \nthe alternative minimum tax. Up until 1986, individuals, including \nfarmers and fishermen, could elect to average income under section \n1301. That choice was no longer available after Congress repealed \nsection 1301 in 1986. Later, in 1997, Congress inserted a new version \nof section 1301 with a modified form of income averaging for farmers. \nSection 1301 currently allows farmers engaged in an eligible farming \nbusiness to average income for tax purposes. This allows farmers to \ntake the fluctuations of their markets, prices and crop conditions into \naccount when calculating income taxes. Fishermen should be afforded the \nsame opportunities as farmers--they are the farmers of the sea and \nshould be treated as such under the Tax Code.\n  A provision similar to this was included in the Taxpayer Refund Act \nof 1999 that was vetoed by the President last year. It is not a \ncontroversial measure, and its impact on the Treasury is minimal. The \nJoint Committee on Tax estimated last summer that this provision would \ncost approximately $5 million over the next ten years. This is a small \nprice to pay to create equity and fairness in our Tax Code and to \nensure fishermen receive the same benefits as farmers. While this is \none step toward equal treatment for our fishermen, it is an important \npart of ensuring the long-term sustainability of our fishing industry.\n  The second portion of the bill we introduce today would allow \nfishermen to establish tax deferred risk management savings accounts to \nhelp them through downturns in the market. The Taxpayer Refund Act of \n1999 included similar language. These new risk management accounts \nwould be used to let fishermen set aside up to 20 percent of their \nincome on a tax deferred basis. The money could be held for up to five \nyears, then it would have to be withdrawn from the individual's \naccount. Once the money is withdrawn from the account, the fishermen \nwould pay tax on the amount that was originally deferred. Any interest \nearned on the money in the account would be taxed in the year that it \nwas earned.\n  This approach to encouraging fishermen to set some money aside for \ndownturns in the market makes sense. The Joint Committee on Taxation \nestimated last year that allowing fishermen to set aside 20 percent of \ntheir income into these tax deferred accounts would cost only $18 \nmillion over 10 years. This is a small price to pay to encourage \nfishermen to be pro-active in planning for downturns rather than having \nto be reactive when markets collapse or fishing stocks are weak.\n  In previous years we have had to bail out fishing areas that have \nbeen hit hard by fishery failures. A recent fishery failure in Alaska, \nand the impact of that failure on families and communities, is still \nbeing felt today. We were forced to allocate $50 million to bail out \nthose fishermen and the local communities. This provision, at a cost of \n$18 million over ten years, is a far-sighted way to let fishermen play \na part in a disaster recovery and preserve the proud self-reliance that \nmarks their industry.\n  I thank my colleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, for his support \nof this bill and I encourage all Senators to support these \nprovisions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND:\n  S. 2204.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce nine bills \nwhich will suspend the duties imposed on certain chemicals that are \nimportant components for a wide array of applications. Currently, these \nchemicals are imported for use in the United States because there are \nno known domestic producers or readily available substitutes. \nTherefore, suspending the duties on these chemicals would not adversely \naffect domestic industries.\n  This bill would temporarily suspend the duty on meta-\nchlorobenzaldehyde; propiophenone; 4-bromo-2-\n\n[[Page S1239]]\n\nfluoroacetanilide; 2, 6-dichlorotoluene; menthyl anthranilate; \ncyclooctene; cyclohexadeca-1, 9-diene; cyclohexadec-8-en-1-one; and \nhigh molecular weight polymerized powders, which are used as \nintermediate chemicals in the manufacturing of a number of products \nincluding, but not limited to, fragrances, agricultural inputs, \npharmaceuticals, water filters elements, surgical orthopedic hip and \nknee implants, and fibers used to make bullet-proof vests.\n  Mr. President, suspending the duty on these chemicals will benefit \nthe consumer by stabilizing the costs of manufacturing the end-use \nproducts. Further, these suspensions will allow domestic producers to \nmaintain or improve their ability to compete internationally. I hope \nthe Senate will consider these measures expeditiously.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of these bills be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2204\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 266\n\n       Whereas the freedom and security that citizens of the \n     United States enjoy today are direct results of the vigilance \n     of the United States Armed Forces;\n       Whereas recognizing contributions made by members of the \n     United States Armed Forces will increase national awareness \n     of the sacrifices that such members have made to preserve the \n     freedoms and liberties that enrich this Nation;\n       Whereas it is important to preserve and foster admiration \n     and respect for the service provided by members of the United \n     States Armed Forces;\n       Whereas it is vital for youth in the United States to \n     understand that the service provided by members of the United \n     States Armed Forces has secured and protected the freedoms \n     that United States citizens enjoy today;\n       Whereas it is important to recognize the unfailing support \n     that families of members of the United States Armed Forces \n     have provided to such members during their service and how \n     such support strengthens the vitality of our Nation;\n       Whereas recognizing the role that the United States Armed \n     Forces plays in maintaining the superiority of the United \n     States as a nation and in contributing to world peace will \n     increase awareness of all contributions made by such Forces;\n       Whereas it is appropriate to recognize the importance of \n     maintaining a strong, equipped, well-educated, well-trained \n     military for the United States to safeguard freedoms, \n     humanitarianism, and peacekeeping efforts around the world;\n       Whereas it is proper to foster and cultivate the honor and \n     pride that citizens of the United States feel towards members \n     of the United States Armed Forces for the protection and \n     service that such members provide;\n       Whereas recognizing the many sacrifices made by members of \n     the United States Armed Forces is important; and\n       Whereas it is proper to recognize and honor the dedication \n     and commitment of members of the United States Armed Forces, \n     and to show appreciation for all contributions made by such \n     members since the inception of the Armed Forces: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of May every year for the next 5 \n     years as ``National Military Appreciation Month''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States and interested \n     groups to observe such month with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit along with Senators \nHagel, DeWine, and Thompson a resolution to designate the month of May \nas National Military Appreciation Month. As my colleagues may recall, I \nhad sponsored a resolution earlier in the year, cosponsored by 61 \nsenators, designating May 1999 as National Military Appreciation Month. \nThat resolution, S. Res. 33, passed by a vote of 93-0 on March 30.\n  Subsequent to passage of S. Res. 33, I introduced S. 1419, which \nwould have made that designation permanent by amending Title 36 of the \nU.S. Code. To date, S. 1419 has 66 cosponsors. Because of the failure \nof S. 1419 to pass, I have agreed to submit a revised resolution \ndesignating May National Military Appreciation Month for the next five \nyears, and requesting the President issue a proclamation calling for \nthe American people and interested groups to observe such months with \nappropriate ceremonies and activities. It is my hope that this new \nresolution will receive the Senate's favorable consideration.\n  The introduction of an All-Volunteer Army was an outgrowth of the \ndisenchantment many Americans felt in the wake of the Vietnam War. The \nend of conscription and the transition to the All-Volunteer concept has \nbeen criticized by some for not adequately reflecting socioeconomic \ndivisions without our country. In point of fact, however, with the \nrequisite attention and care, it produced the finest armed forces in \nhistory. How far we had come since the tumultuous times of the 1970s \nwhen military readiness descended to abysmal levels was evident for all \nthe world to see in the overwhelming victory over Iraqi forces during \nOperation Desert Storm. But that success has been taken for granted too \nlong. Over 15 years of declining military budgets, combined with record \nhigh levels of deployments, have stretched the military to precarious \nlevels.\n  The end of conscription had another, more far-reaching and subtle \nimplication: it diminished the percentage of the public, including its \nelected officials, with military experience. This is not a criticism of \nthose who did not serve; on the contrary, as a strong supporter of the \nAll-Volunteer Army, I remain committed to its survival and success. \nThis gradual diminishment in the shared experience of having served in \nuniform, however, makes it increasingly important that the public \nreflect every year on the enormous role their armed forces have on \npreserving freedom.\n  As thousands of American soldiers serve increasingly hazardous duty \nin Kosovo, while others continue to serve in Bosnia as well as on the \ndemilitarized zone in Korea and around the world, it is imperative that \nour men and women in uniform know of the strong continuing support of \ntheir country for their dedication and service to this country. Whether \nwe individually agree with each and every deployment or not, we have \nlearned to separate our support for the armed forces from our \ndifferences over the policies that sent them into harm's way. \nDedicating one month every year to express our appreciation for the \narmed forces, the same month in which we recognize Victory in Europe \nDay, Military Spouse Day, Armed Forces Day, and, most importantly, \nMemorial Day, is an appropriate measure that I hope will have the \nsupport of all my colleagues in Congress.\n\n  Mr. President, I generally take a somewhat dim view of celebratory \nresolutions. But those who fought on the battlefields of Lexington, \nGettysburg, Normandy, in the Ardennes and on Okinawa, in Hue and at Khe \nSanh, in the deserts of the Persian Gulf and the dusty streets of \nMogadishu, in the skies over Kosovo and who stand a lonely vigil on the \nDMZ, must not be forgotten. Too much blood has been spilled in defense \nof liberty. We owe to those who perished and those who survived, to \ndevote one month out of the\n\n[[Page S1243]]\n\nyear to reflect on the sacrifices of those who have worn their nation's \nuniform throughout its history.\n  Mr. President, I request that the attached correspondence in support \nof S. 1419 from the Military Coalition be made a part of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       The Military Coalition,\n\n                                Alexandria, VA, February 28, 2000.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Senate Armed Services Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The Military Coalition, a consortium \n     of nationally-prominent uniformed services and veterans \n     organizations, representing more than 5.5 million members of \n     the uniformed services plus their families and survivors urge \n     you to encourage your colleagues on the Judiciary Committee \n     to render a favorable report on S. 1419, to designate May as \n     National Military Appreciation Month. S. 1419 is a follow-on \n     to S. Res. 33, which the Senate approved last year by a vote \n     of 93-0. That resolution designated May 1999 as National \n     Military Appreciation Month; S. 1419 will make that \n     designation permanent.\n       Over the three decades since the advent of the All \n     Volunteer Force, a seemingly impossible challenge has been \n     met with spectacular results. Instead of a uniformed service \n     comprised of conscripts, we are blessed with high quality \n     volunteers from all walks of life. Active, Guard and Reserve \n     forces have responded commendably to the increased operations \n     and personnel tempos and in return, deserve this special \n     recognition of a grateful nation.\n       Another compelling reason for approving this legislation is \n     that the gradual decrease in the shared experience of having \n     served in uniform, makes it increasingly important that the \n     public reflect every year on the enormous role that their \n     armed forces have on preserving freedom. As we commit \n     thousands of servicemembers to missions around the world it \n     is imperative that they know of the strong and enduring \n     support of their country for their dedication and service. We \n     owe it to those who paid the ultimate price and those who \n     survived, to devote one month out of the year to reflect on \n     the sacrifices of those who have worn their nation's uniform \n     throughout its history.\n       Please demonstrate your commitment to them by acting \n     promptly to bring S. 1419 to the Senate floor for action.\n           Sincerely,\n     The Military Coalition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/07/senate-section/article/S1243-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n    subcommittee on forestry, conservation, and rural revitalization\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.
